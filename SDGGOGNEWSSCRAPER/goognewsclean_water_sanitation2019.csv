“If just one percent of viewers watching the Super Bowl this year purchased a Chalice, we could help provide access to clean water for up to one million people in need,” said Damon at a New York City press conference.

Now with a purchase of a 12-pack, consumers will provide someone in the developing world with one year of clean water. Similarly, one pint or bottle will provide one month of clean water. Stella Artois is even selling limited edition chalices that will provide one person with five years of clean water.

“The idea is that the woman you are buying a drink for is on the other side of the world and you’ll never meet her, and the drink that you’re buying is clean water,” said Damon about the “Buy a Lady a Drink Campaign” partnership with Stella Artois.

While Water.org and Stella Artois have been partnered for four years, Damon has been invested in the global water crisis since his trip to rural Zambia in 2006. There he realized that the lack of clean water and sanitation not only lead to death and misery, but also robed people of their precious time and thus true potential.

“I went on a water collection with a teenage girl,” said Damon of the visceral moment, “and as I left I realized had someone not had the foresight to sink this borewell a mile from where she lived, she would be spending her entire day scavenging for water, she wouldn’t be in school, she wouldn’t have any prospects for a future.”

Damon said the girl’s aspirations reminded him of the dreams he and pal Ben Affleck had of moving to New York and becoming actors when they were teenagers.

Damon and Affleck, both now world-famous actors, even spent last year’s Super Bowl together. The Patriots’ fans stayed in the corner “not talking to anybody” and then “jumping for joy” when the team made a miraculous comeback in the second half.","Matt Damon partners with Stella Artois for a Super Bowl campaign to bring clean water to millions of people in developing countriesMatt Damon Wants You to Drink Beer and Give Millions Clean Water this Super Bowl WeekendThis year, Super Bowl fans can drink to more than just their favorite team.

Chemical, physical, and biological parameters affect the suitability of irrigation water.

Chemical

Start with a standard complete nutrient analysis. Use water alkalinity and specific salts to match to fertilizers.

When it comes to cleanliness of the irrigation system, water chemistry is a major culprit for clogging irrigation systems. Iron, manganese, and calcium precipitate and clog irrigation lines. This usually happens when these elements are at high concentrations and when the water pH is above 7.0. If you notice rust or white scale on your pipes, you might want to check these numbers.

Water pH affects the efficacy of agrochemicals (pesticides and plant growth regulators) and chlorine-based sanitizers. For example, at pH 6.0 or lower, chlorine is present mostly as hypochlorous acid, which is a strong sanitizer. At higher pH, chlorine is present mainly as hypochlorite ion, a weak sanitizer. The efficacy of chlorine, like some agrochemicals, is pH dependent.

Growers should test their water sources at least twice a year. The chemistry of the water may not change much from year to year, yet the goal is to be proactive and prevent problems. In the Northeast, we have seen sodium and chloride levels rise during summer months. We suspect the concentration of salts increases because the water levels decrease during the summer, resulting in higher salt per volume of water.

Physical

Total suspended solids (TSS) refers to the number of particles that are captured by a filter. TSS comes from a buildup of organic matter (e.g., peat moss, dead algae, or plant material, etc.) or sand particles. High concentration of TSS can clog irrigation lines and reduce the efficacy of sanitation. When cleaning surfaces or water, first remove the debris, and then sanitize.

Pond and recirculated water tends to have high TSS levels, whereas well, municipal, and rainwater tend to be clean in this aspect.

Filtration is the solution to remove suspended solids from the water. The ideal system should have multiple stages of filtration, going from coarse to fine pore filters. Right now, when most greenhouses are empty, it is a great opportunity to clean the filters, flush the irrigation lines, and clean storage tanks.

Biological

Water can be a source or dispersal mechanism for plant pathogens, algae, and biofilm. Growers don’t need to test for specific organisms unless there is an actual problem. The Guelph Lab Services is a laboratory that can screen for specific plant pathogens in water sources. To prevent plant disease, the main recommendation is to follow integrated crop management guidelines. A sanitizer at a low dose can also be applied on a continuous basis as a preventive strategy.

Often the very things that we take for granted are those that billions of people across the world are fighting for, and it is a matter of disappointment that India has the highest number of people in the world without access to safe drinking water.

In rural areas alone, 63.4 million of our fellow citizens live without access to clean water—more than any other country in the world—according to Wild Water, State of the World’s Water 2017, a new report by WaterAid, a global advocacy group working to improve access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene.

Given this dire situation, no effort is too small when it comes to providing access to water.

One of such initiatives is the work of a group of students in Hegganahalli in Devanahalli taluk of North Bengaluru.

Sukruth Krishna Kumar (Class 12) and Suprith Krishna Kumar (Class 9) from The International School Bangalore (TISB) and Tarun Kumar Reddy (Class 12) from Canadian International School came together to ensure that about 150 families (approximately 500 individuals) in Hegganahalli have access to clean drinking water.

During their persistent endeavour for over one year, they raised Rs 8 lakh and installed a filtration unit in the village.

The new RO system was inaugurated in Hegganahalli on December 28, and the plant has been handed over to the local zilla panchayat, which will take care of its maintenance. “A 5-rupee coin gets you a can of clean drinking water,” said Sukruth to the Bangalore Mirror. The money collected goes to the zilla panchayat for the unit’s upkeep.

“When we went to the village with my family, we saw that the water was not clean. The residents told us that they had health issues regularly and their children were missing school often because of it,” said Sukruth, as reported in Bangalore Mirror.

These three students hope that this act of theirs proves to be an inspiration to other students. They initially started by approaching other well-known foundations and wrote to them about the project.

After few hits and many misses, they thought that the best course of action was to set up a charitable trust by themselves. Given that they are minors, they utilised their parents’ help to create the trust, but they emphasise that other than that, all other work—from accounts to the project work—is done by themselves, taking time off after their school and academic commitments.

The students started fundraising through their trust and approached various philanthropists in the city. They even reached out to friends and acquaintances, and last bit of the money was raised through online crowdfunding.

Due to the consistent efforts put in by the trio, the residents of Hegganahalli can have a healthier 2018. The boys also hope that their efforts will inspire others like them to take up such initiatives.

The major toilet and housing equipment manufacturer has put in place 1.2 million units of the “safe toilet,” known as SATO, in developing countries through donations by citizens’ groups and foundations as well as Lixil’s direct sales.

The program has helped an estimated 6 million people, according to the company.

The toilet, developed in 2012 by Lixil’s American Standard brand, was launched in Bangladesh in 2013 and has since become commercially available in Uganda, Kenya and India.

SATO is designed to flush waste with only 200 milliliters of water. It features a counterweighted trap door to minimize odors as well as the passage of flies and other disease-carrying insects, said Tadashi Matsuoka of the Tokyo-based company.

The toilet is structured so simply that it can be produced in the targeted developing countries, the company said.

Lixil is hoping to reach an additional 15 million people with plans to manufacture and distribute toilets in Nigeria, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Rwanda, South Africa, Vietnam, Indonesia, Haiti, Ghana, Malawi and the Philippines with $1 million in funding under a program launched in September by the U.N. General Assembly.

The Water Innovation Engine, established by the U.N. High Level Panel on Water, is responsible for the Urban Sanitation Challenge program, which funds projects tackling poor sanitation in developing countries.

“Priced from $2 to $10, depending on model and country, (Lixil toilets) offer an effective, affordable way to mitigate the dangers and unpleasantness of typical pit latrines,” according to Grand Challenges Canada, which leads the program.

Grand Challenges Canada is funded by the Canadian government and other partners. It provides funds to innovators to help improve lives in low- and middle-income countries.

The blue plastic toilet “looks simple but is designed by utilizing knowledge of hydrodynamics,” said Akane Odake, a senior manager at Lixil.

According to the company, approximately 2.3 billion people around the world lack access to safe and sanitary toilets, of whom 892 million are forced to practice open defecation.

What’s more, every day 800 children under the age of 5 die from diarrhea-related diseases due to unclean water or poor sanitary conditions, it said.

Lixil hopes to make the venture a standalone business by 2020 and improve hygienic conditions for 100 million people.

“We set up the social toilet department in 2016 to help resolve the grave problem of sanitation in developing countries,” Matsuoka said.

Lixil carried out a campaign from April to September to donate a SATO unit to developing countries every time it sold one of its integrated shower toilets.

The response to the program has been better than imagined, said Lixil spokeswoman Yuka Okamoto.

“As more than 200,000 units have been donated, we believe (the program) has raised the public awareness about sanitary problems in developing countries,” she said.

A 13-year old in Picture Butte is getting clean water to children in Haiti with his wish.

Trenton Dyck was diagnosed with stage four alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) in October 2017. When the Children’s Wish Foundation of Canada approached him to offer him a chance to fulfill a wish, he chose to use it to help others.

Trenton used his wish to donate $6,000 to help bring clean water and sanitation to children living in extreme poverty in Haiti.

“Water is such a huge part of everybody’s life,” said Trenton.

“There’s so many people who don’t have any clean water, and the water they do have makes them sick. We take that so granted a lot because we just get it straight from our taps. Something like this would help hundreds and hundreds of people, and disease would go down, and

“He’s always wanting to help people,” said John Dyck, Trenton’s father.

“That was his choice, instead of having something that would just strictly benefitted basically him and his class, a few days of life here, he wanted something that would keep on going and be helpful to kids that are living in (poverty).

“It’s a thing that will help people that are living.”

Trenton is described as an inquisitive child who asks lots of questions, and has a love of science. He could often be found helping out with the children’s ministries at his church and in the community.

Trenton has a very advance form of ARMS, and was given a couple of weeks to live earlier this month.

According to the Canadian Cancer Society, ARMS typically develops in the muscles of the arms, legs, chest and abdomen.

ARMS is a type of rhabdomyosarcoma, which is a cancerous tumor that starts in muscle cells or tissues that are precursors to those cells, and can spread to other parts of the body.

Rhabdomyosarcoma starts in muscle cells or in tissues that are precursors to muscle cells. It is a cancerous, or malignant, tumour that can invade, grow into and destroy nearby tissue. It can also spread, or metastasize, to other parts of the body. It is the most common type of soft tissue sarcoma that occurs in children.

Between 2009-13, 295 children ages 0-14 years old were diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma, and 43 died, with as many as 31 dying from rhabdomyosarcoma.

With his wish, Trenton hopes to be able to help others in need.

Because of the 2010 earthquake and Hurricane Matthew in 2016, southern Haiti’s infrastructure was devastated, leading to problems like contaminated water and the prevalence of water-born diseases such as cholera.

According to the World Bank, a cholera outbreak after the earthquake claimed 8,700 lives. Water-borne diseases remain persistent in the area, although access to clean water lessens the risk of contracting them.

Providing clean water to those effected would dramatically lower the cases of waterborne-diseases in highly effected areas.

“There is a study that showed, out of the population, the disease rate went down from 85 per cent to five per cent,” said Trenton, on the effects of having access to clean water.

Trenton hopes that others would help contribute to his wish, for which donations are being gathered on compassion.ca.

Donations made there will go towards safe water supply systems, including wells, rain catchment systems and reverse osmosis facilities; sanitary latrines and hand-washing stations; waste management; and community education and training.

6,https://www.cannabisbusinesstimes.com/article/the-clean-grow/,"Tue, 09 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Cannabis Business Times,The Clean Grow,"True story: Along with a standard thank-you note, I once mailed a bottle of Windex to a Cornell University administrator who had interviewed me for a management position. The bottle was bedecked in a gold bow. I asked her to give it to an hourly employee whose name I remembered because his greenhouse section was the cleanest of the 15 I walked through. That fellow emailed me grateful thanks for noticing his work. The administrator offered me the job.

My commitment to sanitation goes far beyond being meticulous. The neat freak trait is a good one, as is even paranoia, perhaps, because so much of what we battle with grow room sanitation lurks invisible to the naked eye.

Like much of my management experience, this cleaning habit was learned the hard way. At the growth facility I managed in West Lafayette, Ind., we spent one disastrous summer discarding valuable research plants—some irreplaceable thanks to their genetic modifications—due to an incurable viral disease. The disease, Impatiens Necrotic Spot Virus, can only be spread by feeding the common greenhouse pest, western flower thrips. Each faculty member had their own grow room, and they continuously cropped for years, meaning these particular greenhouse rooms were never emptied and cleaned. New seedlings were placed next to maturing plants. This resulted in persistent thrips, excessive chemical spraying, inevitable pesticide resistance and more thrips. The pest cycle was never broken. Once the virus entered, it ran rampant through the susceptible crops.

We learned that summer that it was best to have communal rooms where researchers shared space, but that space was divided into growth phases so each room could be sanitized following seed harvest—about every four months. This hard lesson, coupled with other painful ones involving tobacco mosaic virus and powdery mildew diseases, made us sanitation experts. We experimented with methods, tools, environments and chemistry. We were given advice from that special brotherhood and sisterhood who manage plant-growth facilities at universities across North America. What we learned can be helpful in developing or streamlining your sanitation protocols.

Start with a Scorched Earth Policy

For being a horticulturist, you’d be surprised how beautiful I find an empty grow room to be. Our pest scouting indicated that a few days of being empty resulted in two months of pest control in a greenhouse, longer for a grow room that was better-sealed from the outdoors.

First rule: Empty means empty. The equipment can stay, but all vestiges of life need to be removed. Every plant, every leaf, every scrap of root substrate. And one step further, what sustains life: water. You need to dry out the place so that any insect and disease life that rely on water will perish. Even pressure wash that nasty crud in the drain.

To accomplish this, invest in good shop-vacs and pressure washers. We learned that it paid to have two shop-vacs, clearly labeled for their use-one “dry” and one “wet.” In most models, the dry vacuuming requires a dust filter over the intake inside the machine. If this filter is left in for wet operation, it becomes caked with mud, which lowers airflow. You’ll have a mess when the clock is ticking to get the room back in production.

Depending on your facility’s size and type, you may need two pressure washers. A small electric one is lightweight and effective for most cleaning, but, its lifespan is greatly diminished if used for more than 30 minutes at a time. A gas-powered pressure washer can run for extended periods and is typically more powerful. For safety reasons, though, you can’t run a combustion engine inside a closed space. We were able to use one with a 50-foot hose extension by parking it outdoors. Pressure washers with oscillating nozzle heads, such as those made by Karcher, were most effective, especially at cleaning algae stains.

Take care not to permanently scar the cement with a pinpoint stream, and users should always wear safety glasses—not splash goggles that fog up—or a face shield, and hearing protection. Provide your workers with two pairs of shields or glasses so they can rotate in case of lens fogging. Otherwise, they’ll just take them off when you’re not around.

All this work is for naught if you leave any plants or pots of used root substrate. Even if it’s legitimate breeding stock, you can’t keep it in your production area, as it will be a pest reservoir. You’ll need to find a separate space to house those long-term plants, like how a university designates a “collection” house for such stock material.

If you are in a greenhouse, this is also the time to kill those weeds hiding in cracks. There are some herbicides labeled for greenhouses (please read and follow all label instructions if you use an herbicide), but if you are pesticide-free, you’ll need to pull them or use some other remedy. More often than not, you’ll find insects on these weeds.

The next step is to remove debris. Using a hose attachment or pressure washer, start with the walls and growing tables and work your way downward. Scoop up that debris or direct it to the drain if you have a soil trap you can remove it from later.

Keep in mind that you are not just removing debris, but dislodging disease spores from surfaces and two-spotted spider mites that have gone into a hibernation phase, or diapause. These mites crawl off into dark cracks and crevices only to re-emerge later. During this phase, they do not feed, and predator mites have difficulty finding them. If your team understands what they are going after during this cleaning, they will do a better job. Make it a point to be pleased with a spotless room, rather than let this opportunity to reward good work pass unnoticed.

The Bake-Out

During the bake-out phase, the goal is to heat the room to kill spores of powdery and downy mildews, and to remove all moisture sources that could sustain remaining insects. Our heat prescription was six hours at a minimum of 95 degrees Fahrenheit for mildew control. If you are able, you can increase temperatures up to 105 degrees, but any higher will have a detrimental effect on some electronics, seals within components and curtain fabric. Following that heating, lower the temperature to between 80 and 85 degrees and hold it for as long as you can afford to keep the room empty.

I strongly recommend maintaining that temperature for at least 24 hours, including the bake-out. Three to five days would be ideal to chase out or kill most active insects without a water or food source.

Personally, I don’t see the point of trying to clean and replant a grow room in the same day, as the benefit in crop cycle time would be lost in crop quality and labor hours dealing with a pest problem later. During this drying down, lock the room to keep people out and remove drain covers to hasten drying.

Finding the Right Formula

Chemical disinfection can be performed before the heat treatments, or just prior to new plants being moved into the grow room. I prefer the latter for two reasons. First, to eliminate any accidental contamination that may have happened during the dry-down. Second, because the smell of a disinfected room reminds everyone who enters of the work put into achieving this level of cleanliness.

Many commercial products are available for disinfection of greenhouse and grow-room surfaces. Reading the fine print on the product label is necessary to determine which product is both legal and most appropriate.

Chlorine products, such as bleach, are legal for food production areas like commercial kitchens, but are not EPA registered for greenhouse production. For this reason, I would advise against using bleach in your plant-growing areas. Besides, there are much better products that are safer for eyes and clothing.

For ornamental production, I have effectively used Virkon S, a poultry and swine production disinfectant; the quaternary ammoniums Green-Shield II and Physan 20, and the peroxide formulations ZeroTol 2.0 and OxiDate 2.0. However, only one product, another hydrogen peroxide product called SaniDate 5.0, is labeled for greenhouses, farms, food production, preparation and storage areas, as well as hospitals and pharmaceutical-processing facilities, and is certified for organic production.

A stronger version of the agent, SaniDate 12.0, is labeled for disinfecting and clearing biofilm from irrigation lines. But it is not labeled for all the uses of SaniDate 5.0, which can also be used for this purpose.

For irrigation lines, follow the directions for concentration used, and allow the solution to stand in the lines for a minimum of one hour, preferably overnight, then flush lines with clean water. SaniDate 5.0 can also be used for disinfecting evaporative coolers. Avoid further confusion with the sister product, OxiDate 2.0, which is formulated for direct application to plants for disease control.

Equipment to Get the Job Done

SaniDate 5.0 should be applied to surfaces and equipment at a dilution of 1:256, or 0.5 fl. oz. per gallon with water. It can be applied with a hose attached to a portable injector such as made by Dosatron or Dosmatic. A simple hose nozzle that can change the water-stream pattern will help with broad sweeps and for reaching high corners.

Use injector units for this application instead of brass siphon mixers, as siphons have proven unreliable in my experience.

For small areas, one tool I’ve found useful is a Hudson Self-Mixing Sprayer that attaches to the end of the hose. It’s a bit like a foliar feeder that you use in your garden, but can be adjusted for siphoning ratio (i.e., it dispenses the SaniDate at the proper ratio, so the concentrate can be poured into the sprayer reservoir without dilution). The advantage is that you can pour the unused concentrate back into the original container when done since it has not been diluted. With techniques using a coarse spray from a hose, apply the solution to the walls, but not so high that the applicator will be back-splashed. (For those high parts, the heat treatment should be adequate; it is less likely to be contaminated and not worth risking the applicator’s safety if you don’t use a pressure washer.) Surfaces must remain wet for 10 minutes for proper disinfection, so you may need to go over each surface twice. A foaming agent, such as BioFoamer by BioSafe Systems, can lengthen the dwell time of the sanitizer, speeding up the process.

If you wish to reach the ceiling (again, heat treatment is typically sufficient), it is best to use a pressure washer that has a chemical injector. We use common sense where we spray. We turn off grow lights and avoid wetting them. We do not spray shade or light deprivation curtains, as the force may damage the material, especially if it has grown brittle with age. A fog applicator generates a cloud of floating droplets of chemical to reach all surfaces, including ceilings—while hastening application—improving dwell time and eliminating the strong force of liquid sprays. I prefer cold auto-fogging units, such as those made by Dramm, as they are also suitable for many microbial pesticides and they can be activated by a timer after hours so that no one is exposed to the chemical.

No matter which method you use, do not rinse the product off the surfaces. Bar people from entering during application, and follow all ventilation requirements (for fogging) and re-entry restrictions.

The Christening of the Grow Room

As you begin using the room, be sure to return all environmental settings to their correct values for optimum plant growth. Replace the drain covers if you removed them, and use this moment to realign tables, look for tripping hazards and other safety issues. On your marker board inside the room, post the date of last sanitation. Take the time to inspect the room personally, preferably with your team there. Reward them with a good word. Then make sure everyone knows that only new plants should be brought in.

Almost four years since PM Modi’s promise, corpses and puja leftovers still pollute the river, while data shows the holy city might be drinking its own sewage.

Varanasi: Narendra Modi’s top electoral promise from the ghats of Varanasi was to clean the Ganga, a Herculean task attempted by several of his predecessors without much success.

Varanasi’s 84 ghats have seen considerable improvement since Modi, the Lok Sabha MP from the holy city, became Prime Minister. Steel dustbins dot the steps of the ghats, while IL&FS, a private company, has been given the contract to manage waste.

But that’s about as far as things have gone. “There have been no deep changes, only cosmetic ones. Ghat cleaning does not mean the Ganga has been cleaned,” said P.K. Mishra, professor of chemical engineering at IIT, BHU.

On a visit to the city, ThePrint found that the river itself is still chock-full of floating waste, pious refuse, animal and human remains, and sewerage.

Floating bodies

In 2016, the National Green Tribunal criticised the Uttar Pradesh government for allowing dead bodies to be dumped in the Ganga.

Locals said it was common practice among Hindus to not cremate unmarried girls or babies. Even hospitals sometimes dispose of bodies of patients that aren’t claimed, they said.

However, Anil Kumar Singh, Varanasi in-charge of the UP Pollution Control Board, insisted: “No dead bodies are disposed in the Ganga. Even the remains from the cremation ghats are carried away.”

The sewage treatment problem

Varanasi generates about 321.5 million litres of sewage per day (MLD). Sewage treatment plants (STP) can only treat 101.8 MLD, while the rest flows directly into the Ganga through the Varuna and the Assi, two rivers (now effectively drains) that flow across the city.

Many problems afflict the existing STPs, which were commissioned in Rajiv Gandhi’s time as PM. Outdated technology and lack of trained staff are two major ones, as is the interruption of electricity supply, which is acknowledged by the Central Pollution Control Board but denied by the Purvanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam, the local supplier.

B.K. Pandey, GM of Jal Kal, the water supply and sewerage system maintenance agency, said both the Assi and the Varuna will be intercepted and their water sent to treatment plants. However, this plan may take another year to implement, as two STPs are still under construction. The plan is to complete them by March 2018 and take the total number of STPs in the city to five. The new STPs are funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission.

Another STP has been initiated under the Namami Gange project, for which the foundation stone was laid by PM Modi on 22 September 2017, three years after the flagship Ganga cleaning programme was launched.

Is Varanasi drinking its own refuse?

Varanasi’s sole functioning sewerage system was created by the British in 1917. The 100-year-old pipes have deteriorated, and in the monsoons, storm water and drain water often mix and flow into these pipelines.

A new sewer network has been laid in Varanasi under JICA, but it has been built as a rising main—which means constructed against the natural slope. Pumping stations will have to pump the waste against gravity to STPs for treatment. It is not yet operational.

Sewage is discharged into the Ganga at six points in Varanasi. These disperse waste water under some of the most famous ghats like Assi Ghat and Harishchandra Ghat. Although ‘River Front Development’ has been sanctioned Rs 27.28 crore under Namami Gange in Varanasi, the river itself is being polluted at these ghats.

Varanasi draws 270 MLD of its water needs from the Ganga. The Bhadani Pumping Station just downstream of the Assi nullah outlet draws most of this water. This means that at the intake point, there’s a very high level of faecal coliform bacteria, and that Varanasi may be drinking its own sewage.

The Sankat Mochan Foundation has been monitoring the Ganga and its water quality for over 30 years. Latest data collected by it in June 2016 shows faecal coliform (FC) levels at 41,00,000/100 ml near the Assi confluence (Nagwa canal) and 53,00,000/100 ml at the Varuna confluence. Normal FC level is 500-2,500/100 ml for bathing water standard.

About this problem, UPPCB’s Singh said: “Till untreated sewage is flowing into the Ganga, there can be no controlling of faecal coliform.”

How much longer?

The glacial pace of Ganga cleaning has led many to doubt if it can be finished in time for the Lok Sabha elections in 2019.

Vishwambhar Nath Mishra, current head of the Sankat Mochan Temple and Foundation, said: “If you do not do anything for the Ganga itself, there is no benefit to just cleaning the ghats.”

Modi had once said in Varanasi that “Mother Ganga is awaiting a son who will accomplish the task of cleaning the river”. The question is: how long will the Ganga have to wait for her ‘sons’?

We are taken to the past when we walk through its artistic lanes and gullies and catch a glimpse of Udaipur’s skilled artisans at work.

Chandpole, one of the seven gates built by the erstwhile king of Mewar, Udai Singh 2 in the 16th century protects the area within the walls and gates and continues to be referred to as the old city or the walled city. Tej Shanker Paliwal, the president of Chandpole Nagrik Samiti, a citizens’ group working on lake restoration tells me about the city’s history, its palaces, majestic forts and most notably its sophisticated system of artificial lakes constructed on local rainfed streams, which gave it the name ‘city of lakes’.

“All the five major lakes in the city – Fatehsagar, Pichola, Swaroopsagar, Rangsagar and Doodh Talai, have been taken up for restoration under the national lake conservation programme,” he says. As we approach the sprawling city palace, which stands on a ridge overlooking lake Pichola, the view of the fort looming above is spectacular and I can see cupolas crown the palace’s octagonal towers. Paliwal, who has been working on the issue of lake protection for several decades points to the finest hotels in the much-sought-after tourist destination on the way. We then tread back to Gangaur Ghat, on the waterfront of lake Pichola and pass by prominent places like Bagore-ki-Haveli museum and the old Jagdish temple. On our way back, while crossing the Brahmpole bridge, one can see raw sewage being directly let out into the lakes by the hotels that mushroom along.

As we sit down at a cheery restaurant, the owner joins us and explains how the tourism industry wants strong protection for the lake. The restaurant overlooks the Swaroopsagar lake and has been turning into a dump yard of late. He puts the blame squarely on bathing and washing of clothes in a lake. “The Rajasthan High Court’s ban of 2015 on all this is not being followed. City conservationists should take up the case, as it means loss of tourists and business for us. The problem of water hyacinth and contamination is very high,” he says. “A large number of people, mainly migrant labourers and the poor, use these surface water sources for many things like bathing and cleaning, where will they go?” Paliwal overlooks him and enquires about the waste management system deployed in his hotel. He explains a little hastily, with an averted face, and goes away.

Not much interest is forthcoming from them to restore polluted lakes and rivers. Citizens’ groups like Chandpole Nagrik Samiti have been conducting street corner meetings with local citizens and clearing the lake of its muck.

I joined a Sunday clean-up at lake Pichola to find dozens of people clearing the lake of water hyacinth and polythene from the riverbed. In fact, some people arrive in a boat that appears to have some sort of small engine and is strewn with debris that they collected from the lake.

Citizens’ Efforts

“The lakes of Udaipur have been reduced to being a garbage can by the houses around them and the numerous hotels catering to the tourism industry,” says Paliwal. The pitiful state of the city’s lakes, coupled with the sheer apathy of the government, has forced some well-meaning citizens to come out of their comfort zones and make a difference. Paliwal has been leading the efforts of the citizens to desilt, clean and restore some of the lakes to improve their water quality. Some of these efforts, like the Udaisagar lake that is now overflowing with clean water, have been successful, while others are ongoing.

The Jheel Sanrakshan Samiti, another lake conservation group has been pressuring the government agencies since 1992 when the organisation was formed to work on lake restoration and resist lake encroachment. “The group was formed shortly after the drought in the late eighties when the Pichola and Fatehsagar lakes dried up and the people faced huge water shortages,” says Dr Tej Rajdan, who heads the Jheel Sanrakshan Samiti. Rajdan got involved in the lake restoration work in the late eighties while he was studying medicine in the city.

“The city is squarely dependent on the system of interconnected lakes for its domestic and drinking water supply requirements. More recently, it has been getting much of its water by pumping through massive pipelines from the Jaisamand lake that is 50 km away as well as the Mansi Wakal scheme. Groundwater is being pumped indiscriminately through bore wells in the dry lake beds,” says Rajdan.

“The Fatehsagar lake, constructed in the late 1600s by ruler Maharana Jai Singh, is now the second major source of drinking water in the city. The lake is highly polluted and its storage capacity is getting reduced,” Paliwal notes. “People demand support and swift action from the government,” he says.

“The lake poses a risk to public health, now that urbanisation has degraded its water quality,” says Nand Kishore Sharma, secretary of a local environmental conservation organisation, Mohan Singh Mehta Memorial Trust. He says that citizens come together almost every weekend to put in voluntary labour for cleaning the lakes, removing water hyacinth and sorting out junk.

“Some of the more recent efforts of the government, like removing water hyacinth through bio-control and introducing new varieties of fish are not finding favour with the people. As a part of the government’s national lake conservation plan, five of the lakes are supposed to be desilted, sewage treatment plant installed and the area adjacent to the lake beautified,” says Haji Sardar Muhammad of Jheel Hiteshi Nagrik Manch, a social group dedicated to keeping the lakes clean. “Many of these plans are too expensive and fail in the absence of a proper institutional mechanism,” says Paliwal.

The Ahar river, that feeds the massive Udaisagar lake, flows right through the city. “The rivers’ degradation had turned it into a sewer carrying toxic pollutants and garbage,” says Sharma. As per estimates of the Central Pollution Control Board, the sewage generated in the city is of the order of 68 million litres per day while the Udaipur municipality puts the figure at 40 million litres per day. The city’s sewage management system, with its frail infrastructure, which to this day does not include a sewage treatment plant is completely inadequate to deal with the burden of urbanisation.

Court’s Interventions

The citizen’s efforts have from time to time, received positive support from the court when it hauled up officials on the lacunae and asked the government to prepare a time-bound plan to clean up Udaipur’s lakes. Yet, the lakes Pichola, Swaroop Sagar, Fateh Sagar and Badi, which are the city’s lifelines, have deteriorated in quality over the years. “A lake development body too has been constituted in 1999 focusing on the problem of the lake, yet the indifference continues,” says Sharma.

“To salvage the lakes from the clutches of pollution, citizens have moved the court several times, notable being the one filed by Balwant Singh Mehta in 1982,” says Sharma. Following this, the court directed the city’s administration to chart a plan to protect the lakes. “Jheel Sanrakshan Samiti has, from 1997 onwards sought intervention of the Rajasthan high court as well as the supreme court through Public Interest Litigations to restore the lakes and appeal against encroachments on the lake,” says Rajdan, who heads the group.

“In spite of the courts’ directives, nothing moves on the ground except in 2000, when a lake development body was constituted. It lacked the teeth, so we began lobbying for a lake development authority, with more powers,” says Rajdan. The efforts paid and in March 2017, a district level lake development authority has been constituted with the Collector as Chairman and Commissioner of Nagar Nigam as Secretary. This local authority is to plan and implement all projects and activities related to management and conservation of the lakes of Udaipur.

“What we need is a forward-looking urban renewal project in which the lake is reclaimed, its ecology rejuvenated by involving citizens in raising awareness on stopping all forms of pollution from entering the river,” says Rajdan, hoping that things move on the ground.

In war-torn Yemen, people struggle with power shortages, and waste piles up on the streets, spreading cholera

NAIROBI, Jan 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Growing up in Al-Harrah, a small village in west-central Yemen, Omer Badokhon watched his mother cooking for hours at a time in a smoke-filled kitchen.

Now the chemical engineering graduate hopes a small-scale biogas system he has invented can tackle unhealthy indoor pollution in his war-torn country.

Last February, the 24-year-old was among a group of Hadramout University students designing a landfill in Mukalla City, a port on the Gulf of Aden.

Realising that recovering biogas from the landfill would take several years and serve only one city, Badokhon set himself the challenge of coming up with micro-scale plants for individual urban and rural homes.

The goal was to provide them with clean cooking fuel, lighting and organic fertiliser, while reducing the trash heaped up on city streets that has helped spread cholera.

""In some villages, electricity has not been restored since the conflict began in 2015,"" Badokhon told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""In Mukalla City where I now live, I remember how desperate I felt trying to complete university assignments by candlelight when power shuts down for four to six hours every day.""

Last month in Nairobi, Badokhon received a ""Young Champions of the Earth"" award from UN Environment, which will help him put his solution into practice in Yemen.

The biogas devices will be constructed locally using plastic or fibreglass, with support from the Hadramout Foundation for Invention in Mukalla.

They will be piloted in 1,500 rural homes in Hadramout, Shabwa, Taiz, Sanaa, Ibb and Aden governorates over the next eight months.

Badokhon will use his $15,000 in prize money to build a first batch of 50 to 80 units, and has also received $10,000 from Yemeni oil company PetroMasila to complete his research.

POLLUTION REDUCTIONS

The awards jury said his project could help tackle three major problems in Yemen. By utilising organic waste that produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas, the biogas system can contribute to curbing global warming.

It also addresses widespread dumping of waste - the major culprit for a cholera epidemic that affected a million Yemenis in 2017.

And it will supply clean fuel for rural homes in a country where more than 3 million people still cook over open fires, causing severe respiratory illness and even death.

After months of experimentation, Badokhon has refined a bio-chemical catalyst that breaks down organic waste faster. Combined with specially designed fermenting chambers, the technology can double the amount of biogas produced from a set quantity of waste feed, he said.

Fifteen prototypes will first be installed in Mukalla homes free of charge, to fine-tune the final product, before it is rolled out more widely.

Biogas is a renewable source of energy, produced when bacteria break down biodegradable material in oxygen-free chambers.

The fermentation produces a gas made up of 55-70 percent methane and 30-45 percent carbon dioxide. Biogas can be used in its pure form for cooking, combusted to generate lighting and heat, and refined into natural gas and transport fuel.

Badokhon said Yemenis each produce half a kilo of organic waste per day, meaning a family has 2 to 4 kg daily feedstock for a biogas unit, which can provide two hours of cooking fuel without a catalyst - ""sufficient to make lunch"".

Cattle manure, another key source of methane, can be added to household waste such as vegetable peelings, further reducing emissions, while the organic liquid fertiliser that is a by-product of the biogas process saves on chemical fertiliser costs, he added.

SHORT OF POWER, CASH

Badokhon noted that Yemen currently produces only 750 megawatts of electricity from a potential capacity of about 1,300 megawatts, most of it generated from fossil fuels.

""You can imagine our plight,"" he said, adding that he has included provisions for solar panels as part of his household unit, to power lights and cooling fans.

In the past five years, half of Yemen's rural households and three-quarters in cities are estimated to have installed solar power systems, according to the World Bank.

Yet while the conflict rages on, Badokhon is concerned that the $250-$300 cost of a home biogas plant may be too high for most families.

""It's not easy for Yemenis in these dire times to pay this amount - people can't afford even food,"" he said.

He is crafting a proposal for the United Nations and others to fund the production of his units, so they could be provided free to rural families.

Launched in 2017 by UN Environment and polymer manufacturing company Covestro, the ""Young Champions of the Earth"" award also offers entrepreneurship training and mentoring to help its six regional winners kick-start their innovations.

Moudgil got 22 votes, while the remaining five went to Congress candidate Devinder Singh Babla.

Mayor’s priorities On financial crunch: ‘I will talk to the Centre for funds besides seeking help from Punjab and Haryana chief ministers. any new levies will be imposed only with the consent of councillors and city residents. Public partnership is must for decision-making.’ On water crisis: ‘I will expedite the work on Phases 5 and 6 of the Kajauli waterworks and try my level best to bring in additional 40 MGD water to the city by July this year. Water will be supplied round-the-clock to all residents.’ On sanitation: ‘I will review the mechanised sweeping project contracted out to Lion Services for Rs 50 crore a year. I will also seek help from RWAs to raise awareness about waste segregation. MC officers will soon hold camps in sectors.’

Also, first-time BJP councillors Gurpreet Singh Dhillon, 39, (ward 21) and Vinod Aggarwal, 50, (ward 26) were elected senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor, respectively, to make it a clean sweep for the saffron party, which enjoys brute majority in the municipal corporation House.

MP Kirron Kher, being an ex officio member of the MC, was the first to vote, while nominated councillors could not vote this time as their right was struck down by the Punjab and Haryana high court in August 2017.

Work cut out for him

Moudgil takes over the reins of the civic body when it is heading towards a major financial crisis. Left with only Rs 125 crore in fixed deposit, it has to spend around Rs 60 crore every month to pay salaries to employees and meet other expenditure. Generating only Rs 12 crore from own sources every month, it may not be able to meet its expenses in the last month of the fiscal.

The new mayor will also have to work on improving the city’s water supply. The city is short of 29 million gallons per day (MGD) of water, equivalent to 45 lakh litre (2.25-lakh buckets).

Even when plans are finalised, procedural delays or wastage have emerged as major hurdles towards quenching the city’s thirst. Though Moudgil assured that additional water will be provided in June, MC officers say it might take another eight months.

Meanwhile, residents and even councillors are regularly complaining about sanitation condition in the city going from bad to worse. In May last year, even MP Kirron Kher said in the House that the company allocated the work to keep the city clean has completely failed despite being paid Rs 4.5 crore every month.

Even as the civic body started distributing colour-coded dustbins for segregation of waste in June last year, things haven’t changed on the ground.

Also, despite directions of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), the Jaypee plant at Dadumajra is processing only a third of the city’s 450-tonne garbage daily. The remaining refuse is being dumped on the ground opposite the plant, as the MC remains a mute spectator.

‘Will take help of ex-MPs’

With his work cut out for him, Moudgil will have to hit the ground running.

After winning the election, the mayor said he will take advise from all former Lok Sabha members from Chandigarh to work for the betterment of the city. “Pawan Kumar Bansal, Satya Pal Jain and Harmohan Dhawan are experienced people. I will take their help too to fulfil the dream of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said.

However, Moudgil will also have to work towards keeping his own horde together.

The BJP got a jolt just a week before the election, as outgoing mayor Asha Kumari Jaswal filed her nomination as an Independent. The rift was wide open as at least 10 BJP councillors — belonging to city unit president Sanjay Tandon’s camp — backed her.

Moudgil, who had the backing of Kher besides Jain and Dhawan, was facing a rout, until his apology and party high command’s rap made Jaswal back out just two days before polling.

Even as Tandon and Jain were seen sitting together in the gallery during the voting and later Tandon offered sweets to Moudgil, he and councillors from his camp, including Jaswal and former mayor Arun Sood, left the MC office soon after.

Moudgil will have to take along all these councillors if he wants to have a fruitful one-year tenure.

The BJP has 20 councillors among the 26 elected members, its ally Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has one and the Congress four besides an Independent councillor.

According to the Punjab Municipal Corporation Act applicable in Chandigarh, the first term of the five-year House is reserved for a woman candidate from general category. The next term — the present — is for any candidate from the general category, the third is reserved for a candidate from the Schedule Castes, while the fourth term is again for a woman candidate from general category. The fifth is reserved for a candidate from general category.","Davesh Moudgil, 41, two-time Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) councillor from ward 22, was elected the city’s 22nd mayor on Tuesday.

ZAMBIA has had cholera outbreaks before but none has impacted the lives of citizens like the current one.

Jokes abound on social media (WhatsApp and Facebook) about people from Lusaka being stigmatised because of cholera, which has ravaged the capital city.

Even music has not spared the caricaturing of Lusaka residents as victims of the shameful water-borne disease- a disease of filth. General Kanene’s latest song talks about his desire to leave Lusaka for the village, which is disease free.

That is not all about the stigma cholera has unleashed on residents of Lusaka, apparently the national epicentre of the disease.

My recent trip to Mongu gave me a clear picture of how travellers from Lusaka are perceived.

All seemed well when I boarded a Shalom bus on my trip to Mongu on Sunday, January 15 this year.

At Lusaka Inter-city Bus Terminus, I underwent the usual sanitisation of hands before the bus started off.

It was business as usual at Nalusanga barrier, where officers from the Department of National Parks and Wildlife (DNPW) conduct their usual routine checks as passengers disembark and loosen up for a few minutes.

At Tateyoyo barrier, the entry into Nkeyema district, we found a mattress soaked in some chemicals where we were ordered to step into before washing our hands using sanitizers.

What initially seemed to be amusing only ceased to be fun when we noticed that passengers on Lusaka- bound buses coming from the other direction (Nkeyema) were not subjected to the kind of screening we had undergone.

That act alone changed the mood in the bus because it became clear that we were the proverbial ‘lepers.

At Munkunye, some youths who were playing pool cynically shouted ‘cholera, cholera, cholera’ as our bus made its way. As we diverted into Kaoma from the Lusaka – Mongu road, I was pleasantly surprised to see how the district has transformed.

There were no vendors along the road all the way to the market and bus station. Even the stands, especially the wooden ones, have all been razed.

The district authorities have embraced the presidential directive with military zeal. Consequently, Kaoma has become sparkling clean to the extent that from the comfort of my seat on the bus, I was able to count ants.

Mongu has also joined in the general clean-up and closed down some make-shift markets as part of the clean-up of the provincial capital.

The only drawback in Mongu is a trading place on the way to Limulunga where garbage is visible along the Mongu-Limulunga road.

In Muoyo village, I witnessed the clean-up exercise where District Commissioner Teddy Chimbinde joined health and local authorities in doing rounds.

Mr Chimbinde and his team toured butcheries, restaurants, bars and all the shops, including the market, to ensure that traders complied with the standards of hygiene espoused by health inspectors.

Some traders complained about the lack of toilets at Muoyo market and wondered what the multi-sectoral team was going to do about it since the market was run by the traditional leadership.

The traders suggested that had the local authority taken over, the market was by now going to have proper sanitation.

In Kalabo, the epidemic preparedness committee swung into action on Thursday, January 18, 2018.

The team, led by District Commissioner Fridah Luhila, visited the Kashitu market to inspect it for cleanliness in particular, waste disposal, status of the toilets, and sale of raw food in unlicensed areas.

The team resolved after the inspection to quicken the collection of waste from the market, close all unlicensed butcheries, relocate all those in make shift shops to properly constructed market stands.

“The newly constructed toilet at the market was clean and had water and soap. We recommended that council complete one market stand and construct another for salaula traders. The team inspected Nalionwa Primary, Nalionwa Secondary, Kalabo Primary and Kalabo Secondary to assess level of cleanliness,” Mrs Luhila said.

Mrs Luhila said all schools had made adequate efforts to clean surrounding as directed by the Ministry of General Education.

“All schools had good facilities except for one that was still completing its ablution block. All schools confirmed that they had water pails for washing hands with soap. The team set up groups to hold meetings in the schools, community, correctional facility to sensitise pupils, prisoners and people on cholera. DEBS [District Education Board Secretary] was requested to send a brochure on cholera to each school in Kalabo district for sensitisation,” Mrs Luhila said.

She said the district director of health, Isaac Tembo confirmed that each health centre was given kits to handle cases of cholera and that one place was identified for any emergency should need arise.

While the current cholera outbreak has been a drawback due to loss of lives and stagnation of socio-economic activities, it has sensitised the citizens, especially with the participation of the defence forces and security wings, in the sanitisation of the country.","BENEDICT TEMBO, MonguZAMBIA has had cholera outbreaks before but none has impacted the lives of citizens like the current one.

LUSAKA has seen a phenomenal boom and increase in both vehicular and human traffic, which has inevitably put pressure on available infrastructure.

Just to illustrate significant comparisons and contrasts, on December 27 last year, I took a drive around Lusaka just to appreciate the goings-on in the city and surrounding residential areas. I made a few key observations.

It is rainy season and this, over the years, has brought challenges that we all know. Flooding has been caused by blocked drainages without planned and functional water harvesting methods in place.

We need water (it is life). I should hasten to say that I am happy with current efforts of constructing the Bombay drainage because it will help in addressing the water harvesting scenario.

As I drove from Chawama via the ring road, I felt humbled by the work the defence and security personnel have done in cleaning up the central business district (CBD) as it has made movements faster.

The tarred roads, too, help reduce vehicle maintenance costs, if I was to compare with five years ago when the roads were gravel.

As I approached Kamwala area on Kafue road, I could notice increase in vehicular and human traffic. I asked myself a number of questions that I have not found answers to, and it is my hope that we all can help? Why are we all coming into the CBD? Is it just a culture of getting into town to get things done? There are a number of malls like Makeni, Embassy and Cosmopolitan operating with key retail facilities, including food outlets. Is it an issue of higher prices as we go out of town to an extent that as a people, we would rather all be in town and save as much as we can?

My plan was to drive from one end of town using Lumumba Road, through COMESA market. As I approached the market, I realised that this is actually a busy area where a number of businesses are housed and people flock to do their business.

That by itself contributes to congesting the area along Lumumba Road, which is a transit route for most trucks going to the industrial areas, Copperbelt, and to other countries. As we get to City Market area by bus, vehicular and human traffic from Kanyama and Chibolya contributes to the high traffic along Lumumba Road. I then decided to turn into Freedom Way.

On this road, minibuses are offloading and loading at undesignated points primarily driven by the fact that people are there. As I approached Juldan bus station, where I had to pick up a colleague who had travelled from Mpika, I found something interesting. A group of passengers were seated, waiting for buses to load in readiness for various destinations, including Kasama, Chipata, Mongu, Lundazi, etc.

I wondered how Juldan Bus Services have their own station when all other operators are operating from Intercity Bus Terminus.

Then there was the parking issue; Juldan say they own about 12 bays. When the buses arrived from Mpika, and when the Chipata-bound came to load the passengers, people were forced to remove their cars to pave way for those buses to park.

The question is on planning; was that made as a provision for bus loading bay? Clarity on this could help, and I believe I am not the only one seeking answers.

We had no option but to move. It meant that we had lost about 15 bays and all the cars had no option but to have their hazard lights on while on the road. How can we decongest the road? Let’s make use of designated places such as Inter-city Bus Terminus for long-distance routes instead of the current scenario where some operators are in the CBD.

As I drove out, now using Cha Cha Cha Road, I approached Society Business Park and there was a huge truck trying to negotiate its way to offload stock. It took about 20 minutes to clear the way, and due to the heavy traffic that had built up, I could hear honks of evidently frustrated motorists.

How can this be managed? I am sure with the presence of a number of outlets, the issue of trucks offloading is a recurring one. What could be the way out? Can we engage mall managers? All these, I believe, are steps in finding a solution.

This is but a trip for today and I have heard a number of people dreading the town trip. I should commend the Zambia Police Service for their presence at major intersections to help control vehicular traffic.

Fast forward to December 30 last year. Unfortunately, we have an emergency, the cholera outbreak that has spread to most areas such as shanty townships. Food outlets at major shopping malls within Lusaka are also affected and the pandemic has reached crisis point.

Markets and vendors are noted as main conduits in the spread of the deadly outbreak which, unfortunately, has claimed over 60 lives.

President Edgar Lungu directed defence and security wings to help contain the spread of cholera and significant progress has since been made. Several markets have been closed, the CBD is free of vendors, and the state of the city is pleasing to the eye following the massive clean-up.

Plans are under way to construct habitable conducive market malls where all who have been in the street will now have decent places to operate from. This is noble as it will drive traffic, both human and vehicular, to a specific area. This will in turn increase potential revenue collection by the city council through market levies.

As I sought common ground through interactions as a concerned patriot, a number of questions came up, including how we can reduce town-bound movements. Can I attribute the quick spread of cholera to that?

Some observers noted that whilst we are in a crisis, we need to be level-headed and focus on a long-term solution. How do we have free-flowing drainage systems not only in the CBD but, more importantly, in townships?

What’s the best way around sanitation (pit latrines and flushable toilets)? I know for a fact that a pilot project on construction and use of flush toilets was flagged off by Government through Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company (LWSC) in Kalingalinga township as a way of eliminating water-borne diseases. This can be replicated around the city.

I should commend the business community for donations and pledges to assist in making our city clean, and residents for heeding calls by Government and its agencies for working together.

To decongest the city beyond the current outbreak, we all have a role to play. Government should expedite the decentralisation drive of the proposed civic centre in every constituency as this may help in decongesting the CBD.

Let’s all play our part and get the views that are coming through for a lasting solution.

YouTube

Editor's Note: This story was updated on February 5 to include information about the scope of the Stella Artois offer.

In a new Super Bowl ad, Matt Damon makes a bold promise: Buy a limited-edition Stella Artois chalice and your money will help give a clean water supply to someone in the developing world for five years.

The ad, called ""Taps,"" reminds viewers that water is something we take for granted. Around the world, 844 million people do not even have a basic service providing water to their homes, according to the World Health Organization.

""If just 1 percent of you watching this buys [a chalice], we can give clean water to 1 million people,"" says Damon in the ad.

The 30-second spot was purchased by Stella Artois (estimated price tag: $5 million). It's part of an ongoing partnership between the beer giant and Damon's nonprofit group, Water.org, whose mission is to provide access to clean water and sanitation in the developing world.

The chalices are sold on Amazon for $13, with $3.13 in proceeds from each purchase going to Damon's charity. The beer glasses are imprinted with designs by artists from India, Mexico and the Philippines, countries where Water.org currently works.

Damon's statement about ""1 percent of you watching"" would add up to roughly 1 million purchases from the Super Bowl audience. According to Water.org, Stella Artois would donate the $3.13 for ""up to 300,000 chalices"" sold in the U.S. between January 1 and December 31.

And what exactly does that $3 buy? Can it really bring clean water to one person for half a decade? Skepticism surfaced on Twitter.

Why does my city water cost 30 bucks a month when the price of a beer mug will buy 5 yrs worth? — John Zavinski (@JohnZavinski) January 30, 2018

This doesn't explain the correlation between the chalice and the water. Like how could buying one chalice fund all that? To me it just means Stella Artois won't help until we buy something. — Trumpet Wom' (@trumpetgrrrl) January 30, 2018

Even water specialists weren't clear on how the numbers were calculated.

To learn more, we interviewed researchers and spokespeople for Water.org

What does Water.org do?

Despite its name, Water.org doesn't actually provide water to people in the developing world. So your $3 won't go directly toward, say, the delivery of jugs of water or the building of a well.

To fulfill its mission, the nonprofit has set up a custom microlending system called WaterCredit. The group partners with financial institutions in developing countries to lend people small amounts of money so they can pay to get water. That might mean buying a faucet and hiring a contractor to tap into water supplies or buying containers to catch rainwater.

Giving people that kind of choice is a good thing, says Annie Feighery, a co-founder of mWater, a digital platform that water nonprofits use to measure the impact of their work. The group has worked with Water.org for four years.

For a long time, charities would try to fix a community's water problem by digging wells and then leaving, she says. But the wells would often malfunction and become contaminated within a year, and they cost a lot to maintain. Today, wells are seen as an ""old-fashioned approach that we now call the dig-and-ditch model,"" she says.

Although in some cases, wells are still a reasonable option. Families who live miles away from a clean drinking water source can take out a loan to pay for the construction of a deep borehole well, which siphons clean water deep in the ground, or a large container to catch and store rainwater. According to the World Health Organization, harvesting rainwater generally provides good quality water.

Is $3 enough to cover those kinds of expenses?

Not exactly.

When someone buys the chalice from Stella Artois, $3 does indeed go to Water.org.

According to Water.org's calculations, that $3 equals five years of clean water for one person in the developing world. To come up with that number, the group counted up the number of people it helped get water from 2014 to 2016 — roughly 3.3 million — and then divided that figure by the sum of the group's organizational costs in the same time period: $42 million. (The data is available in the charity's financial statements on their website.)

And the answer is: $12.50 to give one person access to water.

In this formula, the infrastructure for their water would last about 20 years. Based on these calculations, the $3 from the Stella Artois chalice, says Water.org, would provide five years of clean water.

But that doesn't mean the loans are only $3.

In fact, the average loan taken out by a borrower from local financial institutions, in partnership with Water.org, is about $300.

According to Water.org, 99 percent of the borrowers pay it back. To date, the group says they have given out 2.2 million loans. When people repay the loan, the money gets lent out to others in the community, creating a multiplier effect, says Julie LaGuardia, a spokesperson for Water.org.

""Sometimes in marketing efforts one needs to over-simplify to make reasonable promises to donors, retailers and investors,"" says John Oldfield, a principal at the Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group Global Water 2020. ""But it's a good appropriate claim for the start of the conversation around clean water.""

Asked about the discrepancy between the $3 and the $300 figures, Melanie Mendrys, a spokesperson from Water.org, says, ""I don't consider that a discrepancy. I know that the $3 does in fact help a woman or a family get access to the money needed to get water or a toilet.""

She does not think the ad is misleading. ""It's an opportunity for people to learn more and once they do they get really excited,"" she says. ""We just reached ten million people who received water or sanitation from our efforts. We know what we're doing is working and we're excited to reach more.""

And specialists do think the loan is a good approach.

""What's novel about WaterCredit is that the loan is being provided for a home improvement,"" says Jenna Davis, an associate professor in the department of civil and environmental engineering and a senior fellow at the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford University. She has looked at the evidence around the Water.org's business model.

A tap or some containers to catch rainwater doesn't sound like much, but it can have a significant impact for low-income families. ""In many parts of the developing world, people were paying more for water in a month, for example, buying bottled water, than would be needed to pay a regular monthly bill if they had a piped connection,"" says Davis. Research has shown that for low-income households, the obstacle to installing the hardware or other connections is the cost, she says.

Wouldn't it be more efficient if Stella Artois just gave a few million to Water.org instead of buying a Super Bowl ad?

That was another question raised on Twitter: Why couldn't Stella just have forked over the money to Water.org?

""It's important to remember that this is a Stella ad just as much, if not more, than a Water.org ad,"" says Jason Wojciechowski, creative director of Corelab, an agency that runs digital campaigns for nonprofits like Oxfam, Save the Children and Global Witness.

Wojciechowski doubts that a Game Day ad alone would rake in a ""ton of money"" for the charity. The group would need to combine it with aggressive fundraising and social media campaign efforts over a long period of time.

But he does think the ad will provide another service to the Super Bowl audience: planting the seed that change is possible. ""Showing people that they have agency, responsibility and a role to play,"" he says. ""The idea that there's something people can do to end the water crisis.""","Fact-Checking Matt Damon's Clean Water Promise In A Super Bowl AdYouTubeEditor's Note: This story was updated on February 5 to include information about the scope of the Stella Artois offer.

By Dominic Kirui

EMUCHIMI, Kenya, Feb 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - On a sunny afternoon in Western Kenya, Eunice Shigali filled a 10 litre jerrycan with water, then unfolded it like a suitcase and placed it in the sun.

After a few hours, a green smiley face appeared on the side of the black container, telling her the water was clean and hot, and ready to cook ugali, a staple dish made of maize flour.

""I used to light a fire to boil water for drinking, washing and cooking,"" the 48-year-old mother of three told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""Now I save time because when I put water in the sun, I can carry on with my other chores ... There is nothing that makes any woman happier.""

Shigali refilled the portable solar-powered jerrycan from the well in her compound in Emuchimi village, and once again laid it in the sun to warm a second batch of water for washing.

Nearly a quarter of the world - some 2 billion people - lack access to safe drinking water, according to the United Nations.

About two-fifths of Kenya's 46 million people rely on unclean water sources, such as ponds, shallow wells and rivers, particularly in rural areas and slums, says charity Water.org.

Shigali's jerrycan is made by Solvatten - meaning ""sun water"" in Swedish - a Stockholm-based social enterprise that has been working since 2007 to boost access to clean water by selling its invention to governments, charities and businesses.

The jerrycan takes two to four hours to heat water to 75 Celsius (167 Fahrenheit) in the sun. Clear panels, when it is opened, also expose the water to the sun's ultraviolet rays.

The combination of heat and light kill bacteria which can cause illness. A fabric filter also stops larger particles from getting in when filling it.

Previously, Shigali had to boil water for drinking and took cold baths. Using the jerrycan she uses less firewood and charcoal, which saves money and trees.

IN CONTROL

More than 300,000 people in 20 countries use the product, Solvatten said.

Its inventor, Petra Wadstrom, is one of Sweden's most celebrated environmentalists who has won more than a dozen awards and featured in Vogue.

She had the idea 20 years ago when she saw women and children in Indonesia contracting waterborne diseases, like cholera and typhoid, from drinking contaminated water.

""I wanted to give women the power to be independent and have control of their daily lives,"" Wadstrom said in an interview.

""Even though they might not get a source of clean water, they could still purify the (water) they get from any source so it is safe for them to drink and use.""

Shigali received her jerrycan eight years ago from the charity Soroptimist International, which now sells them to women across Kenya through 11 clubs, for 1,000 shillings ($10) each.

""We are working on ensuring that women are able to proudly have access to safe drinking water and be able to save a lot on fuel with just having to worry about the sunshine,"" said Dolphine Anyango, Soroptimist's Kenya programme director.

The jerrycans are also being rolled out by businesses, such as Swedish coffee company Lofbergs, which has distributed them to improve the health of its Ugandan coffee-growers.

The jerrycans have also been offered as an incentive for mothers to visit clinics and vaccinate their children, said David Wadstrom, a spokesman for Solvatten, adding that the company aims to have a million people using them by 2020.

""You have to believe that there is a better life on the horizon for the most vulnerable people,"" he said.

""It's really about not leaving people behind. Everybody should have access to clean, safe water at home.""

news Clean Water

Tesco Bengaluru in partnership with Rotary Bangalore Whitefield Central, on Thursday announced the inauguration of its community-based clean water programme in Naganayakanakote, a village on the outskirts of Bengaluru city.

The duo collaborated with Waterlife India - an organisation that provides access to safe water to under-served areas. This initiative began in 2017 and is now giving the villagers access to clean drinking water. The project is expected to impact 10,000 lives in the Naganayakanakote village and surrounding areas.

This initiative assures access to clean and safe drinking water as a key focus area for the village. It can thus have tremendous impact on the health and overall quality of life of the community. This self-sustainable project will further empower communities by taking ownership of the water ATMs and giving them the power to operate them accordingly.

Through community water plants, under-served communities will gain ready access to high-quality potable water, and meet or exceed World Health Organisation (WHO) standards and Indian IS1 0500 standards for drinking water. The clean water programme also aligns with Tesco Bengaluru’s vision to contribute to the implementation of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of ensuring clean water, sanitation and building community partnerships for progress.

On the occasion, Sumit Mitra, CEO, Tesco Business Services said, ‘’Over many years, Tesco Bengaluru has demonstrated a strong commitment towards social impact through initiatives that touch the lives of thousands of less fortunate people. For Tesco Bengaluru, every little step makes a big difference. The water plant is one amongst many self-sustaining community projects. Our multi-stakeholder programme helps us spread the right awareness and impacts the economic health, education and productivity levels of households in the community and its surrounding areas. Our efforts towards this programme will continue and scale up further in the upcoming months.’’

With the help of Waterlife India, Tesco Bengaluru also extended an outreach programme by organising painting competitions and quiz competitions in rural schools. These activities were critical to create awareness and boost sensitisation on the merits of safe water and its various health benefits, especially amongst children who are the primary agents of change.

Previously, Tesco Bengaluru has led various preventive healthcare initiatives with a strong focus on disadvantaged communities. Examples include eye check-up camps in government schools and the facilitation of mid-day meal programmes to improve nutrition levels of school children.

The Naganayakanakote village in Bengaluru is surrounded by many larger villages such as Doddadunnasandra, Samethanahalli, Muthkur, Muthasandra, Anugondanahalli and a few smaller villages as well. The programme also aims to facilitate distribution from the Naganayakanakote hub to these villages for clean water access.

RESIDENTS of Nsombo and Mwando villages in Lupososhi Constituency in Luwingu district will always live to remember February 20, 2018. This is the day that the two communities received clean and safe drinking water. At the same time, they were able to access ablution blocks.

This development, which was facilitated by World Vision Zambia at a cost of K1.7 million, left the beneficiaries smiling.

With these facilities in place, the villagers no longer have to walk long distances to access a basic need like water.

And when they want to answer the call of nature, the ablution blocks are just a stone’s throw away.

Chabala Puta, a 13-year-old Grade Six pupil at Nsombo Primary School is seeing a flushable toilet for the first time but he understands the benefits that come with such a facility.

“Most of the pupils shunned using the pit latrines because of their unhygienic state. The bush was the only option,” he said.

Beatrice Chipasha, 70, of Nsombo village, is equally impressed with the move by World Vision Zambia to put in place the facilities.

“We have boreholes but the water is not as clean as the one provided by World Vision,” she said.

The effort by the non-governmental organisation has also struck a chord of gratitude from the traditional ruler.

Chief Chabula of the Bisa people is grateful to Government for allowing World Vision to carry out its duties, which he said will improve livelihoods in his chiefdom.

“Previously, my people walked long distances to access water at the rivers but we now have clean water nearby. It gives me lots of joy,” he said.

The project by World Vision will improve access to safe and sustainable water, sanitation and hygiene for over 1,160,000 people in areas where the organisation operates.

In providing communities with facilities for water, World Vision believes that no child should stop school and jeopardise their future because of lack of access to water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools.

World Vision national director Mark Kelly wants communities to have easy access to water and sanitation facilities so that they live happier lives.

The non-governmental organisation wants to see more children, especially girls, remain in school by providing them with other items such as sanitary towels.

So far, over 6,000 girls have benefitted from the organisation’s provision of 32 menstrual hygiene and management facilities that it has built in 32 schools.

Apparently, Government and World Vision have similar goals to ensure that people are provided with clean and safe drinking water and proper sanitation.

Government prioritises the provision of clean and safe drinking water as an overall goal of poverty alleviation and promotion of sustainable economic development.

In Government’s Vision 2030 and Seventh National Development Plan (7NDP), provision of clean water and improved sanitation is a priority.

The engagement of both Government and the private sector, like World Vision, is a partnership that is yielding fruit.

The Ministry of Water Development, Sanitation and Environmental Protection has prioritised investments for infrastructure development.

An example is the acquisition of a US$2.4 million loan from the Arab Bank for Economic Development (BADEA) to complete phase two of water projects in Mpika, Mbala and Kasama.

And speaking at the same event, Northern Province Permanent Secretary Elias Kamanga, who was represented by Luwingu District Commissioner Patrick Chanda, commended World Vision for it’s continued support to Government in uplifting the standards of living for many communities across the country.

“Having access to piped water and a modern ablution block at a school will enhance children’s attendance in school and results in high concentration and improved performance in class. It is also true that levels of pupils dropping out of school is high, especially among girls,” he said.

And Northern provincial education officer Humphrey Simutowe was happy at the commissioning of the ablution block and water facilities in Nsombo and Mwando.

He commended World Vision for making significant contributions towards the realisation of sustainable development goals.","This development, which was facilitated by World Vision Zambia at a cost of K1.7 million, left the beneficiaries smiling.
“Previously, my people walked long distances to access water at the rivers but we now have clean water nearby.

But, a few years ago things were quite different. It was a strenuous work for the women of the village to provide clean drinking water to their families.

The groundwater of the village that is less than 15 km away from Chilika Lake, a brackish water lagoon, is saline and contains iron. Makhara, a tributary of Daya River flowing near Ogalpur, is polluted. Still, the villagers, especially the women, who are responsible for collecting water, were dependent on these two sources to meet the family’s needs of drinking, cooking and other household purposes.

In Suhagpur village, 35-year-old Kuni Pradhan narrated a similar story. Women and young girls of the village endured the same arduous labour every day to draw water from the village pond, the only source of potable water. Villagers used the pond for washing utensils and clothes, and also for bathing. Open defecation near the pond added to the biological contamination, especially during rains.

Disasters and water-borne diseases

Puri district, with almost 150 km of coastline, is prone to cyclones, floods and water logging; hence epidemics are common. Kanas block is more prone to floods as the block is near the Chilika coast and is surrounded by six tributaries, including Daya River.

During floods, the river water turns muddy and gets contaminated. Lack of access to safe drinking water during and after disasters leaves the entire population vulnerable to water-borne diseases like cholera, typhoid, jaundice, dysentery and diarrhoea. Urban waste and sewage drained into rivers added problems for villagers as it carries loads of harmful bacteria.

In October 2013, Cyclone Phailin hit the entire coastal belt of Odisha. Almost all the villages in Kanas block were severely affected by water from Chilika and floodwater from the rivers.

The villagers shifted to a nearby cyclone shelter as the villages lay inundated in floodwater for nearly a month. “When the flood water receded, we came back to our villages to restore our houses and salvage our belongings,” Soudamini told VillageSquare.in. “But the most challenging work was getting clean water for drinking, cooking and other purposes.”

The water tankers could not reach remote villages and the villagers did not get sufficient drinking water sachets. So they brought water from the river, left it undisturbed for a few hours for solid impurities to settle. “We transferred the clear water in the top to another container, boiled it and put chlorine tablets to make it suitable for drinking,” recounted Soudamini. Every day the women spent hours to make polluted river water potable.

Ogalpur villagers did not use water from the tube well because of its bad taste and smell. Since they were dependent on river water for drinking, almost all the villagers frequently fell ill from water-borne diseases and stomach ailments. “Every alternate week a few children would be down with diarrhoea and most women would complain of stomach pain, skin ailments and allergies,” Amari Samantray of Ogalpur told VillageSquare.in. Lack of safe drinking water not only affected the health but also the education of children.

Treating tube well water

Though iron is not as toxic as lead or arsenic, it has an unpleasant taste and odour and turns red after a few hours. “The salinity and iron content was so high that containers used to store groundwater turned red,” Dhani Parida told VillageSquare.in. “So we used to draw water from the river that was again unsafe for drinking.”

Seeing vulnerable conditions of villagers in getting safe drinking water during and after disasters, SOLAR, a non-governmental organization (NGO) with support from Oxfam India installed iron removal plants (IRPs) for the existing tube wells in Ogalpur. “As the tube wells also get easily contaminated during floods, we raised the height of hand pump above the highest flood level of the area,” Harish Chandra Das, secretary of SOLAR, told VillageSquare.in.

The IRP has a capacity of 2,000 litres and is filled four times during the day to cater to the 800-odd population of Ogalpur. The motor pump lifts the water into the top chamber of the IRP and the filtered water is collected in lower chambers. The tube well water that gets filtered through the IRP is free of bad smell and taste.

Pond to potability

In Suhagpur, the villagers were dependent on the pond water for drinking and cooking. “The pond water caters to the 1000-odd population of the entire village,” Pradhan told VillageSquare.in.

After the cyclone, SOLAR and Oxfam India set up a flood-proof pond sand filtration (PSF) unit in Suhagpur to provide the villagers with safe drinking water. The tank is divided into six chambers containing stone chips, sand and charcoal. Villagers draw the filtered water from the last chamber.

There are five IRPs and two PSFs set up in different villages in Kanas block. “Initially, we ran the units with electric motors, but due to erratic supply of electricity we have attached solar pumps now,” said Das.

Positive impacts

The community recalled how the incidence of diarrhoea, typhoid and jaundice has reduced drastically after they started drinking filtered water. In Suhagpur, before setting up of PSF, 11 cases of diarrhoea were reported; after installing the filters, there was only one case reported in the village. In Ogalpur too, there has been a drastic drop in the incidence of water-borne diseases. This was corroborated by data collected by the auxiliary nurse midwives (ANM) of two panchayats.

With setting up of IRPs and the PSFs the women of these villages are relieved from the strenuous labour of purifying the water to make it fit for drinking. “Now we collect water from the taps in the morning and evening and use it for drinking, without any further purification process,” Sarita Parida told VillageSquare.in.

The women said that they get more time for other household work and also get time to rest. “The girls who used to skip school to help their mothers during rainy seasons are now attending classes regularly,” said Sarita Parida, a mother of two.

Earlier, women were drinking less, as there was insufficient water for the entire family and men got priority. “Now the water intake by the women and girls of these villages has also increased,” Ritima Parida, a young woman, told VillageSquare.in.

As the easy availability of clean water has reduced the drudgery of the village women, they have taken up the task of maintaining the units. They have formed a Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) committee. Every Sunday they clean the tanks and the filters. “Though village funds are used for the upkeep of the tank, a nominal fee of Rs 5 is collected from each household towards these costs.”

The water is currently being used for drinking purpose only. The women seek more such units to meet cooking requirements, as they still rely on water from the ponds and rivers. Women from neighbouring villages also come to draw water from these units as the water is safer than other sources. “With IRPs and PSFs in our villages, now we have access to safe drinking water all the time”, said Soudamini, and the other women agreed in unison.

According to a statement on Thursday, MOL Pakistan has funded and executed several water supply schemes including the installation of hand pumps, installation of wells and supply of water through bowsers in far flung areas of the said districts.

Water supply to Nizrab Banda, one of the most underdeveloped villages of Hangu was one of such examples where MOL Pakistan has single-handedly completed the project.

Citing serious water-borne illness among residents of most of the villages located along the Bannu-Kohat Road due to lack of access to clean water, MOL Pakistan conducted an Electrical Resistivity Survey (ERS) in the area in coordination with the Water Supply and Sanitation Department, Karak. An open well was installed that has catered to the needs of thousands and provided them undisrupted access to clean drinking water. After completion, the scheme was handed over to Public Health Engineering Department.

On request of local community of the Hoti Banda village in Kohat, MOL Pakistan conducted a detailed assessment in coordination with government authorities and after analysing the ground situation, the scheme was approved, executed and handed over to Public Health Engineering Department (PHED) for future operations and maintenance.

In the far-flung areas of Karak where the situation worsens during summers, MOL Pakistan in collaboration with Karak’s district government sponsored the unconventional scheme of water supply using bowsers. The makeshift arrangement has catered to this urgent need of the locals at several locations in the TAL Block and has been greatly appreciated by the local communities.

“MOL Pakistan’s commitment to social welfare was example of a corporation helping society and those in dire need. Whereas many companies see their CSR obligations as a burden, MOL Pakistan has always gone above and beyond the legal requirements to assist people in need. This benevolence is essential for progress and Pakistan needs more generous benefactors to continue to develop as a nation,” the statement concluded.

SCHOOLCHILDREN ought to know that diseases like cholera are as a result of poor hygiene practices.

School authorities, just like parents and guardians at home, are expected to put in place measures aimed at ensuring that young people’s rights to education are fully promoted through hygienic environments.

Clean water (for drinking and other purposes), well-built infrastructure, which includes toilets and, in the case of boarding schools, bathrooms, as well as programmes that encourage healthy behavioural patterns in general, must be present in school.

When such an environment is provided for learners, then their rights to education, good health and participation will have been fulfilled, at least to a large extent. But where sanitation is poor, water is either scarce or dirty, and hygiene behaviours are not appropriate, then the environment in a particular institution will inevitably be detrimental to the health of children, who spend long hours in school.

Oftentimes, schools are places where young ones easily get sick because most of them have limited ventilation, lack hand-washing facilities, with no soap for pupils, and toilets are dilapidated. It is places like these where diseases spread very rapidly.

But with adequate facilities in which there is improved sanitation and water supply in an educational institution, whether boarding or day school, several successes, among them gender equality, can easily be achieved. Besides, there can be increased access to quality education and a reduction in the disease burden among children, especially with regard to diarrhoeal diseases like cholera.

Life skills-based hygiene education is also important in the students’ educational journey. While it is good to teach children about the facts regarding health risks and bad hygiene practices, it is even more important that the learning process focuses on completely changing their hygiene behaviour, that of their families and the hygiene behaviour of society in general so that people’s quality of life improves in the long run.

Therefore, both practical and theoretical information should be imparted to children. For instance, they should be made aware that worm infections are caused by poor hygiene in environments where they are found. So, it follows that for them to be in good health, they have to be clean all the time. Washing hands to prevent infection and diseases is a good practical example of maintaining high levels of hygiene among learners.

Methods aimed at helping students to master hygiene skills should be participatory in nature. This is because young ones almost always enjoy and benefit from more participatory educational approaches. It is from their own actions, and those of their friends, that they truly learn while they are actively involved in various activities. In this way, they easily and quickly learn and adopt new skills and concepts.

A hygiene club in a school set-up can help in ensuring that authorities are always alert to the hygiene needs of pupils. Schoolchildren in such clubs are expected to be actively involved in advocating healthy lifestyles among their peers at school and in the community where they come from. As they learn about desirable hygiene behaviours in school clubs, they can be trained as peer educators who should help in spreading messages of good hygiene both within and outside the school.

Parents and other community members can be involved in keeping schools clean, safe and healthy through activities organised by parent-teacher associations, among other forums.

Indeed, children’s right to education and good health should be respected by creating healthy environments in which there are high levels of hygiene, both in school and at home. In this way, discipline and sanity are bound to be upheld in adult life. As responsible citizens, therefore, they will positively contribute towards the country’s socio-economic development.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM- In a first in Kerala , the state government will soon be utilising the services of Robots to clean sewer holes.

The trial runs of the robot , developed by a startup company, Genrobotics , have been successfully held recently and the product will be launched next week, Kerala Water Authority (KWA) Managing Director, A Shainamol said.

""The Kerala government is very excited with the project,"" Shainamol told PTI.

The robot, equipped with Wi-Fi, Blue Tooth and control panels has four limbs and a bucket system attached to a spider web looking extension to scoop out the waste from sewers.

The project is supported by KWA, which has joined hands with Kerala start up mission to transform new ideas into practical technologies for addressing issues relating to pipe leakage and sanitation.

""Our intention is to promote local talent. Now the product, being fully funded by the government, is ready and it will be launched next week,"" she said.

Initially, the services of the robot, christened 'Bandicoot' will be utilised in Thiruvananthapuram, which has over 5,000 manholes.

The trial run of the robot, developed by the nine-member group of youngsters from varying engineering streams, had been conducted successfully in the state capital recently, CEO and Chief Product architect of Genrobotics, Vimal Govind said.

The youngsters have given up their steady jobs to find a solution to end manual scavenging in an effort to bring in some resemblance of dignity to the lives of these 'invisible' men who are paid a pittance between Rs 300-500 for their effort running into several hours.

According to Govind during the trials held near the Medical college here, about 30 kg of garbage was pulled out by the robot and they were shocked to find sanitary napkins, clothes, surgical blades among other stuff in the clogged manholes.

Fiji Red Cross has emergency response teams on standby as Gita is expected to track through the southern Lau group of islands later tonight.

“Fiji Red Cross is well prepared, and ready to respond quickly. Tropical cyclones are an annual threat in this region. We know how devastating they can be. We have been getting ready for the past 12 months,” said Kathryn Clarkson, the Head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) Pacific team.

This investment in preparedness paid off in Samoa and Tonga, said Clarkson.

“In Samoa, we saw a rapid and effective response to the weekend’s widespread floods, high winds and power cuts. People knew where to evacuate to, and the Red Cross swung into action, helping people forced to stay the night in shelters with pre-positioned stocks of blankets and clothes,” said Clarkson.

“When the waters receded, Samoa Red Cross volunteers went door-to-door checking on people. Tonight, families are home again and the big clean-up continues.”

In Tonga, thousands of people sought shelter in evacuation centres ahead of Gita’s arrival earlier today as a Category 4 Cyclone. The storm caused extensive damage throughout the country. Red Cross teams in Tonga have already started assessing damage and needs, including in remote areas.

Aid supplies have been pre-positioned across Tonga’s Islands in the lead up to the Cyclone season. These supplies, stored in shipping containers, mean that Red Cross volunteers have already started following their assessments with distributions.","Suva / Kuala Lumpur / Geneva, 13 February 2018 – Red Cross volunteers and staff are on high alert as Tropical Storm Gita barrels towards Fiji, having already caused floods in Samoa and destruction in Tonga.

MAYOR of Castries, Peterson Francis, spoke recently at the launch of the Clean City Campaign which, he said, is part of plans of a broader national campaign, aimed at making Castries one of the cleanest, greatest cities in the region by addressing the problem of inconsiderate littering.

The Mayor addressed a slew of issues currently plaguing the nation’s capital, from urinating, to defecating, littering and spitting in the streets, stating that the Clean City Campaign is merely a part of a larger cleaning plan that includes the creation of green spaces in the city, creation of new waste disposal bins and disease control through proper sanitation.

Mayor Francis said that the address was aimed at every stratum of society, and in that vein, he spoke specifically to the concerns of those who are more environmentally-conscious and concerned about the impacts of climate change.

The Mayor spoke on how this latest campaign will address the indiscriminate dumping of waste in drains, in rivers and in various places around the island, stating that these bad practices intensify the already serious risks posed by climate change.

Sponsored

His focus on climate change continued, as he expounded on the above, stating that, “All levels of society must address the country’s litter problems, as an important measure especially as it relates to climate change.”

With flooding being of particular concern to climate change proponents, the Mayor also stated that “indiscriminate dumping of waste-contaminated water sources creates a breeding ground for vector-borne diseases and also clogs drains, making the environment (more susceptible) to flooding.”

Mayor Francis hopes that the campaign will attract more persons to invest in Castries after stating that his Office “believes that improved environmental conditions…enhance the quality of life for residents and visitors to Castries, and cultivate national pride.”

The Mayor also warned offenders and would-be offenders of the legal ramifications of indiscriminate littering. He stated that while personal responsibility is critical, the legislation is there to be enforced and help curb the problem.

He went on to say that people who litter “will be charged according to the Litter Act, Chapter 6.05 Revised Laws of St. Lucia 2008 and the Criminal Code Chapter 3.01 Revised Laws of St. Lucia 2013”, and that the resulting punishments range from fines of EC$150 to EC$1500 and that “in some cases where the law dictates, up to six months in prison.”

The Mayor responded in the affirmative, when asked if there has been a crackdown on people who have been urinating in the streets: “Yes, we have. We have arrested and charged people already. That has been done.”

However, he did not stop there, going on to express his disappointment in the lack of following up on such crackdowns, saying that: “I’m seeing more people peeing all around the place than before.”

He also spoke about the comfort zones already in place in the city limits and his plans to place bold signs for people to see where they are.

“There are comfort zones which I implore you to make use of. They are located on High Street; Lower Jeremie Street near Customs; Jeremie Street Plaza; Faux a Chaux; Pavee; New Village; Leslie Land; Wilson’s Yard; Marchand near the bridge; Marchand Boulevard; Rose Hill; Castries Market; Vendors Arcade; Darling Road Plaza; and the Babonneau bus stop,” he said.

The Mayor was also asked about the problem of stray dogs and rats in the city.

You’ll see dogs in gangs now coming down from all within the environment of Castries.”

About the rats, Mayor Francis confirmed plans to utilize a certain rat poison to help deal with the problem, stating, “We have been working with the Cubans to bring what we call the Bio Rat, which will be killing the rats.” He also stated that the poison will work in such a way that it will dry the rats up, leaving no bad smell.

“I wish to use this campaign as the starting point for Castries to become one of the cleanest and healthiest cities in the region,” Francis said, while stating his vision for St. Lucia’s capital.

WHILE the meaning of all virtues has changed overtime, the application of the virtue of cleanliness has perhaps fluctuated, the most with varied ideas of what it constitutes.

For ancient Egyptian or Babylonian, cleanliness means showering water from aqueducts or simply from servants pouring water on you while in ancient Roman it means rubbing your body with oil and dust and then adding a layer of perspiration from a day of work or play. For us at Workers’ Compensation Fund Control Board, it means using brooms by our employees to clean our offices and surroundings every last Friday of the month. This practice has become part of our culture, at least since the introduction of the ‘Keep Zambia Clean Campaign”.The cleaning programme has gained momentum in light of the cholera outbreak. Readers may wish to learn that more than 70 people have succumbed to the cholera epidemic and over 3,000 cases of this disease have been recorded, according to the Ministry of Health. Health professionals and other opinion leaders have described this cholera outbreak in Zambia as the worst in recent years but amazing responses to combat the epidemic have given birth to cleaning practices in homesteads and institutions which have never been seen in many years. The military has successfully led individual and corporate citizens to clean out cholera, which the World Health Organisation defines as “An acute diarrhoeal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium vibrio cholerae.”

WCFCB is one of those corporate bodies that have joined hands with other sections of society to keep the work environment clean through the “Keep Zambia Clean Campaign”. As indicated above, every last Friday of the month, employees work half day in order to clean the buildings and surroundings at head office and in all the 20 branch offices across the country to address environmental concerns on cleanliness especially in light of disease outbreaks.

A host of global studies, including reports by the World Health Organisation, have identified linkages between climate change and infectious diseases, such as cholera. Furthermore, several findings show that the rising adverse effects of climate change ‘indirectly’ increase the rate at which cholera is transmitted.

A recent study of cholera in Bangladesh by Amit Saha and other cholera experts, in 2017, showed that the cause agent of cholera, the bacterium vibrio cholerae, proliferate, transmits and contaminates both food and water rapidly, under conditions of high temperature which we have been experiencing lately.

The cause of this outbreak in Zambia has been reduced to human activity such as poor waste management systems and the lack of proper sanitation infrastructure.

The fight against cholera needs the participation of every citizen for Zambia to win the battle against this deadly disease and in responding to this call, the Workers’ Compensation Fund Control Board has joined in the fight!

Readers may wish to learn that the board receives hundreds of clients a day from different parts of Ndola as well as from different parts of the country including Lusaka which was the epicentre of the disease and is aware that any one of those clients could be a potential carrier of the bacteria as they come into contact with members of the board and other clients.

To support efforts by the Ministry of Health and other actors to tackle the outbreak of cholera and prevent its spread, the board has installed sanitiser dispensers outside the entrance of the building in order to make sure that every person that visits the WCFCB, sanitises their hands before entering the building and as they visit various offices.

This not only protects the people within the board and those coming into the building, but it also helps keep the clients conscious and cautious of the need to keep the disease at bay by keeping themselves and their environments clean.

So, as the people go back to their various homes, the idea of washing their hands before touching food as well as after using the toilet will be instilled in their minds!

Furthermore, as a way of giving back to the community, the board decided to take a leading role in sustaining the “Keep Zambia Clean Campaign” by engaging every member of the board in various cleaning activities outside the board and other branches all over the country on the first Friday of every month.

Let’s work together to prevent the spread of this disease! Let us all participate in this campaign and together we will win!

The Clean City Campaign, as the operation is called, will be part of plans of a broader national campaign aimed at making Castries one of the cleanest and greenest cities in the region.

“The campaign we hope will reach out to every stratum of society and seek to instill in St. Lucians, particularly residents and visitors to Castries, the importance of keeping our public places and city clean,” Francis said, adding that it pertains also to persons who still risk urinating in the corridors of the capital.

Francis’ campaign mirrors another operation soon to commence, which is driven by the government to create a cleaning plan that includes the creation of green spaces in the City of Castries. Government intends to knock down some buildings in the city to create the green space spoken off.

The building housing the government printery on Jeremie Street, parliament building and the old court house are all earmarked for demolition, as part of plans by the government to remodel the city.

“The Office of the Mayor believes that improved environmental conditions would not only enhanced the quality of life for residents and visitors to Castries and cultivate national pride, but also attract more persons to invest in Castries,” Francis said.

But this is not the first time the City of Castries has seen anti-littering campaigns. Some campaigns lasted longer than others. One in particular had litter wardens roaming the city’s streets to deter persons from littering. In fact there is a Litter Act in effect in the country under which one could be charged for littering. The charges under the act ranged from $150.00 to $1500.00 and in some cases, where the law so dictates, up to six months in prison.

Francis, during his campaign launch earlier today, spoke of the indiscriminate dumping of waste in drains, rivers and other places around the country, claiming that this was intensifying the already serious risks posed by climate change.

“Action is required at all levels of society to address the country’s litter problem as an important measure especially as it relates to climate change adaptation,” he said.

According to the Mayor, indiscriminate dumping of waste contaminates water sources, creates breeding grounds for vector borne diseases and also clogs drains making environments conducive for flooding. He said that the problems are broad and wide-spread from urinating, defecating, littering and spitting in the streets to trucks carrying goods uncovered, cement trucks included, all contributing to the problem.

“While personal responsibility is critical, the legislation is there to be enforced and help curb the problem,” Francis said.

Over 200 sanitation workers within the Castries Constituency Council (CCC) will be part of the clean-up campaign. They will be cleaning and beautifying the city on a regular basis.

Mayor Francis promised more greenery in the city as a result of his clean-up campaign with flowers being planted throughout the city.

The Clean City Campaign will incorporate public educational activities and clean-up campaigns. The city police will enforce and advise members of the public against littering and new waste disposal bins will be placed all around the city as of this week.","Castries Mayor Peterson Francis has embarked on a campaign to get citizens to stop what he described as “inconsiderate littering” saying this is a problem in the city.

What is biogas technology?



Biogas technology is the treatment of organic waste under anaerobic (air-free) condition. In practice, treatment is carried out in two main forms: wet and dry digestion. In wet digestion, the water content is at least three-quarters of the weight of the waste. In contrast, water content is less than a quarter of the feed weight for dry fermentation.



The treatment is carried out by bacteria in series of processes, resulting in formation of digested slurry (or digestate) and biogas. Biogas is a gaseous fuel that burns with a blue flame just like LPG.



Biogas digesters



The digester is the air-tight structure in which waste is treated. It is typically made of concrete, brick, steel, plastic, or fiberglass. Simple digesters may have volumes as low as six cubic meters while advanced ones may range from several hundreds to thousands of cubic meters.



Organic waste for biogas production



Many waste materials are suitable for treatment using biogas digesters. Notable materials include human excrement, animal (pig, cattle, poultry, etc.) manure, food waste, agro-industrial waste and wastewater, and agricultural residues. Concurrent decomposition (co-digestion) of different wastes can be carried out, resulting in high biogas production.



Biogas uses



Biogas can replace firewood, charcoal or LPG as cooking fuel. In industry, it can be used to generate steam for process heating or power generation.



In animal farms or slaughterhouses, biogas can be used to refrigerate animal products. When industries invest in biogas plants, they benefit from energy savings, reduced cost of waste treatment, and improved image.



Biomethane



When carbon dioxide in biogas is removed, biomethane is produced. Biomethane can be bottled and sold just like LPG. Biomethane is also used as automobile fuel, providing benefits such as lower emissions and noise compared to liquid fossil fuels.



The digested slurry (biofertilizer)



The digested slurry is rich in plant nutrients. Depending on the requirements of the owner (farm, company, et.), the slurry may be applied directly as organic fertiliser, used in composting or processed into solid fertilizer and packaged for sale. It is also used in fish farming as feed supplement.



History of biogas in Ghana



Biogas was recognised as an appropriate technology for rural development as far back as 1960 but was given much attention in the 80s and 90s, where government and donor agencies such as GIZ and UNDP sponsored capacity building of several engineers and artisans. Some household and community-based plants were installed to serve as training and demonstration projects.



For instance, in Appolonia, biogas plants were installed by the Ministry of Energy from 1988-1992, enabling that rural community to enjoy electricity for several years. Biogas plants were also built in hospitals, slaughterhouses, schools and farms. Presently, private companies rely on the ability of biogas digesters to treat waste as a marketing tool.



How biogas contributes to sustainable development in Ghana



Biogas technology is a proven technology and can become a key path to national development. Through biogas technology, a waste disposal problem can be turned into an income generating one.



Sanitation



Biogas digesters control odour and improve waste handling since digestion conditions destroy most pathogens and worms. The digesters also prevent seepage and thus protect underground water.



Energy



The potential to produce biogas for productive uses is high and promising in Ghana. Biogas can be used to displace firewood, charcoal or LPG both in the home and industry, resulting in fuel savings. Large scale use of biogas will boost national energy security via displacement of fossil-based fuels.



Agriculture



The use of biofertilizer in farming improves soil structure and increases harvest. Local farmers can save money meant for inorganic fertilizer while imports are reduced.



Other benefits



Installation of biogas plants create jobs at local and national levels through design, supply of materials, construction, and fabrication of appliances. Jobs are also created in processing and distribution of biofertilizer. If biogas is used to replace firewood, drudgery and indoor air pollution are reduced, and women’s heath are improved.



Case studies: treatment of municipal waste



There are several case studies where biogas systems have been used to solve problems with municipal waste.



Zoomlion faecal waste treatment plants



Biogas plants are key components of modern faecal treatment plants established by Zoomlion at Lavender Hill, Ajin Kotoku and Mudor, all in Accra. Before the investment, liquid waste from some parts of Accra was damped untreated in the sea, causing sea pollution which in turn affected fishing and tourism, among others. The plants treat about 5000 m3 of liquid waste daily, producing green electricity and organic fertiliser, which is made available to local farmers. Due to Zoomlion’s investment under PPP with government, Accra’s image has improved considerably in liquid waste management.



Safisana



At Ashaiman, faecal, market and other waste are treated using biogas plants managed by Safisana. The effluent is processed into liquid and solid forms which are used for irrigation and farming respectively. The biogas is used to generate electricity and fed to the national grid.



Industrial waste



Biogas systems are also used to treat various industrial waste and wastewater, including palm oil mill effluent (GOPDC, Kwae), brewery wastewater (Guinnes Ghana, Kumasi), and fruit waste (HPW Fresh & Dry Ltd., Adeiso).



Challenges



While substantial progress has been made in solar, the same cannot be said of biogas. Support to biogas initiatives has been unencouraging. Biogas companies operate with limited support – capacity building, promotion, credit, end-user financing, etc. Biogas digesters are costly mainly due to high cost of materials and lack of economy of scale. This has dwindled the industry since many households, farms, institutions and companies cannot afford biogas digesters.



Way forward



Ghana’s renewable energy (RE) law calls for 10% penetration of RE in total power generation by 2020. Unfortunately, RE currently makes about 1% of generation. Recognising the situation, the Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, recently averred that government would not endorse new thermal plants and would rather institute measures to promote RE. Government should be commended for this positive decision which could become a major path to attainment of sustainable development goals.



It is feasible to generate a fair share of power from biogas if an enabling environment is created. Biogas needs to be promoted in promising sectors in a coordinated manner, with financial incentives (concessionary loans, tax holidays, etc.) made available to private companies and developers for grid-connected biogas power projects. The RE fund established under the RE Law should be expanded and accessible to private developers in RE business.



It is also necessary to simplify processes for acquiring permits for grid-connected biogas power projects, with ECG mandated to make prompt payment for power fed to grid. Moreover, the EPA and local authorities must enforce laws against discharge of untreated waste into the environment.



There is also the need for government to expand existing arrangements with companies such as Zoomlion and Safisana, to enable replication of their treatment facilities in other parts of the country. Combining anaerobic digestion of municipal solid waste with source separation can effectively solve the waste disposal crisis in Ghana, yield may economic, environmental and social benefits. Processing of biofertilizer for agricultural purposes can be integrated into the Planting for Food and Jobs programme, and can boost food security in the country.



Awareness creation for actors in promising sectors for biogas should be intensified. R&D should be intensified to support development of local technology in new and low-cost digester models that can be more affordable. Consequently, the newly formed Biogas Association of Ghana (BAG) requires government assistance to promote the technology in the country.

28,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/22/matt-damon-on-solving-the-worlds-clean-water-crisis.html,"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",CNBC,Matt Damon: A million people a year die 'completely needlessly' from lack of clean water,"Around the world, many people have to walk long distances to find a water source and others have to wait in long lines and pay large percentages of their income to secure any water at all, explain Damon and Gary White , who, along with Damon, co-founded the non-profit organization Water.org and the non-profit impact investment fund manager WaterEquity.

Indeed, 2.1 billion people lack access to safe, readily available water at home, according to a July 2017 report from the World Health Organization and UNICEF . That's roughly equivalent to three out of every 10 people, according to the report . Of those, 844 million people lack access to basic drinking water service. Further, 4.5 billion people around the world lack access to safely managed sanitation, according to the same report. That's roughly six in 10 people. A lack of access to clean water and sanitation is resulting in children dying from diarrhea and the transmission of diseases including cholera, dysentery, hepatitis A and typhoid.

""The potential it robs people of, right?"" says Damon. ""If you are a little girl who now can't go to school because you are in charge of water collection for your family, and you are spending your entire day scavenging for water, what kind of outcome can you expect for your life? Certainly you are not going to live up to your potential.""

""You have a million people dying a year, just completely needlessly, because they lack access to clean water,"" says Damon , speaking to CNBC on Thursday, the 25th annual World Water Day , which serves to call attention to the problem.

Matt Damon is best known as an actor and Academy Award-winning screenwriter. But he's also the co-founder of two nonprofits working to end the world's water crisis.

""Today, 200 million hours will be spent by women and girls walking to collect water,"" says White, speaking to CNBC. ""People are paying up to 25 percent of their income just to get dubious quality water that they can bring back to their home.""

Women and children spend 258 M hours every day collecting water, but they could be doing so much more. Less time getting water means more time for work, school, play, family and life.

To work to solve this crisis, Damon and White came together in 2009 to launch Water.org, a non-profit that works to provide access to clean drinking water in 13 countries around the world: Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Asia, Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Philippines, Brazil, Honduras and Peru. Water.org helps people gain access to clean water and sanitation by teaching, training and guiding local micro-finance institutions to make loans for providing access to clean water and sanitation.

""Gary kind of had this insight years ago,"" says Damon to CNBC.

This #WorldWaterDay donate to @Water and give families water and time for joy, hope, opportunity and life.

""The municipality is piping water underneath their feet, they are just not connected to it.... So if you could front them the money for a connection to the system that exists, you are buying their time back. They can work at a job they will get all those hours back that they are waiting in line or all that income back that they are wasting that the middle class wouldn't have to pay comes back into that household. And so it was this idea he had to apply the concepts of microfinance to the water space and it just was a brilliant idea. These loans pay back between 97 and 99 percent,"" says Damon.

In 2016, Damon and White launched an impact investment fund to provide capital to these microfinance institutions they were educating with Water.org. In 2017, the impact investment management arm of Water.org became a separate nonprofit, WaterEquity. Currently, WaterEquity is raising money for a $50 million fund, seeded by companies, institutional investors, foundations and wealthy individuals.

The goal of the investment fund is to get a 3 to 3.5 percent return (plus principal) to investors — ""so that's better than a municipal, it is better than treasuries,"" Anne Finucane, a vice chairman at Bank of America, which made a $5 million zero interest loan to WaterEquity's fund, told CNBC Thursday.

For millions of low-income Indonesian families, water connections are unaffordable without financing. With small loans, women are empowered to give their families water at home. Less time getting water means more time for work. Donate to @Water and give time. #WorldWaterDay

The funds take the money, invest it through these local microfinance organizations and then return the principal with the interest to the lender.

""We take those funds and invest them in enterprises that serve the poor in terms of their water and sanitation needs,"" says White. ""The basic math on it is that every million that comes into the fund, over the seven-year life, 100,000 people get access to water or sanitation.... It is a truly sustainable and scalable way to connect impact investors all the way down to poor women at the household level so that they can solve this problem.""

Taken together, Water.org and WaterEquity have given access to clean water or sanitation to more than 10 million individuals around the globe.

Given a chance, people are able to take the access to water and really turn their lives around, benefiting themselves and their families. White uses a woman named Mama Florence from Uganda as an example.

""She took out a water credit loan and has a pump and water tank to store water in now, and she took that opportunity and starting selling water to her neighbors,"" explains White. ""She wanted to send her grandkids to school — that was the impetus behind all this.

""And then she went from doing that to growing some vegetables, and then she would feed some to some pigs that she had purchased to raise, and then she used the water to start making bricks and selling those. And then she built some small rooms where people could come and rent. So She just used water and this loan as a way to really develop her own life and get her grandkids into school.""

More than 163 million people in India do not have access to clean water, the highest in the world. It also faces several challenges on water resources due to climate change, says a new study by WaterAid, a global advocacy group on water and sanitation. India is followed by Ethiopia with over 60 million people without clean water. Nigeria ranks third with over 59 million people without safe water.

The report, The Water Gap - WaterAid’s State of the World’s Water 2018, warns that the global population without access to clean water has gone up to 844 million, “which is almost 200 million more than previously counted”. People who spend more than 30 minutes travelling to procure water are to be considered without access to water. It says lack of political will and finance are the primary reasons 11 per cent of the world remains without access to water. It adds that the neglect has already made 60 per cent of the word water-stressed, which means the supply of water cannot or will not continue to meet the demand.

Lack of political will can be seen clearly in India, which drew a Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Ground Water way back in 2013, but is yet to be implemented because most state governments are dragging their feet over it. Under the plan, the country will construct 1,110 million artificial recharge structures with an estimated cost of Rs 79,178 crore. However, in July 2017, the Supreme Court asked the state governments why they had not filed affidavits over whether they will implement the plan or not. This is worrying as the country depends heavily on groundwater to meet its drinking water needs.

The world is facing a water crisis, highlighting a big gap in access to clean water and sanitation between the wealthy and economically disadvantaged, according to a WaterAid study.

Entitled The Water Gap – The State of the World’s Water, the water access advocacy group’s report was released on Thursday to mark World Water Day.

“One in nine people around the world do not have access to clean water close to home,” and 60 percent of people live “in areas of water stress, where the water supply cannot or will not continue to meet demand,” the report said.

That amounts to 844 million people who have difficulties accessing clean water.

And “wherever you are in the world, it’s the poorest and least powerful who are most often without clean water”, the report said.

Eritrea, Papua New Guinea and Uganda are the three countries with the lowest access to clean water. In Eritrea, only 19 percent of people have access to clean water close to home. In Papua New Guinea, the number is 37 percent.

Lack of access to clean water has deadly health consequences, especially for children. The report said that roughly 290,000 children under the age of five die as a result.

“It’s deplorable that nearly 300,000 children under five years old die each year from diarrhoeal illnesses directly linked to dirty water, lack of decent toilets and poor hygiene,” Tim Wainwright, WaterAid’s chief executive, says in the report.

“We all need to step up the urgency around the water and sanitation crisis as current progress is nowhere near fast enough.”

Cape Town example

South Africa‘s city of Cape Town has served as a siren for organisations tracking the world’s water crisis.

The city is facing an unprecedented drought that began in 2015. City officials say people should use no more than 50 litres of tap water a day.

Cape Town relies on reservoirs that are replenished solely by rainwater. Observers say climate change is responsible for the lack of rain and other cities should be prepared.

On July 9, the city will reach “day zero” and be forced to shut off tap water for homes. Only communal taps will have running water.

“Cape Town is a wake-up call, reminding us that access to water, our most precious resource, is increasingly under threat,” said Jonathan Farr, WaterAid’s senior policy analysts on water security and climate.

WaterAid said the global community should recognise that UN global goals, which list clean water and sanitation, “are everyone’s responsibility to deliver”.

This could be accomplished by allocating resources from taxes and tariffs while increasing the amount and proportion of aid for water, sanitation, and promoting pro-poor policies that ensure access to water for everyone, the group said.","World facing water crisis, with one in nine people already lacking access to clean water close to home, says report.

Walking hours per day for clean, safe water was a reality for hundreds of children in remote Timor-Leste not too long ago. But now, community-led efforts have seen water piped into the centres of some of the country’s most isolated hamlets, and its children accessing good health and secure education. Find out how UNICEF is supporting a tiny village in the country’s mountainous centre now.

MANU-MERA, TIMOR-LESTE – Down a rocky trail, snaking up through the craggy hills of Timor-Leste’s mountainous Ainaro municipality, hurtle two young boys and a makeshift wooden cart. One pushes the other, who sits with tucked-up feet and a wide grin as the cart bumps and jerks its way heavily down the hill to the boys’ rueful waiting father.

“What’s the cart used for?” comes the question.

“Carrying water,” shouts the boy in the cart.

“Carrying children,” screams the other, breaking into giggles.

The wooden cart, when filled with jerry cans, is just one way the community in tiny Manu-mera hamlet used to carry clean drinking water from the upland stream down to the handful of houses in its centre.

Home to fewer than 100 households and sitting isolated in the high mountainous pockets of central Timor-Leste, Manu-mera hamlet could be easily forgotten in the emerging country’s development – but for children walking hours per day for clean water, risking illness and missed school, the quest for clean water is urgent and ever-present.

Now, with support from Ono City, Japan and UNICEF, the community come together to bring clean water to its children.

Water for health, family and future

Farmers Bernardete da Conceição (52) and Alfredo da Silva (64) live next to one of the new, community-built water taps that dot Manu-mera, piping clean water to the hamlet from an upland spring. They have seven children – the eldest of which missed out on school to help in the family farm and at home, including washing clothes and collecting water every day.

“We used to walk two, two-and-a-half hours every morning to carry water,” says Bernardete. “But now, it’s just quickly.”

The family has recently built a toilet at the back of their home, which is cleaned and flushed with fresh, clean water, carried easily from the tap. Bernardete remembers previously having to dig holes in the forest, where waste was just covered.

Their 12-year-old daughter, Aurora, is a diligent student in her final year at the local school. She says going to the spring to bathe and collect water every morning used to make her late to class.

“When we’re late, we can’t follow the class,” she says. “And if we ask what is happening, the teacher gets angry, and we are scared.”

“Students had to walk to collect water, then bathe, then return home to prepare breakfast, and they arrive at school late,” explains Tomas de Conceição Pereira, the Director of Manu-mera’s school, which serves 216 children aged between five and 12 years, most of whom had to walk to collect water before it was piped to the town from the spring. The school previously drew its own water from a well, which was often dirty, causing outbreaks of diarrhoea, fever and coughing in school.

Now, the school and local health clinic are served by a shared water tank, which connects to the school’s toilets and provides water for cleaning, washing dusty chalkboards, and even watering the school’s flowers.

“This water is extremely important for students and to connect with the whole community,” Tomas says, earnestly. “For many years we haven’t had it. This water ensures the children’s lives for the future.”

“It’s not the same as it was before,” says Florindo Pereira, a 42-year-old farmer, whose children attend the school. “We’re happy. We used to work long days in the field and not bathe after, because it was too far, but now it’s easy.”

Community-led solution is the only way

In the lively centre of Maubisse, a town just an hour’s drive away from Manu-mera, stickers adorn bright green thick plaster walls of restaurants and guest houses. “The home is complete with a toilet,” chirpy writing reads; part of an outreach campaign designed to encourage households to stop the dangerous but traditional practise of open defecation, and to install toilets with running water in their homes.

With UNICEF’s support, Ministry of Health-led outreach activities in Ainaro municipality have seen nearly all of the municipality’s villages declared open defecation-free – just three remain before the entire municipality, of approximately 60,000 people, is free of the practise. These activities are part of the government’s community-led total sanitation initiative, which encourages communities to initiate and manage their own water and sanitation programmes.

The municipality has committed to the national government’s ambitious goal of country-wide open defecation eradication by 2020. Clean, safe water piped from springs into hamlets like Manu-mera is a crucial part of this.

The Manu-mera hamlet built taps by engaging the community – the community ensures taps are well-maintained and highly valued. Regular monitoring by the local Water Committee members ensures communities remain committed to the initiative.

Of course, the boys at the top of the hill with their new cart don’t care much for this. All they know is a new toy and hours of walking saved each day. But they’re the children who will grow up with the clean water their parents were denied, and the opportunities hygiene, health and education unlock.

As the weak evening sunlight begins to fade, they drag the cart back up the hill for one more turn.","By Sophie RaynorWalking hours per day for clean, safe water was a reality for hundreds of children in remote Timor-Leste not too long ago.

Fresh off her inauguration, Rojas vowed to bring clean drinking water to all residents.

“Now we have water 24 hours a day, it’s clean and healthy water,” and every community in her district has a reliable source.

Water For People, a Denver-based nonprofit, helped Arani in central Bolivia, along with the Cuchumuela and San Pedro districts in the South American country, under its program called Everyone Forever to deliver drinking water and sanitation services to communities.

“Water is something that we take for granted here in the United States. It’s difficult to imagine what our lives would be like if we didn’t have that service.”

The group is an offshoot of the American Water Works Association, which focused on managing and treating water in the U.S. and Canada, explained Mark Duey, Water For People’s chief programs officer. After receiving numerous requests for similar help in other countries, AWWA created Water For People in 1991 to handle those requests.

As it got started, the group was working on a project-by-project approach without much strategy, he said. So in 2011, it created the Everyone Forever model to focus on specific geographies within the nine countries where they worked and to support local governments build the water and sanitation systems.

The governments need to buy into the projects, which can go from hundreds of thousands of dollars to millions of dollars for an entire district, said Duey. In Bolivia, for example, the local governments cover half the cost, he said. The partnership also requires monitoring the water and sanitation systems, done through an Android data-collection app called “Flow.”

In 2017, San Pedro was the first district in Bolivia to achieve universal access, where every family, school and health center had adequate drinking water and sanitation facilities. Most of the water facilities look like a spigot in a wall. Behind the wall, a well is collecting ground water and an electric pump is pushing that water into an elevated tank. A piped network coming from the tank connects the drinking water to homes, schools and clinics.

In addition to Bolivia, Water For People works with local partners in Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Peru, Uganda, Rwanda, Malawi and India. Under its current global strategy for 2017-2021, the organization decided not to expand into new countries and instead increase the impact in countries where it has established programs. Within those countries, Water For People selects new districts based on logistics for its existing team, trying to avoid hiring new staff or opening new offices for efficiency, and ensures the mayor or district councils are committed financially to the goal of universal access.

“Water is something that we take for granted here in the United States,” Duey said. “It’s difficult to imagine what our lives would be like if we didn’t have that service.” He added that it’s time people in other countries get that same experience.

WINDHOEK, March 24 (Xinhua) -- It is 11:30 am on a Friday and the sun was at its peak. The 39-year-old Motjao Mbinge and other villagers from Oukongo Village in Namibia's northern Kunene region endured a long walk under the scorching sun to fetch water from a stream.

The 10-kilometer walk to the stream has become a daily necessity if villagers are to meet their daily chores and livelihood. The stream is their main source of water.

""We usually rely on rain for water. However, during the dry days like today, community members from about five villages rely on the stream for water,"" said Mbinge, who is also a community leader.

The water is however muddy and unfit for human consumption. ""But we have no other choice but to utilize and survive on this water,"" she said.

Mbinge accounts for three in ten people worldwide who lack access to safe water, especially in rural areas, according to the 2017 Report on Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene by the World Health Organization and UNICEF.

The report states that about 844 million have no access to basic drinking water service, including 263 million people who are likely to spend more than 30 minutes per trip collecting water from sources outside the home.

Meanwhile, 159 million people still drink untreated water from surface water sources, such as streams or lakes, according to the report.

According to Mbinge, although boreholes in surrounding areas maybe an alternative source of water, water drawn from the boreholes is saline.

To cope with what they refer to as ""status of waterlessness"", villagers have since established strategies to source water from the nearest main town, Opuwo.

Those who can afford this, at times broker deals with car owners who travel to Opuwo to buy water for them. A 25-liter container would cost about 20 Namibian dollars (1.68 U.S. dollars).

""But this is unsustainable. How many containers of water can one afford to buy for a household of more than five people? How will that be possible in an environment where income generating activities and employment is scarce?"" questioned another resident of Oukongo village, Ishmael Tjaimi.

The muddy water is thwarting the villagers, who said that sickness has since befallen on their community.

The animals too have been affected, said Tjaimi.

Due to lack of water, livestock are shepherded to drink from a sewage pond in Opuwo, the main town in Kunene region, consequently bearing hazardous health implications along the food chain.

""We rely on our livestock for food and nutrition. But now, our goats drink from sewage ponds. Thus, when we milk our goats and feed our children, they get sick. So our only relief will be rainfall or the provision of potable drinking water by government,"" said Mbinge.

Wendy van der Merve, a health extension worker in Kunene region said that cases of diarrhea and cholera reported in the village and surrounding areas have increased, due to the consumption of unhygienic water.

""Lately, cases of ill-health due to unclean and unsafe water have also been recorded amongst adult villagers, which was a rare occurrence in the past. Formerly, cases of diarrhea were mainly reported amongst children particularly those under the age of five,"" she said.

According to van der Merve, despite efforts put in place to provide water purifying tablets to the community, it does not help much judging from the rising number of diarrhea cases.

""This is evidence that the community is in a dire need for clean and safe drinking water,"" she said.

Meanwhile, newly appointed Governor of Kunene region, Marius Sheya said plans are under way to inspect the state of affairs at affected villages as part of efforts to address their plight.

In the interim, as Mbinge and fellow villagers have carried buckets and containers back home. She said that until it rains, consuming muddy water is a risk she can't do without.

Their lack of access to safe drinking water remains as the world observed the World Water Day on March 22. This year's World Water Day was commemorated under the theme ""Nature for Water"" -exploring nature-based solutions to the water challenges faced in the 21st century.","According to Mbinge, although boreholes in surrounding areas maybe an alternative source of water, water drawn from the boreholes is saline.

Despite the billions of dollars spent on water projects, nearly a third of all rural water systems are inoperable at any given time; many more don't function reliably and provide unsafe water. Consequently, people needlessly die every day, and millions more unnecessarily suffer from poor health and lost work and school days.

The current crisis in Cape Town, South Africa, which is counting down to “Day Zero” when fresh water is no longer available through traditional sources, has heightened the world’s attention to the problem. But as World Water Day approaches on March 22, 2018, it is a good time to highlight the work done by a network of entrepreneurs that are dedicated to building water systems that are both scalable and impactful. The Safe Water Network was founded in 2006 by the late actor and philanthropist Paul Newman, along with a group of prominent civic and business leaders to address this significant global challenge. SWN’s efforts are guided by a simple premise - that properly equipped communities can successfully operate small water enterprises that provide a reliable, affordable supply of safe water. The organization also believes that households are willing to pay for the service through a modest charge, which covers operating expenses, including technical service support, and a reserve fund for long-term repairs.

The Safe Water Network has successfully implemented this social enterprise approach at scale, serving more than one million people in 300 communities. They have demonstrated the sustainability of their model to governments, private sector investors, policy makers and philanthropists.

Safe Water Network

Water entrepreneurs, like those that work with Safe Water Network, cannot work in isolation. By the nature of their sector, they must partner with government agencies at the local, regional and national level, as well as private companies that have business and philanthropic reasons for improving water supply. Honeywell, Ernst & Young and others are partnering with Safe Water Network as a philanthropic partner, but also because safe water is critical to ecosystems and major economic verticals like agriculture, manufacturing and transport.

According to Safe Water Network, there are several important steps that water entrepreneurs undertake in partnership with the municipalities and regions they serve. First, as with all successful organizations, they must have robust operational controls in place to ensure water quality and uninterrupted service. This has been difficult because so much about the sourcing of water is beyond their control. Secondly, innovation has become critical to building sustainable business models – from technical innovation around solar energy to power the water plants, to business model innovation around financing. The Safe Water Network has also constructed a platform for its water entrepreneurs and leaders to upload data and share knowledge.

Fresh water has been called the “new oil” because of its scarcity, its importance to industry, and its vital role in all human and ecological life. The crises in places like Cape Town and Bangalore highlight the need for governments to build robust infrastructure to supply water. And in recent years, we have also seen how innovation in areas like large-scale desalinization in Israel, can dramatically improve regions and economies. And yet, this is expensive and time consuming. Until then, water entrepreneurs and NGOs like the Safe Water Network will be successful because of their reasonable rates and reliability.

The Government of Rwanda and the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) signed the financing agreement worth $20 million (about Rwf17 billion) to support a water and sanitation project in the country.

More than 1.3 million Rwandans will have full access to clean water and better sanitation services following the signing of a new financing deal yesterday.

The Government of Rwanda and the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) signed the financing agreement worth $20 million (about Rwf17 billion) to support a water and sanitation project in the country.

The money is a consessional loan for 20 years but with five years of grace period, according to Claver Gatete, the Minister for Finance and Economic Planning.

Speaking to The New Times after the signing ceremony in Kigali, yesterday, Minister Gatete noted: “The project will ensure equitable provision of adequate, reliable and sustainable water and sanitation services for the population in the target areas, thereby contributing to an improved quality of life.”

Meanwhile, Germaine Kamayirese, the state minister for energy, water and sanitation, said the funds will specifically be used to support the rehabilitation, upgrading and extension of the water supply network in Kigali and itssuburban areas, including upgrading of Nzove water treatment plant.

“Part of it will also be injected into the construction and rehabilitation of Gihira II water treatment plant and rehabilitation and extension of water supply distribution networks in Musanze, Rubavu, Muhanga, Nyagatare, Huye and Rusizi districts,” she said.

She added that the support will also help in focus on the rehabilitation and upgrading of semi-centralised sewerage systems in Kigali, and the construction of a centralised sewerage system for Kigali and installation of sewers in the existing buildings in targeted areas.

The project will be implemented by Water and Sanitation Corporation (WASAC).

The entire water and sanitation programme cost is estimated at $262.32 million with the African Development Bank (ADB) injecting in $171.14 million, a loan that was approved last year.

The European Investment Bank has so far contributed about $50 milion in addition to government’s contribution of $20.68 million.

Access to clean water and sanitation services remains government’s top priority and we shall continue working hard with all stakeholders to ensure 100 per cent access to clean water and sanitation services, said Minister Kamayirese.

Presently, about 85 per cent of Rwandans have access to clean water and government’s goal is to achieve 100 per cent in the next two years (by 2020).

Why invest in clean water, sanitation services?

In 2004, the World Health Organisation found that investing $1 in water, sanitation and hygiene education would bring health and other benefits worth between $3 and $34, depending on the technology used.



Research done for the 2006 UN Human Development Report estimated that the total cost of the current deficit in investment in water and sanitation is $170 billion, which means 2.6 per cent of all developing countries’ GDP.



While it is important to invest in water and sanitation services, it is equally imperative to ensure the sector is well regulated and monitored for desired benefits.

Government last year earmarked Rwf467.7 billion for water and sanitation under a new policy.

The total funding of water supply policy implementation strategy is about Rwf337 billion to be used between 2015/16 and 2020.

In sanitation, the Government plans to use over Rwf130.7 billion in infrastructure investments over a five-year period.

Meanwhile, the OFID, Director General Suleiman J Al- Herbish, said the Fund is committed to supporting projects geared at reducing poverty and promoting sustainable economic development in Rwanda.

So far, OFID has financed projects worth $182 million, including supporting different infrastructure projects, energy, transport and now water and sanitation.

In addition, the Fund is involved in private sector financing, where it has provided two different lines of credit worth $25 million to Bank of Kigali and more recently, $30 million towards the construction of Bugesera International Airport.

CHICAGO – The 25th United Nations World Water Day is being recognized this week, and advocates are hoping the message that comes with it will inspire people to sign up for a fundraising event this spring that aims to make access to clean water easier.



The Global 6K for Water walk/run is happening May 19. Ashley Colquitt, director of events at World Vision, says it's a 6K race because that's the average distance that women and children in other countries have to walk each day to get water that's safe to drink.



""So you can imagine, immediately after they give birth, they are still tasked with going to fetch water for the family,"" she says. ""A child having to wake up at 4 A.M. to go get water, and then going to school, and do it all over again after they get out of school.""



Large-scale Global 6K for Water races are being held in Chicago, Seattle, Kansas City and Detroit on May 19, but Colquitt says there are smaller events being held in every state. A link to more than a dozen events in Indiana can be found on World Vision's website.



Colquitt says many people in the developing world are walking miles a day for water that isn't fresh at all.



""They were fetching water from the same place people were washing their motorcycles, and the same place where they wash the school bus, and the same place where the animals drink out of,"" she explains. ""That was the same water they were drinking.""

With the help of the South Sudan Red Cross, Mary and more than 500 community members in her village in Yambio now have access to clean, drinking water. Mary and her neighbours used to fetch dirty water down by a stream a half-hour away from her house and back; now, clean water is at her doorstep.

“The stream was making us sick,” says Victoria Richard, another villager living close by. “In rainy season, the water would get even more dirty and when it was dry, there would be no water at all.”

“Now that we have this borehole, we’re closer to clean water.”

The responsibility of fetching water is traditionally the role of women and children in rural South Sudan who often have to venture far distances by foot at least three times a day.

“Water is a major concern in these communities. We see that more than 90 per cent of the people fetching water are women and girls who must travel long distances,” says Michael Charles, Head of Country Office for the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent.

“Red Cross is here through the power of our volunteer network to help bring water closer to the communities to ensure that women and their families are healthier and safe.”

With the support of the Government of Japan, the South Sudan Red Cross is targeting 3.1 million people, including 560,000 children under five, to help prevent common illnesses in rural communities, including malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea. More than 5,000 people now have access to clean drinking water in through this project with millions more using safer health, sanitation and hygiene practices that keep their families safe and healthy.

In Papua New Guinea, only 40% of people have access to safe drinking water and healthy toilets, one of the lowest rates in the Pacific Islands.

Women and girls of school age generally assume the burden of water collection for their families.

A new project is will provide clean water access for tens of thousands of people bringing connections right to their doorsteps.

Bialla, West New Britain, Papua New Guinea, March 20, 2018 – For most families in the remote district of Bialla, in Papua New Guinea (PNG)’s West New Britain Province, where the dry season can last for many months, the humble plastic container can be a lifeline.

In this small town, owning a good number of plastic containers is essential for families living far from a water source because they are durable and importantly, relatively lightweight for carrying.

Bialla is a small district, 21 kilometers (13 miles) north of the provincial capital of Kimbe, in PNG’s north-east. It is home to around 13,000 people and, like most remote towns in PNG, the people of Bialla struggle for access to many basic necessities of life; particularly access to clean drinking water and proper toilets.

The strain on health care

The lack of access to clean water is a constant challenge for the delivery of essential services to the people of Bialla.

“Our biggest problem, aside from shortages of medical supplies, is not having access to clean running water and proper toilets here at the center,” said Sister Mangaea from the Bialla Health Center, which serves the entire population of the district. “Sometimes when there’s no water at the center, we tell pregnant mothers to bring their own water for use during delivery.”

While an underground water bore was built for the health center in 2015, it only supplies clean water to two outdoor tanks, which all staff and patients rely on.

The lack of proper toilets at the health center is also a major issue. There are just two pit toilets which are expected to serve staff and patients including children at the center each day. Both are more than 20 meters (65 feet) walk away; an enormous challenge for those with an illness or disability.

“Women struggle the most from the lack of adequate sanitation,” explained Sister Mangaea. “They wait hours for nightfall; just to have privacy to use the toilet. This impacts their health and puts their safety at risk.”

Women and girls bear the biggest burden

In many communities in PNG, women and school age girls are responsible for collecting water for their families. They walk long distances often across steep hills and rugged terrain carrying heavy water containers back and forth to their community.

For 13-year-old Rendela, who attends the Bialla primary school, this walk is just an unfortunate part of her daily life.

Rendela’s family, like most others, has several 20-liter plastic water containers stored in their kitchen and bathing area. Previously used for storing lard, fuel and farming chemicals, these large containers have become much-valued necessities for families in the community.

On school days, Rendela wakes as early as six in the morning, collects her family’s empty water containers and rides in the back of a truck for an hour to the Tiraua River; a pristine river that has become a life-line for her family.

“My house is a close walking distance from school but most days I’m late because I have to travel a fair distance to the river to fetch water and have my bath,” explains Rendela.

Returning from the river, Rendela then carries at least three huge plastic containers from the main road to her house; a journey that is all too common for girls her age in Bialla.

During the dry season water collection typically takes two hours, but up to four or five hours for some households due to distance and waiting time. To avoid the heat during the day, some women and girls collect water late in the afternoon, or very early in the morning, thus putting themselves at risk of violence.

Women and girls like Rendela are also carrying heavy loads of water: often up to 30 kilograms at one time. Aside from immediate back pain and tiredness, frequent carrying of loads has long term health implications.

Bringing water to the community

Under the PNG Water and Sanitation Development Project, homes like Rendela’s will soon have access to a new water supply system, bringing connections right to their doorsteps.

The US$70 million (PGK223 million) World Bank-supported project covers nine provincial towns and 10 rural districts across PNG, delivering access to clean and reliable water supply services for tens of thousands of people across the country.

The project is being delivered through the PNG Department of National Planning & Monitoring and Water PNG, and also supports the implementation of the Government of PNG’s Water, Sanitation & Hygiene (WaSH) Policy, which includes education programs aimed at increasing healthy hygiene habits, such as hand washing.

For the township of Bialla, clean running water will be sourced from the existing bore well at the health center, and distributed throughout the town using a small-town water supply system.

For 13-year old Rendala, the prospect of clean, piped running water running through her town is exciting.

“It will make me happy to have clean water from a pipe available at home,” says Rendela, with a smile. “It means that I don’t have to miss school, and I can spend more time with my friends.”

The PNG Water Supply and Sanitation Development Project is funded through the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank’s fund for the world’s most in-need countries.","A new project is will provide clean water access for tens of thousands of people bringing connections right to their doorsteps.

The NEWgenerator uses membrane filtration - similar to a coffee filter - to clean dirty water and convert it for future use.

“You provide the immediate need for sanitation, which a lot of communities still don’t have even in this day and age,” said Robert Bair, a researcher at USF and former engineering graduate student.

The solar-powered generator will be placed in informal settlements, or slums, that do not have proper sanitation systems.

“Slums are kind of the most challenging environments for existing sanitation technology so I’ll love to see these technologies applied to slums or informal housing communities,” said Bair.

Bair conducted the first field test of the NEWgenerator at a south India school for over a year starting in 2016. The device successfully recycled thousands of gallons of water.

In Durban, South Africa, the generator will work alongside a Community Ablution Block (CAB), which is a small facility containing toilets, showers and sinks.

The NEWgenerator aims to recycle water for toilet flushing in the CABs, which would cut down on water demand. It should also provide nutrients for fertilizers that will help local community gardens, creating a potential food source that also can be sold.

The team, led by Bair and Associate Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering Daniel Yeh, received a $1.14 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Bair said that this grant was essential to their work.

“Right now, outside of the Gates Foundation, there really isn’t a whole lot of money to support these new and cutting-edge technologies,” he said.

The NEWgenerator will be sent to Durban in mid-March with a group of four to five USF students who will stay for three weeks to help with the installation.

Lindelani Xaba, a prototype engineer from South Africa, will accompany the students. Xaba has been trained on how the system operates and will stay in Durban for about a year handling the day-to-day operations.

“We have covered a whole lot of issues that may arise,” said Xaba. “The fact that I was here while it was being built out was very nice because it gave me a lot of in-depth knowledge.”

The team is in the process of commercializing and mass-producing the technology.

“I think the ultimate goal is to make our way through this testing phase and get the technology to be really applicable to communities in developing countries that lack reliable electricity grids or don’t have sanitation technologies available to them,” said Bair.

They’ve already set up a start-up company at the Tampa Bay Technology Incubator called Bio Re NEW, Inc. They’re also working with companies in India and China to mass produce the NEWgenerator, and are seeking a similar deal in the U.S.

This may not come as a surprise to many of you, given the rise of health consciousness in the country. But then let’s rethink this—bottled water is not just an alternative to sweetened beverages like cola; it is an alternative to safe tap water.

Last year, when my water filter got spoilt, I switched to packaged bottled water as an alternative in the interim period. Packaged bottled water is one of the few industries that has managed to grow exponentially over the last five years in both volume and value, even as most other beverage segments recorded anaemic growth, according to data from research firm Euromonitor.

In homes with access to tap water, water purifiers are a necessity. In fact, some corporate builders now offer flats with pre-installed water purifiers. The scenario for the impoverished communities—living on around $4.31 or Rs280 a day—is more grim. They are forced to collect dirty water from open ponds and rivers or spend most of what they earn buying water from tankers, says a 2017 report by WaterAid, a water and sanitation non-profit headquartered in London.

According to WaterAid, close to 5% of India’s 1.25 billion people, or nearly 63 million people, have no access to safe water. This is the highest number of people in the world without access to clean water.

It’s not only access to clean water, but even clean air that is turning into an added expenditure. Air purifiers is another segment that saw stellar growth in the last couple of years, according to Euromonitor. This even as the larger consumer durables sector saw muted growth. Events like schools shutting down due to high levels of toxic smog in the national capital in November further drove home the point (or sale), at least in metropolitan cities. The high level of pollution has given a boost to sales of anti-pollution masks, nose air purifier clips, and even air quality consultants who visit your homes and tell you what the right machine is for each room.

The lack of clean water and air has wider implications—on life span, quality of life, medical expenses, school attendance, and worker productivity. Close to 140,000 children die from diarrhoeal diseases each year, after using dirty water, WaterAid says. Whereas deaths attributed to ultra-fine PM2.5 pollutants have risen over the past decade and are estimated at 1,640,113 annually in India. The implications are indeed grave.

This, then, is an even larger market opportunity. So we have companies like consumer packaged goods maker Hindustan Unilever Ltd, which has associated some of its brands with hygiene and environmental issues. As air purifiers too will soon become a necessity, its Anglo-Dutch parent Unilever Plc acquired Swedish air purifier maker Blueair in 2016. The company already has a water purifier brand, Pureit. Moreover, since 2015, it has been running a multi-brand campaign with its brands like Lifebuoy, Domex and Pureit that stress on habits like washing hands, using a toilet for defecation and adopting safe drinking water practices.

Consumer products are just one aspect. They are like putting a Band Aid when what we actually need is to look at solutions that allow our natural ecosystems to survive even as we industrialize and urbanize. For this to happen, businesses need to adopt sustainable practices—design products that are easy to repair, using materials that last longer and which cause the least impact to the environment.

The government too needs to step up in implementing policy measures. The country’s inability to manage its environment, health and ecosystem vitality has landed it a place in the bottom five on the Environmental Performance Index 2018, says a biennial report by Yale and Columbia Universities along with the World Economic Forum. India is at the bottom of the list in the environmental health category, and it ranks 178 out of 180 in air quality. Its overall low ranking—177 among 180 countries—was linked to poor performance in environment health policy and deaths due to air pollution.

Perhaps it’s time to do things differently. May be as consumers we can lead the change this time—ask the tough questions, walk the talk and put our money where our mouth is.

Shop Talk will take a weekly look at consumer trends, behaviour and insights.

Nearly 163.1 million people lack access to clean water close to their homes in India, more than two-and-a-half times those similarly affected in Ethiopia, which is second in the list. The other countries in this top five list are Nigeria, China, and Democratic Republic of the Congo.

At the same time, since 2000, India is second after China in the list of most-improved nations in providing water access, reaching nearly 300.7 million people compared to China’s 334.2 million, according to the report.

The report comes a day ahead of World Water Day, observed on March 22 every year.

Globally, an estimated 89% of the world population has clean water in or near home--an increase from 81% in 2000, added the report--leaving 844 million people struggling to access water. Today, nearly 60% of the world lives in water-stressed areas.

The latest data come at a time when a review of United Nations Global Goal 6, to deliver safe water and sanitation to all by 2030, is scheduled for summer 2018.

The challenges India faces include falling groundwater levels, drought, pressure of demand from agriculture and industry, pollution and poor water resource management, according to the report.

India’s estimated per capita availability of water in 2025 will be 1,341 cubic metre. This may further fall to 1,140 cubic metre in 2050, bringing it closer to becoming water-scarce, according to this 2017 assessment by the ministry of water resources, IndiaSpend reported on December 30, 2017. In the decade ending 2011, the availability reduced by 15% in India.

An area with an annual per capita availability of less than 1,700 cubic metre per person is considered to be water-stressed, and less than 1,000 cubic metre per person, water-scarce.

India’s restructured rural water programme aims to reach 90% of the rural households by 2022. Presently, only 56.3% of the rural population has piped water supply, according to this January, 2018 government response in Rajya Sabha (upper house of the parliament).

Women across the world spend nearly two-and-a-half months a year fetching water

The widespread global lack of access to water has been attributed to multiple inequalities including wealth, ethnicity, religion and cultural attitudes. But gender intensifies the inequality, the report stated. The onus of fetching water falls disproportionately on women and girls.

A woman collecting 50 litres daily, the UN-recommended amount per person, for her family of four from a water source 30 minutes away would spend two-and-a half months a year on this task, it added. Women and girls spent nearly 200 million hours every day or 22,800 years collecting water, according to this 2016 press statement from United Nations Children’s Fund.

One in four rural households spends more than half an hour walking to a water source, according to the Indian Human Development Survey (IHDS II), which surveyed 42,153 Indian households, IndiaSpend reported in June 26, 2016.

Wealth inequalities also contributed to the access to water. In Pakistan, 79.2% of the poorest and 98% of the richest people have clean water. In Bangladesh, the gap is narrower--98.9% of the richest and 93.2% of the poorest have access to clean water.

The 15-year-old Hopewell Valley Central High School freshman said the answer just “popped up in my head.” She would help everyone in the world have clean water.

Petrillo recalled a previous classroom discussion about the current global water crisis. According to the World Health Organization, 844 million people are without access to clean water, and every 90 seconds a child dies from a contaminated water-related disease. If she had a million dollars, these are the people she would help.

Then the pastor of her church—that’s me—asked her another question. Why wait until you have a million dollars?

“That’s how we started the Calvary Baptist Clean Water Crew,” Petrillo said.

The CWC youth group of Calvary Baptist Church in Hopewell is raising $12,000 to support a clean water and sanitation project for a hill tribe village in northern Thailand managed by the Integrated Tribal Development Program. ITDP is a nongovernmental organization in Chiang Mai, Thailand dedicated to providing and improving village drinking water, irrigation and sanitation systems.

As pastor of Calvary Baptist Church, I felt it was important to choose an organization that had a successful track record of project completion, fiscal accountability and sustained community relationships. I want these kids to care about making a difference in the world, but I also want them to learn how to do it effectively. It is important to choose organizations that have the largest and most lasting impacts on people’s lives.

Setting a fiscal target of $12,000 wasn’t the only goal. The small youth group also wants to raise awareness about the current global water crisis. “So we made a rule,” Petrillo said. In order to reach at least 1,000 people, no one can contribute more than $12 to their project.

Petrillo said they don’t want one person writing a big check. “It is more important to make this the mission of many, instead of the charity of a few,” Petrillo said, adding that if people wanted to contribute more, they could help by asking others to donate.

In order to reach their goal, the group needed to partner with other community organizations. The Hopewell Council of Churches has been a great support to their group — particularly the youth group of Hopewell Presbyterian Church, which has already organized several fundraisers for the project.

Another invaluable partner has been the Global Connections Club at Hopewell Valley Central High School mentored by science teacher, Dr. David Angwenyi. The club agreed to collaborate with the small youth group on a 14-day “water challenge.”

Students and community members are asked to drink nothing but water for 14 days and donate the money they save from not buying coffee, soda and other soft drinks. The challenge began in March to commemorate World Water Day on March 22. The day focuses on advocacy for creating and sustaining clean water resources in developing countries.

‘It was heartbreaking to see people traveling miles over difficult terrain just to fill a jug of water.’

Senior Jeremy Borges, who is a member of the Global Connections Club, said two weeks without their morning coffee would be difficult for many students, but raising awareness about this issue is important. Borges has traveled to Kenya with a student group led by Angwenyi. He has seen first-hand how difficult it is for some people in the world to have access to clean water.

“It was heartbreaking to see people traveling miles over difficult terrain just to fill a jug of water,” he said, adding that it sometimes took several hours to fill one jug because the only water source came out a few drips at a time.

Angwenyi, who was born and raised in a small village in western Kenya, helped found the Hopewell Keroka Alliance. The group supports efforts to promote health, education and infrastructure improvements in western Kenya —including clean water resources. He said creating partnerships with other groups that have a shared mission increases the ability to help because it brings in more resources and broadens the groups areas of expertise.

“Collaboration with the community outside the school is very important because it makes it more realistic and not just an academic exercise,” he said. He added that outside partnerships also provide opportunities for mentorship and continuing support.

“We want service to others to be a life-long experience for these students,” he said.

Freshman Jane Bellaus. who is also a member of the CBCWC, said another important part of their project is getting people to be more responsible about their own water use. At first, it was hard for her to imagine not having access to something that she has taken for granted every day of her life. But when she learned how difficult it is for millions of people to get clean water, she reflected on how careless she had been with her own water use.

“Everybody can make a difference by just taking an extra second to think about how you can conserve water by making small changes in the way you do things — like washing your hands,” Bellaus said.

She added that helping the villagers in Thailand makes her feel like she is making up for her past wastefulness, adding that it is a good feeling to know that she will be helping to change lives in a single village for generations to come.

Emma Bean is the youngest member of the CBCWC. The precocious six-year-old is a kindergartner who attends Hopewell Elementary School and has already made personal changes to her own water use.

‘People who donate need to know they are making a difference in the world. Even though it’s only 12 dollars, they are saving lives.’

She said she only runs the shower long enough to get wet then turns it off. She soaps up without the water running and only then turns the shower back on to rinse off. Her mother, Samantha Bean, said that Emma is quick to remind her not to leave the water running at home and is also quick to remind classmates and teachers not to leave the water running when they are cleaning up at the end of the day.

“I’ve told everybody in my class about our water project,” Emma said. “I’ve told my teachers and even my principal.”

Emma and other CBCWC members — 6th grader Sara Petrillo and 5th grader Kevin Petrillo — turned their last birthday parties into water project celebrations. Instead of birthday gifts, they asked guests to make $12 donations.

Anna Petrillo said the CBCWC is building a website and planning a number of events to help raise awareness and reach their goal of $12,000 — including bake sales, benefit concerts and a 5-mile “Walk for Water” event this June. The group is also trying to optimize their use of social media and hopes that people will share information about their project with others.

Anna Petrillo says it’s a sad and serious thing that people don’t have access to clean water and are dying from water-born diseases — especially children.

“People who donate need to know they are making a difference in the world,” Petrillo said. “Even though it’s only 12 dollars, they are saving lives.”

Residents rely on water from the Lubunga River, which is 10 kilometers (6 miles) away from the village. Water from the river is used for drinking, cooking, bathing and washing clothes and household items.

Years of using this unsanitary water source, however, have resulted in the spread of infectious diseases, including cholera. But the spread of cholera has been curbed – and local business is improving – thanks to a borehole recently drilled in the center of Lubunga.

More than half of sub-Saharan Africa’s water resources are found in DRC, but an estimated 75 percent of the population remains without access to clean water, according to a 2010 report from the African Ministers’ Council on Water. Due in part to years of conflict, the water infrastructure is damaged or has been slow to develop in some parts of the country.

Limited access to clean water poses a threat to the country’s public health. Diarrheal diseases are among the leading causes of death in DRC – they accounted for nearly 12 percent of deaths in 2012, according to the World Health Organization’s 2015 statistical country profile, the most recent available.

In Lubunga, the most recent cholera outbreak began on December 27, says Dr. Samuel Bosongo, head of the Lubunga administrative health zone. On January 15, when the outbreak ended, 92 people had contracted the disease, six of whom died, he says.

Shortly after the outbreak, residents began drilling a borehole with assistance from provincial government, making Lubunga the most recent beneficiary of the “Village Assaini” program, says Eugene Kikuni, secretary at Regie de Distribution d’Eau de la Republique Democratique du Congo, a government-owned water-distribution company. Through “Village Assaini” which means healthy village, the government, in partnership with UNICEF, constructs boreholes in remote communities to improve accessibility to clean water and improve hygiene and sanitation. So far, the decade-old program has reached 2,850 villages across the country, but officials say boreholes will be constructed in another 6,000 villages.

During a two-month period, 10 engineers supervised the drilling of the borehole, which locals often refer to as “moto pompe” and which goes 17 meters (nearly 56 feet) below ground, says Albert Bita, one of the engineers.

Having water flowing from a tap would be a miracle.

About 1,500 people now have access to clean water, says Roger Solomo, the village chief. Residents use water from the newly created source for household chores, such as cooking. Bosongo says this has contributed to a decline in cholera cases. Of those who contracted cholera during the recent outbreak, only one person still has the disease, and no new cases have occurred, Bosongo says.

Others are using water from the borehole to keep their small businesses running.

Joséphine Linyanya, a small-scale farmer, says that for years she would have to walk to and from the Lubunga River three times each week to fetch water for her crops. But the water was unclean, which sometimes stunted the growth of her crops. But now, she no longer has to trek to the river, and her crops are thriving, she says.

“The availability of borehole water has been our salvation, because we had had quite enough of clean-water shortages,” she says.

But some say residents are still at risk of contracting infectious diseases despite the new water source. Residents should take precautions when consuming water from the borehole, says Junior Bolamba, a health and sanitation expert.

“To me, the construction of the boreholes remains paramount,” he says. “However, people should bear in mind the need to boil borehole water sufficiently to make it safe to drink.”

""Finishing the job in Rwanda will be a resounding declaration of what can be done when compassionate people are united together to show God's love to those who are suffering.""

This task will mean bringing clean water to one million people over a five-year period. It's part of World Vision's ambitious timeline to reach 20 million people with clean water between 2016 and 2020. So far, the organization is on track, having reached nearly eight million people with clean water in the first two years of the commitments.

""While we are making tremendous progress toward our goals, we need to have a sense of urgency in solving this crisis. We know clean water saves the lives of children and transforms communities to achieve their God-given potential. Reaching one million people in Rwanda is well within our grasp. Let's show the world that we can solve the global water crisis starting in Rwanda,"" said Dr. Greg Allgood, Vice President of Water for World Vision U.S.

The announcement comes on the 25th anniversary of World Water Day. Stearns is currently traveling in Rwanda, meeting families in communities who don't yet have access to clean water as well as those whose lives are now forever changed because World Vision has brought access to clean water to their communities.

The need is urgent:

Nearly 1,000 children under age 5 die every day from diarrhea caused by contaminated water, poor sanitation, and improper hygiene.

Women and children are responsible for water collection in more than 80 percent of households in 61 developing countries; often, the walk is dangerous, children miss school, and the water is unhealthy.

Globally, 844 million people lack access to clean water and in Rwanda alone, 47 percent of the rural population is without clean water.

The progress is encouraging. In the past 25 years since World Water Day began:

Two billion people have been reached with clean water worldwide.

In the early 1990s, World Vision was reaching an estimated 200,000 people per year in just a select number of countries including Ghana , Mali , and Niger . Today, the organization reaches an estimated 3.2 million people a year with clean water. That means reaching one new person with clean water every 10 seconds and reaching three more schools every day with clean water.

, , and . Today, the organization reaches an estimated 3.2 million people a year with clean water.

World access to improved water sources has gone from 76 percent in the 1990s to 89 percent of the global population today who have basic water service, meaning access within a 30-minute round trip (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs391/en/).

""Supporting the Rwandan government's ambitious goal of 100 percent water coverage by 2024, we'll demonstrate global leadership by finishing the job, paving the way to do the same in other countries like Ghana, Honduras, and Zambia. Rwanda's leaders have made a bold commitment to turn their legacy from one of horrific genocide to hope and health. We are excited to come alongside them in this effort,"" Stearns said.

Anyone can join with World Vision in the effort to bring water to those in need. One way is by joining World Vision's Global 6K for Water. On Saturday, May 19, 2018, people from around the globe will walk or run 6 kilometers for an extraordinary cause, uniting in the world's biggest 6K for water.

This problem, in turn, drives many others—like the deaths every year of hundreds of thousands of children under 5 from diarrheal diseases caused by unsafe water and sanitation.

Private philanthropy has a long history of working on this issue, and despite frustrations and setbacks, donors remain on the case. Today, World Water Day, is a good time to take stock of how funding for water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) has evolved lately. Are there are new funders on the scene? Are grantmakers getting smarter and having more success? And how does WASH fit into the broader landscape of global health and development funding?

“From a certain angle there actually are a lot of funders, particularly small-scale ones, in the WASH space,” David Douglas, a principal at Global Water 2020, president of the nonprofit Waterlines, and a trustee of Wallace Genetic Foundation, told Inside Philanthropy.

A major challenge, Douglas said, is to get more funders “supporting not infrastructure projects per se, but other, no less critical, areas of WASH funding.” He cited, as examples, investments that lead to in-country grants to indigenous advocacy groups to strengthen deeper political will in a developing country, or support aimed more at long-term sustainability of water projects, many of which fail over time.

John Oldfield, a principal at Global Water 2020 with a decade of experience in advocacy work for global water security, is also cautiously optimistic. He told Inside Philanthropy that funding for WASH from private and corporate grantmakers “is trending in the right direction, but we need to ramp up both the quantity and the quality of our efforts if we are to meet the Sustainable Development Goal of 100 percent access to WASH.”

Oldfield said he’s seen a shift in how grantmakers in this space think. They are moving away from questions like, “How many wells can we buy for $100,000?” and toward “What sort of lasting impact can we have for $100,000?”

And he said that while the dollar amounts may often be small in relative terms, philanthropy’s role in making headway on WASH can be significant.

“Philanthropists are more flexible and agile than larger multilateral organizations, and are less confined to counting the number of beneficiaries and cost per capita,” Oldfield said. “Thus, they have an opportunity to focus less on hardware and infrastructure, and more on strengthening enabling environments, innovative financial approaches to WASH, and integrating WASH into other development sectors such as health, education, poverty alleviation, and gender equality.”

Another piece of good news: Both Douglas and Oldfield noted how diverse the funders in the WASH space have become.

“There are already a lot of private-sector funders in the space, often below the radar screen,” Douglas said. “There are large ones like Gates, focused on sanitation, and Hilton, focused on water. Then there are the corporate philanthropic arms of Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola.”

At the other end of the size spectrum, Douglas said, thousands of churches and Rotary Clubs are involved in individual water projects and are getting “more savvy” about ensuring each project’s sustainability over time.

Douglas said that thanks to Americans’ generosity, there is a lot of small-dollar funding going into the WASH space abroad, but it’s difficult to quantify.

What hasn’t happened, though, is the emergence of a new crop of major WASH funders—for example, from the ranks of the Silicon Valley winners now turning to philanthropy. At Inside Philanthropy, we’ve written about at least one celebrity donor who’s embraced this issue—Matt Damon—and about a few wealthy givers who’ve supported charity:water, like Michael Birch and Jack Dorsey. Otherwise, though, there’s not a lot of action in this vital space, even as new donors have flocked to other niches related to global health and development, like curbing malaria.

There are reasons that donors are often hesitant to take on WASH.

“Water is an attractive issue for funders, but it is proving challenging to significantly increase the quality of that funding,” Oldfield said. “Sustainable water solutions often require long timelines and a concerted focus on governance, finance, and institutional capacity building.”

Douglas said that one major challenge was how incomprehensible it was to many funders in the United States, where the average per-person daily water use is 85 gallons, that so many of the world’s people don’t have access to water.

One frustrating thing, Douglas said, was that many funders of global health are dealing with the consequences of poor water and sanitation—even as they ignore the underlying causes. They lean “toward investing in treatment of WASH-related diseases rather than prevention of WASH-related diseases.”

Against this backdrop, where could more WASH funding or new approaches make a difference?

Reaching remote communities and disadvantaged subgroups is one challenge, Oldfield said. “Donors might be able to reach a working family in a suburb of a large African city relatively easily. But what about that young girl living with a physical or intellectual disability in a poor, rural community of subsistence farmers in Central America?”

Oldfield said helping hard-to-reach populations will require a more concerted effort, smarter grantmaking, closer relationships with local governments, and likely an extended timeline and more financial and technical support in the short to medium term.

“It is not easy to reach the final few hundred million people, but that is the most important gap,” he said.

A more specific funding gap, this one singled out by Douglas, is to address the fact that many healthcare facilities in poor countries lack clean water and sanitation—an unthinkable situation in advanced countries.

“American donors would have a hard time finding better value for their investments than contributing to the growing effort to improve access to WASH at hospitals and clinics in developing countries,” Douglas said. “The situation is grave... and the problem has slipped through the cracks of world attention until recently.”

Douglas said he didn’t know of any more “serious and solvable” global health problem that was awaiting increased donor attention.

At the end of the day, how much rides on better approaches to WASH funding, and more efforts to fill these gaps? Douglas said that poor WASH conditions cause more than 20 diseases and an estimated 80 percent of illnesses in developing countries, including typhoid, cholera, dysentery, trachoma and schistosomiasis. That says it all.

It’s encouraging that, as of this World Water Day, some things have improved in the WASH funding space. But there is still a long way to go. And in a world where just 2,200 billionaires are sitting on assets of $9 trillion, one thing is clear: there's no shortage of wealth that could be put to work to ensure that all of humanity has access to safe water.","Today, World Water Day, is a good time to take stock of how funding for water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) has evolved lately.

52,http://eltecolote.org/content/en/indigenous-women-provides-clean-water-for-remote-part-of-nicaragua/,"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",El Tecolote,Indigenous women provides clean water for remote part of Nicaragua,"When the men of Wawa Bar—an indigenous Miskitu community located in the remote North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region (RACCN) of Nicaragua—sized up Shana Zamora Dixon, they doubted she would last.

“There’s a perception in our community that this work is for men,” said Dixon, who began building rainwater harvesting tanks in 2015 as a means of providing clean drinking water to her community. “They questioned my capacity, my aptitude … they said I would only last two or three days.”

But like her Miskitu people, who are regularly targeted by outsiders and profiteers for their natural resources, Dixon has persevered.

A married 25-year-old mother of two, Dixon has lived her whole life in Wawa Bar, which is only accessible by boat. Each day, a single boat departs from Wawa Bar at 5 a.m., bringing passengers to Bilwi, the region’s capital, and doesn’t return until noon. For her interview with El Tecolote, Dixon—who doesn’t speak Spanish but who communicated through an interpreter—travelled to Bilwi. It’s a trek that winds through rivers and lakes and can take anywhere between one and two hours, depending on the weight and passengers of the boat. And it’s the nearest place with a decent enough internet connection.

There are no roads in Wawa Bar. There is little infrastructure or steady work, and only one part-time nurse who can leave for days at a time. The Nicaraguan government, located 220 miles away on the opposite side of the country in the capital of Managua, offers virtually no help to these indigenous communities. And access to clean drinking water is scarce.

WaterAid

Dixon works with WaterAid, an international nonprofit founded in 1981 to provide clean drinking water and sanitation to some of the poorest regions in the world, which began working in Nicaragua’s Caribbean coast in 2011. With the region’s heavy rainfall during rainy seasons, WaterAid embarked on a project to build rainwater harvesting tanks to catch precipitation free of contamination.

“In Miskitu communities, there is not a lot of flow in the economy. And if there is any type of movement, it’s usually coming from the men, whether they be fishermen or farmers,” said Nathalie Fernandes, who works out of the WaterAid offices in both Nicaragua and Colombia. “And the women kind of don’t really have opportunities within communities. So it was done with that intention, to empower them and to allow them to also grow professionally.”

The first rainwater harvesting tank in Wawa Bar was built in 2015. Dixon became involved in the project after WaterAid recruited 24 people from the Miskitu community to train and teach others to build tanks. She heard about WaterAid from friends of hers who were working on the project and approached WaterAid and expressed interest in learning the craft.

“We identified her as one of the women with the most potential to work in this field,” said Eduardo Rodriguez, who is Miskitu and who works with WaterAid in Nicaragua. “She’s active and interested in this type of work.”

As of December 2017, 107 rainwater harvesting tanks have been built in Wawa Bar—104 for residents, and the other three for the clinic, military base and school.

“They’ve changed the lives of people in this community,” Dixon said, describing how children used to routinely fall ill. “Before the construction of the tanks, we would drink from wells. And those weren’t protected from contamination, and it would cause diarrhea.”

Dixon, who left school in the fifth grade, is a veteran, having worked on a total of 10 water systems. Today she trains others (mostly women) to build rainwater harvesting tanks when needed.

“When we come to the community, we identify people who have the need to learn how to do this work,” said Rodriguez. “We don’t require these people to be engineers. We train people who haven’t even completed elementary school. We don’t require our recruits to have a great education, all we ask is that they have a need to learn.”

The last tank Dixon built was for the Women’s Movement Nidia White organization’s Casa Albergue, a home for young girls who are survivors of sexual violence. Before the construction of the tank, Casa Albergue also relied on wells for its water.

“There is very little help,” said Rodriguez. “There are communities where we’ve intervened where we’re the only project that’s taken place in that community, they are forgotten, so to speak. They are communities with a lot of necessities, but other organizations and even their own government haven’t initiated any programs that create jobs in the community.”

Disputed lands

While there seems to be little interest in the Miskitu people, there is plenty of interest in the land where they live.

For years, the Miskitu throughout the coast have been involved in bloody land disputes, the result of outsiders encroaching on Miskitu land in search for timber, gold and cattle grazing.

“There are a lot of killings over land. The victims are mainly the indigenous Miskito people in the region,” Rodriguez said.

The Miskitu call these outsiders “colonos” (colonists). Rodriguez describes them as ranchers in search for land for their cattle to graze. When laws prohibit them from buying land, they lease it.

“But when they graze the land, they destroy the forest entirely,” Rodriguez said. “That’s why there is conflict. There is a lot of bloodshed here in this region. And it’s over land.”

These conflicts have lead to many Miskitu communities taking up arms in self defense. But that defense has also hurt efforts to expand the rainwater harvesting tank project from to indigenous communities like Esperanza and Tikiamp.

“That whole sector we couldn’t go in and continue our projects, even though we had started them, because of safety concerns for our people,” Rodriguez said.

Back in Wawa Bar, there is one person who is especially thankful for the project. Dixon, in addition to the many tanks she constructed, was able to build one for her mother.

“My mother needed to have a tank,” Dixon said. “I’m very proud of that. And my mom is really proud of me.”

The Supreme Court of India states that clean drinking water is fundamental to life and it is the duty of the State to provide it to its citizens as a part of the ‘right to life’ under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Clean water was recognised as a part of the right to a healthy environment by the Supreme Court in 1984 (in the case of Bandhua Mukti Morcha vs. Union of India). However, legality aside, the right to clean water is also imperative to secure India’s future, and especially as the country loses more children to unsafe water than any other cause.

The water crisis in India

According to Water.org, 163 million Indians are currently living without access to safe and clean water. The World Bank estimates reveal that unsafe water and lack of hygiene practices are responsible for 21 percent of communicable diseases in the country. These are also the third leading causes of diarrhoea, leading to nearly 1600 daily deaths in India.

The situation is worse in rural areas. Last year, WaterAid’s ‘State of the World’s Water‘ report disclosed that 63.4 million people in rural areas are living without access to clean drinking water, which is more than any other country.

Moreover, there are glaring inefficiencies in the water supply. Most of the rural drinking water comes from wells, hand-pumps, and tube-wells, as the scattered population is not ideal for a piped system. Even in urban areas, where the population relies on taps and piped water, the problem of wastage continues to persist while urban slums are not covered under the piped network. Therefore, there is an urgent need for innovative water solutions in India, considering that 100 percent piped potable water may be a little difficult to implement on a universal scale across the country.

Women, children, and economics: The unseen consequences

Lack of access to water is one of the major causes of the feminisation of poverty (disproportionate impact of poverty on women as compared to men) in India. Women, who are often primarily responsible for collecting water for their households, lose out on work and family and more importantly, their personal health. The existence of ‘Water Wives’ in Maharashtra is a prime example. Empowering women is critical to solving the nation’s water crisis. They can experience greater autonomy and independence and pursue skills outside of their traditional roles when they are not locked in a cycle of poverty due to poor availability of water. Even school-going children find themselves on the losing side as the family water-collection duties take time away from study and play. According to Water.org, there has been evidence of improved school attendance as a result of reductions in time spent collecting water.

Further, with the lack of safe water resulting in diseases, stunted growth, and infant mortality, the economic loss of the crisis is also huge. As per the World Bank, the annual cost of problems related to poor drinking water is about $4.2 billion or about Rs 26,000 crore. What is even more alarming is that the cost of water-borne diseases is almost exclusively borne by the economically deprived and the rural population. These inequities would only escalate unless mitigating steps are taken at the earliest.

The enterprise-linked approach

Providing equitable distribution and access to safe water, especially to those at the Base of the Pyramid (BoP), calls for an enterprise-linked approach. This finds evidence in the work done and the impact made by social enterprises such as Waterlife and Piramal Sarvajal.

Waterlife provides customised water solutions at a reasonable cost, sets up purification systems and sells treated water across 10 states at the rate of Rs. 5 per 20 litres. A major feat has been achieved in the Mandavgan Farata village in Pune district, where a community water purifier plant was proposed. Prior to this, the 35,000 villagers did not have access to clean drinking water due to the primary source, River Bhima, being severely contaminated by industrial waste. Waterlife is a first-of-its-kind outlet that now has a successful franchising model and is slowly bridging the gap between haves and have-nots in the underserved parts of India through partnerships with the government, Panchayats, NGOs, SHGs, commercial institutions as well as international agencies.

On the other hand, Piramal Sarvajal deploys another innovative and technological solution for creating affordable access to safe drinking water—that of Water ATMs. These are automated dispensing units, which provide communities with 24/7 safe water access. Additionally, these solar-powered and cloud-connected machines allow monitoring of the water quality and remote tracking of each pay-per-use transaction.

The Water ATM technology was also used in Rajasthan as part of Cairn India’s ‘Jeevan Amrit Project,’ where kiosks with Reverse Osmosis (RO) plants were installed in villages like Aakdada, Batyu, Bhakharpur, Guda, Jogasar, and Kawas with the aim of making potable water available at the doorsteps of the local community. More than 22,000 people in the state benefitted as a result of this programme and currently, 22 RO plants cater to the drinking water needs of the villagers. A striking feature of these kiosks is the swipe-card facility that works just like a Bank ATM. The cards come with an initial cost of Rs 150 and can be further recharged as per the villagers’ needs. Moreover, since these machines are portable, the facility can also be availed in the surrounding areas and hamlets at an additional cost of less than Rs 2. For this Public Private Partnership (PPP) model, Cairn India has undertaken a collaboration with the Rajasthan Government’s Public Health Engineering Department, Tata Projects, and the concerned village Panchayats. The revenue generated helps in making the kiosks self-sustainable as it is utilized for their efficient operation and maintenance.

The road ahead

Enterprise-linked approaches embody the new public management principle of ‘Price and Communitise,’ which has not only made safe and affordable water accessible to those at the BoP but also eliminated the long bucket-queues and waiting hours for the water tanks. Later, as such collaborative solutions are adopted more widely across the nation, ‘Water Committees’ will crop up as pillars self-governance and undertake the efficient management of the Water ATMs in their local areas. The key to ensuring the four litres per individual per day requirement along with maintaining high-quality drinking water standards is to leverage the potential of innovative and smart water solutions. The World Health Organisation projects an economic return of $3 and $34.3 for every $1 invested in water and sanitation, which only strengthens the argument further.

In the past few years, fetching water has become a full-time occupation for the villagers. “It is only March and water shortages have already begun here,” said Mansur Khorasi, who is with Dilasa, a non-government organisation (NGO) working to revive traditional watershed management and rainwater harvesting techniques in Vidarbha. Khorasi added, “Clean drinking water is a pipe dream for many here.” Even as World Water Day is observed on Wednesday, Khorasi estimated at least 50 per cent of Yavatmal is going to be affected by drought this summer. Yavatmal is not an isolated case. India, the fastest-growing big economy, is at the bottom in a recent ranking of countries with access to drinking water, published by WaterAid, a global advocacy group on water and sanitation. According to the Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP), 70,992 people in rural areas do not have access to clean water. The official Ground Water Resources Assessment says more than a sixth of India’s groundwater supply is being overused. This dismal picture is at odds with the NRDWP’s ambitious goal of providing piped water to at least 90 per cent of rural households by 2022, and universal availability by 2030. Experts believe a systematic approach and a concerted effort by the states (water is a state subject) can help achieve this goal. Safe Water Network’s (SWN’s) Country Director Ravindra Sewak said the goal of supplying water to every household by 2030 can be hastened by facilitating more public and private partnerships. Its iJal station project has provided over a quarter of a million people with daily access to safe water since 2008, and is a good case. It provides 20 litres of drinking water for Rs 5 in ATM-style dispensing stations in some of the most arid districts in Telangana and Uttar Pradesh. Rural entrepreneurs are trained to operate these stations; they earn up to Rs 9,000 per month, investing in all the fixed assets. SWN puts in the filtration technology, training, technical assistance and continuous monitoring. Each station costs less than Rs 2 million to set up and services 300-350 households.

Another example is of Amrita University’s Jivamritam, a modular water filtration system that uses activated carbon filters and ultraviolet radiation to render water safe for drinking. It is currently being tested at nine places in Kerala, and can be adapted to rid water of different, region-specific contaminants. Second — most topical since the theme of World Water Day, 2018, is Nature for water — is the need to sharpen the focus on watershed management, rainwater harvesting, and raising ground water levels. In Rajasthan’s Karauli district, one of the 100 most backward, ‘Water Man’ Rajendra Singh’s NGO, Tarun Bhagat Sangh, is trying to improve the depleted water table and decreased water-absorption capacity of the soil by setting rainwater harvesting systems. In Yavatmal, Dilasa has installed doha models — traditional water-harvesting tanks dug inside seasonal river beds in 175 villages. Seventy of them no longer need to depend on government water tankers — or, an increasingly erratic monsoon. Sitaram Kowe of Rajani village recalled how, six years ago, his well had water at a depth of 25 feet. In Kowe’s village, an ecological transformation occurred after two dohas were constructed on a nearby riverbed. “These tanks have ensured a plentiful water supply through the year,” he said. “But even more importantly, they have recharged the groundwater, and today, we have water at a depth of 10 feet!” A comparison of water levels in neighbouring villages in Yavatmal —Mangurda (where Dilasa has installed watershed management systems) and Sonbardi (where there are none) — reveals the difference that two years can make. In Sonbardi, water levels have fallen from 1.4 meters in 2016 to 0.2 meters now. In Mangurda, water levels in wells have risen from 0.5 meters in 2016, when the watershed intervention began, to 1.5 meters. Developing a sustainable supply of clean water, recharging beleaguered aquifers and harnessing rainwater are important, but changing how we, as a society, consume water is crucial. For example, in the arid regions of central India, farmers could be incentivised to eschew water-guzzling crops such as sugarcane in favour of multi-cropping, using indigenous and drought-resistant varieties of millets and cotton. Similarly, in urban households, reliance on water-guzzling reverse-osmosis filters can be reduced by installing community or resident welfare association-owned water treatment systems.

But the reality for Tongans is more complex, especially with climate change bringing more frequent and stronger storms.

So when Cyclone Gita tore through the two main islands (Tongatapu, pop. 75,416, and ‘Eua, pop. 5,016) with winds of nearly 200 km/hour and heavy rain, the islands incurred heavy damage.

The category 4 storm, the strongest storm to hit Tonga in 60 years, affected approximately 70% of the population. It left more than 4,500 in evacuation shelters and damaged the majority of dwellings.

The principal concern for residents is accessing clean water. Extensive damage to rainwater tanks and catchments means many Tongans are now reliant on bottled water for their immediate water needs. In addition, communal sanitation infrastructure (pit toilets and septic tanks), which most of the population relies on, were also damaged or contaminated because of the storm surge and heavy rains.

With funding from the Canadian Humanitarian Assistance Fund, managed by the Humanitarian Coalition, Oxfam will help approximately 17,000 of the most vulnerable and hard hit people. Oxfam was deemed the best-placed agency by the Humanitarian Coalition member agencies to respond to this crisis.

The NGO is coordinating its response with its local partner, the Tongan government and other aid organizations on the ground. Oxfam will provide emergency drinking water, repair and clean rainwater tanks and catchments and build emergency latrines at evacuation centres, schools and in worst affected communities.

The Canadian Humanitarian Assistance Fund is a joint mechanism financed by Global Affairs Canada, the Humanitarian Coalition and its member agencies.

Aminu Dayyabu, Executive Director, Katsina State Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (RUWASSA), says 1.3 million people have gained access to clean water between 2015 and March 2018 in the state.

He said this in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Katsina.

He said that that out of the number, more than 850,000 people were provided with clean water through the Sanitation, Hygiene and Water in Nigeria (SHAWN) project.

Mr. Dayyabu said that 20 local government areas in the state were participating in the programme, which was supported by the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF).

He said that the remaining 450,000 people were provided with potable water through the construction of boreholes in rural communities across the state by the state government.

“Over 1,600 boreholes with hand pumps have been drilled for the rural dwellers under the SHAWN project.

“Ten boreholes with hand pumps were also rehabilitated by the administration in each of the 34 local government areas to assist the people to have access to potable water.

“Twenty-five motorised boreholes were also drilled, all in an effort to enhance potable water supply, particularly to the rural dwellers across the state.

“Besides, six compartments of Ventilated Improved Pit (VIP) latrines were constructed in 240 primary schools in the state during the period under review,’’ he said.

Mr. Dayyabu said that the schools were also provided with water and other sanitation facilities to enhance environmental sanitation and personal hygiene, which would strengthen efforts to prevent disease outbreaks.

He also said that the agency would provide water and sanitation facilities for 261 schools, 121 health centres, and 1,334 communities across the state before the end of the year.

The country's waterways have drawn media attention for some time. The Ganges, one of the most sacred rivers in the world, is also known as the dirtiest. Trash, raw sewage, and even dead bodies have polluted more than half of the rivers across the country, leading to a crisis of both water and sanitation.

So organizations have taken action. Jaggi Vasudev, known as Sadhguru, is a popular yogi who started the Isha Foundation, a spiritual organization, in 1992. In 2017, he wanted to bring attention to the daunting state of India's heavily polluted rivers, so he embarked on a nationwide campaign to revitalize the country's waterways.

On a month-long mission called the Rally for Rivers, Sadhguru gathered supporters to join him as he traversed 16 states and held more than 146 public events across India. He stirred up bipartisan support from governments, media, celebrities, and corporations, bringing together 160 million people to voice their concern about the country's fluvial lifelines.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

His endeavor culminated in Delhi on October 2, 2017, where he proposed an official revitalization policy to the country's Prime Minister and Ministry of Environment.

The campaign gained popular international support, and was lauded as a model for a global ecological movement. Now, with World Water Day on March 22, Sadhguru will speak about the campaign at the United Nations.

Planting Proposal

After the fanfare of the campaign, the organization proposed a plan to plant trees that would cover a border two-thirds of a mile wide and stretch on either side of the country's rivers. Sadhguru says this is the simplest way to revitalize the waterways, since planting trees can increase rainfall and replenish groundwater supplies. Plant roots stabilize river banks to prevent soil erosion, while their leaves shade the rivers to protect them from low flows and high temperatures.

Although the project received support, this blueprint is not without issue. Some say it would take too long for the planted trees to become economically beneficial for farmers. The proposed tree buffer would not address threats like dams, sand mining, and deforestation, and it wouldn't cut down on the pollution that flows directly into the rivers.

""The dilution can help because you can have less concentrated pollution,"" says Sandra Postel, director of the Global Water Policy Project and a former freshwater fellow of the National Geographic Society. ""Generally, it's not going to solve the pollution problem.""

Some say that interlinking the rivers is a better alternative. This solution would connect Indian rivers through reservoirs and canals in an effort to more effectively manage water resources. But this, too, comes with caveats, as this also wouldn't stem pollution. A definitive solution has yet to be decided upon.

A Complicated Relationship

India is one of the most water-challenged countries in the world. Its rivers are depleted by over-extraction, deforestation, pollution, and climate change. Major rivers are shrinking and rivers that were once perennial now only flow seasonally as India becomes more desert-like.

The volume in rivers is slowly decreasing, from about 182,824 cubic feet in 1951 to only 54,561 in 2011. To make matters worse, only a small percentage of this water is usable for human purposes—a mere 33,125 cubic feet. That number is expected to decrease to 28,746 cubic feet by 2025. This, in turn, is killing species and destroying natural resources.

The Ganges, historically relied on for agriculture, and the Indus Rivers are often listed as the most endangered in the world. Both are threatened by rampant pollutants and plans to build dams.

Agriculture is India's economic mainstay, and water is crucial to its people. But with the way things are, the country could face severe water shortages this century. This could mean doom for many farmers and long-term damage for the ecosystem.

Views of India's rivers are complicated, and some traditional beliefs say the Ganges is powerful enough to clean itself. Hinduism, the largest religion in India, dictates that the river is connected to the goddess Ganga, who is described as having heavenly origins.

For the past 10 years, photographer Giulio Di Sturco has been capturing the Ganges River through his Death of a River series. Seven years ago, he traveled to Kanpur, India, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Kanpur is home to thousands of tanneries, which have used the river as a dump for chemicals used to clean leather.

Nearby, Di Sturco saw people bathing and swimming in the river. When he asked them why they were splashing in the polluted water, he got an overwhelming response that they believed the polluted water was sinking to the bottom and coming up purified.

""The water looked like oil, and it was going directly into the Ganges,"" Di Sturco says. ""They still believe that the Ganges has this kind of power to clean itself.""

1:49

Li Yutong, who completed the Rally for Rivers with Sadhguru's motorcade, had a similar experience 10 years ago when she saw the Hugli River in Kolkata.

""That river looks just like a cesspool, with all kinds of rubbish floating on it,"" Yutong says via email. ""But people bathing and praying in the river look completely unaware of the pollution.""

Flowing Forward

Around this time last year, a political idea emerged that the Ganges and Yamuna rivers should be granted personhood status. Intended to increase protection for rivers, this idea implied that polluting or otherwise damaging the rivers should be legally on par with assault or murder.

India's Supreme Court ruled this motion out a few months later, declaring the notion legally unsustainable. But this is not the first time rivers have been protected in this way, and it's possible the idea could pop up again for India, says Postel.

""The Ganges is one of those rivers where there's been an attempt to give the river a voice,"" Postel says. ""These are ideas that have been around for a while [and] it's a movement that's gaining some steam.""

As Di Sturco continued to visit the river in Kanpur over the years and photograph it, he gradually saw it become cleaner. (Read: ""India Stems Tide of Pollution Into Ganges River"")

""There is this awareness that is coming out,"" Di Sturco says. But where cleaning up the river is concerned, ""I think they need to be really fast. The Ganges is really dying really fast.""","Major rivers are shrinking and rivers that were once perennial now only flow seasonally as India becomes more desert-like.

Express News Service

HYDERABAD: The slum dwellers at Gun Rocks hills at Trimulgherry get water only for two hours from public taps. And, over 600 residents here have to fight it out everyday to collect water from the three public taps. Although it is the underground water that is supplied to them, residents here complain that often sewege from the nearby nala gets mixed with the water, as the pipelines are laid across a polluted nala. Women are forced to trek two kilometres for potable water.

World Water Day, celebrated on March 22 every year, makes no difference to their lives.

Moreover, in the absence of toilets or sewege lines, residents including women and children are forced to defecate in the open besides the nala. The slum dwellers allege that both Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) and the ward member have turned a blind eye towards their problems.While SCB maintains that the land belongs to defence ministry and has been encroached upon by the slum dwellers, residents refute the allegation saying that they have Aadhaar, voter ID cards and even house numbers.

G Chandrakala, a resident, rued that the locality has not seen any development in the last 15 years. “In the early morning for about two hours, bore water is released from the public taps and we stand in queue to collect water and store in drums. For drinking water, we trek two kilometers,” she said, adding that public taps go dry in peak summer and they depend on private water tankers.

For D Balaswamy, another resident, sanitation is their major concern. “We are forced to defecate in the open as we don’t have public toilets. There are no water pipelines and sewerage connections. Used water flows in the open turning into a breeding ground for mosquitoes. This leads to health hazards,” said Balaswamy, adding that in spite of many requests to the SCB for drinking water connections and sewerage connections nothing has been done.

On the other hand, ward member Bhagya Shree, too, claims that several representations were made to the SCB and to the chief executive officer for water connections.

“SCB is not responding and defence officials do not allow laying of pipelines for newly constructed public toilets. These 6 toilets are not usable,” she said.

SCB’s water wing superintendent, M Rajkumar, when contacted, told Express, that SCB will bear expenses to be incurred on supply of water by tankers in summer. “The entire settlement is an encroached defence land and SCB has no right to develop infrastructure in defence lands. We are supplying borewell water and public toilets are under construction,” he stated.","u mahesh ByExpress News ServiceHYDERABAD: The slum dwellers at Gun Rocks hills at Trimulgherry get water only for two hours from public taps.

The company operates a market-based, franchise business model that is sustainable in both urban and rural areas. The ATMs dispense water on a pay-per-use system using coins or a debit card. The franchisee manages the local operation. Sarvajal uses cloud technology to manage the operations system-wide. Franchises are operated in partnership with either a local entrepreneur or a local Panchayat/ Community-Based Organization. The franchise model helps to create new, sustainable commercial ventures within the community in addition to providing access to clean drinking water 24 hours a day, every day.

The company was founded in 2008 with seed money from the Piramal Group. The company receives funding and support from national and international benefactors including Nestle, Fullerton India, Mercedes Benz, Standard Charter Bank, Tata Motors, HSBC, and the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation.

March 22nd is the United Nations’ annual World Water Day. According to Sarvajal, “Even today, three-quarters of India still drinks untreated water.” This exposes millions of people to diseases like dysentery, diarrhea, or permanent fluorosis – and their debilitating results, including death.

UNESCO estimates that 1.9 billion people live in “potentially severe water-scarce areas.” Given current global conditions, this number is not expected to decline significantly. Rather, UNESCO projects that the number of people residing in water-scarce areas could reach three billion.

In addition, 1.8 billion people drink from unimproved drinking water sources that are contaminated with filth and feces. In fact, more than 80% of the wastewater generated globally flows back into the environment where it taints groundwater and streams.

Sarvajal has established over 1,000 drinking water stations across 16 Indian states. These stations provide affordable, safe water to more than 4.3 million individuals daily.

Of course, his speech from the ramparts of Red Fort drew praise from every quarter of society as he mentioned how lack of toilet led to many problems, including sexual violence.

Soon after, building of toilets began very rapidly. As the deadline ends this October, everybody has one question in mind: How much progress has the campaign made so far? The answer is remarkable, if data is to be believed.

More than six crore toilets have been built under this Swachh Bharat Abhiyan ~ a tremendous achievement for this government. However, little did they know that this movement against open defecation will bring forth many other sanitation issues affecting the society.

Be it sewerage system, drainage system, manual scavenging or cleanliness, all these issues are plaguing the Indian society for a long time. This scenario is true not only of rural or Tier-3 or Tier-2 cities but metropolitan cities as well.

All thanks to this movement, which unearthed how our cities or rural areas have been facing sanitation problem for a long time. This is what Society for Participatory Research in Asia (PRIA), a global centre for participatory research based in New Delhi says in their research done in two cities ~ Ajmer and Jhansi ~ on sanitation situations.

The survey covered 6,582 households in all the 60 wards in Jhansi and 6,220 households in all the 60 wards in Ajmer. And their findings are, to put it mildly, disgraceful.

Unfortunately, open defecation remains a problem in these two cities, with 13 per cent of the slum households in Ajmer, and eight per cent of the slum households in Jhansi still practising open defecation.

Not only this, 48 per cent of the septic tanks in colonies and 64 per cent of the septic tanks in slums have never been cleaned in Ajmer. A similar situation is prevalent in Jhansi.

Apart from the open defecation issue, the study also gave insight into other sanitation problems, including solid waste management, toilet facilities, water outlets and drainage, water supply and bathing facilities in both cities.

This is the story of just two cities; imagine what would be the condition in rest of the country? Keeping all these things in mind the only conclusion that emerges is, if the government really wants a “Clean India”, they will have to focus on overall sanitation development, not just raising toilet structures.

Inside the cities

Ajmer city is part of Rajasthan and is famous for housing Ajmer Sharif Dargah, a shrine of the Muslim Sufi saint Garib Nawaz. Jhansi is in Uttar Pardesh and is part of the Bundelkhand region.

The survey was done for six months in 2017 and its purpose was to assess the ground realities of the Swachh Bharat Mission ~ Urban (SBM-U) for both cities. It covered 6,582 households in Jhansi and 6,220 households in Ajmer.

In Jhansi, 83 per cent of the households were taken from colonies while the remaining 17 per cent were from slums. In Ajmer, 79 per cent of the households were from colonies and 21 per cent from slums.

The survey reads that in Ajmer, 91 per cent of the colony households and Jhansi’s 89 per cent of colony households have individual household latrines.

However, when it comes to slums, both cities lag, with 80-81 per cent households having latrines. It means, around 20 per cent households still defecates in the open.

The study also pointed out that most of these houses rely on septic tanks. But what is the of concern here is that 48 per cent of the septic tanks in colonies and 64 per cent of the septic tanks in slums have never been cleaned in Ajmer.

The same scenario is seen in Jhansi, where 86 per cent of septic tanks in both colonies and slums have never been cleaned. But what is shocking is that around 54 per cent of all households in both cities informed that their septic tanks were cleaned with manual methods. This is the condition of two cities, which were chosen to be for a smart cities in India.

“Rapid urbanisation has led to strain on civic services, in particular,sanitation services,” said Kaustuv Kanti Bandyopadhyay, Director, PRIA. “One of the bottlenecks in city-wide planning of urban sanitation services is lack of authentic data.

Municipalities often do not have the necessary capacities to generate updated data for realistic planning. This study is expected to fill this data gap in city-wide planning, with particular focus on the informal settlements in the city.

We sincerely hope that these results will be used constructively by all citizens of Ajmer and Jhansi to help make their cities sustainable and liveable.”

Beyond sanitation

The study also highlighted many other grave issues both cities are facing. For instance, solid waste management, toilet facilities, water outlets and drainage, water supply and bathing facilities, are all a serious crisis that both cities are reeling under.

The report says around 48 per cent households in Ajmer and 98 per cent in Jhansi generate hazardous waste. But there is no segregation of waste in Ajmer. However, Jhansi is lucky as 17 per cent its households segregate their waste for collection.

In terms of door-to-door waste collection, slums are left far behind. In Ajmer, 55 per cent slum households and 75 per cent colony households are covered.

In Jhansi, there is a little improvement with 71 per cent of slum households covered by door-to-door waste collection, but only 63 per cent households in colonies getting this service.

“I am glad an in-depth study has been conducted on the sanitation services available in Ajmer,” said Himanshu Gupta, IAS, Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Ajmer. “The identified deficiencies will help the municipality provide a higher quality of service to the citizens.”

“PRIA has provided critical input to Jhansi Municipal Corporation and is a member of the weekly officers’ meeting reviewing Swachh Bharat Abhiyan set up in order to improve the city’s sanitation services to communities,” said Pratap Singh Bhadauria, PCS, Municipal Commissioner, Jhansi Municipal Corporation.

As for water supply, around 95 per cent of households in Ajmer have access to government piped water supply. In Jhansi, a little over half the households surveyed (51 per cent) have access to government piped water supply.

Over 80 per cent of households surveyed in both cities, across colonies and slums, expressed satisfaction with water availability, even though it is available only for 3-4 days in a week, for 30 mins to an hour per day, in Ajmer and for 1-2 hours per day on all seven days in Jhansi.

Impacting factors

The big question is, why are 13 per cent of the slum households in Ajmer, and eight per cent in Jhansi still practising open defecation? In a conversation with PRIA, many people agreed that lack of funds is the most common reason for households not constructing toilets.

Other than this, around 28 per cent households in Ajmer and 13 per cent in Jhansi cited lack of awareness of the procedures for submitting an application as the reason for not building a toilet.

It means a little awareness about the application procedure could help one to build toilet. This is the scene even after four years of incessant campaigns and advertisement by government. Does money spent on advertisement flowing in right way?

The way forward

As mentioned above, the result of the survey can provide critical feedback and play an essential role in monitoring and evaluation of government schemes and its implementation plans.

After the survey, PRIA has put forth several recommendations for improving sanitation services. For instance, the emphasis on Open Defecation Free drives is not sufficient to eradicate this menace.

The campaign should involve many non-governmental organisations to keep a check on them. For instance, they can rope in Settlement Improvement Committees (SICs) and RWAs.

The appalling findings of sewerage cleaning is also disheartening. It indicates that a huge number of households never got their septic tanks cleaned or they did not know when it was cleaned last time.

Therefore, the municipality needs to urgently raise awareness about the importance of tank cleaning. Waste management is a critical aspect of sanitation service.

Ajmer MCD should launch a segregation drive so that waste can be segregated. Municipalities must advocate a three-bin strategy, where a third bin is reserved for sanitary waste.

As per guidelines, sanitary waste should be wrapped and handed over separately to waste pickers.

Municipalities must however realise that manually segregating of sanitary waste is often a major issue as it exposes those handling such waste to diseases. Therefore, safety equipment for sanitation workers is also of primary importance.","Not only this, 48 per cent of the septic tanks in colonies and 64 per cent of the septic tanks in slums have never been cleaned in Ajmer.

Mayor Rajab Mbonyumuvunyi (right) during the meeting with the senators in Rwamagana District. J.D. Nsabimana.

Lawmakers on Senatorial Standing Committee on Economic Development and Finance have urged district leaders to look at ways of ensuring universal access to potable water.

The lawmakers, led by Célestin Sebuhoro, the vice president of the committee, were in Rwamagana District this week to assess clean water distribution in the area.

In Rwamagana, only 56 per cent of the population is able to access clean water within a distance of 500 metres from their homes.

Water in the district is mainly tapped from Muhazi and Mugesera lakes by Water and Sanitation Corporation (WASAC).

Today, lakes and other water sources in the area produce 8,803 cubic metres of water in both rural and trading centres a day, while the district needs 14,230 cubic metres in urban areas and 30, 337 cubic metres in rural areas to achieve 100 per cent water access.

Senator Sebuhoro said that during their assessment they realised there were differences between district officials’ statistics and the reality on the ground.

“There are many water pipes but not all of them are functional. So, it is our responsibility to discover the real numbers on which to base recommendations,” said Sebuhoro.

“We, therefore, recommend the districts to base on the real numbers during their planning and not the ‘imaginary ones,” he warned.

Sebuhoro said that the assessment has a significant impact because it awakens districts, WASAC officials, other water distributing companies, and other stakeholders, to plan and carry out self-assessment of their water management strategies.

“We hope that it will have an impact, but more importantly, we are still carrying out the evaluation in various districts before compiling a report to be tabled in the Senate,” he said.

The committee has so far finished its assessment in Southern Province districts, six of seven districts in Eastern Province, and four of five districts in Northern Province.

All Rwandans are set to have access to potable water under the current seven-year government programme.

Sebuhoro noted that provision of clean water is key to hygiene, adding that access to clean water is a right.

Rwamagana District Mayor Rajab Mbonyumuvunyi said the district’s target on universal access to clean water will be achieved by 2024.

“The problem we had was capacity, but now networks are being worked on. We have increased our capacity to supply more water. The first phase will be completed by the end of this fiscal year,” he said.

He added that WASAC is now installing more and bigger water pipes to reach all sectors of the district.

“In the previous two years, we had construction of roads in town as a priority, but in the coming two years, we are prioritising bigger projects to distribute water and electricity. So we will meet the target of 2024,” he said.

Sometimes, various trading centres access water once in two days a week but the district officials said their plan is to completely address this.

“We will not tire until everyone has access to clean water,” said Mbonyumuvunyi.

Senator Chrisologue Karangwa stressed the need for water purity.

He explained, “Though one may have enough quantity of water, it is not enough, you can have more of it but with more troubles due to the lack of purity.”

Government’s target is for every Rwandan to have access to pure water in their homes, or at least access it in 200 meters in urban areas, and not beyond 500 meters in rural areas, by 2024.

“Everyone needs to understand the value of this element, water is life. It was in the 2010-2017 Government goals that access to water would be 100 per cent, it was not possible. But now in 2017-2024 goals, it is achievable,” said Senator Evariste Bizimana.

Championed by former US first lady Eleanor Roosevelt, it pledges UN countries to protect citizens' rights to life, religion, movement, and health.

But the right to a clean environment, which many today would view as being essential to a good quality of life, is not included. That's because the declaration, which has since become part of customary international law, was written well before environmentalism took off as a movement in the 1970s.

Now a United Nations expert is trying to change that. John H. Knox, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and the Environment, asked the UN this month to recognize the human right to a clean environment.

""There can no longer be any doubt that human rights and the environment are interdependent,” Knox told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. ""A healthy environment is necessary for the full enjoyment of many human rights, including the rights to life, health, food, water and development. At the same time, the exercise of other freedoms, including the rights to information, participation and remedy, is vital to the protection of the environment.""

Knox was presenting a report, called the ""Framework Principles on Human Rights and the Environment”, which contains an exhaustive review of existing national laws and international agreements. The report calls on the Human Rights Council, and the UN as a whole, to adopt a global instrument calling a clean environment a human right.

The report proposes 14 framework principles, among them the requirement for states to ensure a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, and for governments to protect those who are fighting for that right.

Without international recognition, it can be hard for citizens to lodge complaints when they see pollution

Existing definitions

""As Victor Hugo famously declared, it is impossible to resist an idea whose time has come,” Knox said. A majority of UN member countries already recognize the right in some way, and some, such as Bolivia, have even enshrined the right in their constitutions. Earlier this month, 24 Latin American and Caribbean nations signed an environmental rights pact recognizing the right.

But Knox says the absence of an equivalent at the global level has left this as an area of legal uncertainty, and means that there are no international laws to hold national governments to account. He wants the UN General Assembly to recognize the human right to a healthy environment when it meets for its general assembly in the Autumn. At its 2010 general assembly, the UN enshrined a right to water and sanitation.

A tool for citizens

Nick Meynen, an environmental justice campaigner with the European Environmental Bureau in Brussels, says having such an international recognition would help him pursue legal action around the world.

""This would reinforce future court cases, and strengthen court cases that are ongoing and that we support through our work,"" he told DW. ""For instance, there are class action cases in the Netherlands and Belgium about air pollution that would be helped.""

He notes that the Aarhus Convention, which was signed in 1998 between European countries and guarantees citizen access to information, justice and decision-making in environmental matters, has proven invaluable in helping citizens investigate environmental harm. But it's only helpful if those crimes are recognized by the national government. Having an international agreement that environmental harm is a crime against human rights would make a big difference.

Meynen says even if the general assembly doesn't take up Knox's call this year, the report itself will likely be used in future court cases. ""We see more and more engaged citizens who say it's no longer tolerable to accept environmental harm,"" he said. ""For example in Belgium, a court case over air pollution was recently started by civilians. It wasn't initiated by an NGO, just concerned citizens who say they've read what the level of air pollution is and it's not acceptable. This kind of report is what they need to make their argument stronger.""

He adds that international recognition will also help protect environmental campaigners from threats of violence or arrest. A recent report from Global Witness found that 2016 was the deadliest year for environmental activists.

As UN Rapporteur for Human Rights and the Environment, Knox's previous work is already being cited by courts. For instance, last month the Inter-American Court of Human Rights cited Knox's previous testimony to the UN in a ruling equating environmental protection with human rights.

Next steps

Whether the general assembly will take up Knox's cause will depend on how strongly the Human Rights Council backs his report. The Council is expected to adopt its official reaction to the report by the end of May.

Knox's term will end this summer, before the next UN general assembly, due to term limits. There is already talk of selecting a high-profile replacement who can push through the effort to its final stages. Some have suggested that the actor Leonardo DiCaprio should take on the role.

But even DiCaprio might find that changing these decades-old international treaties is hard work.","John H. Knox, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and the Environment, asked the UN this month to recognize the human right to a clean environment.

Though the state government has taken many initiatives in every department, but the achievement and implementation is a distant dream, it is learnt.

In Governor’s address during an ongoing budget session of Punjab Assembly is was stated that the government has added 18.76 Lakh household water connections in past one year.

The government has also provided round the clock water supply in 107 schemes and have handed over 4,948 village drinking water schemes to gram panchayats (village councils).

The government has installed 2,257 Reserve Osmosis (RO) systems in the rural areas of the state under a National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) funded project. In the year 2018-19, another 153 RO plants will be installed.

Similarly, the government is installing Arsenic or Fluoride removal plants in 429 most severely contaminated habitations in the state.

Also, under Swachh Bharat Mission (Rural) the state government has provided financial assistance to beneficiaries fir construction of 2,39,219 individual toilets. Sanitation coverage in rural areas of the state has increased free from open defecation.

The state government has also planned to provide water supply, sewerage and solid waste management facilities to the entire urban population.

A project with financial assistance from HUDCO is being launched in urban local bodies for providing the required infrastructure, it was stated in the Assembly.

Likewise, under the smart cities mission, major projects amounting to Rs 1,043 Crore for Ludhiana, Rs 840 Crore for Amritsar and Rs 1,133 Crore for Jalandhar have been identified.

Also, 16 cities of Punjab with a population of more than one Lakh were selected under AMRUT scheme for up-gradation of infrastructure works such as water supply, sewerage works and parks.

Projects amounting to Rs 2,766 Crore will be implemented as these have been approved.

Adding to it, the state government has notified 15 new local planning areas in past one year.

The work of digitisation of master plans has started and 10 master plans have been already digitised. An electronic system for granting change of Land Use (E-CLU) has been successfully started on a pilot basis and is now being extended to all digitised master plans.

The state government has also planned to introduce e-licensing of colonies in 2018.

This Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) involves wastewater management, air pollution control, recycling, waste disposal, radiation protection, industrial hygiene, animal agriculture, environmental sustainability, public health and environmental engineering law.





Environmental engineering is concerned with scientific and engineering principles for the protection of human populations from the effects of adverse environmental factors. This may include protection of environments, both local and global, as well as improvement of environmental quality.

It is the responsibility of the Marine Corps environmental engineer to study the air, ground and water and identify and analyze sources of pollution and its effects on their installation.





Furthermore, it is their responsibility to find plausible solutions in the field of public health and implement laws which promote adequate sanitation in urban, rural and recreational areas.





But, even more so these Marines inspire the community to live in safe and healthy environments by directing programs to control safety and health hazards in the workplace.





Much of the work Marine environmental engineers conduct is done at research laboratories. However, aboard Quantico environmental engineers can be found in the Natural Resources Environmental Affairs(NREA) headquarters conducting their research.





Aboard base these Marines can also be found at the water treatment plant, base facilities and recycling center conducting essential services that maintain a safe and healthy environment.





However, the majority of the work done aboard Quantico is conducted outside in Quantico’s natural landscape, including the trails, shoreline, ranges and woodland areas.





Maj. John Crutchfield, acting environmental health and safety officer, currently leads a team of two Marines with various environmental projects aboard base.





Since there is no official required training school for enlisted environmental engineers much of the MOS is learned through on-the-job training. Additionally, Marines receive various certifications to operate various machinery and handling and disposal of hazardous materials.





Cpl. Spencer Patterson, who was formally trained in the primary MOS of combat engineer, has since received the secondary MOS of environmental engineer after being assigned to Marine Corps Base Quantico





Where it is typically his job as a combat engineer to perform various duties accompanying demolitions and construction through altering, repairing and maintaining buildings and structures, his role as an environmental engineer is based upon the conservation of the environment.





Some of Patterson’s skills still translate from his combat engineer role to the environmental engineer position.This includes the pick-up and transport of hazardous and recyclable material, including ammunition on the training ranges by bracing and utilizing rigging devices, which aid in the transport of materials.





Then there are environmental engineering officers, such as Crutchfield who receive formal education with a background in engineering management.





Crutchfield was able to receive his education from the Air Force Institute of Technology, Graduate School of Engineering and Management via the Commandant’s Education Program.





At the university, he learned how to assess studies on various factors affecting the environment surrounding him and then how to evaluate the significance of hazards and develop and promote regulations which advise the community on proper treatment to prevent mishaps.





During 2017, Crutchfield, with the assistance of NREA, organized more than 250 volunteer hours clearing new nature trails and picking up more than 17 tons of trash and recyclables.





This was done during a week-long Earth Day recycling initiative to clean up the base’s natural landscape and create an environment that Marines and civilians aboard base could be proud of.





Because of the Earth Day initiative, NREA was able to raise enough money to build a Paintball Park at Quantico, located off McCard Road behind Butler Stadium.





The Earth Day recycling initiative also inspired a recycling program at Lejeune Hall to encourage the community to maintain a clean office space by further helping to reduce the rate of trash thrown away.





The environmental engineering MOS does a lot of work to keep the base safe and clean and all they ask is the base community help do their part by reducing the trash on the trails and other natural areas and recycle when possible.





They also ask when recycling or disposing of hazardous materials such as paint, light bulbs and batteries that everybody follow the base orders.





As Earth Day is fast approaching (it falls on Sunday, April 22), the environmental engineers and the NREA have already begun planning a week filled with environmentally conscious festivities to continue the progress the base made last year.

Where the environmental team is small in total force a community working together can make a larger impact.

The empty bottle was for her to carry water to wash up after using a filthy, clogged-up public toilet that made her retch every time she used it.

Her nightmare ended when Kozhikkode’s civic body installed an eToilet, an unmanned public utility that is sensor-based, self-cleaning and eco-friendly.

“Now I can go to work with much confidence. The dirty public toilet always nagged me and at times it affected my work,” Komalavalli said.

Designed and produced by Thiruvananthapuram-based company, Eram Scientific Solutions, the eToilet revolutionised public sanitation in India, where millions of people still don’t have access to modern toilets, especially in rural areas.

Providing toilets to the people is one of the pet projects of Prime Minister Narendra Modi who launched the Swachh Bharat campaign to end open-defecation across the country by October 2019 by building household and public toilets.

And Eram Scientific Solutions has played its part, supplying more than 3,000 units to 23 states since the eToilet was developed in 2011.

Driving the R&D in the company is civil engineer Bincy Baby, an MBA graduate from Changanassery in Kottayam.

“I always told my team that it is not a glamorous job. It is a service. For us, it is a passion and we dream of a tidy countryside,” said the 45-year-old director and mother of two.

Telling people they were developing a smart toilet initially drew laughs, but the twittering stopped when people gauged the team’s commitment.

“It’s based on an indigenous technology developed by our R&D team that uses a pre-fabricated, unmanned and automated toilet. And these toilets can be monitored by our team constantly using IoT (Internet of Things), the first such initiative for toilets in the country,” said Baby, adding that upkeep and after-service pose big problems in the usual brick-and-mortar toilets.

The Eram group’s USP is the close monitoring of all eToilets installed across the country by its executives sitting in office. There’s even a mobile app that directs users to the nearest eToilet.

Eram offers eToilets to suit all pockets, ranging from Rs1 lakh to Rs6.5 lakh, with the lifespan of the steel-based product being 20 years. It needs just 35 sq feet space for installation, with water and power consumption being minimal. It can also work on solar power.

“Our toilet washes its floors automatically after every five uses and are fitted with coin-based entry, voice help, LED indicators and censor-based water and electricity use,” said Baby.

“We want to change the country’s public sanitation scenario. Open defecation is not there in Kerala but in other states, it is still prevalent. But changes are slowly becoming visible across the country,” she said. Baby started her career in 1990 with the state’s IT mission, where she worked for more than a decade. She and a group of friends conceptualised the eToilet after she left the mission.

“We all came around and developed this idea. When funds posed a problem, we scouted for investors and it attracted the Saudi-based Eram group’s founder Sideek Ahmed’s attention,” she added.

Ahmed, who is also a philanthropist, bought majority stake and pumped enough money to make it a full-fledged company, which got funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for innovation.

“We are committed to creating a meaningful impact in sanitation and hygiene, especially for vulnerable women and children. We have groomed a good team under Bincy,” said Dr Ahmed, CMD of the Eram group.

With 300 eToilets, Chennai Metro has installed the maximum toilets and now IT giant TCS has awarded a contract to build 660 toilets across 300-odd villages in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. There’s another offer from Kuwait to build 100-odd eToilets.

Baby is, however, worried at the way India is managing its mounting waste.

“Most of our rivers and water bodies are turning into open drains. We need a comprehensive policy and mechanism for waste management. There has to be a durable solution,” said Baby, whose husband PP Ouseph is a senior scientist with the Indian Space Research Organisation at Thiruvananthapuram.

“After the flush toilet, the sector hasn’t witnessed any major innovation. We have to invest more in research and technology to develop a futuristic, environment-friendly technology,” she said.

“A clean and litter-free environment is not the sole responsibility of the government. Each of us must contribute and young people must be groomed to realise that cleanliness is next to godliness,” said Baby.","The empty bottle was for her to carry water to wash up after using a filthy, clogged-up public toilet that made her retch every time she used it.

The Government's commitment towards providing every Fijian with clean and safe drinking water remains a priority.

Minister for Infrastructure and Transport Parveen Bala reiterated the assurance while addressing stakeholders, students and the western community at the World Water Day celebrations at Churchill Park in Lautoka.

He says the government has consistently worked towards improving access to safe, clean drinking water from the current 78% coverage for Fiji and similarly for sanitation from the current 71%.

Bala says this has been achieved through fast-tracking new and upgraded water mains and expansion, particularly into the rural areas, much of these work included upgrades to infrastructure neglected by previous governments.

He says Government remains committed to ensure that we safeguard the environment and scarce resources such as water.

Bala says for this financial year, a total budget of $306.9 million was provided to the Water Authority of Fiji to facilitate maintenance, upgrading and development of new water and wastewater projects, an increase of $233.4 million from its $73.5 million budget in 2007 and he has no doubt, the figures speak for itself, when people talk about government's commitment.","Government consistently working towards improving access to safe, clean drinking water – BalaGovernment consistently working towards improving access to safe, clean drinking water – BalaMinister for Infrastructure and Transport Parveen Bala at the World Water Day celebrations at Churchill Park in Lautoka [Photo: Fijian Government]The Government's commitment towards providing every Fijian with clean and safe drinking water remains a priority.

MARY Nsofwa, 53, a marketeer at the old Soweto market in Kanyama could not hide her joy on seeing a new clean public toilet near the market.

She is one of the many residents of Kanyama that are benefitting from the Live Clean public toilet initiative that was recently launched in Kanyama near the old Soweto market.

Live Clean is an initiative developed with the support of the UK Department for International Development (DFID) through Kukula Seed and Zambian entrepreneur Mwila Lwando.

“The new toilet is affordable and very clean, even if it’s a fee-paying one, it’s worth it. I am very happy because the toilets are very safe and conducive because they are well taken care of,” Ms Nsofwa said.

“I have been doing business in the market for a very long time now and we had a challenge with the toilets. We thank Government and the Live Clean project for building such a clean and nice flushable toilet. We hope diarrhoeal diseases like cholera will be a thing of the past,” she said.

Another beneficiary, John Kabwe, and a Kanyama resident, shared that he has lived in the area for over 10 years and has never seen a clean public toilet in the community.

“I stay in Kanyama and I sell plastic bag. Normally, I sell them in the old Soweto market but the problem was the use of toilets.Usually when I want to relieve myself, I would rush to any hidden place. For me, that was better than paying for a very dirty toilet,” Mr Kabwe said.

At the launch of Live Clean, speaking on behalf of the Minister of Local Government and Housing Vincent Mwale, Permanent Secretary Amos Malupenga said the project symbolises the importance of providing clean and hygienic sanitation facilities to everyone.

He said the toilets which were constructed from customised modular containers were also environmentally friendly.

“Government is very committed to consistently improve the living standard of people in Zambia. A cornerstone in this commitment is to have clean cities with good sanitation infrastructure in order to create an environment in which people can thrive,” Mr Malupanga said.

He directed the Lusaka City Council and all relevant government institutions to provide full support to the project so that more fee paying public toilets could be opened in the next 12 months.

Co-founder of the project, Mwila Lwando said the Live Clean project will culminate into the creation of fee-paying public toilets and shower facilities in peri-urban areas of Zambia.

The company wants to take part in boosting Zambia’s socio-economic development by providing access to improved sanitation facilities.

The Live Clean sanitation system will also produce bio-fuel and fertiliser using human excreta. Water used in the showers and basins will be recycled for use in the toilets, whereas rainwater will be harvested for use.

“The facilities are not only a much cleaner alternative to existing facilities, but they are also constructed to improve the environmental impact of sanitation using a closed loop strategy and special waste tanks.” Mr Lwando explained.

Director of Kukula Seed and partner in Live Clean Niels Bojsen shared that the Live Clean project will further the empowerment of women in Zambia by providing modern, safe-guarded sanitation facilities that offer an easier, cleaner, and safer alternative to pit latrines and makeshift holes.

“These facilities are quite different because they offer security especially for women and girls, there is a fence around the facility which makes it safe for anyone using the facility,” Mr Bojsen said.

He noted that there is urgent need to improve the existing conditions of public sanitation in Zambia.

“Currently, 70 percent of groundwater in urban Zambia is contaminated and more than 500 people die every year from diseases related to poor sanitation,” he said.

For Live Clean, the new sanitation system will help combat diarrhoeal diseases like cholera that are common in Kanyama.

Mark Richardson, head of office for DFID Zambia, said the UK government is pleased to have invested in this private sector model that provides affordable and high quality water and sanitation facilities for thousands of people in Lusaka.

“In partnership with Kukula Seed and Mwila Lwando, we look forward to working with the Ministry of Local Government and Lusaka City Council to rapidly roll out this sustainable and scalable approach across the city so that many more people can benefit,” Mr Richardson said.

The DFID leads the UK’s work to end extreme poverty in African countries. They are ending the need for aid by creating jobs, unlocking the potential of girls and women and helping to save lives.","Live Clean is an initiative developed with the support of the UK Department for International Development (DFID) through Kukula Seed and Zambian entrepreneur Mwila Lwando.

KARACHI: The deadline given by Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar to clean the metropolis ends today, but the city remains dotted with heaps of garbage.

The deadline should have got dumpers moving across Karachi, given the chief justice had told the authorities concerned to go as far as collecting funds — if it required — to clean the city.

But only two days after the clock started ticking, Karachi Mayor Waseem Akhtar was found steering himself clear of the responsibility by saying it was not under his ambit to clean the city.

He said the Sindh government has taken the management of Karachi Metropolitan Authority into its own hands, which did not leave relevant functions with the municipality.

Even a Facebook poll regarding the responsibility of city’s sanitation suggests that the majority believes it to be the Sindh government’s job.

However, taking ownership of the issue, the provincial government did promise to make the city clean by the end of the deadline.



According to locals, work did start in parts of the city where heaps of garbage would be seen piled, following the chief justice’s demand. These areas they said included Gulshan-e-Iqbal and Gulistan-e-Johar, among others.

But cleaning Karachi in a week is not a goal everyone believes is achievable.

Being one of the main metropolis and an economic hub, Karachi has become home to people from different parts of the country and even the world, over the years.

The population kept on growing but little was done to make the infrastructure efficient to accommodate the rising number of people.

Roads and flyovers have been constructed to ease commute, but the other side of infrastructural development seemed to have been overlooked. There is no proper system to manage the waste generated by a population as large as Karachi’s.

Although there have been a number of cleanliness drives in the city carried out by people from different walks of life, there was still the need for the chief justice to point out the abysmal state of littering.

This is because such drives are often concentrated in specific areas, mostly in the south of Karachi. One of the reasons why these certain areas are selected for cleanliness drives is that they are easier to be cleaned of trash. The authorities concerned time and again work on the beautification of these areas as they are frequented by VIPs and VVIPs of the country, leaving them littered here or there instead of garbage piles.

The other factor that could have kept the city spick and span was the endorsement by Chinese authorities, who took to placing garbage cans across Karachi while also providing updated vehicles to collect trash. But a look in most of the areas would show garbage piled right beside the cans placed for the very purpose.

Cleaning Karachi in a week would have been possible had equal attention been paid to all its areas.

Besides, the city needs a proper system to dump the waste so that it does not end up in piles and heaps and eventually been burnt and causing yet another form of environmental hazard.

Above all, the citizens need to realise they can play a major part as individuals by utilising these garbage cans to throw trash rather than letting it stand on the section of footpath or road right beside it.

If such measures are not taken, such weekly and monthly deadlines and campaigns will come and pass but Karachi would continue to reek of trash.","Photo: FileKARACHI: The deadline given by Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar to clean the metropolis ends today, but the city remains dotted with heaps of garbage.

It can also expose your body to 13 times the level of bacteria considered safe, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data says.

According to a report in Hindustan Times, at a holy site for Hindus – the sangam (confluence) of the Ganga and the Yamuna in Allahabad – concentration of faecal coliform (FC), a bacterium that enters the water through the faeces of warm-blooded animals, is 5-13 times the permissible limit. The permissible limit for FC is 2,500 MPN (most probable number)/100 ml, while the desirable level is 500 MPN/100 ml, the report says.

This is the venue of the poorna kumbh and the maha kumbh melas, which see millions of devotees gather for a “holy dip” every few years.

The Ganga's pollution levels have been worrisome for years.

The alarming data raises key questions – what are its implications for us, why is the Ganga in such a terrible shape, and what is happening to Namami Gange, the Narendra Modi government’s much touted, flagship, river clean-up programme?

What pollution can do to us

According to the HT report, in Uttar Pradesh, 50 per cent of the 16 stations for which FC data was available for 2018 did not meet desired standards. In Bihar, 88 per cent stations fell below the mark.

The Ganga is the lifeblood of one of the most populated pockets of the country, passing over Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal in its journey from the Gangotri glacier to the Bay of Bengal. According to Colorado State University fluvial geoscientist Ellen Wohl, the Ganga river basin supports 10 per cent of the world’s population.

Every use we put the water to – drinking, bathing, irrigation of crops, consuming the fish it harbours – is a way for its pollutants to enter our bodies. According to an article in Newsweek, “Diarrhoea, often caused by exposure to fecal matter, kills 6,00,000 Indians per year, and waterborne diseases throughout the Ganges river basin, many a result of the polluted waters, cost families $4 billion per year. Sanitation and water pollution issues cause 80 percent of the diseases that afflict rural Indians”.

Hence, for people in the Gangetic plain, the toxic substances they put into the waters of the Ganga find their way back in some form or the other.

Namami Gange status check

After Narendra Modi became the prime minister of India, he addressed the public at a grand event in Varanasi, where he had contested from. He made an emotional pitch for cleaning up the Ganga: “Mother Ganga has made me yours. Perhaps these opportunities and good fortune do not come in the life of everyone. That is why I say that Mother Ganga has decided some tasks for me. And as Mother Ganga guides me, I will perform those tasks. Brothers and sisters, from her source to end, Mother Ganga is wailing, ‘Let any of my sons come and rescue me from this filth’.”

Narendra Modi had come to Varanasi for a ganga aarti after leading the BJP to a win in the Lok Sabha polls 2014.

A budget of Rs 20,000 crore was pitched and four years later, Mother Ganga is still wailing. The prime minister did begin the task in right earnest. The water ministry was named ministry of water resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenation, funds sanctioned.

However, in December 2017, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India found that the allotted funds had not been utilised. A report tabled in the Parliament said: “Funds amounting to Rs 2,133.76 crore, Rs 422.13 crore and Rs 59.28 crore were lying unutilised with the National Mission for Clean Ganga, various state programme management groups and executing agencies/central public sector undertakings (as on 31 March, 2017).”

While presenting the Union budget 2018, Finance minister Arun Jaitely had said, “A total of 187 projects have been sanctioned under the Namami Gange programme for infrastructure development, river surface cleaning, rural sanitation and other interventions at a cost of Rs 16,713 crore. 47 projects have been completed and remaining projects are at various stages of execution.”

However, Down to Earth points out that “recent data from the National Mission for Clean Ganga suggests otherwise. Only 18 projects have been completed out of 95 sanctioned (see table below). Moreover, not a single project has been completed in Bihar, Jharkhand, Haryana and Delhi”.

Delay in finalising plans and lack of coordination among various bodies involved are among the reasons for the poor utilisation of funds. But the BJP, the “champion” of Hindu pride, was expected to show more efficiency in cleaning up a river so integral to the faith of its most loyal voter base.

Why the river is polluted

For a large population of Indians, the Ganga is the source of economic as well as spiritual sustenance. The more populated towns in this belt are along the river, and it has to swallow their domestic and industrial waste.

Then, of course, is fact that immersing a dead person’s ashes in the Ganga is integral to the Hinduism. Faith and money often come together to ensure that not just ashes, but bodies too are immersed in the river.

Governments, over the years, have not been able to come up with a robust solution for treating the effluents discharged into the river. For example, in Kanpur, a major centre of the leather industry, up to 50 MLD of toxic tannery wastewater is generated daily, but the city has the infrastructure to treat only 9 MLD.

Environment is usually not a poll issue in India, and when governments are moved to act, they tend to announce Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs), which are expnesive to operate and maintain, but sound impressive. A few CETPs are woefully inadequate to tackle the amount of sewage discharged into the Ganga.

Another major problem is that the flow of the river is reduced to a trickle as it meanders over the plains. Less water means the concentration of pollutants immediately becomes higher. According to a report in The Wire, 80 percent of Ganga’s water is diverted at Haridwar and Narora for irrigation. Thus, while on one hand water flow diminishes, pollutants are added to the river.

The drop in water levels can have macabre consequences – in 2015, the river had revealed its worst secret, when more than 100 decomposed bodies had come up to the surface in Uttar Pradesh’s Unnao.

A people that worship a river as a mother goddess would be expected to treat it better. But this is where faith mixes with civic sense to create a dangerous cocktail. The Ganga lived in the heavens above, it came down to earth to wash away people’s sins. The idea has been taken rather literally by people, who seem to think that consigning everything to the Ganga relieves them of their responsibility towards it.

Devotees think that the Ganga is the mighty force that has sustained civilisations for centuries, and will magically continue to do so.

However, the magic, if there was any, is about to come to an end. It is high time the public and the government worked together to ensure that Ganga is treated like a river, and not a sewer.

Oh, and KwaZulu-Natal emerged as the province where the bulk of the country's serious economic crimes had been uncovered. By MARIANE THAMM.

While the DPCI’s ambitious “Operation Clean Audit National Government Departments and SoE’s and MoE’s” might have been rolled out in 2009 in North West Province and “implemented systematically in all other provinces” since then, evidence of its spectacular failure is the irregular expenditure by government departments of some R46-billion flagged by the Auditor General for the 2016/17 financial year alone.

On Tuesday DPCI head, Major-General Yolisa Matakata, and head of the DPCI’s Commercial Crimes Major-General, Alfred Khana, presented to Scopa a progress report with regard to the case load , court cases, investigations and matters before the Senior Public Prosecutor for a decision.

Considering that SoEs have been the centre of the universe for the endemic project of corruption that has come to be known as State Capture in South Africa, Scopa members were not impressed with the lack of detail with regard so current cases in the DPCI presentation.

What did emerge is that the province that had been blighted with the greatest number of serious economic crimes was KwaZulu-Natal with six cases in justice, two in SARS, two in rural development, six in health, nine in home affairs, four in human settlements, 10 in public works (ah Nkandla), 14 in transport, two in SAPS, two in rural development, a whopping 43 in education, two in labour, three in land affairs, one in social security and development, one in water and sanitation, seven in agriculture, one in correctional services, one in the department of legislature, two in GOGTA, one in trade and industry and 12 in the department of local government

Khana, sketching the national picture in relation to the feeding troughs of SoEs told Scopa that there were 78 cases “on hand”, 14 of which had made it to court, 50 that were still under investigation and 14 that were with the SPP.

With regard to Provincial SoEs, Sassa was responsible for 23 cases in the Eastern Cape, two of which had made it to court, while 15 cases were being investigated and six were with the SPP. In the Free State there were five cases against Sassa, three of which had made it to court while in KZN four Sassa cases had been reported, one having made it to court with two still being investigated.

One of the key focus areas with regard to government and local government corruption and a feature of “Operation Clean Audit” was, said the DPCI, “to contribute and to ensure that by 2019, 120 persons are convicted for corruption” and also “to contribute and ensure that by 2019, 1000 public officials are convicted for corruption or offenses related to corruption”.

While Tuesday’s presentation by Matakata and Khana might have been big on pie charts and pyramids, it was short on detail such as names, values and the number of cases presently being investigated. Scopa chair Temba Godi requested the DPCI to provide a detailed list at its next presentation.

“Visible action should be taken against those who conspire to use public funds. It send the message out there that you can run but you can’t hide,” said Godi.

Khana presented a power-point to committee members outlining that nationally there were 30 “cases on hand”, three of which had made it to court, 26 of which were still under investigation, while one was with the SPP.” The Estina/Vrede case was one of the three that had made it to court.

Nationally the Department of Health was responsible for the “bulk” (in terms of monetary value) of serious economic offences clocking in at the grand total of four. Health was followed by the Department of Social Development with one case, the Department of Rural Development with three cases, the Department of Home Affairs with one case and the Department of Transport with two, SAPS with six, the Department of Rural Development with one, Department of Education with four, Correctional Services with one, Mineral Resources with three, Cultural Affairs and Sport with three.

Asked by committee members why some cases took so long to come to court Khana replied “there are lots of cases lying with prosecutors for long periods. I have personally taken that up”.

Matakata said while the DPCI did not have challenges with funding it did have problems with regard to the retention of staff.

“We have a loss of members. The DPCI requires specialised skills. We have lost a lot of members over the years and our problem is we could not advertise for a structure that was not approved. That structure was only approved in February last year. Also there are other labour challenges with labour organisations.”

(Matakata is referring here to the illegal appointment of Lieutenant General Berning Ntlemeza which was later overturned by the courts.)

Asked why the DPCI was haemorrhaging staff Matakata said: “Members are getting greener pastures in the private sector, municipalities and local government are offering them better packages. Some of them have retired but we have lost the bulk of members to the private sector.”

Khana alarmingly told the committee that some of the corruption and serious economic crime cases were dealt with “internally”, a process to which “we are not privy”.

He also stated that the bulk of bases reported to the DPCI were from lower ranking officials and whistle-blowers and not Directors General.

This would suggest that these Directors General, as accounting officers are flouting the Public Finance Management Act with apparent impunity and without fear of repercussion.

He said that departments also often contracted private investigations into corruption and that these investigations often presented “findings and opinions” not based on facts or interviews with those implicated.

Khana’s comment would seem to mirror events that took place at SARS and the four investigations into the alleged “rogue unit” the most controversial of which was conducted by KMPG. KMPG later publicly withdrew the findings and recommendations of the “SARS Report” as well as paid back the R23-million it had cost South African taxpayers.

The Commercial Crimes head said some departments would tell Parliament that they had reported alleged corruption to the DPCI when in fact they had only provided a flimsy, often three-page “section 34 report” that “says nothing”. This was done, said Khana, in order to comply with the most basic statutory requirements.

“In fact we should charge these people with an abuse of process. It is part of the problem. It prolongs the process of getting information from the complainant.”

Asked whether the NPA was hindering DPCI investigations Matakata would not be drawn saying only that there were some cases that have been with the NPA for over a year.

Khana said the Commercial Crimes unit did use consultants and accountants for those cases where it needed a cash flow analysis to be done and that these service providers were appointed through the normal supply chain management process.

Godi asked Matakata and Khana to provide a detailed list, within two weeks, to Scopa “so we can see how fast or how slow you are moving”. He also asked for the names categories of public officials who had been charged and convicted. DM

By | Published: 12:53 am 1:51 pm

Hyderabad: Among the several components that are being planned under complete health profile initiative of the population in Telangana, which was announced by Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao, health authorities here are looking to introduce unique tests in the screening programme.

In addition to offering standard diagnosis facilities for hypertension and diabetes, for the first time in the State, health officials are planning to introduce screening programmes for oral hygiene, management of hearing related ailments and even conducting basic mental health evaluation.

Authorities are hoping to conduct all such basic evaluations at the sub-centre and primary health centre levels, which are the peripheral outposts of the healthcare system. Patients will be screened at primary level for a host of ailments and depending on their medical condition and treatment required, they will be referred to a higher level of healthcare institution.

Senior health officials here have acknowledged that there was also a need to go beyond just preparing the health profile of the population by offering treatment options to identified patients.

Before launching the initiative of massive health profile, charting out protocols, action plans and management algorithms for various medical conditions is underway.

At the primary health centre level, fixed day clinics for hearing care, oral health, mental health and vision care will be introduced. At primary health centres and community health centres, healthcare providers will conduct basic hearing tests, mental health evaluation and oral health facilities.

Special mental health centres will be set up at Community Health Centre (CHC) level where conditions such as depression, anxiety, Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) will be diagnosed. Later, these centres, which will receive patients from PHCs and sub-centres, will offer counselling and further assessment before referring them to area and district hospitals for therapy.

Basic dental services such as scaling, root canal and dental decay are being planned at CHC level while dental implants, complicated root canal and scaling techniques will be attempted at area and district hospitals.

Special drive for NCD ailments

For the management of diabetes, the health authorities have decided to conduct A1C tests that provide information about a person’s average level of blood sugar levels over the past three months.

To measure levels of hypertension and diabetes and later, to provide specific services for management, in collaboration with Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), State health officials will also launch supply of drugs for diabetics and blood pressure. Special medicine kits for chronic diabetics and hypertension patients are expected to arrive from MOHFW for distribution among patients here.

The treatment options will be offered to patients under Aarogyasri, insurance schemes of RTC, Railways, ESIC, CGHS and Aarogyabhadratha schemes.

Healthcare profile to help tackle NCDs

The proposed heathcare profile of the entire State will go a long way in extending vital medical services, especially management of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) among patients.

The initiative will also be able to pinpoint the burden of disease that falls under the broad category of NCDs, senior State-health officials argue.

There are several studies that indicate that NCDs, caused due to present-day lifestyle choices and environmental factors, are by and large on the rise in the State.

The disease burden report of Telangana, which was released by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) last year, indicated the vice-like grip of lifestyle diseases over the general population.

According to the disease burden report of ICMR, between 1990 and 2016, there has been a swift shift from traditional ailments such as measles, diarrhoea and vector-borne ailments such as malaria to lifestyle-related conditions such as cardiac ailments, pulmonary or respiratory ailments, strokes and even anaemia due to iron deficiency.

Disease burden is the impact of a health problem that is measured by financial cost, mortality, morbidity and other indicators.

In 2016, the Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) became the number one cause of death between the age group of 30 years and 70 years in the State.

For the age group between 40 years and 70 years in the State, cardiovascular diseases and chronic respiratory ailments also formed the largest chunk of group of ailments that have caused morbidity in 2016.

The disease burden report said risky dietary habits, hypertension, air-pollution, high cholesterol, tobacco and high BMI are the top reasons for the rise of NCDs in the State.

Quite contrastingly, in 1990s, unsafe water, lack of sanitation and washing hands were the top reasons for the surge in ailments. Reflecting the present-day lifestyle and eating habits, the ICMR report said back in 1990, high cholesterol and Body Mass Index (BMI) were not at all the high risks conditions in the State.","Authorities are hoping to conduct all such basic evaluations at the sub-centre and primary health centre levels, which are the peripheral outposts of the healthcare system.

The practice, he said, comes with its own health and environmental hazards, citing the recurrent incidence of Cholera in the country, a disease caused mainly by the unhygienic exposure of faecal waste.

Addressing a community sensitization durbar at Aboabo Number One in the Asokore-Mampong Municipality, Mr Townsley said it was important that Ghanaians changed their attitude to improve sanitation in communities.

A study by the UNICEF estimates that at least one out of five Ghanaians defecated openly, and that only 14 percent of the population had access to improved sanitation.

The nation, according to the World Bank, loses an average of US$79 million annually due to open defecation, and is classified among 34 countries with the highest open defecation rates of 15 per cent.

The durbar, organized by Clean Team Ghana, aimed at educating residents of the area, one of the suburbs in the Municipality with the highest concentration of slums, to refrain from open defecation.

As part of the programme, the company also demonstrated to the participants how to use a mobile toilet facility it had developed, and currently, being distributed freely to underprivileged communities.

Mr. Townsley disclosed that his company had over the last two years distributed more than 1, 600 of the facility to some communities across the country.

He said they were hoping to distribute 10, 000 of such facilities by 2020 to provide improved sanitation to the citizenry.","Mr. Peter Townsley, out-going Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Clean Team Ghana, a sanitation-oriented company, has stressed the need for increased education campaign to end open defecation.

""I want a neat and clean Karachi within a week,"" CJ Nisar ordered while hearing a citizen's rights case concerning Sindh's water and sewerage problems in the Supreme Court's Karachi registry.

During the proceedings, Justice Nisar recalled that Mayor Waseem Akhtar was supposed to resolve the garbage issue. He ordered Akhtar to explain who was responsible for removing trash from the city.

The city mayor, who was present for the proceedings, put the onus of responsibility on the provincial government, reiterating his earlier stance that all his powers in this regard had been shifted to the government.

""The District Municipal Corporations (DMC) are responsible for garbage collection and disposal, and all DMCs work under the provincial government,"" he explained.

The provincial chief secretary, also present, seconded the mayor and told the court that 4.5 tonnes of garbage are left to rot on the city's streets on a daily basis.

He also told the court that the process of garbage removal from roads had been initiated. ""The entire system of garbage collection and disposal has been made computerised,"" he claimed. He added that four contractors tasked with garbage collection were also operating in the city.

""Why has this improved system then not been able to yield results,"" Justice Nisar asked the secretary, before directing him to take measures for creating awareness among the citizenry on where to dispose of their trash.

The city mayor, on the other hand strongly criticised the provincial government, saying that Karachi has been ""ruined"" over the past 10 years.

""There are garbage heaps everywhere and hospitals are filled with patients,"" he said, demanding that revenue resources be provided to the local government setup.

The chief justice, however, directed the mayor to ensure cleanliness even if he was forced to collect alms for this.

""I don't know who is supposed to clear out the filth from this city but I don't want to see it again,"" he stated.

He also directed Akhtar not to indulge in politics as he had received votes to serve the citizens, not for scoring points.

The chief justice then praised the commission he had formed to look into Sindh's water woes, and directed it to take up the issue of garbage disposal as well.

The Sindh Home Department, on the recommendations of the Supreme Court-appointed water commission, had recently banned the dumping of household, industrial, commercial and hospital waste in the open spaces of residential and commercial areas.

Toshiro Muto, the CEO of the organizing committee for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, spoke following a meeting of the organization's executive board.

Last year, E.coli concentrations were found to be 21 times above the accepted limit in the Odaiba area of Tokyo Bay, the venue for triathlon and marathon swimming.

Fecal coliform bacteria were also detected.

Officials have blamed much of the problem on heavy rains last year, a surprise sanitation problem in a country known for cleanliness. Organizers say underwater screens will be experimented with this year.

""We are going to put in place some special filtering screens in the water to shield any impurities,"" Muto said. ""We think that's probably one of the effective measures we can take.""

Tests carried out last year showed water-quality standards required for marathon swimming were met on only 10 of 26 days — and only six of 26 days for triathlon.

Muto said organizers would ""make sure that water quality is at a high level.""

The International Olympic Committee has mentioned water quality as one of Tokyo's few problems.

The 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics were plagued by severe pollution in Guanabara Bay, the venue for sailing. Rio dumps much of its untreated sewage into the sprawling bay, and avoiding floating debris was a major problem for sailors.

Muto also said four companies that have been banned by the Tokyo metropolitan government for bid rigging would not be involved in future tenders on Olympic projects.

Tokyo prosecutors pressed charges Friday against the four companies for allegedly colluding on bids for a high-speed train line. The four builders — Taisei Corp., Kajima Corp., Obayashi Corp., and Shimizu Corp. — are also major contractors on Tokyo Olympic projects.

""For the time being, we will refrain from offering (new) contracts to the four companies,"" Muto said.

Muto hedged slightly, saying the companies might be allowed to join new bidding if participation is needed to meet Olympic deadlines.

""The deadlines cannot be moved,"" he said.

Muto said he hoped to hold an executive board meeting in July in Fukushima. The prefecture was devastated when a nuclear reactor was damaged during the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

The prefecture north of Tokyo is a venue for Olympic baseball and softball, and organizers hope playing games there will convince skeptics about safety.

Water is everywhere. It covers 70% of our planet and makes up nearly 60% of the human body. Despite its abundance, 663 million people around the world lack access to safe water.

Another 2.4 billion people lack access to a toilet or latrine, while more than 3.5 million people die each year because of inadequate water supply, sanitation, or hygiene. The earth may be covered in water, but only 3% of that is fresh water, and only a small fraction of that is available to the planet’s 7.5 billion inhabitants.

In many communities in developing countries, the lack of access is compounded by a number of challenges, including poor sanitation, lack of awareness of hygiene practices and water treatment technologies, and limited local capacity to manage, maintain, and repair water points.

Lack of access to clean water and sanitation results in economic losses of $260 billion each year and poor communities are impacted most acutely. The burden of water collection falls primarily on women and children, who spend 125 million hours each day collecting water, often walking long distances to do so. This is time and energy that could be better spent in school, pursuing careers, or supporting their families.

The impact of a dollar and a drop

Water is tied to every aspect of our lives. Clean water and sanitation is a critical part of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development agenda, and it’s uniquely tied to all 17 of its overarching goals. It drives economic growth, supports food and energy production, and is key to biodiversity, health, and social development.

It’s no wonder that for every US$1 invested in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), we see a US$4.30 return. Access to safe water means fewer illnesses, reduced health care costs, improved school attendance, and longer, more productive lives.

Tapping into the power of digital solutions

At Cisco, we recognize the need for sustainable access to safe water and the tremendous impact of ensuring access to clean water on all aspects of society. It’s why we’ve awarded over 21 grants to nine different nonprofit grantees since 2010, reaching more than 3900 organizations and nearly 50 million people.

By investing in digital solutions, we are helping nonprofit organizations to increase the efficiency and quality of their programs, reduce overall costs, and enable greater reach and scale of WASH initiatives around the world.

Akvo Foundation, for example, creates open-source, mobile software and sensors to help partners improve the management of water and sanitation. Today, their mobile-based data collection tool, Akvo FLOW, is used by over 250 organizations in over 40 countries, enhancing the ability of governments, nonprofits, and communities to plan, implement, and remotely manage WASH projects. Their new tool, Akvo Lumen, helps organizations aggregate, map, and analyze their data for greater insights and actionable information.

Portland State University and Sweet Sense, its social enterprise spin-off, have developed low-cost, remote sensors to improve the reliability and sustainability of water service delivery. Their sensors can alert local maintenance workers via SMS when a water point breaks down, reducing response time and downtime of water points, thus improving access and the reliability of water sources.

Technology can also help bridge the vast human resource capacity gap in the WASH sector. A recent study in just 10 countries found that in order to reach Sustainable Development Goal 6 of access to safe water and sanitation for all, more than 787,000 trained WASH professionals are needed.

The Centre for Affordable Water and Sanitation Technology (CAWST) provides online resources and virtual training to local organizations, to build their capacity in meeting their communities’ needs for water, sanitation, and hygiene. CAWST’s Virtual Water Expertise and Training (WET) Centres use internet-based solutions — such as e-training modules, online information resources, webinars and video-based training — to expand the reach of CAWST’s services to more than 3000 organizations in 164 countries.

We know the Sustainable Development Goals are bold, ambitious targets. We also know that technology can play a critical role in achieving these goals.

Organizations such as Akvo Foundation, Sweet Sense, and CAWST demonstrate the impact that technology can have in addressing water and sanitation challenges, and in helping realize SDG 6: to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.

Access to clean and safe water is a human right, one we believe in and continue to support. On World Water Day, we recognize the governments, fellow companies, nonprofit organizations, and communities around the world working to achieve universal coverage for all.

(CNS/EPA/Orlando Barria)

Five years ago, few people thought of the Catholic church as ecologically activist or environmentally diplomatic. But Pope Francis' election to the papacy changed that, especially since the promulgation of his 2015 ecology encyclical, ""Laudato Si', on Care for Our Common Home."" In my analysis, fresh water is the most important point of papal reflection at the intersection of environmental and social justice. Fresh water is, in no uncertain terms, a fundamental life issue.

The magisterial Catholic Church has articulated two fulcrums for environmental reflection — theological and ethical — that apply in specific ways to fresh water. Theologically, water is the matrix of creation, a ritual substance par excellence, and a gift from God intended for the benefit of all people. Ethically, fresh water is a substance that requires attention to justice: It is the poor and vulnerable who are first and most profoundly affected by lack of sufficient, clean, fresh water. Francis is surely the most visible, and most recent, authoritative Catholic voice on the topic of the centrality of fresh water to environmental and social justice. Citing his and Pope Benedict XVI's papal precedent, Francis' concluding salvo at a 2017 Vatican-hosted ""Dialogue on Water"" exhorted: The questions that you are discussing are not marginal, but basic and pressing. Basic, because where there is water there is life, making it possible for societies to arise and advance. Pressing, because our common home needs to be protected. Yet it must also be realized that not all water is life-giving, but only water that is safe and of good quality — as St. Francis again tells us, water that ""serves with humility,"" ""chaste"" water, not polluted. All people have a right to safe drinking water. This is a basic human right and a central issue in today's world.

Both Francis and Benedict declared that the fundamental human right to water is a core aspect of Catholic social teaching, which now includes environmental aspects in a central way. The Catholic Church was among the first major international institutions to defend the idea that access to fresh water is a fundamental human right, and it has enshrined this idea in authoritative teachings, such as the 2004 Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church, Caritas in Veritate and Laudato Si'. There is abundant skepticism in Catholic social teaching that the mechanisms of the free market, especially the tendency to treat water as a commodity, are sufficient to ensure just access to fresh water for all. Water is to be seen as a human right precisely because it undergirds all life and is central to human dignity. The popes also point out that fresh water is essential to the fulfillment of all other rights. More broadly, sufficient access to clean, fresh water is fundamental to the achievement of all manner of public and private goods, such as education, economic activity and social equity. It's worth noting that the Catholic Church — despite its patriarchal structure, and yet in line with social realities around the world — has noted that gender is a major factor in water and sanitation, for it is often women and girls who bear the burden of procuring water when it is scarce. Given papal leadership and the powerful tradition of Catholic social teaching, what more might be worth exploring with regard to fresh water? I suggest five aspects that will be important for the church to consider as it deepens its analysis and moral advocacy on the subject of water.

First, individual versus structural responses to water challenges. Fresh water is a reality that is simultaneously hydrological, climatological, social and institutional. The way fresh water flows depends not only on the weather and the water sources in a region, but also on the ways that infrastructure is constructed and access given to some users rather than others, as well as incentives given to some types of water uses over others. Twenty-first century moral reflection on fresh water requires not just attention to individual practices of conservation, but also to the political and economic frameworks within which fresh water is withdrawn from its sources, valued, exchanged and distributed. The Catholic Church, as a repository of theological insights and ethical reflection, is a needed voice in defending the preferential option for the poor and marginalized. Second, water and migration. Scientist Travis Huxman points out, ""Water is the hammer with which climate change will hit the earth."" One way this is visible is with regard to environmental refugees who have left their homes in response to drought, especially in agricultural regions. Given the church's advocacy for displaced persons, it is well-poised to advocate for environmental immigrants to be granted the status of refugees, a status that confers special rights that are more conducive to well-being, especially in an era of migration prompted by water scarcity. Third, water and sanitation. Scholars recognize that the right to water is deeply interwoven with the right to sanitation for all people, and especially significant for girls and women. How gender, water and sanitation intersect is a crucial topic, and one that the global Catholic church could rightly identify as an equity issue, since women and girls are more negatively impacted by lack of sanitation infrastructure. The church is already an outspoken critic of the fact that upward of 1,000 children die every day due to waterborne, and entirely preventable, deaths.

Fresh water is, in no uncertain terms, a fundamental life issue.
The magisterial Catholic Church has articulated two fulcrums for environmental reflection — theological and ethical — that apply in specific ways to fresh water.
Ethically, fresh water is a substance that requires attention to justice: It is the poor and vulnerable who are first and most profoundly affected by lack of sufficient, clean, fresh water.
Twenty-first century moral reflection on fresh water requires not just attention to individual practices of conservation, but also to the political and economic frameworks within which fresh water is withdrawn from its sources, valued, exchanged and distributed."

OXFORD, United Kingdom — The Rockefeller Foundation and UBS Optimus Foundation are backing a new financing tool to bring clean water to 1.4 million Ugandan school children, saying the model can potentially be replicated across other countries and sectors.

However, questions were raised about the sustainability of the “Social Success Note” model after the new tool was launched Thursday at the Skoll World Forum conference in Oxford.

Globally, nearly 850 million people have no access to a reliable, quality source of drinking water, the subject of Sustainable Development Goal 6. The World Bank estimates that securing sustainable and quality access to water and sanitation for all by 2030 will require an additional $114 billion annually. Official development assistance for the issue is now about $8 billion a year.

The SSN is the brainchild of nonprofit venture fund Yunus Social Business, which was founded by Muhammad Yunus, the father of microfinance. It proposes a solution to the problem of attracting sufficient financing streams to the WASH sector in developing countries, specifically to businesses seeking to provide sustainable water solutions to the poor.

In this first pilot of the SSN model, the UBS Optimus Foundation will provide a $500,000 loan to Impact Water, a social enterprise, to expand its work installing low-cost UV-based water purification systems in schools across Uganda. Schools pay approximately $1,000 to Impact Water to install the system.

Impact Water will pay back the loan after five years and the rate of interest will go down if certain outcomes are achieved. If Impact Water achieves agreed upon targets, the Rockefeller Foundation will pay up to $200,000 to both pay off some of Impact Water’s interest and pay UBS a performance-based return on its investment.

The goal is to reach 1.4 million children over five years. YSB will manage the Social Success Note and oversee its monitoring and evaluation.

Speaking to Devex ahead of the launch, Saskia Bruysten, co-founder and CEO of YSB, said the SSN is designed to help social businesses access scale capital while not being diverted from their social mission by the need to meet onerous investor demands for returns.

“The social business gets financing adequate to what they need and keeps them aligned to their social mission,” Bruysten said.

YSB’s chair, Professor Yunus, added in a statement: “Social businesses around the world are gaining momentum and young entrepreneurs are getting enthusiastic about them. To support their initiatives, social businesses need continuous funding and I hope the Social Success Note becomes the leading instrument to fulfill this need.”

The SSN is one of a string of results-based financing mechanisms that have emerged in recent years, including the development impact bond, a variation of the social impact bond pioneered in the United Kingdom in 2010. Despite strong interest in the DIB model within the development community, only a handful of DIBs are currently up and running.

Bruysten said there are key differences between the SSN model and DIBs. For example, under the SSN, outcome payers are only responsible for paying a return based on performance; they do not have to cover the original investment, making it more attractive to potential outcome payers.

She added that the SSN has a simpler structure than a DIB, to reduce transaction costs and time; and that complex impact metrics are avoided in favor of simple key performance indicators linked to the number of water systems installed.

“We really wanted to make it very simple because we were worried we would alienate investors [if] it’s just too complicated,” she said, adding that the high transaction costs associated with structuring complicated deals can be off-putting to would-be donors and investors.

The value of the SSN’s simplicity was echoed by others at the launch event, including Adam Connaker, program associate at the Rockefeller Foundation; and Maya Ziswiler, head of social finance at UBS Optimus Foundation, who described the low transaction costs as “a key component” in the design and success of the model.

However, some at the session said using installation-based key performance indicators as the outcome measure would not ensure sustainability in the long run — a problem that has dogged water projects in developing countries in the past. Studies have shown that around one-third of rural water projects are nonfunctional at any given time.

Ziswiler said that while the measure was “not perfect,” it was intended to make the SSN “simple enough for investors to be interested initially.” An independent evaluator would also track other outcomes, including how the investment impacts school attendance and improved health outcomes among students, she said.

Connaker added that it would be partly up to outcome funders to check sustainability, as they would do with non-SSN grantees.

Another issue raised during the session was whether, by offering social businesses a “subsidy” in the form of a low-interest loan, the SSN could distort markets. In response, Bruysten said social businesses focused on the poor still face major challenges in accessing capital and paying interest and returns, meaning such subsidies are still needed.

“While the business model is really a relevant tool, we still think this subsidy … can be instrumental in making these types of social businesses sustainable in the long run,” she said.

The Uganda pilot is funded through UBS’s philanthropic arm, Ziswiler said, but in the future she hopes the model could be funded through the bank’s impact investing platforms via a “fund-like structure.” That could see the model extended across more sectors and geographies.

Bruysten agreed that the long-term vision for the SSN model would be replicable elsewhere, as well as funding it through a “larger pot” that could include commercial capital. YSB is exploring the idea of setting up an SSN fund in India, Bruysten said, where social businesses are often pushed to become more commercial by investors, at the expense of serving the poor.

In a statement, Evan Haigler, CEO of Impact Water, said the SSN “has great potential as a financing model that social businesses can use to grow and deliver impact at scale. It crowds-in commercial and impact investment while aligning the financial incentives and social objectives of all partners involved.”

The “Blue Marble” photo of Earth shot from Apollo 17, the last of NASA’s Apollo missions as the rocket ship was hurtling toward the moon, wasn’t the first satellite image of our planet, but it was the first full image—stunning in color—taken from some 18,000 miles in space, with the sun fully illuminating Earth. The south polar ice cap, despite heavy cloud cover, was clearly captured, and the photo showed almost the entire coastline of Africa, extending from Antarctica to the Mediterranean Sea. Most of us who saw it at that time were stunned with how much water covered our planet.

This one single dramatic image eventually gave the name “Blue Planet” to our Earth, due obviously to the abundant water sources we could see on its surface. The photo was taken on December 17, 1972 and for all of us at that time, caught up in the exploits of the space discovery, it forever altered the comprehension of our planet. Now, when I think of Earth, and when hundreds of millions of others think of Earth, this is the iconic image that comes to mind.

This is an article about the global clean water crisis, about clean water, about water from a tap or from a glass, hopefully free of pathogens that bring disease. This is an article about clay pots and large plantain leaves and cupped dried gourds that hold rainfall hopefully untainted by acid effluvium. This is an article about pole wells drilled beneath polluted soil, and the unintended arsenic poisoning of villagers. This is an article about drying water reservoirs, about waste and sewage and chemicals polluting streams and rivers and major waterways. It is about encroaching urban development laying acres of implacable concrete and miles of roadways over land where rains can now no longer replenish water tables. It is an article about taking responsibility for that Blue Planet spinning alone, and as far as science now knows, unparalleled in our universe. No liquid water has been confirmed as existing on any other planet in our solar system. As yet, not a single drop of water has been detected anywhere in interstellar space. Scientists have determined that only a planet of the right mass, the right chemical composition and the right location can support liquid water; in other words, a planet like ours, the Blue Planet, this Earth.

That information alone should evoke awe when we look again at the ubiquitous reproductions of the Apollo 17 photo (identified by NASA as AS17-148-22727.) This image is perhaps best described in the spare language of Genesis 1. “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the Spirit of God was moving over the waters … And God said, ‘Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.’ And God made the firmament and separated the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. And it was so.” The Creation account then proceeds with the regular, rhythmical and dynamic pronouncement of the Creator, “And it is good. And it is very good.”

Just imagine: God looking at the actuality of what that splendid photo AS17-148-22727 replicates. Who can refuse to admit to experiencing a similar and deep soul sigh, it is good. It is very good . . .? According to United States Geological Survey (USGS), “The Earth is a watery place. But just how much water exists on, in, and above our planet? About 71 percent of the Earth’s surface is water-covered, and the oceans hold about 96.5 percent of all Earth’s water. Water also exists in the air as water vapor, in rivers and lakes, in icecaps and glaciers, in the ground as soil moisture and in aquifers, and even in you and your dog.”

I’m not sure about water content in the animal species, but data informs me that adult males are about 60 percent water and adult females are about 55 percent water.

Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s poem “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner” captures the analysis of contemporary oceanographers, “Water, water everywhere.” And unfortunately, due to the stresses of climate change, rising seas, urban sprawl, lack of urban planning, spoiled springs and creeks and raging rivers overwhelming their banks and flooding, the rest of that poetic lament is becoming all too real, “And not a drop to drink.”

A Quarter of Earth’s Major Cities Face Water Stress

At the time of this writing, the world is watching the water distress in Cape Town, South Africa, where the taps are scheduled to run dry due to extended drought that has emptied the water reservoirs. In fact, experts tell us that this coastal paradise city is not alone in its water depletion extremity. Literally millions of people around the world live without sufficient access to water; over 1 billion people lack water supplies, and another 2.7 billion find it scarce for at least one month of the year. A 2014 survey of the world’s 500 largest cities estimates that one in four are in “water stress.” In fact, right now, there are 11 major cities on the Blue Planet that are most likely to run out of drinking water—exactly like Cape Town. Those cities are:

São Paulo, Brazil’s financial capital. Bangalore, India, where rapid growth as a technological hub outstrips advancements to the city’s plumbing, resulting in half its drinking water lost to waste. Beijing, China; the country is home to some 20 percent of the world’s population but whose continent has only 7 percent of the world’s fresh water. Cairo, Egypt, where the major water source, the River Nile, is the increasing destination of untreated agricultural pollutants and residential waste. Jakarta, Indonesia, where rising sea levels with saline water have resulted in 40 percent of Jakarta to be below sea level. Moscow, Russia, where 70 percent of the water supply is dependent upon surface water, but pollution, a leftover from the USSR industrial legacy, has contributed to the fact that 35 percent to 60 percent of total drinking water reserves do not meet sanitary standards. Istanbul, Turkey, which is now technically in water stress. Experts have warned that, if not checked, the situation could worsen to water scarcity by 2030. The city’s reservoir levels declined to less than 30 percent of capacity in 2014. Mexico City, Mexico, where 1 in 5 residents have tap water only a few hours a week, and another 20 percent have running water just part of the day. London, England, where the city draws 80 percent of its water from the Thames and the Lea rivers, has a waste rate of 25 percent, and consequently is predicted to have serious shortages by 2040. Tokyo, Japan, which is now initiating plans to collect rainwater due to its high precipitation—some 750 private and public buildings in the city have water collection and utilization systems. Miami, Florida, is suffering from an earlier project to drain its swamps, causing the unforeseen problem of the Atlantic Ocean rising as water warms and now contaminating the Biscayne Aquifer—the city’s main source of fresh water—and causing closure of nearby outlying wells due to saline infusion.

Studying this list makes one point crystal clear: Even if I (or you) may not be personally affected by water emergencies in the areas where we individually live, modern urbanized cities across the entire Blue Planet are now under water duress. They serve as the early warning systems that demand global attention! Attention! Attention! In addition, problems that were ignored 20 years ago are in need of urgent correction now, as are other situations that now need corrections in order to prevent water disasters in the near future.

The World Health Organization has made clean water a priority. According to the WHO Drinking Water Fact Sheet, “In 2010, The UN General Assembly explicitly recognized the human right to water and sanitation. Everyone has the right to sufficient, continuous, safe, acceptable, physically accessible, and affordable water for personal and domestic use.”

The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) releases a yearly grade for infrastructure for the United States as well as a grade for each state. They gave the United States a grade of D+ for the year 2017. According to their report, this assessment for roads, bridges, airports, water systems, etc. is determined by measures like capacity, funding, operation and maintenance, and public safety.

These are the analytics that need to be explained in any discussions of America’s infrastructure hazards, and they are the modes for diagnosing our failing and crumbling public systems, upon which we are all dependent. Consequently, because of its looming water emergency, the thriving city of Cape Town has become the poster city for what, if the necessary correctives are not applied, will be water-scarcity crises duplicated in other large cities worldwide. Even now, that crisis is a reality for millions living in a world where the alarming estimate is that by 2025 half the world’s populations will be living in water-stressed areas.

“We are now limited to using 13 gallons of water per person per day. That’s enough for a 90-second shower, a half-gallon of drinking water, a sink full to hand-wash dishes or laundry, one cooked meal, two hand washings, two teeth brushings and one toilet flush.”

TIME Magazine’s reportage as to the causes of Cape Town’s severe water depletion point to several realities, which are also relevant to other urban centers. Climatologists at the University of Cape Town recognize that man-made climate change is a contributing factor in continuing drought patterns and warn that a drier future with increasingly unpredictable rain supplies is likely. It is generally agreed that the current water crisis is a result of what writers Mikhael Subotzky and Johnny Miller report is “a combination of poor planning, three years of drought and spectacularly bad crisis management. The city’s outdated infrastructure has long struggled to keep up with the burgeoning population. As dam levels began to decline amid the first two years of drought, the default response by city leadership was a series of vague exhortations to be ‘water aware.’”

In February 2018, Cape Town’s mayor’s office announced more stringent water restrictions: “We are now limited to using 13 gallons of water per person per day. That’s enough for a 90-second shower, a half-gallon of drinking water, a sink full to hand-wash dishes or laundry, one cooked meal, two hand washings, two teeth brushing and one toilet flush.” The warning in the TIME article is this: “What is happening to us in Cape Town might not be an outlier. It could happen to you too.”

Global Clean Water Crisis Exists in America, Too

In her master work titled Dirty, Sacred Rivers: Confronting South Asia’s Water Crisis, Cheryl Colopy, a prize-winning environmental reporter specializing in water systems and clean water restoration, makes a wry observation about the Western form of household waste management:

“But the system I have known and used, quite unconsciously ever since I was potty trained, is nuts. In a world where the supply of clean drinking water is becoming an almost universal worry, why would anyone put clean water into a toilet? For South Asia, flushed toilets and the treatment systems they require have become untenable long before they have become universal. For the Western world, the system as it is currently practiced will surely become untenable before too many more years have passed.”

Orange County, California

Any discussion of clean water inevitably introduces the twin dilemma on the matter of how the world handles human waste. Author Colopy’s point is even now an issue with the state of California, which has concluded that intermittent periods of drought may be the predicted future for its residents. Recycled and purified toilet water (and other grey water from washing machines, dishwashers, showers and sinks, gutters and sidewalks) is the basis for the Orange County Water District pioneering wastewater treatment facility that basically recycles sewage and returns it directly to the drinking supply. Soon, some 100 million gallons per day will meet the water needs of some 850,000 people. When mixed with the groundwater supply, this treatment reaches more than 70 percent of Orange County residents.

Admittedly, the concept of “from toilet to tap,” as the phrase goes, has met with determined resistance, but due to a three-year water shortage crisis and to determined public education, negative reaction seems to be lessening. A public campaign has carefully explained the three steps of the water reclamation project.

“The first is a micro-filtration of the treated waste water to remove solids, oils and bacteria, before the resulting liquid goes through reverse osmosis.” Phase Two means everything is pushed “through a fine plastic membrane that filters out viruses and pharmaceuticals.” Phase Three: “The water is then treated with UV light to remove any remaining organic compounds, before joining the main groundwater supply, which must pass strict quality controls to meet legal standards and distribution to households.” Mike Marcus, the general manager of the Orange County Water District (OCWD) explains that once wastewater goes through this three-step process, “we basically have distilled water.”

Water Reclamation Process Phase 1 Micro-filtration removes solids, oils and bacteria, all before the water goes through reverse osmosis. Phase 2 Everything is pushed through a fine plastic membrane that filters our viruses and pharmaceuticals. Phase 3 The water is treated with UV light to remove any other organic compounds.

The OCWD assures the end-user that the re-treated water exceeds all state and federal drinking standards. As the technology is adapted to other places in the world, water-insecure Singapore, for instance, in addition to new state-side additions launched in Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego, the president of the World Water Council, Benedito Braga, reports, “The quality [of effluent water from a sewage treatment plant] is very good, as good or better than the tap water in any city in the developed world.” Thomas Quinn, the head of the Association of California Water Agencies insists this process is a central strategy to drought-proofing modern urban economies.

For those who shudder at the possibility of drinking recycled toilet water, sometimes it is all a matter of what’s in a name. An interview over National Public Radio

acknowledged the “yuck” factor many in the public might naturally feel at the thought of recycling water from the toilet to the tap, and that resistance might be helped by a newer nomenclature such as the “the potable reuse project.” The Orange County Water District is being far more upfront in their public campaign by using the hashtag #GetOverIt. NPR Reporter, Nathan Rott, insists that recycled water is and will remain California’s single largest source of new water supplies as the state moves forward into the 21st century.

“The quality [of effluent water from a sewage treatment plant] is very good, as good or better than the tap water in any city in the developed world.”

Then before we turn to the water dilemmas of the two-thirds world and point a finger and tsk-tsk over spoiled rivers and sewage-polluted streams, perhaps we should look hard at the infrastructure inadequacies of our own nation. The news cycles in the States and the headline-oriented emphasis of major networks and cable outreaches leaves little time for in-depth reporting. We have heard, for many years, much discussion regarding the national need for infrastructure renovation—Roads are in disrepair, bridges are crumbling, airports all need upgrading. Rarely—rarely—do we hear that our water infrastructure systems are also in red flag conditions.

Flint, Michigan

The sad result of what is essentially a violation of public trust can be encapsulated by the Flint, Michigan, water saga that happened in April 2014. The drinking source for this city was diverted from the treated Detroit Water and Sewerage Department to the Flint River. This change was influenced by the fact that an estimated $5,000,000 in savings was projected over the next two years. In August and September of 2014, city officials detected levels of coliform bacteria, and a bulletin was issued for Flint citizens to boil their water. In October 2014, General Motors complained about the corrosivity of the water, explaining that car parts were actually corroding. The request was made that GM be able to switch back to the Detroit water source. (It turns out, that corrosive capability of the Flint River water would be determined to also corrode upon lead pipes, leaching lead levels into the water supply of individual homes. An early investigation by one “whistle-blowing” worker determined that, despite standard practice, officials failed to apply corrosion inhibitors to the Flint River water.) In January 2015, in a public meeting, citizens complained about bad water—murky tap water; there was a bad smell and taste as well as the questionable appearance. These complaints appeared to have gone on over an 18-month period before a local physician, taking it upon himself, found highly elevated blood lead levels in the children of Flint.

Eventually, with city officials dodging complaints, issuing false reports to state regulators indicating that “tests at Flint’s water treatment plant had detected no lead and testing in homes had registered lead at acceptable levels,” and with Michigan’s Department of Environmental Quality eventually being pegged as the major player in denying the problem and refusing to take action, major players, too numerous to mention, finally stepped in. Scientists and physicians and medical schools and environmental organizations, both private and governmental, determined that the proportion of infants and children with elevated levels of lead in their blood had nearly doubled since the switch to the Flint River.

In September 2015, Dr. Marc Edwards, notified by a Flint resident whose alarms had been ignored by city officials, began testing Flint water with a team from Virginia Tech to perform lead level testing. Working with a grant from the National Science Foundation, he and his student team reported that at least a quarter of Flint households had levels of lead above the federal allotted level of 15 parts per billion (ppb) and that in some homes, lead levels were at 13,200 ppb. Edwards summarized the Flint Water Crisis by stating: “It was the injustice of it all and that the very agencies that are paid to protect these residents from lead in water, knew or should have known after June at the very latest of this year, that federal law was not being followed in Flint, and that these children and residents were not being protected. And the extent to which they went to cover this up exposes a new level of arrogance and uncaring that I have never encountered.”

This all, of course, has resulted in countless hearings, investigations, and continued studies on the local, statewide and national levels. Emergency centers for distributing water and home filters, then replacement cartridges, have been established. Testing water and lead levels in the blood of children continue. The water supply was diverted back to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. Numerous Class action suits have been filed against Michigan Governor Rick Snyder and 13 other state officials, including former Flint mayor Dayne Walling. The complaints allege that the officials acted recklessly and negligently, leading to serious injuries from lead poisoning.

Needless to say, major funding has been found and pledged for comprehensive water infrastructure improvement, all to be carried out over the next few years. But what is immeasurable is the damage done to the brains of small children, most of which cannot now be determined but which bodes ill for the future of these kids. Senators Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters along with Representative Dan Kildee called upon the state of Michigan to “make a sustained financial commitment by establishing a Future Fund to meet the cognitive, behavioral and health challenges of children affected by lead poisoning.” All fear that those challenges will be real and life-lasting.

Clean Water Problems Around the Globe

So let us take a deep breath. Let us think a moment about that peaceful and stunning NASA photo: AS17-148-22727. Let us remind ourselves that of all the spinning planets in our solar system, it alone has been created uniquely to sustain water, and that not one other drop has been discovered anywhere else in interstellar space. Let us remember that 75 percent of our planet is covered with water, some 96.5 percent of that in its oceans. Then let us say a prayer for its water resource preservation and purification, and let us remember that some religious systems view water to be holy. Only then, let us absorb the fact that an investigative report by Reuters released December 19, 2016, found nearly 3,000 areas in the United States with lead poisoning rates at least double those in Flint.

This headline tagged a report released by the Associated General Contractors (AGC): “Both Public and Private Studies Find Astounding Gaps Between Current Spending and Projected Needs.” The analysis determined: “Modernizing and replacing aging water infrastructure may be the single largest public works endeavor in our nation’s history. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Water and Drinking Water Infrastructure Gap analysis found a $540 billion gap between current spending and projected needs for water and wastewater infrastructure (combined) over 20 years. Other public studies conducted by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and a private study produced by AGC partner, the Water Infrastructure Network, have similarly estimated the nation’s water infrastructure needs to range between $400 and $600 billion over a 20-year period.

The 2014–2017 Flint, Michigan lead-poisoned water crisis highlights possible impacts on communities if warnings are ignored and if appropriate budget planning is not prioritized. (“What is happening to us in Cape Town may not be an outlier. It could happen to you too.”) We need to understand that water degradation and evaporation and infrastructure decline is happening to us now.

So what is the status of clean water worldwide? According to the World Health Organization, some of the global facts regarding safe water usage are these:

71% of the global population in 2015 (5.2 billion people) used a safely managed drinking-water service—that is, one located on premises, available when needed, and free from contamination. 89% of the global population in 2015 (6.5 billion people) used at least a basic service. A basic service is an improved drinking-water source within a round trip of 30 minutes to collect water.

840 million people lack even a basic drinking-water service, including 159 million people who are dependent on surface water (water from rivers and ponds). 2 billion people globally use a drinking water source contaminated with feces.

502,000 deaths every year are caused by diseases transmitted by contaminated water such as diarrhea, cholera, dysentery, typhoid and polio. 38% of health care facilities lack an improved water source in low- and middle-income countries. 19 percent do not have improved sanitation, and 35 percent lack water and soap for hand-washing.

In addition to these above statistics, WHO also notes that “Yet diarrhea is largely preventable, and the deaths of 361,000 children aged under five years could be avoided each year if these risk factors were addressed. Where water is not readily available, people may decide handwashing is not a priority, thereby adding to the likelihood of diarrhea and other diseases.”

Is Anyone Doing Anything?

Certainly, organizations somehow, somewhere, are doing something about this? Right? This is the natural response of those of us who unthinkingly use clean water to flush our toilets and allow grey water to be piped into the sewer systems of our communities.

Actually, that thought many of us have when we read about water-distressed systems worldwide is right. Well-meaning help of all kinds, from missionary groups to hundreds if not thousands of non-government organizations to the World Bank and the United Nations to the World Health Organization to inter-agency coordinated efforts to private foundations with substantial granting means to individual governments to the largess of western countries—all of them are players in attempting to solve the water problems of the world.

However, even the best laid plans of sophisticated systems often go awry. Evidence of this is the estimated 50,000 wells in Africa dug by well-meaning organizations that now lie broken, abandoned and non-functional; a dismal testament to good intentions gone bad. Really bad. Jamie Skinner of the London-based International Institute for Environment and Development reported at the 2009 World Water Forum, a triennial summit, on the state of wells in Africa. He is a water development specialist with particular emphasis on West Africa. His report on “water points” included some of these disturbing facts:

The equivalent of up to $360 million USD has been wasted on building borehole wells that break because they are not maintained or repaired.

Only one third of water points built by NGOs in Senegal’s Kaolack region are working, and 58 percent in northern Ghana are in disrepair.

Disrepair occurs because NGOs often do not fully consult with local people before beginning a water project to determine what it will cost to clean and maintain the well.

Some naysayers have deemed this come-do-your-thing-and-go approach as “non-government organizational malfeasance.” Skinner gives the example of a badly constructed and poorly maintained shallow well, dug by a charity in Katine sub county in north-east Uganda, that was full of soil and animal feces and was making the local population sick. The African Medical and Research Foundation’s strategy to solve this well deficiency was to set up a local committee responsible to operate and maintain a new borehole with trained hand-pump repairmen available in case of breakdown. “There is no point in an external agency coming in, putting in a drill-hole and then passing it over to the local community if they can’t afford to maintain it over the next 10 or 20 years,” concludes Skinner.

The Need for Clean Water in Asia

In her book Dirty, Sacred Rivers: Confronting South Asia’s Water Crisis, Cheryl Colopy takes us on nearly every footstep of her arduous investigation starting in the headwaters high in the Himalayas.

“This book chronicles my travels in Nepal, India, and Bangladesh, countries that are knit together by the Ganga and her various tributaries. I explain what I learned about glaciers melting in the mountains, sewage gluts and water shortages in the vast cities, and plans for engineering rivers that will have unknown consequences and perhaps limited benefits,” she writes in her introduction.

Interviewing hundreds of Asian water conservation experts who are concerned about their countries’ water shortages and misuse, we have a chance to listen over her shoulder to their love for their land and their attempts to solve water distress issues. Clean water, indeed, is the goal, but working through past mistakes, the consequences of climate change and its unknown future, population explosions, and unintended engineering mishaps gives the reader an extraordinary feeling of being party to all the discussions. As the flap copy explains, “Many are reviving ingenious methods of water management that thrived for centuries in South Asia and may point the way to water sustainability and healthy rivers.”

Simple is often best. Ancient civilizations solved their water needs in ways that speak to us today.

Here too, as with Jamie Skinner’s reporting on Africa’s abandoned wells, a theme emerges, one the author confesses she discovered during her essentially seven-year journey. “There is no way that I—a former medieval scholar turned environment reporter rather later in life—can claim to have answers to South Asia’s water crisis, if there are right answers. So I give you many highly intelligent, trained, sane, and committed water experts from that region. These authorities more often argue for the lighter hand, the softer path; not no engineering at all, but less invasive engineering, and techniques that are localized, decentralized, and draw on traditional methods along with the almost-lost wisdom of local people.”

The themes of the book are: Simple is often best. Ancient civilizations solved their water needs in ways that speak to us today. The people who are most affected by water stresses are most often the ones who can solve the problem.

Indeed, the problems are real.

Sewage in the rivers: “Estimates of the amount of untreated raw sewage that enters the Ganga every day are hard to grasp: apparently something in the neighborhood of a billion liters. Much of it comes from homes that do have toilets, where relatively clean water is being flushed away and turned into sewage, which then turns rivers into sewers, a further loss of clean water.”

Climate change: “This lack of snowfall is the chief problem Dobhal (a glacier specialist) has seen in the high mountains in recent years. As a consequence, the glaciers are depleting, not developing. With good winter snowfall, they stay in balance, and the melting rate is not cause for alarm. Melting glacier ice accounts for 30 percent of the water in the rivers. The rest is from snow and from the monsoon. Now that there is less snow, the spring flow in the rivers comes directly from the older ice. When glaciers lose their volume, the rate of melting increases. It’s the difference between a melting block of ice and a melting ice cube. Big glaciers create their own climate. They make cold weather. Big glaciers can be more powerful than the sunlight that reaches them. But as glaciers shrink, the power of the sun to melt them grows.” Unpredictable behavior is ahead from flooding due to increased glacier melt to drought to drying rivers. One expert sums up the uncertainty, saying, “Climate change will manifest itself through water. It will affect every sector of life through precipitation, snow, rain, whatever. Livestock, forestry, soil, sanitation, disease, everything. But we have no idea how it’s going to happen.”

Agricultural water scarcity: The global water scarcity problem is not limited to providing potable drinking water for humans, although without it we would not exist. Water is necessary for agriculture, for both crops and animal husbandry.

In water-starved South Africa, the first restrictions on water usage were levied upon the agricultural sector. Now, farmers are renegotiating their leases because they cannot produce enough income. Current economic forecasts anticipate that within the next five years as many as 98 percent of farms will have a negative Net Farm Income.

China’s Ministry of Water Resources recently declared a need “to fight for every drop of water or die.” Twelve northern Chinese provinces suffer from water scarcity. In eight, the scarcity is considered acute. This is particularly significant because those provinces provide 38 percent of the country’s agriculture. The rapid economic expansion in China has placed so much demand on water supplies that 28,000 rivers have disappeared over the past 25 years. The flow of the Yellow River has dwindled to a tenth of what it was prior to 1950. Pollution is so rampant in China that almost 10 percent of the groundwater is not even fit for agricultural use.

These countries and others are in a catch-22. Water for agriculture is limited, but it is needed to grow the crops and animals required to feed the demands of growing populations.

The rapid economic expansion in China has placed so much demand on water supplies that 28,000 rivers have disappeared over the past 25 years.

Recognizing the importance of water conservation, the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) in India is making a concerted effort to bring dramatic reform in their own jurisdiction. Infrastructure can cause as much as 45 percent water loss, far above the national average of 15 percent systemic water loss. As the KWA brings improvements to its clean water delivery system, the potential for positive impact is significant.

On the national level, Indian Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi began promoting the implementation of a decades-old clean water initiative in 2014. One part of that project alone, linking the Ken and Betwa rivers, would make drinking water available for 1.35 million people plus provide enough to irrigate 600,000 hectares of farmable land. The project is pending approval from the environmental ministry, but nonetheless, we’re hopeful of the efforts making strides to resolve India’s water crisis.

In 2016, 330 million Indians were affected by drought, and the government is taking action to respond. “We are working on a big scheme to bring water to farmlands. We need to have a permanent solution to the drought,” the Prime Minister said.

There is a plan underway for 25,000 villages to get clean water wells, and 5,000 wells have been started, as of April 2017.

Dr. K.P. Yohannan, founder of Gospel for Asia and Metropolitan of Believers Eastern Church, met with high officials in the government in March 2016 to discuss ways in which India’s Christian community could collaborate with the government for the good of the nation. Believers Eastern Church has since been able to work together with the Indian government to work on cleaning up some of the nation’s rivers.

One of those voices Colopy interviewed—a highly intelligent, trained and committed expert—Sudhil Chaudhary, a professor of biology at Bhagalpur University has a plan. His is for forestry restoration, which also involves water reclamation. Sudhil would like local communities to be part of each and every decision about the plan. This is a theme that seems to be emerging all over the world. I find it stated more and more as I research world development needs and particularly, the Millennium Development Goals and its companion the Sustainable Development Goals. Things work when there is community buy-in, and often fail when there is none.

What Scripture Has to Say About Water

It is intriguing, in light of the fact that 71 percent of our Earth is covered by water, that Scripture has a great deal to say on the topic. One commentator suggests that water is mentioned 722 times in the Bible. This total is less than the mentions of God, Jesus, heaven or love, but more than faith, hope, prayer or worship. In Genesis it says: “A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters The name of the first is Pishon … The name of the second river is the Gihon … The name of the third river is the Tigris … And the fourth river is the Euphrates.”

For those of us with a Sunday School background, the stories dealing with water are memorable: Moses parting the Red Sea as the children of Israel fled the pursuing chariots of the Egyptians. Moses striking the rock at Horeb so that water flowed in the wilderness to satisfy the thirst of the people and of their flocks.

Wells are central stages for story-telling dramas: Abraham’s servant finds a bride for Isaac after praying near a well, “Oh, Lord God of my master, Abraham, give me success today and show kindness to my master.” Jesus declares His spiritual authority to a Samaritan woman by a well. “Will you give me a drink?” He asks, to begin a dialogue with her, and then eventually He declares, “But whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life” (John 4:14, NIV).

Rivers are forded, oases with pools satisfy weary nomads and their families, and always, over and over, water is used as an example of God’s blessing. “And the LORD will continually guide you, and satisfy your desire in scorched places, and give strength to your bones. And you will be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water whose waters do not fail” (Isaiah 58:11, NASB).

Water is used as an example of the sacramental, where the holy mixes mysteriously with the physical. People flock to John the Baptist in the wilderness to be baptized for the forgiveness of their sins: “I baptize you with water for repentance. But after me comes one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire” (Matthew 3:11, NIV).

The heavens open after Jesus is baptized, the Spirit descends in the bodily form of a dove, and a voice is heard declaring, “You are My beloved Son; in you I am well-pleased” (Luke 3:22, NKJV).

Water is a symbol of cleansing, not only in a physical sense but in a spiritual sense. Jesus walks on the water. He teaches by the shores of the seas. Some of His disciples are fishermen who gained their livelihood from waters’ depths. In the last chapters of Revelation, which many theologians feel is a prophetic picture of Eden being restored again, these words bring the water theme to a close. Revelation 22, the last chapter of the Bible, the first verse: “And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding from the throne of God and of the Lamb.”

Global Clean Water Crisis: A Christ-like Response

It is a comfort, to know the fragility of our water sources around the globe is taken into account. Because of community involvement and the compassion of pastors from Believers Eastern Church and other affiliate organizations, Dr. K.P. Yohannan spearheaded the “Jesus Well” project among some of the neediest regions in India, even small villages across Asia, spanning multiple Asian nations. In 2016 alone, Gospel for Asia was able to help provide 6,822 wells. That is 6,822 sources of clean, fresh drinking water. GFA supporters around the world have allowed the rate of installation of Jesus Wells to continue and to remain consistent, with tens of thousands of wells drilled and constructed in the past several years. Now, the Jesus Well project is one of the largest clean water initiatives in the world.

Here, there are no broken wells laying waste and abandoned because well-meaning but neglectful charities dug wells that villagers could not maintain or repair. Jesus Wells are maintained in good repair by GFA-supported local pastors. In fact, wherever possible, the wells are dug near local churches, not simply so that they will be maintained, but so that the beneficiaries will recognize that our love for them is genuine, because everyone is able to drink freely—no matter their income or social background.

Digging a Jesus Well supports the local economy, because local labor and materials are used to drill the wells. This keeps costs low, often even seven times lower than wells installed by other organizations.

Jesus Wells are drilled up to 650 feet deep to ensure a continuous supply of clean water. They can last for 20 years and provide clean water for an average of 300 people every day. Some wells serve even more at a cost of $1400 apiece, and provide practical solutions to our global clean water crisis.

In regions where water might be available, but it’s just not safe to drink, GFA-supported workers provide BioSand water filters. These simple structures—locally built from concrete, sand and rocks—filter the water to remove impurities, providing water for drinking and cooking that is 98 percent pure. In 2016, GFA provided 14,886 BioSand water filters for families and individuals.

Gospel for Asia published a story in 2016 that shared the paradox faced by four villages in one region of South Asia. These communities faced severe water shortage during the hot, summer months, but in the rainy monsoon season their water sources were contaminated by chemicals. Their situation was an echo back to Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s poem: “Not a drop to drink.” Local congregations in the region were concerned about the people and their need for clean water, and in 2014, GFA helped drill four Jesus Wells to provide safe, pure water for these villages. By God’s grace, there are now more than 5,000 people who benefit from these wells!

A Jesus Well Transformed Salil’s Family

The staggering weight of the global clean water crisis is beyond the ability of most of us to wrap our minds around. Still, more than 150 million people in South Asia alone have either no immediate access to clean water or drink from polluted sources.

But the clean water problem can be devastating for a single family. We see this illustrated in the story of a gentleman named Salil, his wife and his children. Until a Jesus Well was installed in their village, all the water for the community came from a nearby contaminated pond. Salil’s family and the other villagers were sick with a plethora of illnesses and diseases. They suffered because of the very water they depended on for life.

The situation drove them even deeper into poverty as their illnesses kept them from work, and their meager income was not adequate to provide for the medicines they needed—let alone their other essential needs. Salil did everything he could think of to provide for his family, but nothing he did was adequate.

When a local pastor requested and received a Jesus Well for the community, everything changed. A thankful Salil said, “Our family is blessed both physically and spiritually. We are free from problems and sickness.”

How appropriate: “And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who is my disciple, truly I tell you, that person will certainly not lose their reward” (Matthew 10:42, NIV). Those who receive are blessed, and those who give are blessed. The accompanying video will give you a feel for just what that means.

So, our Blue Planet spins in space, obedient to its determined orbit. Its surface is covered by 71 percent water. So far, there has been no confirmed verification of liquid water existing on any other planet in our solar system. As yet, not a single drop of water has been detected anywhere in interstellar space, and scientists have determined that only a planet of the right mass, the right chemical composition and the right location can support liquid water. Let us remember that it is good. It is very good.

The increase occurred despite the international push to reduce the use of these important drugs.

Researchers found that while many low- and middle-income countries still lack appropriate access to antibiotics, the global increase was driven largely by some developing countries which face more drug-resistant infections and a lack of tools to test infections and track how these medications are used.

To tackle antimicrobial resistance (AMR), we need to look at all the factors behind how and when antibiotics are used. One obstacle I often see as a medical microbiologist working in developing countries, is a lack of access to clean water, which makes preventing and controlling infections nearly impossible. It is a major driver of inappropriate antibiotic use and, ultimately, the growth in antibiotic-resistant bugs – so-called “superbugs”.

For want of water

I think back to one night when there was a violent knock at the door around midnight and I was told that there was an emergency patient that I needed to see. I woke the medical team, who were sleeping after a 16-hour trek – just one leg of a village to village journey providing healthcare in rural Nepal.

Before we got to the door of the emergency department, we could smell the problem: gangrene. A ten-year-old boy had broken his arm two weeks earlier when ferrying water from the river to his home on top of a hill where he lived with his 80-year-old grandmother. His six-year-old brother walked with him for almost three days to come to the healthcare centre.

Because of a lack of water, the boys did not clean the wound but tore an old shirt to use as a bandage. In the two weeks since the injury he had not taken the “bandage” off because the pain was unbearable. By the time we saw him, the only thing we could do was refer him to the nearest hospital – a two-hour flight away – for an amputation.

We cleaned the wound in the hospital, but it was too late to save the arm. We prayed that the flight would be able to land the next day (not a given, thanks to the monsoons). After 32 hours, a plane was able to land and take him away.

When we saw the boy three weeks later at the hospital, he had only a stump where his right arm was. He still smiled when he saw us, but told us: “I am not sure how to get water to my house now with one hand.”

In the coming weeks, the boy developed a persistent fever and it was discovered he had a drug-resistant infection. While spending an extra month in the hospital fighting off this infection, his brother developed diarrhoea caused by a different drug-resistant bug in untreated tap water.

A water crisis is a health crisis

While water scarcity in California and Cape Town makes headlines, the World Health Organisation and UNICEF report that 2.1 billion people lack access to a safe and sustainable water supply. Around 40% of health care facilities in developing countries do not have a water supply. This is why the water crisis is a health crisis. Having access to safe water and sanitation is central to improving health and fighting diseases that are increasingly resistant to treatments, such as typhoid, cholera and dysentery.

One of the United Nations’ sustainable development goals is to ensure access to sustainable water and sanitation for all people by 2030. Despite the resolution, water scarcity has spread rapidly to many parts of the world as population and consumption levels have increased against a fixed supply of renewable fresh water.

The establishment of water treatment facilities throughout urban and rural regions in poor areas like Nepal are limited. The capital, Kathmandu, sees massive shortages of water: 60% of the city has access to piped water, but it only flows for two to three hours every ten days. These shortages lead to sanitation and hygiene problems and, as a result, foster a high number of waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, gastroenteritis and cholera.

Rainwater harvesting could be a solution for places like Nepal, which has excessive rainfall for four months every year. While collecting rainfall on roofs is deemed to be unsuitable for big hospitals that guzzle a lot of water, these systems could be useful in smaller hospitals in rural areas and in homes. Installing rainwater harvesting systems has also been shown to reduce the need to buy water from private suppliers, and can improve sanitation and reduce disease.

If this boy had access to clean water at home, he may not have broken his arm or his immune system may have been stronger to fight the infection. With clean water, he could have cleaned the wound and changed his bandages. If the hospital had clean water, better hygiene could have prevented blood infection from a drug-resistant bug and his brother would not have developed diarrhoea. Preventing any of these complications could have further reduced the need to use antibiotics and helped slow the spread of antibiotic resistance.

The two boys we treated for the broken arm and diarrhoea had a happy ending that too many do not. Antibiotics eventually worked, and after three months in the hospital, they got to go back home to their grandmother. I often think of them and the question he asked us: how will he get water these days?","One obstacle I often see as a medical microbiologist working in developing countries, is a lack of access to clean water, which makes preventing and controlling infections nearly impossible.

Ferguson Bath Kitchen & Lighting Gallery will host an evening to support the Kohler Clarity Initiative to provide clean water to Honduran families from 7 to 10 p.m. April 26. The event will feature local restaurants, drinks and entertainment at the Ferguson showroom in the Indiana Design Center, 200 S. Range Line Rd.

“While Visiting Kohler, Wisconsin for a design event, there was a breakout to discuss the Kohler philanthropy department, which highlighted the work they’re doing to reach areas with limited drinking water,” said Jeremy Konechne, Indianapolis area showroom manager for Ferguson. “Both myself and our local Kohler rep thought it’d be a great opportunity to raise awareness for this cause and provide people with information as well as directly helping by creating an event where all of the funds were going directly to purchase and send these water filtration devices to areas in need.”

In 2015, Kohler developed the KOHLER Clarity water filtration system for homes affected by waterborne illness. The company uses its expertise to address worldwide WaSH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) issues, including access to safe drinking water. KOHLER Clarity filters out bacteria and provides up to 40 liters of safe water each day.

“Each of these units will provide a family clean drinking water for six months. In addition, replacement cartridges will be offered to continue the flow of clean water for these families,” Konechne said.

Each $40 ticket will include a chance to win a hand-painted Kallista freestanding tub, painted by local artist Walter Knabe. Guests can purchase additional raffle tickets at the event and must be present at the 9 p.m. drawing to win.

The purchase of each ticket goes directly to the purchase of one filtration device to be shipped to Honduras. Buy tickets at fergusonclarity.eventbrite.com/?s=83778380.

With the assistance from the Partners in Community Development Fiji (PCDF), families in Narikoso, Ra, now have access to one of life’s basic necessities.

For the past 40 years, close to 42 families in Narikoso Village, Ra, did not have access to clean and safe drinking water.

However, with the assistance from the Partners in Community Development Fiji (PCDF) they now have access to one of life’s basic necessities.

The work was carried out by the engineers from a Non-Government Organisation (NGO) where a water catchment was constructed just 9.8 kilometres from the area laying pipes from the catchment to the storage tanks where water was then dispersed to each household.

The area comprises two settlements, Narau and Nadonumai.

PCDF Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) engineer, Vilive Tavabulabula said the two settlements could now access clean and safe drinking water and they would no longer use the creek.

“When they first settled here, these families had been accessing the creek water for their daily lives like cooking, drinking, washing and bathing.

“The water was contaminated by animal husbandry activities occurring upstream which resulted in an outbreak in typhoid cases in the area around 2010-2013 deeming it a red zone,” he added.

With this initiative, Mr Tavabulabula added that WASH standards would improve in this area to reduce the chances of a typhoid outbreak.

The initiative is supported by the United Nations International Children’s Fund (UNICEF), Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Project which aimed to support communities that require additional assistance for water system construction works and complete water system upgrades.

Thirty-eight-year-old, Semi Baravilala said the area before had been labelled as a typhoid zone.

“We have been using water from the creek which was usually contaminated because it has been polluted upstream; it was an emotional moment for many of us to see tap water running in our respective households.

“For the past 40 years we have been using the creek beside our settlement to access water and we want to thank PCDF for their great help,” he added. The project will be officially opened on May 4.

According to a recent report by India Today, many villages are facing large-scale migration during summers, especially in Rajasthan.

Displaced families

In the area close to the Chambal region, the people say that administration has so far not been able to ensure that water supply reaches these villages. Archana Sharma, vice-president, Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee claims that a number of structures have been built to preserve water, traditional structures have been renovated. But people are leaving Dholpur because of scarcity of water. This shows that the government has totally failed in dealing with the situation.

reuters

It is said that by 2050, India will only have 22% of the per capita water that it has today.

Every summer, people from 40 villages of Dholpur district are forced to migrate with their animals. Some of these villages include Galori, Dagripura, Gopalpura, Sirona, Ballapura, Sukhsinghpura, Kharkai, Nayapura, Khaidar, Subedar ka Pura, Bhagatpura, Lehaspura, Dabarpura, Narsinghpura, Dankpura, Mughalpura, Layakpura, Bared, Kunakheda, Indora, Savarpali, Bharani, reported India Today.

Going South

According to another report by Reuters, Bengaluru, might be the first city to face acute water shortages, just like South Africa's Cape Town, already raising alarm with ""Day Zero"". The Guardian reports that the drought faced in India may be similar to the ones witnessed by Cape Town. According to a statement issued by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), ahead of World Water Day, water table there shrunk from 10-12 metres to 76-91 metres in two decades, while the number of extraction wells went up from 5,000 to 0.45 million in 30 years.

The shrinking of reservoirs is not just limited to Maharashtra-Gujarat-Rajasthan belt, coastal Andhra is also reeling under water scarcity. In parts of south-western Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and north India, next three months seem to throw a gigantic water crisis. The Cauvery Delta region in Tamil Nadu is facing extreme water stress. The Godavari, known as the Ganges of the South is also running dry.

Reservoirs are 'damned'

The Guardian also reported that tensions have also been apparent in India over the water allocations for two reservoirs connected by the Narmada river. Poor rains last year left the upstream Indira Sagar dam a third below its seasonal average. When some of this shortfall was passed on to the downstream Sardar Sarovar reservoir, it caused an uproar because the latter is a drinking supply for 30 million people. Last month, the Gujarat state government halted irrigation and appealed to farmers not to sow crops

India is the world's largest user of groundwater, accounting for 25 per cent of the world’s extracted groundwater. Over-exploitation has resulted in the decline in groundwater levels. In some parts of the country, the decline is more than one metre per year. Gujarat has already consumed 68% of its groundwater and figures among the worst offenders in exploiting aquifers for domestic, irrigation and industrial use.","India's water crisis is taking a grave turn as it is forcing families to leave their homes in search of potable water.

Don't worry, I won't judge you if it was last week or last month (or a couple months, which, let's be honest, is probably the case for most people). But if you are a professional makeup artist, your answer to the question is yesterday. Every single day they work, makeup artists wash their brushes when they get home without fail. Even if they go out that night, one MUA revealed to me he'll even clean every single one of his brushes no matter how buzzed he is.

Of course, the hyper-diligence is for hygienic reasons. Horror stories often pop up on social media after a model gets an infection from dirty brushes. Because of this, pro makeup artists keep disposable tools like cotton swabs, cotton pads, and single-use mascara wands on hand to avoid these instances. Los Angeles-based makeup artist Allan Avendaño even considers beauty sponges like Beautyblenders disposable because he throws them out after 10 uses. ""You can clean them well, but I’m always cautious about sponges collecting bacteria and keeping my clients safe,"" he explains.

Clean brushes also help professional makeup artists do their jobs the best they possibly can. ""Would you trust a painter to paint the walls of your interiors with a dirty brush? I’d sure hope not,"" Dominique Lerma, the executive makeup artist for Royal & Langnickel, tells Allure. ""Makeup artists cannot create a perfect canvas with sub-par tools.""

Keeping their brushes spick and span at all times helps extend the life of their brushes, too. Avendaño, who has worked with Camila Cabello, Jenna Dewan, and Sarah Hyland, has some that are 10 years old. Although they own anywhere from 200 to 1,500 brushes, pro makeup artists cherish their brush sets like children. I asked a handful of MUAs how often they replace their makeup brushes, and their reactions would have made you think I asked them something blasphemous about their real children.

""I rarely replace brushes because I take very good care of them,"" New York-based makeup artist Benjamin Puckey says. ""I’m now mourning the loss of my all-time favorite Make Up For Ever eyeliner brush from when they still had the yellow lacquered handles. I used it until every last hair fell out."" And Mai Quynh, a Los Angeles-based makeup artist who has worked with Chloë Grace Moretz and Alison Brie, had a similar answer. ""I have a lot of attachment to my brushes, so I usually won’t replace them unless I lose one or they’re falling apart on me.","Every single day they work, makeup artists wash their brushes when they get home without fail.

KUMASI, Ghana — With widespread concern over corruption and environmental neglect in Ghana, the church has launched a national project to help clean up the country. ""We shall fight against the perpetrators of the 'crime' against our common home, in the form of environmental degradation, poor sanitation and corruption, which are all social canker"" that lead to increased poverty, hunger and sickness, said Bishop Joseph Francis Kweku Essien of Wiawso.

Water bodies, land and other natural resources must be protected for the use of all Ghanaians, Essien, chairman of the bishops' governance, justice and peace department, said at the late April launch in Kumasi of the conference's project, ""A Clean Environment in a Corruption-free Society."" Parishes and other church structures throughout the West African country will implement the project, which aims to complement national government efforts to reduce corruption and improve sanitation. The church will seek ways to address corruption, poor sanitation and abuse of the environment ""and enhance the capacity of the lay faithful ... to support the local authorities in the search for accountability and local development,"" the bishops' conference said in a statement. Ghana was placed 81 out of 180 countries in the 2017 Corruption Perception index, dropping 11 places from its 2016 ranking. Global watchdog Transparency International's index is based on independent surveys on corruption. The church's work in fighting corruption will help to shape attitudes and contribute to the formation of ""a new Ghanaian who would be able to frown on corruption and other social ills,"" said Samuel Zan Akologo, who heads the bishops' human development department. Archbishop Gabriel Justice Yaw Anokye of Kumasi said at the launch that modern technologies and urbanization have led to the destruction of the environment.

Priority Waste, based temporarily in Clinton Township, launched last month and is looking for a permanent headquarters and storage yard as it seeks to build from an initial investment of more than $4 million, said Sam Langer, chief operating officer for the company.

In the past three or four weeks, the company has expanded from two drivers to six, with just as many 2018 tri-axle Kenworth trucks and 300 waste containers, ranging in size from 10 to 40 cubic yards. Langer said the company is looking at a site in the area of Hall and Mound roads, but no deals have been finalized.

Nonetheless, company executives hope to double its staff of 15 during its first year while achieving $7 million to $10 million in revenue.

Langer said he thinks the local waste and recycling management market is ripe for growth.

""The primary reason is the turnaround of the area,"" he said. ""The economy has come rolling back. (There is) a lot of construction in Detroit and Southeast Michigan.""

He said the other equally important factor is a lack of customer satisfaction following acquisitions by big companies.

""Over the last three years, we've seen the large national companies come in and buy all the ma and pa companies,"" he said. ""Service has gone downhill significantly.""

SPOKANE, Wash. -- Four salons in the Spokane and Spokane Valley were fined for safety and sanitation violations.

There are many indicators to make sure your salon is following safety and sanitation laws. According to Pamela Craig with the Glen Dow Academy, the way tools are sanitized and stored is a clear indicator of cleanliness.

Spa Paradiso has been voted Spokane's Best Spa for several years in a row.

""In between all of our clients our tools are soaked in barbicide. After each service they are scrubbed down with barbicide, hot soapy water, sprayed with disinfectant, and then put right back in,"" said Sara Wilhaite an employee at Spa Paradiso.

For sanitation purposes Spa Paradiso does not reuse nail files. They either throw them away or give them to clients after being used. If you go home with your nail file that is a great indication your salon is not reusing files on clients.

""The filters in those spas can harbor a lot of bacteria if they are not cleaned each and every time,"" said Pamela Craig.

She advises you wait ten minutes before you quickly jump into a spa after another client. Washington safety and sanitation law requires circulating spas to have surfaces remain wet with disinfectant for 10 minutes before another client uses the spa. Spa Paradiso drains the water after every client and fills it back up with barbicide water for 15 minutes.

""If you just see them drain the tub and you don't see them fill it up with anything else that would be a red flag,"" said Sara Wilhaite.","There are many indicators to make sure your salon is following safety and sanitation laws.

The workers, who spend their days moving around on trucks collecting garbage, say with the dangerous and harsh nature of their jobs, they should at least be compensated a little bit more.

""A we a the backbone for the work, me deh yah from $400 a day, and a just $1,000 and little bit me a get now, how much years me deh yah,"" said one sanitation worker who has been with the NSWMA since 2007.

""We not getting any good pay, we not comfortable. First of all, we come six o'clock a morning and come off late like four or five in the evening. We don't get no pay for overtime, we work double on Sunday. We concern about them thing deh because we have children going to school, we have to eat,"" said one woman who has been working for the company for seven years.

LATE PAYMENT

The workers also complained that on numerous occasions their salaries were paid late, and expressed concern that they get no fringe benefits, with the absence of a health insurance scheme among their main concerns.

""We no have nothing fi get. If drum drop on you them goodly pay you all three fortnight and forget about you. We have it hard, man,"" said one worker from the side of the truck he works on.

He charged that basic tools were not being provided by the NSWMA, with workers having to go into their pockets to purchase basic items like gloves.

""All months before we get a pair a gloves. Them give we shoes and uniform and the shoes mash up because them no good. We no get no toilet paper, we no get nothing to wash we hands. When you go to them you have to a beg, and them still nah give you nothing,"" said another worker.

""We have fi deh pon the truck in a the boiling sun. We have to deh behind it a throw rubbish in a it and if we don't go out go work the truck cannot move. So why the driver them must get more pay than we and a we a do the work. We nah get nothing, them a get everything,"" said another sideman.

Responding to the concerns of the workers, executive director of the NSWMA, Audley Gordon, told The Sunday Gleaner that he wants to see them paid more because what they are getting now, approximately $1,240 per day, is woefully inadequate.

""We want them to have a better quality of life overall and I'm trying my utmost best. I can tell you that there are conversations going on as it relates to their salary but it's not something that I can just do, as you can well imagine, it has budgetary implications, but there are conversations going on,"" said Gordon.

He admitted that the workers have been paid late at times, but said this was due to a glitch in the information technology system.

""The late payments are unfortunate. The money is already small so we don't want to be embarrassing you by having you wait too long for it. It is not something that we are happy to even talk about.

""We would hope that they would get their pay before it is even due sometimes. The truth is that sometimes it is beyond our control,"" added Gordon.

SUPPLYING UNIFORMS

Gordon noted that uniforms were introduced for the workers in 2017, and said he is working to ensure that they get another set soon.

""I'm not surprised at the shoes. I'm not surprised at the uniforms because of the conditions under which they work. They are not in offices, they are out there in mud and water, and so their uniforms would naturally not stand up, especially the boots, for any long time.

""We are looking forward to being able to outfit them with uniforms this year again,"" said Gordon.

With the workers charging that the truck drivers are being treated better than them because they have union to speak on their behalf, Gordon said he doesn't think a union is necessary to get improvements for these workers.

According to Gordon, he has asked the workers for patience and understanding as he has vowed to see them get a more liveable wage before his three-year contract expires in 2019.

""I want them to understand that they are our first responders; they are not a secondary arrangement. They are our primary focus and we are going to ensure that before long they will get their next set of uniforms.

""This one is more out of my range but I'm hoping that before long they will see improvement in their wages, too,"" added Gordon.

Many of us are able to enjoy our fresh-squeezed juice straight from our own backyard trees. However, be we urban or rural dwellers, we are not the only creatures that enjoy the ripe fruit hanging on our trees. Rattus rattus, the naked-tailed roof rat, a nonnative but ubiquitous local resident, has a fondness for many of our backyard fruits with a special affinity for oranges.

Nationwide, roof rats (sometimes called black rats) and Norway rats are estimated to cause $19 billion in damage to fruit and nut crops annually. Although, both types of rats live in San Diego County, because of their wide ranging territory and climbing ability, roof rats are the primary culprits when it comes to backyard fruit damage. They are typically active at night and forage from dusk to dawn. Roof rats damage trees in two ways. They can feed on and girdle the bark of a young tree’s trunk or the mature tree’s newly produced limbs. They also feed on the fruit in a very characteristic way. The roof rat will gnaw on the ripe fruit, opening a 2-3 inch hole in the rind. They feed on the pulp and seeds within the fruit and what they leave behind becomes host to insects, such as fruit flies.

The University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources Division (UCANR) Pest Notes 74106 recommends using a three-pronged approach to managing outdoor rat populations: sanitation, rodent proofing and population control. Sanitation is fundamental to rat control. Keep the area around your fruit trees free of debris. Harvest fruit when it is ripe and remove any damaged or split fruit. Pick up any fruit that has fallen to the ground. Do not leave dog or cat food outside overnight. Clear your backyard of existing or potential nesting areas.

Roof rats prefer to build their nests of sticks and leaves elevated off of the ground. Some of San Diego’s most popular landscaping plants can provide the rodent with ideal nesting spots. English and Algerian ivy; honeysuckle and passion fruit vine, because of their dense understory; Bougainvillea, with its thorny branches and raised, spreading platforms; and oleander, because of its thick leaf structure are commonly used for nesting. Any dense shrub or thick slope cover may harbor a rat’s nest, so thinning these ornamental areas is an important feature in rodent management. Trim dense shrubs at least a foot off of the ground to deny Rattus rattus the invisibility it needs to feel secure. Place piles of wood or building materials on raised platforms and store them away from the walls of the house.

By following these guidelines, you will be eliminating the roof rat’s easy access to food and shelter, making your backyard a less attractive place for these uninvited guests. Continued monitoring of your backyard fruit trees and landscaping is required as rat populations can explode quickly. Unmanaged, your orchard’s rats will eventually move into your house.

Good sanitation practices alone will never completely eliminate the problem of rats in backyard fruit trees. In addition to good sanitation practices, a regimen of rodent proofing is recommended. Rat guards, homemade or purchased, are sheets of thin, pliable metal at least 18 inches tall that can be placed around the base of the tree to prevent rats from being able to get a good foothold for climbing. Remove the branches from your tree that extend to any nearby plants. Rats will use these as bridges to access your fruit. Try to maintain a space of at least 24 inches between your tree and the surrounding landscaping to inhibit the rat’s ability to jump across the span. Open up the interior of your tree to create a greater visibility, something your night visitor would rather avoid.

While the most effective form of management is to limit food and shelter, direct population control is often necessary. Snap traps are the safest and most effective means of removing rats from your backyard landscape and orchard area. Snap-traps should be of an appropriate size. A wide variety of attractive food baits are utilized with snap traps, such as nuts, dog kibble or dried fruit. Baits need to be secured to the trigger so that the rat will need to pull on it to collect its prize. Peanut butter, if used, should be placed underneath the bait. Its scent will attract your target but if left on top it can be licked off by the rat without disturbing the trigger.

While it is generally recommended that animals should not be trapped in devices that capture them alive, in some situations live trapping may be more successful. Note that it is illegal under California law to move a live-trapped animal from your property to another location. Live trapped animals must be euthanized humanely. UCANR Pest Note 74106 recommends using plastic gloves when working around an animal carcass, placing the dead animal in a plastic bag and disposing of it in a trash can with a tight-fitting lid. Check with your local waste service company for any prohibitions.

Toxic baits for rat control are sold at retail stores. The baits are poisonous and can pose a hazard to children, pets and wildlife. If toxic baits are used, carefully read and follow the directions on the product label. UC Pest Note 74106 Rats provides more information on the use of toxic baits for rat control.

With good sanitation methods and implementation of rodent proofing and population control strategies, backyard orchardists can keep the uninvited vertebrate pest at a manageable level while preserving their fruit crop for themselves and their friends.

The sun was out on Sunday, striking in its presence, perhaps because spring has been elusive this season. It was a good day for a bike ride, a walk or a softball game, and it was Earth Day — a day to celebrate the Earth. But for some, the warm and windless morning was instead an opportunity to make a difference in their community. As cars raced down Route 106 in East Norwich and Oyster Bay, a group of eighth- grade boys wearing T-shirts that read, “Life is a journey, not a destination,“ focused on one thing — garbage.

A black umbrella. A discarded yogurt container. Countless plastic bags.

The wooded side of the road was filled with all kinds of garbage, some of it trapped under a cascade of snarled branches, which the boys worked hard to free. The town-owned property is south of James H. Vernon School, which they once attended. Now most travel down Route 106 during the week to reach Oyster Bay High School, a few miles away.

“I kept seeing the garbage when I was on the bus going to school, and I wondered who was going to clean it up,” said Patrick Walsh, 14, of Oyster Bay. “I decided my friends and I should clean it up, because no one else is doing it.”

Most were unaware that it was Earth Day, said Patrick’s mother, Vicki Walsh, a former Oyster Bay-East Norwich PTA president.

But Jack Hardiman, 14, of East Norwich, said he knew what day it was. “It’s important to keep the Earth clean and help out the community,” he said, dropping a can into the big black garbage bag that Walsh held open. “This is something you feel good about doing, and it makes me happy.”

An empty bag of fertilizer. A Jack Martins County Executive sign. More plastic bags.

Vicki Walsh said she wondered why there are clean-ups at Theodore Roosevelt Park Beach, the annual events the Town of Oyster Bay and other nonprofit organizations lead on Earth Day weekend. “There’s not garbage there — it’s here,” she said, holding open the bag once again to allow one of the boys to drop a couple of Poland Spring bottles inside.

The boys didn’t really notice when a car driven by Genella McGrath pulled over to the side of the road. Opening her window, she handed a box of donuts to Walsh. “I applaud this — way to go boys,” she exclaimed, adding that she was a graduate of Oyster Bay High School and a former president of the East Norwich Civic Association. “I saw the boys when I was on my way to Dunkin’ Donuts. What a great thing they’re doing.”

Dirt flew into the air when two boys yanked a big orange Home Depot bucket out from under a pile of dead tree branches, which snapped. Annother boy cautiously carried a bottle of what appeared to be urine. This cleanup clearly was not for the faint at heart.

Ellen O’Neill, who was there to supervise the seven boys with Walsh, said it was important for them to take ownership of the community service. She said she believed the experience would build character. “Doing something like this makes an impact on your life,” she said, adding that she has always participated in community service projects, even in college. “If you volunteer in childhood, you do so as an adult.”

William Iannetta, 14, of Oyster Bay, said he had done beach cleanups in the past, although never on Earth Day. Then he paused to survey the wooded area, which remained filled with all kinds of garbage. “I think that every little bit helps. If we could get a few groups a day to do this, it would slowly clean up the Earth.”

O’Neill said that people living in the area have complained for years about the garbage, but most didn’t know who to complain to. She has never seen anyone cleaning the area. “And from what I’m seeing today,” she said, “I’d say no one ever does.”

Walsh grew up in Queens, where, she said, everyone expected to see garbage. “I always say, doesn’t it bother people here to see this?” she said. “You drive up to this beautiful hamlet and this is what you see — garbage.”

A tire. Some beer bottles and even more plastic bags.

The boys were getting closer to the strip mall where there’s a Stop & Shop. They had been hard at work for nearly two hours. But none seemed to notice.

“You can sit here and keep complaining about it or do something,” Walsh said. “Look, there’s a trail that goes to Vernon. How cool would it be if it looked nice?”","It was a good day for a bike ride, a walk or a softball game, and it was Earth Day — a day to celebrate the Earth.

Under the international standards, the acceptable MPN should be less than 1 up to less than 10 MPN.

This means that the pollution in the creek is way beyond the acceptable limit, and all the oxygen has been used up. Under such condition, no fish would ever survive because it has to compete with billions of bacteria.

Conga Creek is among the 48 creeks under the Adopt an Estero Program of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and other private and government agencies.

The program helps communities improve their living conditions through science and technology interventions in health and nutrition, water and sanitation, basic education and literacy, livelihood/economic enterprise development and disaster-risk reduction and climate-change adaptation.

The partners in the Adopt an Estero Program also committed to support each other in the following areas: information and education campaigns, community mobilization and other activities that would foster harmonious relations.

They will also work together in decongesting the pilot site of garbage dumps and introduce interventions, which are aligned with the DENR’s recommended measures, such as the planting of bamboo and other plant species along the river banks and other activities.

The other agency-partners in the Conga Creek cleanup are the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) and the departments of Public Works and Highways, Interior and Local Government and of Health.

There are around 273 waterways (estero) in the metropolitan area alone, according to the MMDA. It is not uncommon to see polluted waterways in Metro Manila, and the level of pollution has been a concern among environmentalists and other individuals and groups.

By Legislator Anker's Office Published: April 24 2018

Suffolk County Legislator Sarah Anker announces a partnership with Stony Brook University’s School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences and Suffolk County’s Environmental Planning Department to create a Marine Debris Education Awareness Program.

Stony Brook, NY - April 24, 2018 - Suffolk County Legislator Sarah Anker announces a partnership with Suffolk County Legislator Sarah Anker announces a partnership with Stony Brook University ’s School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences and Suffolk County’s Environmental Planning Department to create a Marine Debris Education Awareness Program.

Our oceans have a system of currents driven by the global wind system and by the movement of water due to differences in temperature and salinity called Gyres. The ocean currents can take plastic and garbage debris, released from ships and land, great distances to reach Gyres, where the plastics accumulate to form “garbage patches”.

A massive garbage patch the size of Mexico was recently discovered in the South Pacific Ocean. This is in addition to the North Pacific Garbage Patch found in 1997, measuring a million square miles in size, and the North Atlantic Patch located off the coast of Long Island. The floating plastic debris particles can be microscopic in size, making it difficult to clean up. Over 8 million tons of plastic trash ends up in our oceans every year, and 90% of seabirds and marine life consume the debris, which can then be consumed by humans.

In 2015, Legislator Anker co-sponsored legislation to ban microbeads in Suffolk County. Microbeads are tiny plastic particles found in personal care products, which were banned nationally, following Suffolk County’s lead, after research showed not only were microbeads bad for our environment but a health concern for people.

“We all must be accountable and take an active role to prevent and repair the damage that has been done to our marine ecosystem that directly effects our global environment,” said Legislator Anker. “To address this issue, I have facilitated a partnership with Stony Brook University’s School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences and Suffolk County’s Environmental Planning Department to create a Marine Debris Education Awareness Program.”

Legislation will be submitted this cycle to formalize the partnership, and Legislator Anker will be pursuing Suffolk County’s 477 Water Quality Funds to provide seed money for the program. Dr. Katherine Aubrecht, Director of Coastal Environmental Studies at the Stony Brook University School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences will collaborate with the county to produce presentation materials to be used for educational programs tailored to different audiences on how we can reduce and address ocean pollution.

Aubrecht notes that “Stony Brook’s School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences has a long history of research and education on plastic waste in the oceans and we look forward to partnering with Suffolk County.”

“We live on an island surrounded by water, which gives us an even greater role in protecting our water. We can all be part of the solution by keeping trash, especially plastic, out of our oceans, and volunteering to clean up our beaches,” said Legislator Anker. “It’s time every person, community, and nation join together to remove the ocean debris from our waters. We can then breathe easy and hope our marine ecosystem can, too.”

In her time in office, Legislator Anker has supported the approval of over 2000 acres of open space and farm land preservation. Most recently, legislation sponsored by Legislator Anker was unanimously approved to begin appraisal sets for a 9.9 acre wooded parcel near Pine Lake in Middle Island for open space preservation. She also began the legislative process at the General Meeting of the Suffolk County Legislature on March 20, 2018 to approve the preservation of a 3.42 acre parcel near Whiskey Road, adjacent to the Pine Barrens Compatible Growth Area under the Suffolk County Drinking Water Protection Program.","Stony Brook, NY - April 24, 2018 - Suffolk County Legislator Sarah Anker announces a partnership with Suffolk County Legislator Sarah Anker announces a partnership with Stony Brook University ’s School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences and Suffolk County’s Environmental Planning Department to create a Marine Debris Education Awareness Program.

“Most primary health centers in Nigeria lack good washing facilities. At the Lugbe PHC, there is no washing sink in the labor room, so water has to be fetched from the tap outside and brought to the mother. A health worker who wants to wash her hands will have to fetch a bucket. It is not possible for us to do our jobs as midwives without access to water, sanitation, and handwashing stations,” Rita Momoh, a midwife, explains.

Rita lives the everyday challenges caused by the absence of the single most fundamental requirement for basic health care: access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene in health care facilities around the world. Hundreds of thousands of midwives and other health care professionals work in similar conditions.

Rita’s experience is backed up with startling data from the Water Institute at the University of North Carolina. In an analysis of 129,000 health care facilities in the developing world, researchers found more than 65 percent of facilities lack both running water and soap for handwashing. Data from a subset of six countries — Bangladesh, Haiti, Malawi, Nepal, Senegal, and Tanzania — revealed that only 2 percent of their health care facilities have concurrent access to water, sanitation, hygiene, and waste management services.

This on-the-ground reality results in the inability to implement the most basic infection control measures, a situation that not only endangers patients and staff, but also presents a danger to all of us. Health facilities are the epicenters for pandemic containment, but the lack of WASH contributes to further spread of disease, such as the recent outbreak of Lassa fever in West Africa attests.

When it comes to patients, among the most vulnerable are pregnant women and newborns, both at great risk of sepsis — a leading cause of death in hospitals. WaterAid found that half the primary health facilities it surveyed in Nigeria did not even have handwashing facilities in delivery rooms. Midwives like Rita live that reality daily. The organization I founded, the Wellbeing Foundation Africa, interviewed midwives across Nigeria, who told us about delivering babies under appalling conditions that put the lives of infants and mothers at risk. The scope of this problem extends far beyond Nigeria, of course, to a majority of health care facilities in developing countries throughout Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East.

We know that access to WASH in health care facilities is a major global problem, one that is readily solvable, but largely ignored by the international community — until recently. In March, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres recognized the need to address this urgent health concern with the launch of the Water Action Decade and his call to action in which he specifically challenged the global community to achieve universal WASH access in all health care facilities by 2030. The World Health Organization and the U.N. Children’s Fund will lead the global charge.

But they cannot achieve success without every one of us. Every person and organization dedicated to better, safer, and more humanitarian health care needs to consider the health workers and their patients whose access to safe health care is deeply diminished by inadequate WASH services.

Regardless of how many vaccines a health care facility has, or how new its technology is, it can never be effective without providing the most basic service of all: WASH. By introducing adequate WASH services in health care settings, we can thwart preventable deaths and achieve universal health coverage.

We must all meet the challenge issued by the U.N. secretary general’s call to action. To start, we must elevate this issue within our own health and WASH programming; reach out to the community leaders with whom we all work; and support local, regional, and national governments and multilateral organizations in their response to the call to action. For example, the Wellbeing Foundation Africa works with Nigerian ministries and agencies, along with WHO, in their commitment to adequate WASH services in health care facilities throughout Nigeria. This fundamental issue is one that is solvable, but it will not be solved by any single sector. Health, development, finance, and government must commit.

More specific action items include: using WHO’s washinhcf.org website for resources and exemplars to model your programming; capturing lessons learned and documenting best practices for data sharing; advocating for increased financing for WASH in health care facilities; and utilizing a risk-based management approach and a health systems approach by implementing WHO and UNICEF’s WASH FIT tool. Moreover, USAID and other development institutions should insist that every health care facility they are involved with has access to WASH, or a clear, financed plan to make that happen.

As we join the international community on May 5 in observing World Hand Hygiene Day and the International Day of the Midwife, it’s clear the themes of both days are deeply interconnected. We in the global health and development communities can no longer stand by in silence while mothers and newborns die from preventable and unnecessary complications, simply because the most basic of WASH services are not available.","Rita lives the everyday challenges caused by the absence of the single most fundamental requirement for basic health care: access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene in health care facilities around the world.

It was a crisis that made international headlines as health-care workers scrambled to provide care. Yet for the doctors, nurses and midwives struggling to provide care inside tens of thousands of health-care facilities around the world, having no water and sanitation is just a routine day.

When the University of North Carolina Water Institute reviewed recent data from more than 129,000 health-care facilities in 78 low- to middle- income countries, its researchers found an appalling 66 percent of health-care facilities in low and middle-income countries lacking running water and soap; not surprising, sanitation also desperately lags with a third of health-care facilities without basic sanitation.

As we lead up to Mother’s Day, consider how this routine absence of water, sanitation and hygiene [WASH] in health-care facilities is particularly treacherous for mothers and newborns. Back in Manchester, one mother whose three-day-old daughter was in neonatal intensive care, told reporters, “We can’t sterilise anything … I can’t even boil water to sterilise my equipment to express milk.”

Around the world, the first day of life is when more than 40 percent of maternal and newborn deaths and stillbirths occur. Sepsis claims the lives of one million newborns and up to 100,000 women during and after pregnancy every year, according to the World Health Organization, WHO. Even though it is an easily prevented infection resulting from poor hygiene, sepsis is largely overlooked as a chief cause of maternal and newborn deaths and complications.

Perhaps it is no coincidence that just before Mother’s Day, May 5 is shared by World Hand Hygiene Day and International Day of the Midwife. All these “days” offer an opportunity to amplify this fundamental gap in global health care. I hope the absence of WASH in health-care facilities may finally be breaking through the global silence.

On World Water Day (March 22), UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, made an unprecedented announcement, followed by an endorsement from World Health Organization Director General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Citing the UNC data, Secretary Guterres said, “Today, I am using the launch of the Water Action Decade to make a global call to action for water, sanitation and hygiene in all health care facilities…We must work to prevent the spread of disease. Improved water, sanitation and hygiene in health facilities is critical to this effort."" His office is to follow with a large initiative. WHO’s Director General quickly joined in, ""We can’t expect #HealthForAll without these essentials. We support the global call to action for water, sanitation and hygiene in ALL health care facilities.""

These are welcome words; until now, like water, leadership has been missing. But this issue is not a single sector problem and it does not have a single sector solution. The U.S. government, multi-laterals, NGOs, private sector, donors and local governments need to plan and finance policies and programs that prioritize and maintain sustainable WASH in all health care settings.

In the U.S., we have an opportunity to further elevate the federal government’s significant, recent focus on the importance of water. The U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, released the first ever U.S. Global Water Strategy , which coordinates 17 U.S. government agencies, and private partners, around global water security. As USAID goes through a redesign proposed by Administrator Mark Green, it is essential to keep the priority for clean water and sanitation for their obvious tie to health, nutrition, economic opportunity, empowering women and so much more.

Let us not forget that disease and pandemics know no borders; prevention is the key. In the next decade, 48 countries are predicted to face water shortages according to the United Nations. The effort to shore up health-care facilities is wise and urgent. Absent this prioritization, conditions are going to further decline — with even more broken pumps and dry faucets, dirty hands and medical staff struggling daily to prevent the spread of illness and disease in facilities meant to cure.

William Reilly was administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under President George H. W. Bush. He is chairman emeritus and former president of World Wildlife Fund; co-chair of the Global Water Challenge; and established a fund to invest in water in developing countries.","All these “days” offer an opportunity to amplify this fundamental gap in global health care.

Savio Carvalho is Global Campaigns Director, WaterAid

LONDON, May 10 2018 (IPS) - They are the foundations of a happy, healthy childhood: good nutrition, health care which includes immunisations and preventative care as well as treatment for illness, a good education.

How many among us would even think to list clean water to drink, a safe place to go to the toilet and the ability to keep hands, bodies and surroundings clean with soap and water?



Yet far too many children are deprived of these, affecting their health, education and life chances. Some 480,000 children under five die each year of diarrhoea, more than half of these directly linked to poor water, sanitation and hygiene.

And 880,000 children under five die each year of pneumonia – which also has links to dirty water, poor sanitation and poor hygiene.

The solutions are familiar, and close to home. New research by WaterAid and PATH’s Defeat DD initiative has found that combining clean water, decent household toilets and good hygiene with routine childhood vaccinations and nutrition support could potentially save the lives of nearly 700,000 young children and prevent billions of harmful bouts of diarrhoeal illness and pneumonia in under-fives each year.

Produced by WaterAid and PATH’s Defeat Diarrheal Disease (Defeat DD) Initiative, this new analysis is published in the report Coordinate, Integrate, Invest: how joint child health and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions can deliver for your country’s future.

Our modelling shows that if every child in the world had access to clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene including handwashing with soap, along with routine rotavirus immunisation and other nutritional interventions such as zinc supplementation and breastfeeding, we could cut the rate of deaths from pneumonia and diarrhoea by half, and reduce incidences of diarrhoea and pneumonia by two-thirds.

That is millions of episodes of illness. Imagine what that would mean for these young children, their parents, and the impact on the health care system.

Specifically, ensuring 100% coverage with water, sanitation and hygiene, rotavirus vaccination and nutritional interventions such as breastfeeding promotion and zinc supplements could potentially reduce illness by nearly two thirds (63%) and almost halve the number of child deaths (49%) from diarrhoea and pneumonia.

None of this requires new technology or invention. It requires coordination, the integration of programmes for health and nutrition and for clean water, sanitation and hygiene, and investment to make it happen.

It’s not just a matter of health – it’s also a matter of wealth. For every US$1 invested in water and sanitation globally, there is a US$4.3 return in the form of reduced healthcare costs.

Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia that have not tackled child stunting are facing punishing economic losses of up to 9-10% of GDP per capita, due to the potential lost in children who are stunted. Combining actions on health, nutrition and water, sanitation and hygiene could help to create a more productive workforce and economic growth, lifting countries out of poverty.

The report also highlights examples of where countries are making good progress with integrating health, nutrition, water and sanitation efforts. In Madagascar, for example, the government is using this kind of coordination to tackle high rates of malnutrition.

In Nepal, promoting good hygiene during health clinic visits for rotavirus vaccinations is improving parents’ knowledge and actions around food safety, handwashing and safe disposal of children’s faeces, while also improving immunisation coverage and helping to reach those families hardest to reach because of remote locations and poverty.

If children are to grow and thrive, they need clean water, good sanitation and good hygiene alongside good healthcare, vaccinations and good nutrition. Each year, nearly 300,000 young children die of diarrhoea directly linked to dirty water, poor toilets and poor hygiene, and the greatest tragedy of all is that we know how to address this.

This study adds to the evidence that the lives of hundreds of thousands of young children could be saved each year if these pillars of development were combined with other health interventions.

WaterAid and Defeat DD are calling on governments and donors to align child health and water, sanitation and hygiene programmes, policies and financing to address this unnecessary health crisis more effectively and more efficiently. These investments create a positive cycle that builds human capital, strengthens economies, reduces future healthcare costs and contributes to national development.

This July the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 6 – to deliver water and sanitation to everyone, everywhere by 2030 – comes under review in New York. We are calling on decision-makers to make water, sanitation and hygiene a priority, because they are essential to child health, nutrition and the success of the next generation.","How many among us would even think to list clean water to drink, a safe place to go to the toilet and the ability to keep hands, bodies and surroundings clean with soap and water?

Clean water and sanitation is one of the important constituents of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which is a 15 year agenda (2015-2030) adopted by UN in 2015. Clean Water and Sanitation figuring at serial 6 of SDG stresses on water, sanitation and hygiene also called WASH. In-fact access to safe water and sanitation are human rights, as recognized in 2010 by the UN General Assembly. Recently Greater Kashmir carried a news article titled “Doodh Ganga, drinking water source for Budgam, Srinagar areas, turned into dumping site”. Having spent my childhood on the banks of Doodh Ganga locally called Chaz Kull, I feel horrified and traumatized today when I happen to pass through the banks of this Kull. I remember how much fascinated we used to feels as kids while enjoying swimming in Doogh Ganga during summer months. Today as we claim to have become much developed and educated , my head bows down in shame when I see all the solid and liquid waste finding its way into Doodh Ganga. The worst part of it is that this polluted water continues to be lifted at Doodh Ganga water treatment plant located at Kralpora in the outskirts of Srinagar. The said water is supplied to a huge population in Srinagar. On one side United Nations and Governments across the world stress upon better sanitation, scientific waste management and supply of safe drinking water to people, authorities on the other hand along with local population of Chadoora continue to dump solid and liquid waste into the waters of Doodh Ganga.

Doodh Ganga Water Supply scheme

As Srinagar city started expanding by late 1960s there was a demand to have another water supply scheme for Srinagar other than the one at Nishat. In the year 1972 unit 1st of Doodh Ganga water treatment plant was commissioned at Kralpora Chadoora. With the passage of time three more units were added to this plant. On one hand all the fecal matter , solid and liquid waste right from Branwar to Kralpora via Surasyar, Dadompora, Zoohama, Sogam, Chadoora, Wathoora enters into waters of Doodh Ganga and on the other hand same water is lifted at Kralpora. After some so called treatment by chlorination, this water is supplied to residential areas like Chanapora , Gulshan Nagar , Natipora , Jawahar Nagar , Rajbagh , Wanbal , Rangreth , Rawalpora, Pir Bagh, Hyderpora, Burzulla, Parray Pora upto Tengpora bridge plus several areas in Budgam district as well. I believe out of Srinagar’s 15 lakh population, at least 6 to 7 lakh people take water supplied from Doodh Ganga. As a consumer I want to ask Public Health Engineering department (PHE), can your chlorination and filtration at Kralpora plant make Doodh Ganga water safe for drinking ? Carcasses of animals like cattle , dogs are seen floating in this nallah , hundreds of lavatories enter into it , plus all the solid and liquid waste is also thrown into Doodh Ganga , is it possible PHE can make this water clean ? I am not blaming PHE alone but we all are collectively responsible for this mess. Had our planners and engineers set up Doodh Ganga plant in the upper reaches of Chadoora in early 70s, I think situation would have been different today. Liver ailments, cancers, kidney diseases and other gastro intestinal diseases are at rise and I can say with authority that intake of unhygienic water is one of the important factors for occurrence of these diseases.

Chlorine and Cancer

In almost 100 % of Government water supply schemes in Jammu & Kashmir chlorine is used in abundant quantity. I am not an authority to speak on this issue , but after some internet search I found some astonishing facts about excessive use of Chlorine in water which our public health experts / researchers need to look into. We don’t use chlorine because it’s the safest or even the most effective means of disinfection, we use it because it is the cheapest. In spite of all our technological advances, we essentially still pour bleaching powder in our water before we drink it. The long term effects of chlorinated drinking water have just recently being recognized. According to the U.S. Council of Environmental Quality, “Cancer risk among people drinking chlorinated water is 93% higher than among those whose water does not contain chlorine. Dr. Joseph Price wrote a highly controversial book in the late sixties titled Coronaries/Cholesterol/Chlorine. He concluded that nothing can negate the incontrovertible fact, the basic cause of atherosclerosis and resulting entities such as heart attacks and stroke, is chlorine.

Conclusion

In order to provide safe drinking water to people , J&K Economic Reconstruction Agency (ERA) has achieved 95 % physical progress on laying of Raw water pipeline from higher reaches of Doodh Ganga Nowhaar to Kralpora water treatment plant. Now water from Doodh Ganga will be lifted at Nowhaar which is 18 kms up Kralpora. It is given to understand that by the end of May 2018, 12 Million Gallons ( 12 MG) of fresh water will be lifted at Nowhaar every day and out of it 10 MG / day will be supplied to Kralpora plant. This water after treatment will be supplied to areas already mentioned above. 2 MG of raw water will be supplied to small water supply schemes around Chadoora as well.

Nowhaar is not the last village located on the banks of Doodh Ganga. There are more than half a dozen habitations like Bonyaar, Pethyaar, Surasyaar, Check Surasyaar, Brenwar etc where from water comes down to newly established mega water supply scheme at Nowhaar. Population in these habitations will increase in the coming years. Right now lot of fecal matter , solid and liquid waste continues to enter Doodh Ganga around these habitations especially in rainy season. Immediate attention of authorities is sought on following points :

Government in order to ensure supply of safe drinking water to Srinagar , Chadoora and adjoining areas must declare these villages Open Defecation Free (ODF) and small Sewerage Treatment Plants (STPs) must be established in all these villages / habitations so that not even 5 % of the liquid waste enters into Doodh Ganga. Scientific solid and liquid waste management programme must be put in place in Chadoora town and adjoining villages as well. Research on side effects of excessive use of Chlorine during water purification must be conducted. No more water be lifted from Doodh Ganga at Kralpora after commissioning of Nowhaar water supply scheme.","Recently Greater Kashmir carried a news article titled “Doodh Ganga, drinking water source for Budgam, Srinagar areas, turned into dumping site”.

In a nation the size of India, achieving the goals of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (the Clean India Mission) is of a magnitude that is difficult for the average person to comprehend. President Modi understands that a holistic approach that includes sanitation projects is necessary to provide a consistent and adequate supply of clean water. The health and well-being of the country will improve in correlation with the success of the Clean India Mission.

Note: The objectives of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan include more than clean water. The Mission, which is expected to cost $9 billion USD, is a comprehensive sanitation campaign.

On 04 May, the government announced the Ministry of Water Resources had created the National Water Informatics Center (NWIC) to “empower, inform, and enrich every citizen with up-to-date and reliable water data” within an online, public domain platform.

In a press release issued today, 10 May 2018, Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Shri Nitin Gadkari, told a press conference in New Delhi “We hope to clean 70 to 80 percent of the Ganga by March 2019.”

He explained that “Real time monitoring of pollutions is being done in 938 industries. 211 [others] have been identified which are causing pollution in Ganga.” In addition, he noted that “251 Gross Polluting Industries (GPI) have been closed and closure directions have been issued to non-complying GPIs” and that “Almost all the 4470 villages on the bank of Ganga are now Open Defecation Free (ODF).”

His address included update information on progress on a variety of other components of the Mission, including the creation and/or rehabilitation of sewage treatment plants, construction of individual family toilet facilities, and the placement of real-time water quality monitoring stations in strategic locations.

A second press release issued 10 May 2018 cited the depletion of water availability in the nation’s 91 major reservoirs. This has been a continuing problem for many countries around the globe and one that is not easily resolved.

The total amount of reservoir water reserves is at 20% of capacity, down 2% from 03 May 2018. The reserves are 8% lower than the average amount available for the past decade and 12% lower than the amount available during the same period in 2017. A country with the size and varying topography and climates of India the national average may not be a clear indication of regional averages.

Region Reservoirs Capacity BCM Available BCM % % 2017 Avg. % 10-yr Avg. Northern 6 18.01 3.19 18% 24% 26% Eastern 15 18.83 5.85 31% 37% 25% Western 27 31.26 6.36 20% 25% 25% Central 12 42.30 10.94 26% 34% 23% Southern 31 51.59 6.85 13% 8% 18%

While the overall situation is consistent with the water crises in other major countries, the Southern Region has experienced a 5% increase in volume over last year and the Eastern and Central Regions’ reservoirs are experiencing an increase in volume of 6% and 3% respectively.

The “miracle” of completing a project like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in an entire country is not accomplished by waving a magic wand. It is achieved by a concerted and cohesive that continues until the work is done. Progress and patience will have their reward.

115,https://www.greenhousegrower.com/production/how-greenhouse-sanitation-helps-you-start-clean-and-stay-clean/,"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 07:24:57 GMT",Greenhouse Grower,How Greenhouse Sanitation Helps You Start Clean and Stay Clean,"Preventive cleaning reduces the risk of pathogens and disease and establishes the baseline for successful biocontrol use. Alarmingly, some growers I’ve encountered don’t practice sanitation at all. So it’s always good to review how to prepare and sanitize a greenhouse after a crop cycle to ensure your next crop is healthy. For the sake of keeping this from turning into a multi-part series, I will assume you at least clean your floors or tables between crops.

Advertisement

Why Sanitize?

It Saves Money. While sanitation adds an expense, it’s a lot less than the costs of ongoing spray applications to treat pests and pathogens introduced and intensified by unsanitary conditions. What could be prevented with a couple of days of disinfecting and starting clean can turn into costly, curative treatments, increased labor for applicators, decreased production time due to re-entry intervals, or worse — incurable plant viruses resulting in crop loss.

It Preserves Structures, Hard Goods, Etc. A grower with wooden benches probably knows what algae and moss will do if left unchecked season after season. The same can be said about fertilizer injectors, boom irrigation, and many other watering systems using an unsanitary source. Biofilm accumulation in lines is one of the leading causes of costly irrigation repairs in older systems.

It’s Safer. I’ve encountered algae patches on walkways that would make banana peels jealous. Add in the usual tangled water hose (also covered in algae) and you’re one viral video-worthy fall away from a trip to the hospital with a work-related injury.

How to Reset After a Greenhouse Crop

Once shipping has finished and the greenhouse is empty, it’s time to start creating a sanitary environment for the next crop.

Don’t Procrastinate. I’m going to assume we all know about common disease and insect vectors (weeds, incoming plant material, tools, etc.). But many growers make the mistake of waiting through the off-season, then cleaning their houses just before production starts. This approach allows many weeds, pests, and diseases to overwinter.

Clean Up the Clutter. Before disinfecting ceilings, walls, benches, or floors in the greenhouse, remove all remaining containers, tools, employee garbage, etc. from the greenhouse. Sweep tables, benches, and floors, and remove and clean all water hoses, sprinkler heads, and other watering devices. Also, use this time to fix uneven spots in the floor or replace missing groundcover.

Weed. Start by manually pulling/digging large and problematic weeds before they go to seed, both inside and around the outside of the greenhouse. Next, apply preferred and approved herbicides (pre and post emergent). Heat treatments are an option for those who wish to avoid herbicide treatments, but soil temperature must be kept at 180°F to 200°F for at least 30 minutes to be the most effective.

Disinfect. There are many products available for disinfecting structures, surfaces, and tools. Some of these products are not licensed in all states, and it is up to growers to make sure they are using an approved chemistry for their jurisdictions. Some of these products can also burn plants and should be applied according to label rates, methods of application, and personal protective equipment requirements.

Start with a thorough pressure washing of all walls, benches, and floors. Pay special attention to problematic areas such as corners and around watering systems where algae and liverwort tend to accumulate.

Strip-It Pro, when applied with a foaming attachment, is a great product that penetrates whitewash coatings, biofilm, mineral deposits, and organic loads without scrubbing. Apply with foamer and allow to sit for 5 minutes before rinsing with a high-powered hose.

Next, apply an antibacterial disinfectant to all walls, surfaces, and floors before closing the doors and windows for at least 72 hours. You now have a clean and sterile environment to start your next crop in. If you plan to leave your greenhouse empty all winter, repeat the last step before starting the new crop.

The gifting of two new boreholes to the Ladu community in the capital Juba will help reduce inter-communal tension over scarce water resources in the area. They will also support the irrigation of crops and development of new businesses in nearby villages.

The United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) installed the boreholes near Ilikore and Gwori villages as one of its Quick Impact Projects, which are designed to make a swift and significant impact on the lives of civilians at minimal cost and to help bring communities together.

The two boreholes will supply water to a population of over 12,000 people as well as itinerant cattle keepers. This will help ease historical inter-communal conflict over access to water between Bari, predominantly farmers from Jubek, and Mundari, largely cattle keepers from Terekeka.

Olivia Victoria Davies, UNMISS’ Civil Affairs officer in the Juba Field Office, says the installation of the boreholes would provide alternative sources of clean water to help mitigate conflict, promote peaceful co-existence and improve relationships between the two neighbouring tribes.

“By mitigating conflict, we are protecting the lives of civilians by reducing the number of attacks on the local population: children, women and girls, including the elderly, who cannot adequately protect themselves,” she said.

“I am so proud that I have seen fresh water in our villages today. We used to fetch water from our nearby seasonal streams, and during the dry season we have to excavate the soil to reach the water table,” says Jaqueline Raphael Laku, a resident in the area.

She says building the water points was important strategically, given that both Ilikore and Gwori have no access to the Nile River.

Many communities rely on water from the Nile but this can create risks to people’s health.

“Our children and the elderly often suffer from acute watery diarrhea owing to drinking this contaminated water, because we share it with our goats, sheep and cattle, much as it stagnates when rains stop,” said Jaqueline Raphael Laku.

Kandido Swaka Ladu, Ladu County Commissioner, has one more important request for his people:

“Now you have installed water for my people; what I am requesting is awareness-raising campaign about the use and safety of the boreholes to ensure their longevity and minimize the spread of diseases resulting from unintended water contamination.”","JAMES SOKIRIThe gifting of two new boreholes to the Ladu community in the capital Juba will help reduce inter-communal tension over scarce water resources in the area.

Hundreds are homeless, 47 deaths have been reported and a massive number of livestock have been killed. “The cyclone comes on the heels of a series of natural disasters - severe drought that had left more than half the population in need of humanitarian support and ongoing floods that has destroyed crops, homes and businesses,” said Simon Nyabwengi, Country Director of World Vision’s programmes in Somalia and Somaliland. “We’re concerned about the high number of people who have been displaced by natural disasters and about an outbreak of Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD/cholera) that is threatening people’s lives.” “People urgently need food, shelter, essential household items like blankets and soap, health services and clean water, particularly the families that are displaced and being hosted in schools and temporary camps,” he adds.

Mohamed Abdi, a 57-year-old father of two boys in Warabe Dareeray village, is one of those displaced by the cyclone that has affected 1.2 million people leaving them in need of immediate humanitarian assistance. “I have been living in this village for the last 37 years and have never seen such kind of rain with storms.

It was so new to me and my family, we thought it was the last day of our lives, we prayed and ran to the mosque when the heavy rain started. We have nothing, no food, no water, no blankets, no household items. My wife also died. But we have hope from our God.” According to a World Vision emergency response team that visited affected areas, Cyclone Sagar caused massive livestock deaths, property damage and destroyed roads forcing many families to be displaced. “We visited affected villages of Tijaabo, Waraqadhigta, Tuurka, and Waraabe Dareere which are under Garbo Dadar district in Lughaya, Somaliland. People do not have food. They sit at the mosque, school and madrasas with hope of getting some help. Many water systems were destroyed. People are fetching water from the open rivers with a lot of waste and this is putting them at risk of contracting diseases,” describes Mubarik Mohamoud, the response team leader for World Vision in Somaliland. “All roads have been destroyed and telecommunication network also destroyed, leaving people with no means of communicating or receiving help from relatives using mobile money,” he adds.

World Vision has currently dispatched a response team and a consignment of essential relief items including bedsheets, fabric, clothes, soap, water bottles to support 6,000 people affected by Cyclone Sagar in Somaliland.

The child-focused humanitarian agency is also supporting medical services which have already treated 604 people at two health centres and three mobile clinics in Gargaara, Waraaba dareeray, Garbo dadar and Lughaya. Most of the people were treated for minor injuries.

World vision is appealing for USD 600,000 and will continue to actively engage and work with various organizations and government to support the most vulnerable families with urgent needs.

I found myself wondering this recently as my son and I tidied the family car after a road trip. We’d been driving for only five hours, but we had produced two grocery bags of trash: water bottles, parking stubs, wrappers from lunchtime hoagies, reading material, a roll of Scotch tape, and a ping-pong ball among other miscellany that had accumulated over the short time. It wasn’t unusual. In my family, I’m the one who remembers to clean out the car, so I’m all too familiar with the volume and medley of mess that can be generated in vehicle regularly used by adults and kids.

Advertisement

Yet with companies like Uber, Waymo, and Lyft planning to launch their first generation of self-driving cars as shared taxis, it’s not yet clear who or what will be there to clean up the half-drunk Starbucks cup, wipe down the mystery stickiness on the seat, or handle even less hygienic situations. It’s not just a trivial matter: it’s an issue of sanitation and rider well-being—one more pressing for future users than you might imagine.

Consider the many dimensions of mess. As I thought about mess in cars, I wasn’t just thinking about cleaning up the slightly gross piece of lettuce from my son’s hoagie that had fallen on the floor mats. I was thinking about cleaning up an even grosser kind of mess—the kind that you make if you are carsick.

I have to admit something embarrassing at this point: I am hideously prone to motion sickness. Cars. Boats. Planes. Subways. All of them make me nauseous. Sometimes, the consequences are messy. Reading of any kind makes the problem worse. This includes interacting with screens on mobile devices, which, unfortunately for me, a Carnegie Mellon survey suggests will likely become the most popular activity for self-driving car riders.

I started asking around to find out if other people had thought about motion sickness and self-driving cars. I found University of Michigan researchers Michael Sivak and Brandon Schoettle, two scholars in the vanguard of thinking about robot cars and retching. In a 2015 report, “Motion Sickness in Self-Driving Vehicles,” they concluded that people riding in self-driving cars are more likely to experience motion sickness than people riding in conventional cars. Since motion sickness most often occurs when the movement you feel doesn’t align with the movement you see or otherwise anticipate, the pair saw multiple potential triggers for the ailment more likely to be at play in self-driving cars. Among them: a lack of control over direction and speed of movement, a non-forward-looking gaze, and an increased likelihood of participating in activities like reading, texting, watching videos, or playing games. Because of this, according to the researchers’ calculations, 6 percent to 10 percent of American adults riding in self-driving cars are likely to experience motion sickness often, usually, or always.

Advertisement

Think about that for a moment: At least 1 out of 10 self-driving cars will often contain someone who is experiencing motion sickness. That’s going to mean an awful lot of cleaning up.

Notice that this estimate doesn’t include children or mention pregnant women. Yet they are the first groups that I, and probably most of you, think of when considering who’s most prone to the Technicolor yawns. Most families have some kind of gross story about their kids traveling and tossing cookies. “My son Owen has hurled in the exact same mile marker range on the PA Turnpike, between Mountains and Breezewood, on every road trip to Indiana,” writer Monica Yant Kinney told me about her 10-year-old son. “That’s two pukes per trip, three to four trips per year. He is a pro at using a gallon-sized Ziploc bag. No mess!” Some research also suggests that women may be more prone to motion sickness than men.

It’s already common for passengers to ralph in ride-share vehicles. Typical is the story a graduate student recently told me about a time she ordered a Lyft after an 11-hour flight from Tokyo to Boston. “I’m prone to motion sickness, especially around menstrual stuff,” she said. After the long, exhausting flight, she got into the car with and started chatting with the driver. Then it hit. “All of a sudden, I smelled a floral scent from somewhere in the car, and I started feeling nauseous,” she said. The driver gave her a full bottle of water, which, she said, turned out to be the wrong strategy: “I took a sip of water every time I felt nauseous. Then, I projectile-vomited on myself and the car.” They pulled over, at which point the student opened the door to finish outside.

She said the kindness of the driver—stopping the car, asking her if she needed a minute to breathe, giving her a box of tissues, showing that he wasn’t angry with her—meant a lot in what was an uncomfortable and embarrassing situation. Still, it was all over her and all over the car. She said she apologized profusely. She also said she tipped him $25 on a $25 ride, and thus avoided the $25 to $250 fines that Lyft, Uber, and some municipal taxis are known to allow drivers to collect for such “damages.” After all, it’s on the driver to clean up the mess.

I see self-driving taxis going the way of the Port Authority Bus Terminal bathrooms. Circa 1980. Before they had bathroom attendants.

Motion sickness is only one dimension of the many reasons that people yak in cars. There are also the drunk people, and the babies who spit up, and the people who are ill with gastrointestinal issues. There’s other unexpected discharge, too. One woman recently wrote in the Guardian about giving birth in an Uber: It was, like all births, messy. Sick and injured people are also known to take taxis or rideshares to the hospital instead of calling a pricey ambulance. But average cars, including the driverless models currently in testing, do not have the wipe-clean surfaces of an emergency vehicle’s interior, let alone the plastic-y seat covers of many cabs. Have you ever wondered why New York City taxis have smooth vinyl surfaces instead of molded plush seats of conventional passenger cars? It’s a design decision that comes out of long experience with a wide variety of humans.

Then there are the other body fluids—the ones usually managed in private. In Driverless: Intelligent Cars and the Road Ahead, authors Hod Lipson and Melba Kurman write about autonomous vehicles’ potential to become a kind of rolling No-Tell Motel. In one scenario, they imagine a new line of driverless cars that includes a “bed bus” model, complete with shaded windows for privacy. In other, they imagine a comfortable mobile environment for viewing entertainment on screens or with virtual reality goggles. Naturally, this could include one particular type of media product: porn.

This notion that driverless cars could become pornography hubs on wheels is quite common in futurist circles. Jeffrey Tumlin, a strategist at transportation consultancy Nelson/Nygaard and interim head of the Oakland, California department of transportation, predicts that self-driving cars could become vehicles for prostitution services—essentially fitted out to be self-driving brothels. Putting aside for a moment the very serious questions a sex-on-demand robot car raises about safety and human trafficking, think about the mess. Perhaps these vice cars will specialize. But even so, it’s still not a stretch to imagine that people—teenagers, adulterers, or other couples caught up in the moment—will avail themselves of the perceived privacy of a driverless car during a standard trip. Do you really want to be picked up by a self-driving taxi that has someone’s used condom on the floor?

With all the mess—organic or not—with the potential to build up in shared self-driving cars, it’s hard for me to accept the sleek future many envision for shared autonomous vehicles. Instead, lacking the human drivers, I see self-driving taxis going the way of the Port Authority Bus Terminal bathrooms. Circa 1980. Before they had bathroom attendants.

Some tech has been proposed to deal with preventing some of the mess, including motion sickness. In 2016, Uber filed a patent for a “sensory stimulation system for an autonomous vehicle” designed to combat it with haptic feedback (think lights, vibrations, or bursts of air). Waymo also has patents for devices to curtail motion sickness, including a head-mounted VR device. As someone who’s experienced motion sickness with every VR device I’ve ever tried, I was more optimistic about the Uber strategy.

I spoke with Molly Nix, the UX lead for self-driving Uber cars, and one of only two product designers working on what the company deems the “self-driving Uber human experience,” which includes everything from the app interface to the logistics of motion sickness. As it turns out, Uber’s haptic feedback technology might not become reality. Nix explained that the patent is a reflection of the kinds of things the Uber team is thinking about, but that, “It’s important to remember there is such a thing as overengineering a solution to a problem like motion sickness,” she said. “Nothing beats windows.” Staring outside may be the best remedy for passengers, and choosing when you need to open a window may be better than relying on a hyperdesigned haptic feedback system giving you bursts of air.

But even less thought seems to have been put into cleaning. When I asked Nix what would happen if someone made a call on a porcelain telephone in a self-driving car, she declined to answer. I asked if she and her team talk about it at the office. She again declined to answer. What will any kind of self-driving car garbage cleanup look like in reality? “We are still envisioning what it might look like,” said Nix.

Sarah Abboud, an Uber spokesperson, said that the company doesn’t have a plan for dealing with the aftermath of people getting sick or making other serious messes in self-driving cars, in part because the vehicles Uber’s testing now still have backup human drivers. “Since we have an operator in the car, we have not really explored exactly what that looks like,” Abboud said. She added she imagines that such messes would probably be handled in the same way the company plans to handle general cleaning: dispatching the car to a facility for a human to clean it and get it back on the road. There are currently two operation centers that clean the driverless cars Uber is testing, one in Phoenix and one outside Pittsburgh. Perhaps Uber would create more of those, Abboud suggested.

The same seems to hold for other companies. Waymo, for example, has partnered with rental car titan Avis for routine maintenance of its self-driving vehicles in Phoenix—though the few available details a Waymo spokesperson sent to me simply suggest that cars will “need to be charged and refueled, cleaned, and presentable for riders.” The overview did not include information about how, exactly, this happens. (Lyft did not respond to a request for comment on the cleaning issue.)

It’s possible that companies could program cars to return to a home base for upkeep after every ride. But it’s an unlikely solution considering the potential for wasted time, wasted energy, and increased congestion. Instead, as of now, solutions still seem to rely on human intervention. Someone will likely need to alert Uber or Waymo to any mess in a car. Then someone will need to clean it. (No Roombas for car interiors yet.) Abboud alluded to a potential mechanism that might help Uber’s systems identify such messes in the future, but wouldn’t say if that would be a video camera inside the car or something else. “We don’t really have that figured out yet,” she said.

The lack of strategy from these companies seems to reflect a naïve view of what people are like and of how much invisible labor drivers put in to keep their cars clean. According to Nix, Uber expects passengers to take out their own trash today, and “expect[s] that to continue for self-driving ride-sharing.” But that ignores the way the dynamics will inevitably change. Today, people may have social guilt about intentionally littering in the car of a person inches in front of them in the driver’s seat. Even if they don’t, if a passenger leaves the odorous, crumpled remains of a late-night McDonald’s run or a mess of a more biological nature behind in a taxi, a human driver will be there to see it, clean it up, and maybe roll down the windows to air out the car. Oh, and to ding the passenger with a cleanup fee. A human can do these things easily. A robot can’t: There’s no sensor for grime, mess, or stink.

When the driver disappears, we already know what happens: Cars get dirty, smelly, and damaged. Just look at Zipcar, the car-sharing service owned by Avis, which relies on an honor system for cleaning. As Business Insider detailed, Zipcar’s currently got a “D-“ rating from the Better Business Bureau for customer service—and has been struggling for it—in large part because of complaints from users who find their rented cars are dirty and damaged from past use. Sure, customers can report such issues to Zipcar. And, in the future, they may be able to use an app to flag unhygienic cars for Uber or Waymo. But that’s a lot of time and frustration to potentially put on users.

I’m not surprised that companies like Uber don’t have a robust plan to deal with cleanliness. The company seems to exemplify the kind of biased worldview that I call technochauvinism. Technochauvinists tend to prioritize technical issues solved by engineering and math, while overlooking the human factors that shape how platforms or systems can and are used in practice. This results in strategies like pouring millions into developing apps that edge out the competition and computers that get its driverless cars onto the road fast over making sure that, for example, women passengers don’t get harassed or assaulted, or that people like me don’t get physically ill from riding in its cars. However, if you are trying to design a fully autonomous system that involves 2-ton potential killing machines—which is what robot cars are—the stakes are high. Human factors matter a great deal, and not just because humans are the other drivers on the road.

Fortunately, I can also attest that there is one surefire cure that works every time I get motion-sick as a passenger in a car. Instead of riding, I drive.","Who will clean self-driving vehicles?
I started asking around to find out if other people had thought about motion sickness and self-driving cars.
In a 2015 report, “Motion Sickness in Self-Driving Vehicles,” they concluded that people riding in self-driving cars are more likely to experience motion sickness than people riding in conventional cars.
Because of this, according to the researchers’ calculations, 6 percent to 10 percent of American adults riding in self-driving cars are likely to experience motion sickness often, usually, or always.

These are but few of the technologies displayed at an exhibition being held at the Department of Science and Technology here.

The exhibition was inaugurated by Prof Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary DST on May 7 as part of a fortnight long Swachhata Pakhwada programme to showcase the technologies that have been developed in the country to address the problem areas in sanitation and cleanliness.

Prof Sharma said the technologies that have been developed over the years with funding and other support from DST would also come up for discussions being held with scientists and experts as part of the Pakhwada with a view to promote their widespread use.

Vigyan Prasar, Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC), Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC), Technology Missions Division (TMD), Science for Equity, Empowerment & Development (SEED), Indo-U.S. Science and Technology Forum (IUSSTF), National Entrepreneurship Board (NEB) and National Innovation Foundation - India (NIF) are participating in the exhibition, besides several NGOs working in the area of sanitation.

Godasu Narsimha Pallesrujana is an innovator, who has developed a water hyacinth removal machine. The machine, consisting of a five hp electric motor, has been found to have been very useful to fishermen as it has significantly reduced the labour and cost that was consumed during the traditional method of manual removal of hyacinth from water bodies using cutters.

Another interesting exhibit on display is a machine to make bricks out of fly ash. It has been developed by Arjunbhai M. Paghdar from Junagadh, Gujarat. The machine can efficiently undertake all operations like soil lump breaking, raw material mixing and brick making. It can make 140-150 blocks (of size 15 x 9 x 7 inches) per hour. It can be used for making both conventional and interlocking bricks of different sizes by changing the mould. It eliminates the need to employ woman and child labour in the brick making process.

Prem Ranjan Singh, Shivani Singh and Ankush Pal from Daman and Diu have developed an innovative dustbin. Unable to bear the sight of overflowing garbage bins, the three friends have come up with a dustbin with separate slots for biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste plus a message sending facility. A message would be despatched to the municipality automatically once the dustbin is filled up to a preset level.

The Department of Science & Technology is observing the Swachhata Pakhwada from May 1 to 15. Other activities planned during the programme include expert talks and stakeholders consultations on clean water, clean air, clean energy and waste management. Child innovators will also showcase their innovations and prototype models for Swachhata on May 14 at Technology Bhawan.

The event marked the first global CRS Community Day, where CRS staff around the world work in service and solidarity with people they serve on community projects. As part of the event, Monrovia City Mayor Jefferson T. Koijee officially handed over three public latrines, rehabilitated by CRS, to the West Point Township.

Mayor Koijee lauded CRS for renovating the three latrines, which had been in disrepair for several years. Mayor Koijee said, “These latrines will greatly help the struggling residents of West Point,” and that he wants “the residents of West Point take full responsibility of consistently maintaining the cleanliness of these latrines.”

It is anticipated that at least 1,000 community members will utilize each facility daily, improving their access to high quality, well-managed water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities that will provide services for defecation, hand washing, and bathing. Latrines selected for major rehabilitation were Roadside Bathhouse, Battlefield Bathhouse, and Riverside Bathhouse.

CRS developed a participatory approach, working with local communities’ skilled workers as a means of creating jobs and financial empowerment for locals, increasing their sense of ownership of the project, and improving the quality of maintenance for long-term project sustainability through the involvement of the direct project beneficiaries.

In addition to the latrines’ rehabilitation, two water wells were restored, to provide water for the operation of the latrines; water storage and hand washing barriers, with stands attached, were also provided to support good hand hygiene practices.

CRS Liberia is focused on meeting local demand for WASH services, most specifically in finding sustainable solutions to sanitation problems in high-density, low-resource urban communities through the Cleaner Living through Enhanced Environmental Norms and Sanitation (CLEENS) project.

The CLEENS project will include a research component to be carried out in collaboration with Villanova University, to identify innovative opportunities to improve access to and quality of WASH services for community members living in West Point. Approximately 20,000 community members will directly benefit. The goal is to partly address the most urgent sanitation needs in West Point and other high-density low-resource urban communities so that community dwellers experience improved sanitation, health, and well-being.

CRS is an international humanitarian relief and development organization founded in 1943 by Catholic Bishops of the United States. Since then, CRS has reached more than 120 million people in more than 100 countries on five continents. CRS has been operating in Liberia since 1990, focusing specifically in the sectors of emergency response, health, justice and peace, and agriculture.","The Catholic Relief Services (CRS) in collaboration with Monrovia City Corporation (MCC), West Point Community Empowerment and Sanitation Services Inc., and community members participated in a community cleaning day in West Point as part of the national “Clean Cities” initiative on Saturday, May 6, according to a press release.

Nepalese peacekeepers based at the Rumbek Field Office, while on a five-day patrol in the counties of Meen and Malek, used their time in the area to further improve the water system by repairing a tap handle and adding another two taps to the facilities.

The Nepalese initiative, complementing the previously done plastering and installation of water taps, is expected to make sure that access to clean water is sustained in the long term.

The project implementation as a whole, said Kwame Dwamena Aboagye, head of the Rumbek Field Office, is an excellent example of military and civilian peacekeepers working together to assist the people of the war-torn country of South Sudan.

Mr. Manyang promised to do his part to increase the longevity of the water system by teaching members of nearby communities how to use and maintain it properly.

Pankaj Vir Gupta, José Ramón Barañano, Ambassador of Spain to India, Thomas Katsouleas, Provost of the University of Virginia, Hardeep Singh Puri, Union Minister of Housing and Urban Issues, and Inaki Alday (Left to Right)

Many studies have been conducted in the past on cleaning up the massively polluted Yamuna river and how to reconnect Delhi back to the water. A new study, titled The Yamuna River Project and compiled by Virginia University professors of architecture Inaki Alday and Pankaj Vir Gupta, was released by Hardeep Puri, Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs last week.

It took five years for Inaki and Pankaj to put together a team of government agencies, experts and activists from India partnering with international researchers, experts from Virginia University and students to put together a comprehensive plan. This looked at not only reviving the neglected river but also contained suggestions on how to establish a healthy equilibrium between the river and the city. A five year Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed by the University of Virginia in 2017 with the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) to map out an expansive, multidisciplinary prescription to rehabilitate the pollution-choked Yamuna River.

In May 2017, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Spain, and the two countries issued a joint statement on climate change and water access management. Following up on this, the Spanish Embassy in India partnered with the University of Virginia to offer Spanish expertise in designing smart, sustainable cities. The Embassy also helped to bring together different government bodies to aid and facilitate the research.

Jose Ramon Baranano, Ambassador of Spain in India, said that it was impossible to figure out exact costs, but, “to restore the river, re-imagine the city and develop Delhi as a smart, sustainable city a rough estimate would be about USD 150 billion and it would take about 40 years to achieve this. As of now there are 27 different municipal agencies and government bodies, often working at cross purposes, who are supposed to be working to save the river. We need one unified authority, a political agreement to start work. Spain has the expertise to turn the city around as we have done with multiple cities in Spain and clean up the river.”

According to Inaki, the second year of the partnership with DJB has already received a funding of USD 7 million, which will help speed up further study and implementation of findings from the Project. The five year project which cost USD 1 million in faculty and student research grants was funded by the University of Virginia.

Detached citizens

Delhi’s citizens are now completely detached from their river, only part of a larger detachment from the formerly shared consciousness of public space, from the concept of a commons. This detachment is the underlying cause of Delhi’s environmental dilemma. The Yamuna is now incapable of supporting physical life.

“It’s sad to know that for 700 years the river was a thriving entity around which the city of Delhi grew and the last time in history that we see the river flowing by the palace was during Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan’s reign,” said Pankaj Vir Gupta, Professor of Architecture at the University of Virginia, and one of the authors of the study, at the launch of the report.

Some of the key recommendations of the project are the development of a holistic new urban design master-plan for New Delhi which proposes solutions for low-income housing, mixed-use neighbourhoods, proper sanitation and solid waste management infrastructure, and integration of pedestrian mobility with the public transport infrastructure for the city. All this would be centred on an ecological commons – the Yamuna floodplain riparian zone – as the green spine of the city.

The report has found that Delhi is in a real emerging crisis — a rapid transition from a city without clean water for all its citizens to a city without any clean water at all. As an increasing amount of water is diverted at the Hathnikund Barrage for the Western and Eastern Yamuna Canals the amount of water flowing downstream through the Yamuna has decreased; today much of the Yamuna is a dry riverbed.

In Delhi during the eight months of the dry season, the Yamuna is fed mainly through a trickle of sewage and waste runoff from the city. As the city’s water usage increases, dry season water levels in the river rise due to greater amounts on untreated water being dumped into the river. Consequently, floodwaters are also rising during the monsoon season. The report further says that because of climate change, current statistical calculations are under scrutiny. Predictions are proving challenging and chances of massive and sudden rains are becoming notably higher.

Encroached floodplains

The project also studies the problem of encroachment of the Yamuna flood plain in great details and finds that bridges and other large infrastructures create obstructions in the river. This decreases the effective width of the floodplain and increases the speed of water during monsoon floods. This in turn taxes crossing structures, embankments, dredges the river bottom and erodes riverbanks, accentuating the Yamuna’s destruction.

The consequences of steady flood plain encroachment are severe. The embankments will fail during a 100-year flood event, wiping out structures built in low lying areas of the floodplain and inundating East Delhi with water. This scenario is unavoidable unless significant interventions are taken to redesign Delhi’s waterways.

Puri announced at the launch of the report that the Vice Chairperson of NITI Ayog (National Institution for Transforming India), a policy think tank of Government of India, has been directed to form a body of all stakeholders to implement the recommendations of the project. He added that the cleaning of the Yamuna is at the heart of rejuvenating the city and that work in this regard will commence very soon.

Interestingly, the CEO of the Delhi Jal board (DJB), the government agency responsible for the supply of potable water in Delhi — which is a major partner in the project — could not be reached despite several phone calls and emails. The CEO’s office forwarded names of two senior officials who, thethirdpole.net was informed, were qualified to speak on its partnership with the project.

But on contacting them, it was found that none of them had even heard of the MoU between DJB and Virginia University and were not aware of any study called the Yamuna River Project. One DJB official said, on condition of anonymity, “Nothing is happening on it. Just a report has been prepared.”

Several mails written to the Delhi Lieutenant Governor’s office went unanswered.

Environmental flow

According to the environmental activist, Manoj Mishra, who has been fighting to preserve and protect the Yamuna river, and its floodplains through his organisation Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan (Let the Yamuna Live Movement), the Yamuna River Project has not addressed the issue of environmental flow which is crucial to save a river. “To my understanding the study for the project was done in fits and starts. No ecology expert from India was consulted. For us, water is the main issue and how a river can be made more accessible to people. It will be good if we see some real work happening after a lot of high level attention that the Project has received,” said Mishra.

Far more critical comments came from C.R. Babu, Professor Emeritus at the Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems, University of Delhi. “The new Yamuna River project proposed jointly by Virginia University, Spanish Government and Delhi Jal Board is nothing new and simply repeats what has been said earlier about the woes of the city and the river,” Babu wrote in response to questions on the project. “It does not tell the action plans for rejuvenation of the river and its riparian ecosystem that generate ecological services including the storage of flood water, enhanced recharging of ground water, flood regulation, treatment of sewage before and after discharging into river.”

He also mentioned that two reports had already been submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), the most important environmental judicial system in India, and had already been accepted by the NGT and the Delhi Development Authority. These include a 52 km stretch of embankments, embankment roads, and roads on either side of the river developed as greenways, with walkways, cycle paths and recreational centres to facilitate the link between citizens and the river.

Rejuvenation of wetlands

The second major recommendation being implemented was the rejuvenation of wetlands. “These wetlands can store millions of gallons of flood water and recharge ground water and also enhance the river flow during lean period; some of these wetlands can be used for recreation purpose including locating and pisciculture,” Babu wrote. “In fact, we have already restored [a] 100 acre catchment wetland in the upstream of Wazirabad reservoir as a part of the development of Yamuna Biodiversity Park. It stores 500 million gallons of floodwater every year and recharges the groundwater. Similarly, using constructed wetland system we have been treating 0.5-1.0 million litres per day… that enters into Neela Hauz lake.”

It seems that much of what the Yamuna River Project envisages is already being undertaken under the aegis of the NGT and the DDA, which begs the question as to why these endeavours are not being built upon? The lack of coordination between the various agencies seems to point to the key issue that has bedevilled previous plans, and seems to be set to bedevil this one.

The municipality says there is no money to fix the problem. Photo: Chris Gilili

Residents of Duncan Village D-Section use buckets to relieve themselves because the communal toilets are blocked. They empty the buckets on surrounding fields. Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality says it has no money to fix the problem, at least not in this financial year.

One of the toilets, used by almost 30 households, has been blocked for almost two years. Smelly water, used condoms and human waste greet anyone who enters. Residents complain of the municipality’s failure to provide sanitation services and remove refuse.

D-Section originally consisted of a hostel, but over time people have built shacks and houses in the area. The toilets are fixed standalone structures.

Lulama Mxako, who is responsible for cleaning the toilets, says she has given up the battle to have them maintained by the municipality. “At first I would receive the cleaning detergents and gloves to clean these toilets inside-out but this has changed over the years. I clean them with my bare hands, exposing myself to diseases because my job is to clean them. I have told the councillor and the municipality but no one hears my plight,” said Mxako.

Since the blockage two years ago, residents have opened a drain located nearby which supports the toilets. However, it also gets blocked and residents pour the dirty water onto the surrounding grass, leaving the ground filthy and smelly.

“I just fear for the kids, who love playing around this area,” said Mxako.

A resident, who asked not to be named, said that dirty water gets inside her shack. The smell is unbearable. She has raised the problem in community meetings but there has been no progress.

“We are exposed to the smell day and night but our municipality is failing us. Even at night, if I want to relieve myself I have to force it and travel a longer distance. Maybe if we protest and burn municipal offices, someone will do something. That is the language our government understands,” she said.

“Maybe if we protest and burn municipal offices, someone will do something. That is the language our government understands.”

The problem is not confined to D-Section. Nozibele Wolani, who cleans a communal toilet block at C-Section, said that the toilets there have been closed for four years. People have given up challenging the municipality to fix the problem.

“I tried to clean these toilets using my own money. However, they blocked again but no one wants to hear about it when I tell them,” said Wolani.

Buffalo City response

Councillor Mkakutta Clara Morolong-Yekiso (ANC) said that during an Integrated Development Plan roadshow on Wednesday, she tried to raise the toilet problem with municipality officials but no one took her seriously.

Mkhuseli Nongogo, Engineering and Sanitation Programmes Manager for the municipality, told GroundUp, “There has been no budget in the municipality to maintain the toilets over the years. However, we are aware of the matter and will look into it in the coming financial year.”

Bonisile Nombewu, who works on toilet maintenance for the municipality, said that people have been complaining to him but his hands are tied.

“Ever since the toilets were installed in 2009 by the municipality, sadly they have never been maintained. Hence the increasing blockages. Every single year I ask my superiors about this. They say there is no budget allocated for this purpose. To tell you the truth, the issue will not be attended to anytime soon and it’s sad because people are inconvenienced,” said Nombewu.","Photo: Chris GililiResidents of Duncan Village D-Section use buckets to relieve themselves because the communal toilets are blocked.

By David Smith

Did you know that a typical office keyboard can contain as many as 7,500 bacteria at any given moment? Or that viruses like the flu can linger on office desks or computers for 24 hours or more?

These frightening statistics reveal just how filthy an office environment can get if it is not cleaned regularly. Aside from the general unpleasantness of occupying a dirty building for several hours a day, this can also have a negative impact on workplace productivity for numerous reasons. For one, you will find it harder to motivate yourself to work your best when you are confronted with a filthy office every morning.

Also, companies lose a seismic amount of time and revenue because of unclean office environments. Think about the last time you needed to find an important document – did you know instantly where it would be found or did you need to sift through piles of cluttered papers just to track it down? The more time you spend on searching for paperwork, the more this impacts on the ability to get through your daily tasks.

It can often be the case that taking a little time each week to devote to a certain task, such as cleaning, will prove to be economical in the long run as it will prevent the need to set aside a full day for the task that must be completed. Even if it’s only 15-30 minutes at the end of a working week, set aside some bit of time to execute ongoing cleans so that all your ducks will be in a row for the following week and you won’t squander valuable time on needless duties.

The concern comes as health authorities are encouraging hygiene and sanitation to avoid cholera. Karonga was hit hard by the waterborne disease which claimed seven lives duting the rainy season.

According to Nelson Mwakasulo Gerenge who is area development committee chairperson, the lack of water at the facility is leaving patients in danger of catching other diseases.

“When we talk about hygiene first we look at water at health centre and ours does not have potable water and this is risky to parents and guardians as they are at high risk of catching hygiene related diseases,” he said.

He added that due to lack of water, women at the labour ward are compromised as guardians are forced to go out to the communities to fetch water for their patients to clean up after labour.

Concurring with Mwakasulo, group village headman Gweleweta said women are delivering in bad conditions hence the need for health authorities to step in to provide safe and clean water at the facility.

“We are calling upon health Authorities to help us especially for our dear women who are facing difficulties delivering due to absence of water and apart from that we are also at high risk of contracting cholera again as people are forced to fetch water in areas where animals also drink water from,” lamented the chief.

Meanwhile, Karonga District Health Officer (DHO) Dr Phinias Mfune has reassured the communities living around Kaporo Health Centre that in conjunction with the council his office will construct a borehole to ease some of the challenges that the facility faces.

Kaporo Rural Health Centre currently serves over 50,000 people and last month had its pharmacy gutted down by a fire.","Communities around Kaporo Rural Health Centre in Karonga have expressed concern over the continued lack of potable water at the facility saying the problem is compromising health service delivery.

LAST Sunday, President Edgar Lungu re-launched the ‘Make Zambia Clean, Green and Healthy’ campaign.The launch, coming against the backdrop of probably the worst cholera epidemic that Zambia has ever encountered, is another litmus test for turning around the country from a garbage heap into garden nation.

Late President Levy Mwanawasa was the first head of State to launch the ‘Make Zambia Clean and Healthy’ campaign on June 22, 2007 with a view to making homes, communities, villages, towns, and cities clean.

Dr Mwanawasa had noted with concern that for some years, communities, towns, and cities had not been as clean as they were supposed to be and this was caused by inadequate clean and safe water supply and sanitation services, inappropriate personal and food hygiene practices, along with low knowledge levels by many citizens concerning basic health and hygiene matters.

In re-launching the ‘Keep Zambia Clean and Healthy’ campaign for a smart Zambia 10 years later, then Minister of Local Government and Housing John Phiri urged all citizens to set aside the first Saturday of every month for cleaning of premises and surroundings.

Eleven years later, President Lungu has re-launched the campaign, this time with an expanded scope that includes greening.

The re-launch is a demonstration of Government’s desire to have a sparkling clean Zambia devoid of diseases such as cholera.

For the campaign to succeed there is need for mindset change as the starting point.

This mind change should start with pupils, students, and youths to grow it.

For the mindset to change there is need for sustained sensitisation because this is the most important part. Thereafter local authorities should designate disposal sites.

Joseph Chimpampwe, a banker, feels that for the ambitious campaign to succeed, the country’s leadership at all levels should take a lead, like President Paul Kagame does in Rwanda, and possibly dedicate a Saturday every month to countrywide environmental cleaning.

Mr Chimpampwe, who is also an entrepreneurship and business coach, says the country’s leadership should maintain the hype created during the cholera period and institutionalise the campaign in schools, companies, churches and at events such as weddings.

“Where possible, we should implement punitive measures such as name and shame,” he said.

Mr Chimpampwe has called for the adequate funding of the campaign and holding relevant people accountable for outcomes.

Patson Moono, a Monze resident, says the previous “Make Zambia clean and healthy” campaigns had little or no impact at all because the pronouncements were not followed by action from both Government and stakeholders.

Mr Moono says what can make this campaign successful is enactment of by-laws for enforcement, full involvement of Government and all stakeholders, who include every citizen, and there must be consistency, availability of bins and toilet facilities, stiffness of punishments to offenders and stopping street vendors from selling on the streets.

It is clear that unless Government, through public service workers, begins to walk the talk, the campaign may yet be consigned to the archives.

Following President Lungu’s launch, government offices are expected to be sparkling clean because workers will not only rely on staff from cleaning companies.

For instance, Government Complex should become cleaner than it currently is.

Given its proximity, government ministries operating from Government Complex should create some ambient environment to make the premises the envy of all.

What about creating space for a botanical garden and some lawns?

Public service workers have a premium to make Zambia clean, green and healthy.

Mrs Katherine T. Lankono, the Nadowli District Chief Executive in the Upper West Region joined Ghana Environmental Health Association to undertake a clean-up exercise in Nadowli, the District Capital, where she swept and collected garbage.

The District Chief Executive with health and sanitation management experts also cleared bushy parts of the town in an exercise, described as an initiative to encourage community members to participate in public health education and also observe good sanitation practices.

Mrs Lankono said the importance of clean-up exercise called for residents to keep their environment clean and healthy in order to prevent environmental diseases.

'I think that it is a good programme especially that we are doing it around the Hospital facility, and it is said that cleanliness is next to Godliness. If we have clean environment, doctors will have little work to do,' she said.

She urged constituents to adhere to the habit of cleaning their environments all the time without relying on environmental and sanitary officials to remind them of the need to clean their surroundings.

'This is a wake-up call especially for the Nadowli township, so that we keep a very healthy environment and also to own household latrines to enable us meet our District agenda of an open defecation free (O.D.F) by 2019,' she added.

The National Public Relations Officer of Ghana Environmental Health Association, Mr Salifu Braimah Andrews, told Ghana News Agency on the sideline of the event that the exercise was part of a nationwide one embarked by the Association with Upper West being the third region after cleaning Central and Northern regions.

The choice for Nadowli-Kaleo District was based on efforts the district had made to help strengthen what the environmental health district officers with others had done to improve sanitation to achieve ODF in the area, he added.

He was unhappy that a toilet facility built and completed for the past four years had not been commissioned for residents to use.

'We cannot fight any open defecation if we don't have toilet facility in the community; so, I appeal to stakeholders to commission the newly built water closet to the residents,' he said.

The clean-up exercise brought together sanitation officers from the region, District Assembly Staff, Staff of Nadowli hospital, market Women and Zoomlion members and residents coming out in their numbers for the exercise.","Listen to articleMrs Katherine T.

He bemoaned poor sanitary conditions in many Zongo communities, which he said may lead to the outbreak of diseases if immediate measures are not taken to the arrest the situation.

The Minister said, “You will reduce poverty when you enhance sanitation, because at the end of the day, diseases like malaria will be reduced and we will have fresh air to breath, so it is important we keep our environment clean, and this is also to support the President's vision of making Accra the cleanest city in Africa, said Alhaji Abubakar Saddique Boniface.

The Minister for Inner City and Zongo Development said the cleaning of the municipality is in keeping with President Nana Addo's pledge of making Accra the cleanest city in Africa.

According to the Minister, who is also the Member of Parliament (MP) for Madina in the Greater Accra Region, the Ministry is embarking on clean-up exercises which focus on cleaning solid waste, street corners, drains, backyards and public open spaces.

He said that his Ministry would not relent on its efforts until the Zongo communities are cleaned as part of the 'Clean Zongo' project by the Ministry.

He said the Ministry is looking at developing sanitation entrepreneurs to provide jobs for the teeming unemployed Zongo youth.

According to him, the president created the Zongo Ministry so that many years of neglect of these parts of the country would be reversed.

He explained that the establishment of the Ministry is the first of its kind on the continent.

“Even though Nigeria has the largest Zongo communities, they have not been able to create a target Ministry for their development,” he added.

On his part, the Minister for Sanitation and Water Resources and MP for Navorogo Central, Kofi Adda, pledged his support for the 'Clean Zongo' campaign.

He said as part of the Nation Builders Corp agenda, many more sanitation guard module would be rolled out to help check indiscriminate littering in the Zongo communities across the country.

He expressed his gratitude to Zoomlion, Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA), among other stakeholders, for supporting the initiative and added that the clean-up exercise should be sustained.

Celebrated musicians and actors, among others, were there to endorse the exercise and whip up enthusiasm among Zongo dwellers to keep the Zongos clean.

The exercise was supervised by the Chief Director of the Ministry, Gifty Mahama, Dr Sarfo Ohene, Special Advisor to the Minister of Inner-City and Zongo Development, Mohammed Alhassan, Director of Policy, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (PPME), Princess Amina Sammo, Director of Projects and Programmes, Cletus Anafu, Director of Finance and Administration.

THE ‘Make Zambia clean, green and healthy’ campaign kicked off last Saturday on a rather low note.

While there was adherence by some government institutions such as the Zambia Environmental Management Agency (ZEMA) and parastatals like the Zambia Daily Mail, there was resistance from others, though not deliberate.

Most business houses in the Lusaka central business district and elsewhere started the day by cleaning up their premises before opening.

It was gratifying to see President Edgar Lungu walking the talk by joining other well-meaning Lusaka residents at Chakunkula Primary School in Chelstone township where he led other government officials in planting orange trees.

Planting trees, which is under the ‘Plant a million trees, is an extension of the ‘Make Zambia clean, green and healthy’ campaign launched last month.

ZEMA corporate affairs manager Ireen Chipili who was on the ground in Bauleni, was happy with the participation of the local leadership in the cleaning of the market.

ZEMA was in the area to promote sound environmental management in the exercise complemented by five companies which availed their trucks for transportation of garbage from Bauleni to Chunga dumpsite.

Lafarge Zambia, Lilume Quarry, Tainyu Investments, Wonderful Ceiling and Gold Tiger generously made available their vehicles to the clean-up exercise while Adils and Baba Engineering supplied gloves to ensure people who participated in the cleaning had personal protective gear.

Men and women from Chunga were also on hand to pick up recycleable items from the garbage site with a view to teaching Bauleni residents that not all garbage is waste.

ZEMA also told community members to desist from the habit of burning garbage and encouraged them to subscribe to garbage collectors.

Kabulonga ward 16 councillor Patrick Mwansa said garbage collection has been an on-going exercise in Lusaka Central Constituency.

Mr Mwansa said about 250,000 tonnes of garbage was collected during the outbreak of cholera, hence the low incident of the disease, including diarrhea.

He says there is need for change of mindset to make the environment clean and wants more residents involved in sanitising Bauleni.

Mr Mwansa commended garbage collectors for their commitment but wants more bins as well as the increase in the number of trucks for picking up of waste.

Recyclers Association of Zambia chairperson Harrison Musonda was at hand to sensitise Bauleni residents on the need to segregate garbage and to begin to turn waste into a resource.

Mr Musonda wants citizens at large to appreciate the existence of collectors, aggregators and processors in the waste management sector.

Citizens can be putting plastics and bottles aside which they can be selling to aggregators and processors to make money.

LEADERSHIP

While citizens are willing to implement the presidential directive to make ‘Zambia, clean, green and healthy’ leadership and ownership of the programme is lacking.

For instance, for Richard Lungu, assistant director in the Ministry of Water Development, Sanitation and Environmental Protection showed up in Bauleni to join ZEMA members of staff because his employers had not organised a cleaning event.

He therefore volunteered to make his way to Bauleni to join ZEMA, a statutory body under his ministry.

There must have been several public service workers out there who found themselves in Mr Lungu’s position because nobody provided leadership.

But Mr Lungu’s conscious haunted him to act while others watched from the sidelines.

Lack of leadership at ministerial level could have been the reason why President Lungu wondered that Cabinet ministers were with him in Chelstone instead of being elsewhere participating in the clean-up exercise.

Going forward, State House may have to delegate an inter-ministerial committee comprising Health, Defence, Environmental Protection and Local Government to be responsible for implementation of the presidential directive.

There may also be need to create structures in the community for the cleaning programme to work.

Not every worker should be cleaning their premises but employers should begin to look outside the box like ZEMA did.

Being the first month since the launch of the campaign, a lot more citizens, government institutions, parastatals and the private sector were expected to turn out.

While there may not have been total adherence to the first cleaning exercise, the task to inculcate a cleaning culture has begun.

There is need for more hype for the participation of many citizens ahead of the World Environment Day on June 5.

This is a very important event in the calendar of all environmentally responsible citizens, especially Zambians as we begin to re-dedicate ourselves to do a lot more this year to fight environmental degradation. It’s time to act.

It is the citizens who are not ready to keep the beach clean. Pushing authorities to clean the beach, again and again, will not change the situation unless we as citizens realise our responsibility. Basic civic sense is missing.

Local residents sit at home and run social media cleaning campaigns and complain about the authorities for not doing their work. Every day, over 50 workers from the BMC clean the beach early in the morning. By evening, the beach is full of plastic packets, PET Bottles, food leftovers etc. The government is not here to clean shit created by us every day. Can we all not come forward, work together and remind citizens of their basic civic sense?

Ways You Can Keep Juhu Beach Clean

1. Ditch Plastic: Stay away from those evil plastic bags! The best you can do is bring your snacks and such in reusable bags or containers. It is a perfect prevention method and you still get to enjoy those chips and chocolates you love so much.

2. Take Everything Back: Bring your own bags with you, this will ensure you don’t throw everything on the beach. Trash doesn’t just disappear and we all know it, so take everything you brought back with you and it will make the ocean smile.

3. If You Spot Trash, Pick It Up: You’re most likely to find a bottle or two as you stroll on the beach, it’s okay if you safely pick it up and throw it in a trash can. I know it’s impossible for you to go and pick up everything you spot on the beach, but picking up a couple of leftovers will do good to keep the beach clean.

4. Bring Reusable Bottles: Little things matter a lot here. For example, you could bring a reusable water bottle to the beach instead of disposable water bottles. Or you can just sip on margaritas at your closest beach bar, which not only helps the environment but it also makes you very happy!

5. Take Care Of Your Pet’s Poop: If you’ve brought your puppy to the beach, that’s great, nothing beats a puppy trying to swim! However, remember to pick up the little gifts they drop. You wouldn’t want to step on poop as you run to catch a ball, right?

6. Smoking Doesn’t Just Kill You: Cigarette butts are one of the leading pollutants in the world. Smoke all you want, of course, we won’t tell you what to do but if you do smoke, dispose of the cigarette butt properly so it doesn’t go into the water or sand.

7. Encourage Everyone To Participate In Beach Cleaning Initiatives: I’m pretty sure almost everyone has a special place in their heart for the beach, so pass on the word, help keep the beach clean and our marine life safe!

TimesView TIMES VIEW Kudos to TS Mahadevaswamy for giving us a simple, yet effective method of dealing with kitchen waste. Cleanliness of our villages, towns and cities cannot be the responsibility of civic bodies alone. It must fall to every citizen to keep public spaces clean. While it is disappointing that Bengaluru does not figure in the list of top clean cities, experts suggest sustainable long-term plans such as a move away from landfills and in-situ treatment of wet waste are being put in place to manage solid waste. Citizens must lend a hand for the clean cause.

BENGALURU: A retired paper mill manager from Shivamogga has won the Swachh Survekshan-2018 award in the citizen participation category for converting kitchen waste into manure using a PVC pipe.T S Mahadevaswamy , 64, a resident of Vinobanagar 3rd Main, believes that efficient disposal of wet waste is key to ensuring total waste management and keeping the environment clean. That was the compelling idea behind his pipe compost technology.“I began using this method two years ago,” Mahadevaswamy said. “People are always disgusted with waste, but don’t want to take care of it. All that people need to implement this process is a length of PVC pipe, cow dung, jaggery and water. One kilogram of kitchen waste gets converted into 100gm of manure and it only costs Rs 600-700 to get hold of the materials.”In the first stage, a six-foot length of PVC pipe (six inches wide) is inserted 1.5 feet into the ground. This will keep it at a suitable height for the average adult. One kilogram of cow dung diluted with 10-15 litres of water, and the kilogram of jaggery needs to be mixed together and poured into the pipe. Under the ground, it activates bacterial growth. From the next day, kitchen waste can be dumped daily into the pipe and a mug of water added every week.“Every two to three months, poke a stick into the pipe,” Mahadevaswamy said. “If it comes out wet, the process is active. If not, pour the mixture of cow dung, water and jaggery once again. It is, however, a time consuming process as it takes eight months to a year to generate manure. I got the manure tested at a lab and the results showed that it is rich in calcium, phosphorous and other nutrients. People’s waste should be dealt with in their homes.”After finding success with his method, Mahadevaswamy established the pipe compost system in the homes of the deputy commissioner, CEO of the zilla panchayat and the corporation commissioner. He is also a Swachch Bharat mission coordinator for the city.Mysuru has been regarded as the ‘cleanest city’ in the three to 10 lakh population category, according to the Swachh Survekshan-2018 survey conducted by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs. Mangaluru bagged the award for being “the best city in solid waste management”. The survey covered 4,041 cities and their urban local bodies (ULB) and the parameters for cleanest city included collection and transportation of waste, processing and disposal of waste, sanitation and open defecation free among others. While Indore (Madhya Pradesh) was declared the cleanest city in the country, followed by Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh) and Chandigarh, Greater Mumbai (Maharashtra) took the title of cleanest capital city/union territory followed by Jaipur (Rajasthan) and Ranchi (Jharkhand). Bengaluru has failed to find a spot in the list of top clean cities.","Bengaluru not in toppers’ listTimesView TIMES VIEW Kudos to TS Mahadevaswamy for giving us a simple, yet effective method of dealing with kitchen waste.

The hospital with a history of more than a century has been infested by pollution and lack of sanitation. It is known as one of the filthy and stinking hospitals around the town.

Although the hospital has around 100 toilets, these are under worst condition. Filthy water flows out from these toilets at night spreading foul smell all over the hospital.

Minister of State for Health and Population Padma Kumari Aryal initiated the month-long ‘hospital clean-up campaign’ today as part of the government’s effort to have full sanitation condition at the government health institutions.

“Let us become the part of this campaign with the thinking that all the government hospitals are own properties. We should start from ourselves. We will see the real change in one month from now,” she said.

The Minister of State for Health said that the hospital’s internal cleaning was equally necessary as was its external cleaning. Vice Chancellor of the National Academy of Medical Sciences (NAMS) Prof Dr. Ganesh Bahadur Gurung on the occasion, vowed to fulfill the objective of the campaign although cleaning the hospital was a challenge as it is located in the heart of the capital city and is thronged by a large number people every day.

Hospital’s director Prof Dr. Bhupendra Basnet said the hospital has seen much improvement of late and the patients are getting better services. He added that the infrastructure of the hospital has been improved, it has been painted and sanitation improved. Basnet further noted that technology and equipment have also been added in recent days.

The stairs, floors, and walls of the hospital building are dirty. The emergency rooms as well other cabins are also not clean. The hospital is not clean as expected to be even though 150 cleaning staffs clean it every day.

Around 3,000 patients visit the Bir Hospital every day from nooks and cranny of the country while 2,000 more people visit the hospital for one or the other purposes. According to the WHO, 10 persons succumb to infections out of every 100 patients in the developing countries while less than seven persons died of an infection in the developed countries.

The Ministry has coordinated with Khem’s Cleaning to launch the sanitation campaign in the Bir Hospital and Trauma Centre in every 15 days. Khem Sharma coming from Australia and his 15 volunteers are working in the sanitation mission along with 10 volunteers of the hospital.

Sitaram Kattel has also joined the cleanliness campaign as the sanitation ambassador.

After the exercise, the Executive Director of GNPC Foundation, Dr. Kwame Baah-Nuakoh, emphasized on the need to keep the environment clean and tidy at all times to forestall communicable and water borne diseases such as malaria, cholera, diarrhea and amoebic dysentery.

The exercise remains one of many activities being undertaken by GNPC to improve on the quality of life of the people of the Western Region and beyond. In order not to make the clean-up exercise a one-off occurrence, the Foundation donated the cleaning equipment (rakes, shovels, gloves, lawn brooms) to the communities to use for periodic clean-ups as part of the sanitation competition which will be instituted by GNPC Foundation and Karela FC.

""I will detail some of my officers to come down and do unannounced inspection and the town with the cleanest environment will be rewarded with a Development Project of their choice”, he echoed.

He also used the opportunity to highlight some of the corporate social investment (CSI) projects being undertaken by GNPC within the Western Region which includes the awarding of over 250 Scholarships to students to study STEM subjects in the public tertiary institutions, provision of equipment and financial support for some Secondary and Technical Schools, completion of Accident and Emergency Unit for Half Assini Government Hospital and a Classroom Block for Effia Nkwanta Nursing and Midwifery School, as well as a 160 bed dormitory for Sekondi School for the Deaf, among others.

The CEO of Karela FC, David Cobbina Brigidi thanked GNPC for the collaboration in the clean-up exercise and commended the Corporation for the interventions done in the area to impact the lives of the people.","GNPC Foundation teamed up with Karela Football Club, a Premiership side based at Anyinase in the Ellembele District, to undertake a clean-up exercise at Ngelekazo and Beyin in the Jomoro District of the Western Region on Tuesday, May 1,2018.

These remote rural areas usually receive contaminated and harsh water which, on consumption, has led to many illnesses.

The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has launched the Swajal scheme in around 115 rural districts in India to provide clean drinking water. It will involve an outlay of Rs 700 crore through flexi funds under existing National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) budget.

What is the Swajal scheme?

This Swajal scheme was launched by the government for sustained water supply in rural areas. 90 per cent of this project is funded by the government and 10 per cent is funded by the beneficiary communities.

The management of this operation is managed by local villagers and hundreds of technicians will be trained under this scheme to maintain and operate the units.

All the villages will get water supplied through fitted pipes. This will ensure that the water is not contaminated. The maintenance of these pipes will be taken care of by the technicians.

Supply of clean water to aspirational districts

The government has chosen 115 rural districts which will receive rapid transformation to match up to government's vision of 'New India'.

The selection criteria of these districts are dependent on six socio-economical parameters, according to Niti Aayog. The parameters are health and nutrition, education, financial inclusion and skill development, agriculture and water resources and basic infrastructure.

35 districts that face Left Wing Extremist (LWE) violence and 15 districts from Jammu and Kashmir which experience terrorism are included in this scheme.

Government aspired to bring technological change in these districts as well and transforming them rapidly to develop the nation further.

Around 2 lakh people die in India every year because of the immense water shortage and 600 million people of this country don't have access to clean drinking water.","The government of India has launched Swajal scheme to ensure there is a steady supply of clean drinking water in rural areas.

Sitting in the arms of his mother, the one-year-old boy cries out and reaches in the direction of a plastic cup. But, for now the cup is empty and his mother can only try to soothe him.

The water supply at Pombreal Village, in the remote Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea, has run dangerously low in the months since the 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck in February.

Landslides have contaminated a nearby creek, and now the entire community, some 600 people, relies on a single 5000L water tank.

James Mepham/UNICEF Otmar and his mum Racheal come to the Pombreal Primary School to have a clean water ration. The situation is extremely poor with the entire village sharing a very limited rain water supply.

The rainwater tank replenishes slowly, and the situation has grown desperate. The community must ration the little water they have left, just a quarter of a cup for each child per school session.

Rachael, the boy's mother, explains how Otmar became sick with diarrhoea after drinking water from the creek. It was the family's last resort.

""I know it isn't good for him, but we have no choice. There are no other options.""

More than 85 per cent of Papua New Guinea's population lives in rural areas like this one.

According to the 2015 WHO/Unicef Joint Monitoring Programme, 68 per cent of people living in these areas don't have access to improved water sources, and these numbers have remained virtually stagnant since the joint monitoring programme began in 1990.

James Mepham/UNICEF Rachael explains how Otmar became sick with diarrhoea after drinking water from the creek.

Rachael tends to the family's crops; fields tall with sugarcane and corn, soil rich with kaukau.

The family lives as subsistence farmers. Besides, there aren't ever any visitors for them to sell their produce. The village is too remote. The only road was an unsealed detour from Mendi, leading two hours through the winding mountain range.

Theirs wasn't the only family that have resorted to such desperate measures for water. And if a child falls ill there isn't much a under-resourced health centre, that's some trek away, can do to help.

The issue of clean drinking water only compounds other stresses the family of four faces in the wake of the earthquake.

Rachael said that her eldest son, seven-year-old Innocent, seems irrevocably changed - and she fears he may never be the same. He clings to his father every time there is an aftershock, and if one occurs during school hours sprints through the fields to be at home

However, in the month's since the first earthquake, there's some hope in the form of a large tent and one amazing woman.

After Unicef erected the tent as a temporary learning space at Pombreal Primary School, Judy Olpis - who calls herself a ""housewife"" - volunteered to oversee a diverse learning programme.

James Mepham/Unicef Judy Olpis is the Unicef Program Volunteer at Pombreal Village Village, Nipa, Papua New Guinea.

Day after day, she teaches 132 school kids. Her curriculum doesn't just cover ""the ABCs"" but also teaches kids basic principles of hygiene, such as how to wipe their noses.

In spite of her own problems - the family home needs repairs - she continues to show up.

""I tell them, when there is an earthquake, not to run off in every direction - because they will break my tent!""

Olpis explains how when there is an aftershock she will ""save"" the children in her stead, but then modestly corrects herself, instead saying that she will ""keep them safe"".

But, in a sense she has saved the children of Pombreal Village. Without a school programme to at least provide them a sense of normalcy, the long-term psychological effects might be far worse.

Olpis fears one threat to the wellbeing of her students above all else; the shortage of water.

""The children say to me: 'Aunty Olpis! We want water! We are thirsty!' A full water tank doesn't even last us one week - we are really suffering here.""

Olpis's example has begun to inspire others in the community. Maxwell Konop, the Chairman of Pombreal Primary School, is supporting the construction of a new pit latrine toilet, a set of tippy taps for hand washing, and two additional 5000L water tanks.

James Mepham/UNICEF The rain water tank is the only fresh water supply for Pombreal Village, Nipa, Papua New Guinea.

Within the month, Konop will also begin construction of a permanent building to stand in place of the tent, a new home for the Unicef Education Programme.

Maxwell says the effectiveness of Olpis's learning programme - parents are supportive, children are engaged - makes this an easy initiative to support.

The new facilities, which will be operational in one month will provide improved sanitation for the community, and triple its rainwater storage capacity.

It's a change that will go a long way to sating the thirst of children like Otmar.

Reaching into her backpack, one of my colleagues finds a short-term solution, and fills Otmar's cup almost to the brim with water. He hungrily gulps it down, stopping briefly to smile at us, before draining the remaining liquid dry.

Sourcing on a site run by the Gujarat government, www.gujaratindia.com, instead of assessing things independently, which is what a policy-making body should ideally do, the Niti Aayog report, released this month, claims that this 100% score has been made possible because the state government ""provides clean water to all of its ~35 million rural residents."" Giving credit for this to Gujarat’s rural water supply programme, led by the state’s Water and Sanitation Management Organisation (WASMO), the report says, its main aim has been ""to supply the village community with adequate, regular and safe water through household-level tap water connectivity, including households of people from backward communities.""It adds, ""The programme strives to build a sustainable model through building capacity of village communities and empowering them to manage water resources themselves. The programme is based on a unique cost-sharing model, where the community partially shares the cost, owns the drinking water supply assets, and holds the operation and maintenance responsibilities.""""As a result of this programme"", the report continues, initially, villagers were ""mobilized to discuss the key problems that the local drinking supply system suffers from"", adding, ""These efforts involved participation by NGOs to ensure the inclusion of all views, especially those of women and the poorer members of the village.""Based on these discussions, a Village Action Plan (VAP) was drawn up with 10% of the estimated programme cost collected from residents and 90% contributed by WASMO, the report continues to claim, adding, a representative ‘Pani Samiti’ for the village was then ""established to plan and implement the programme.""""Finally"", the report says, WASMO and its partner organizations provided hand-holding and capacity building support to the Pani Samitis for a year, to ensure that the programme is technically and financially sound, and thus sustainable, with a huge positive impact: The rural water supply project is being providing clean water access to villages in all state districts.""As of the end of 2013, ~50% of the villages completed schemes at an investment of Rs 800 crore, and Pani Samitis were formed in almost all of the ~18,400 villages in the state"", the report contends, adding, ""This programme has been the driver of Gujarat’s 100% achievement in the ‘rural drinking water’ category of the Index, helping the state fully cover all rural habitations and achieve a 100% decline in rural water quality incidents in FY 16-17.""Ironically, the claim of 100% success with the help of Pani Samitis or water committees stands in sharp contrast to what the report seeks to suggest elsewhere: Just about 15% -- one of the worst in India -- irrigated command areas have operational Water Users' Associations (WUAs), a community-driven scheme, with the right to manage all water-related issues. As many as 12 other states are better performers in this.Yet, it continues, the lessons Gujarat has for other states include mobilizing community participation by ""tapping"" local knowledge base of problems and challenges surrounding water supply systems, even as ""ensuring true representation through partnerships with NGOs and other relevant organizations.""It is not just the rural areas that this ""success"" is visible, the report suggests. Even in urban areas, it says, 100% urban population has been ""provided drinking water supply."" These are not the only successes that the report seeks to cite for Gujarat.The capacity installed in the state to treat the urban waste water as a proportion of the total estimated waste water generated in the urban areas of Gujarat, the report claims, is 71%, the highest in India.

141,https://ssir.org/articles/entry/accelerating_an_impact_industry_lessons_from_the_clean_cookstove_industry,"Fri, 01 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Stanford Social Innovation Review,Accelerating an Impact Industry: Lessons from Clean Cookstoves,"When then US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, announced the launch of the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (the Alliance) in 2010, she supported an audacious goal—100 million households adopting clean cookstoves and fuels by 2020. Bringing together leaders from government, civil society, and the private sector, the Alliance aimed to harness the power of markets to build a robust and thriving industry that could help alleviate poverty and enhance sustainable development. The question then, and now, is what do organizations like the Alliance need to do to make this vision a reality?

Development organizations, foundations, nonprofits, and governments have invested in a variety of programs to unlock the transformative power of business to help tackle some of society’s greatest challenges. From encouraging policy reforms and launching incubators that nurture enterprise growth, to leading awareness and behavior change campaigns that drive consumer demand, these programs have been stepping stones to building industries that generate sustainable and scalable impact—what we call “impact industries.”

An impact industry is a special kind of industry. While an industry is defined as a group of businesses related in terms of their core business activities that provide products or services that are close substitutes for one another, an impact industry offers the opportunity to build profitable businesses that create substantial social or environmental impacts.

Despite their potential, efforts to develop impact industries generally remain fragmented, operating independently of one another and lacking an integrated vision. This results in insufficient investment in the industry, lack of coordination among key players, markets with limited prospects for profitability, and enterprises that struggle to scale their impact. Accelerating impact industries can be particularly challenging when the target market is the base of the pyramid (BoP)—the approximately 4.5 billion poorest people on the planet.

Recognizing these limitations, a new type of organization has emerged in the last few years, which we refer to as an “impact industry accelerator” (IIA). These include the Alliance, along with other organizations such as Family Planning 2020 and the Global Off-Grid Lighting Association.

IIAs are tasked with building a thriving impact industry populated by enterprises that are sustainable at scale. Our definition of an impact industry accelerator compliments and extends work done on the concept of an industry facilitator. Industry facilitators have a narrower mandate than IIAs and are viewed as focusing on a group of businesses using a similar business model and operating in a specific country or part thereof. As IIAs are asked to catalyze an entire impact industry’s development, they must engage a wide variety of stakeholders beyond business to address the multitude of activities, both at the global and local level, required to accelerate multiple business models in multiple markets across the developing world.

Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves

Almost three billion people, nearly all of whom are part of the BoP, depend on open fires or the use of biomass (such as charcoal and dung) in inefficient cookstoves to cook their food. While these methods may be inexpensive, or in many cases free, they come with many hidden costs to individuals and their environment. Household air pollution and particulate matter resulting from the inefficient combustion of solid fuels contribute to a multitude of health issues, including pneumonia and heart disease, with disproportionate impacts on women and young girls who do most of the cooking.

Women and girls are also largely responsible for collecting fuel, which puts them at greater risk of violence when traveling outside of the home, and also means that girls have less time for school and women have less time for other activities. There are environmental impacts as well. Fuel collection often degrades land and can destroy habitats. Combustion of these fuels releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. The widespread adoption of cleaner cookstove technologies that burn biomass fuels more efficiently, or that burn cleaner fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas, can eliminate many of these negative outcomes.

Globally, the Alliance facilitates research focused on better understanding the link between reduced use of traditional cookstoves and changes in health, climate, environment, and gender equality outcomes. It uses these data to advocate for greater investment in clean cooking solutions by public and private sector partners. To ensure these impacts are achieved, the Alliance has established global standards for clean cookstoves and develops approaches and materials to educate and change consumer behavior to maximize the impact of clean cooking technologies.

At the national level, the Alliance has market managers in eight countries (Bangladesh, China, Ghana, Guatemala, India, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda) who coordinate on-the-ground activities and develop the local partnership ecosystem. Within each country, the Alliance works with private sector manufacturers and distributors of cookstoves and fuels, local and international non-governmental organizations, national government ministries, and in some cases, local and regional associations, to develop and execute “country action plans” (CAPs). These CAPs are designed to coordinate and accelerate the local clean cookstove and fuels industry.

An important part of what the Alliance does is to raise and manage funds from bilateral and multilateral organizations, corporations, foundations, civil society organizations, and individuals. Staff at headquarters in Washington, D.C., work with in-country managers to design and implement targeted programs including those that support greater innovation and experimentation, provide working capital support for enterprises, and fund investments in institutional capacity building.

In 2015, five years after its launch, the Alliance reported the distribution of 53 million clean or efficient cookstoves and fuels, more than half way to its goal of 100 million households by 2020. To achieve this milestone the Alliance has had to simultaneously address the many barriers that impede the purchase and use of clean cookstoves and fuels.

Four Stages of Industry Acceleration

The findings in this article are based on a research study the authors conducted with the Alliance to identify lessons learned from its activities thus far, including a review of secondary literature, and interviews with the Alliance and its partners in Washington, D.C., Kenya, and Bangladesh. Our research found that accelerating the clean cookstove industry targeting the BoP involved four different, yet interconnected, stages of acceleration. Each of the four stages (see “Four acceleration strategies for the clean cookstove industry” below) emphasized a specific acceleration strategy—investment, collective action, profitability, and impact—and all four were critical in the development of this impact industry.

For the sake of clarity, the discussion that follows presents each stage in linear progression. In the real world, the four acceleration strategies are interconnected and mutually reinforcing, and don’t occur in linear fashion. Indeed, our findings show that the Alliance did not proceed in a step-wise fashion, completing one stage at a time. Rather it simultaneously prioritized and choreographed key next steps across all four stages. The process was also iterative, as the Alliance shifted emphasis and investment in response to evolving and varying circumstances in the global environment as well as individual local contexts.

Four acceleration strategies for the clean cookstove industry.

1. Accelerate Investment: Before the Alliance could do anything meaningful, both financial and non-financial resources were needed. While initially these resources came from various players in the development sector, the source of this investment has changed over time to include some private sector support. These investments were generally funneled through the Alliance but could also be provided directly to other organizations collaborating in industry acceleration efforts. Success in this stage of acceleration can be measured by the level of resources mobilized for the impact industry.

We identified three critical activities implemented by the Alliance to secure investors. First, the organization created a wide investment proposition that enabled it to mobilize resources from a range of potential investors. Rarely does the development community want to build companies or create industries. They want to solve societal problems. They may, however, be interested in accelerating an impact industry and the enterprises within it, if they see it as an effective means of contributing to their social impact goals.

Second, before potential supporters made financial commitments, they needed an implementing platform (the Alliance) in which they were comfortable investing and confident the resources would be deployed as intended. This organization must not only ensure that investments are appropriately channeled, with effective sequencing and prioritization of activities, but also have the flexibility to evolve with the industry and ensure that appropriate resources are mobilized for a journey that could last more than a decade.

Third, the Alliance had to convert interest in the issue and confidence in the organizational structure into commitments of financial and non-financial support. This required engaging a range of potential supporters, both globally and in-country, to ensure a consistent and continuing flow of funding, and to attract non-financial resources such as access to data, systems and tools, and intellectual capital.

It was the development of a wide investment proposition that led to the formation of the Alliance itself. In 2009, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sought to expand an existing program, The Partnership for Clean Indoor Air, beyond what it could do within its agency mandate. In doing so, the EPA’s administrator at the time, Lisa Jackson, and her team began to articulate to a variety of potential partners, including the US Department of State under Secretary Clinton, how clean cooking could generate not only environmental benefits, but also result in substantial positive impacts in health, gender equality, and affordable energy.

While accelerating the clean cookstove manufacturing industry was not a priority for most of these potential partners, the Alliance model was considered a new and powerful way to achieve their specific objectives. With the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, this wide value proposition became attractive to a variety of potential donors that linked the growth of the industry to achieving one or more of the SDGs. These same value propositions were effective in facilitating the formation of cross-ministerial committees in Kenya and Bangladesh that include government units responsible for health, energy, environment, and agriculture, among others.

In the early stages of the Alliance’s formation, those championing this effort approached the United Nations Foundation (UNF) to act as a host organization for the Alliance. They viewed UNF as an organization that could provide a governance structure and the reputational capital to facilitate investment from the public and private sectors, and from multiple countries, as well as effectively prioritize, sequence, and channel those investments. Once established within UNF, the Alliance continued to evolve its structure and strategy as the industry evolved, from an organization that was predominantly focused on global issues to one that is increasingly focused on country-level issues.

In Kenya, for example, the Alliance played a key role in the formation of the Clean Cookstove Association of Kenya (CCAK), which created local ownership, governance structures, and reputational capital. The CCAK is a professional membership association that aims to increase the use of clean cooking and fuels through policy advocacy, increasing awareness, and building the capacity of local enterprises.

The Alliance benefitted from the Secretary Clinton’s championing of the issue of clean cooking, and its launch at the Clinton Global Initiative helped facilitate support from the World Health Organization, the EPA, Royal Dutch Shell, and the UNF, among others. Since its formation, the Alliance has continued to find ways to attract champions who have been invaluable in ensuring commitments are made and honored. These individuals include those who can leverage political capital within specific organizations, as well as individual ambassadors who raise the profile of clean cooking, such as actress Julia Roberts and chef José Andrés.

2. Accelerate Collective Action: While creating a wide investment proposition in the accelerating investment stage supported a variety of stakeholders investing in the clean cooking industry, it also presented the challenge of responding to a diverse set of interests and motivations. Potential partners want order, but they do not want to be ordered. As such, the Alliance had to build industry legitimacy in order to facilitate collective action. Success in this stage of acceleration can be measured by the perceived legitimacy of the impact industry

Our research identified three activities that were central to the Alliance’s efforts to accelerate collective action. First, it sought to establish a common vision and goals for the clean cooking industry at the global and local levels. Given the mixed success of the development community’s prior efforts to promote clean cookstoves, the Alliance needed to create confidence in the direction in which the industry was moving and facilitate collective action among all of its stakeholders.

Second, we found that continued engagement and future investment by partners generally hinged on the Alliance building a solid foundation of empirical support for the relationships between the use of clean cookstoves and fuels, and specific social impacts. The existence and strength of this social value proposition proved invaluable in articulating the magnitude and urgency of the problem, crafting more effective solutions, and demonstrating progress towards the desired outcomes.

Third, the Alliance undertook efforts to ensure quality and consistency. Delivering on a shared vision, including achieving the expected social impacts, requires confidence in the manufacturing and use of the products. Given the wide range of product offerings, the Alliance needed to address information asymmetries across the value chain and build confidence in the consistency and quality of products being offered within and across markets.

To establish a common vision and goals for the industry, the Alliance had to engage and align a diverse set of stakeholders and advocate for the sector to become a priority for these stakeholders’ resources. This required co-creating a global strategy as well as individual CAPs in its eight focus countries. The global strategy was built with inputs from 350 key stakeholders and 11 working groups. The local CAPs were developed and owned by local institutions in each country, either a local association, local government ministries, or other stakeholders.

The process of creating these CAPs helped to lay the foundation for collective prioritization and action. In Bangladesh, for example, the CAP process resulted in the formation of the Household Energy Platform with support from the Power Division within the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources, which coordinates stakeholders and resources across the cookstove industry.

Maintaining commitment and momentum required the Alliance to demonstrate that the clean cooking industry was achieving the social impacts its partners desired. The Alliance found, for example, that while household air pollution was a problem recognized by the development community, evidence that clean cooking would provide demonstrated benefits for health was more limited. It therefore commissioned research to better understand the potential impact that lower emission biomass cookstoves and cleaner fuels could have on child survival, as well as research demonstrating how key indicators of cardiopulmonary health (like blood pressure and lung function) could change with the adoption of clean cooking. This information was also disseminated more broadly to create greater awareness and empower advocates within the clean cooking industry.

These results, however, were only meaningful if product quality and consistency could be ensured across several key dimensions. To do this, the Alliance invested in developing global standards. Working through the International Standards Organization process, a team of experts developed a tiered system that characterizes differences in efficiency, emissions, safety, and durability. These standards were developed to facilitate comparisons across similar products by providing a consistent approach for testing, characterizing and reporting performance, and labeling that provided a way to share this information to consumers.

Leveraging global efforts to create standards helped ensure harmonization across markets. Variations in local context, such as the availability and quality of different fuel types, could then be addressed by adapting the standards to these local realities, and communicating these standards through labels that are appropriate for the local market. For example, both Kenya and Bangladesh are engaged in efforts to develop local standards, testing approaches, and labeling regulations for cookstoves.

3. Accelerate Profitability: The Alliance’s market building activities were not directed at a specific enterprise. Rather they were targeted at building the market environment that surrounds these companies, so that all the enterprises in a market were better positioned to become profitable. Success in this stage can be measured by the establishment of durable and robust markets for clean cookstoves and fuels.

In our research we identified three core activities in the Alliance’s efforts to build profitable markets for clean cookstove enterprises. First, the Alliance explored opportunities to enhance the enabling environment by addressing the laws, regulations, and policies that influence business activities in the industry. These included cumbersome or inadequate rules that made it prohibitively expensive or time-consuming to do business, burdensome import duties and restrictions, and weak or non-existent institutional infrastructure that limited access to capital or otherwise prevented the market from operating efficiently.

Second, the Alliance invested in energizing demand for clean cooking products and services through awareness raising and behavior change. Need is not the same as demand, and in many markets there was low awareness of the benefits of clean cooking, which was a barrier to purchase.

Third, the Alliance saw an opportunity to reduce producer costs by facilitating bulk purchasing that allows for collective negotiation with suppliers. This improves the companies’ bottom lines and their ability to extend their product offerings further down the economic pyramid.

To address legal and institutional gaps, and to facilitate advocacy for market-building activities, the Alliance has supported the formation of local institutions in its focus countries. These may be business membership organizations like the CCAK in Kenya, or inter-ministerial bodies like the Household Energy Platform in Bangladesh. These organizations can take up issues that would be challenging for any one actor to address alone. In Kenya, the CCAK, with support and guidance from the Alliance, successfully advocated for the removal of a value added tax for both imported cookstoves and the raw materials required to manufacture cookstoves and facilitated the development of local testing centers to assess the quality of stoves.

Enhancing demand is a key pillar of the Alliance’s in-country efforts to increase the adoption of clean cooking solutions. The Alliance has piloted awareness campaigns along with behavior change communications programs to increase understanding of the dangers of indoor air pollution. This type of investment is a common good that few, if any, individual companies can or would want to make.

For example, in Bangladesh the Alliance has supported a campaign that used mass media, street theater, and fairs to raise awareness of clean cookstoves, which reached almost 50,000 people.

In some countries, the Alliance is working with financial institutions to increase access to consumer financing to enable customers to pay for clean cooking solutions on an installment basis. It has also created targeted subsidy programs in partnership with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to make cookstoves available to displaced populations. In Kenya, the CCAK is also engaging the government of Kenya to understand the opportunities for institutional purchases of clean cookstoves that would provide producers with predictable, high-volume demand.

4. Accelerate Impact: The Alliance recognized that only when enterprises are sustainable at scale can the industry’s impact goals be achieved. If the enterprises are unsustainable or remain small, the opportunity for impact will be limited. The Alliance’s activities and investments at this stage of acceleration focused on specific enterprises and included broader support for experimentation and innovation followed by targeting resources toward the best opportunities for sustainable growth. Success in this stage can be measured by the scaling of enterprises within and across geographies in a manner that is economically sustainable. This includes both the growth of specific enterprises and the replication of successful business models by other enterprises.

Our research found that the Alliance focused on three key activities in this stage of acceleration. First, it encouraged variation by enabling a relatively large number of enterprises to experiment with business model and technology innovations. By supporting a diverse set of approaches, the Alliance sought to increase the probability that a subset of enterprises with a demonstrated potential for growth would emerge.

Second, it targeted the most viable enterprises as candidates for additional support. This meant providing more resources to a smaller number of enterprises viewed as having the highest likelihood of achieving sustainability at scale.

Third, the Alliance recognized that a dedicated effort at understanding and sharing lessons learned, best practices, and performance drivers could help speed the success and growth of the selected enterprises while also providing logic for their decision-making.

The Alliance and its partners implemented several programs that provide support to enterprises seeking to innovate. By targeting specific bottlenecks faced by enterprises—such as providing seed capital to support proof of concept pilots, the unique challenges experienced by women entrepreneurs, and the high cost of technology research and development—the Alliance has spurred experimentation and variation. Additionally, the Alliance endeavored to make these programs accessible to as wide a range of enterprises as possible, including programs that specifically focus on locally-owned, early stage ventures.

To encourage scale, the Alliance designed interventions such as a capacity building facility that provided tailored technical assistance to enterprises that were ready to scale and partnered with impact investors that provided growth capital. The Alliance also recognized the importance of de-risking investments in the clean cooking industry by developing loan and loan guarantee programs that provide enterprises with working capital financing that they otherwise would be unable to access. While a winnowing process to identify high performers was necessary to enable the creation of a healthy, self-sustaining industry, this also required that the Alliance manage the tensions and discontent among enterprises that were not selected to receive further support.

As its support for this research study demonstrates, the Alliance is interested in understanding lessons learned and best practices that inform future decision making. Yet disincentives to learning continue, as most of the industry’s funders want to see short-term results that generate immediate impact in the field. However, the Alliance recognizes that this goal must be balanced with a longer-term perspective of learning how best to build enterprises that are sustainable at scale and to accelerate an impact industry with the limited resources available. The industry’s continued evolution, combined with the goal of adding more countries to the eight already in its portfolio, suggests that a learning orientation will only become more critical in the Alliance’s efforts to accelerate multiple markets targeting the BoP.

Implications for the Alliance

In collaboration with the Alliance leadership team, we applied this four-stage acceleration framework to help prioritize and choreograph activities in their strategic planning process. Assessing the gap between the current and desired state of the industry, we developed a roadmap for organizing action and rebalancing activities and investments at the global level, as well as in Kenya and Bangladesh. This analysis started by looking at relative success across the four acceleration strategies.

Over its first five years, the Alliance has been most successful in accelerating investment and collective action, and our analysis indicated that, at a global level, the Alliance’s work is currently centered on the latter stage. Its efforts at mobilizing substantial resources, establishing a common vision and goals, developing a wide social value proposition, and establishing quality and consistency in product offerings have provided a strong foundation for further accelerating the industry.

Maintaining this momentum will require continued attention across the four acceleration strategies. The adoption of the SDGs by the global community has created new opportunities to develop a wide value proposition through linking clean cooking to multiple SDGs. Short-term budget cycles and the emergence of new priorities are a reality of the development community and mobilizing resources will require continued attention to build relationships and activate financial support.

The Alliance believes that now is the time to put greater emphasis on accelerating profitability and impact. Increased investment in developing local institutions, and in awareness creation and behavior change interventions, reflect a greater focus on building sustainable markets for clean cooking enterprises. While the Alliance has invested in fostering variation and innovation among enterprises through a variety of mainly grantmaking programs, a shift toward scaling impact will require the Alliance to place more emphasis on selecting the most promising of these enterprises and facilitating access to the appropriate type and level of scaling capital. As the scale and impact of its investments grow, the Alliance will continue to expand its learning-oriented efforts to ensure these enterprises have access to the latest research on best practices, which will enhance their likelihood of success.

What this analysis produced was a structured approach for identifying next steps in the Alliance’s journey to accelerate the clean cookstove industry, and a guide to building out the details of the organization’s strategic plan. (See “Roadmap for clean cookstove industry acceleration” below.) Applying this approach also yielded insights into the internal capabilities and external collaborations necessary for the Alliance to best achieve continued success. A reprioritization of activities can point to the need for new internal skills and capabilities and also involve reallocating existing staff and resources into new priorities. Similarly, partnerships that are optimized for a particular portfolio of activities may not be as suitable when the focus shifts.

While this analysis was developed for the Alliance, we believe that other IIAs may benefit from pursuing a similar approach. Creating growing and sustainable impact industries that target the BoP—such as affordable energy, clean water and sanitation, better housing, and improved health care—can be life altering for billions of people around the world.

Roadmap for clean cookstove industry acceleration.

If these IIAs are able to effectively identify, prioritize, and choreograph activities within and across the four stages of acceleration, they and their partners will be better positioned to turn their vision of impact into reality.","When then US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, announced the launch of the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (the Alliance) in 2010, she supported an audacious goal—100 million households adopting clean cookstoves and fuels by 2020.
Our definition of an impact industry accelerator compliments and extends work done on the concept of an industry facilitator.
It uses these data to advocate for greater investment in clean cooking solutions by public and private sector partners.
This information was also disseminated more broadly to create greater awareness and empower advocates within the clean cooking industry.
Success in this stage can be measured by the establishment of durable and robust markets for clean cookstoves and fuels."

Assa Doron and Robin Jeffrey have both been writing regularly on the waste/garbage seen in public places in India. To put it differently, they are critics of India’s unclean public spaces and the disposal of waste. They have been advocating change. They adopt the Gandhian method that focuses on changing the behaviour of caste Hindus who expect others to clean. In other words, they do not find any problem with the Gandhian method.

The method adopted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his signature campaign, Swachh Bharat, celebrates the same approach. This method has undergone no scrutiny at all. What aspect of change does the Gandhian approach preach? Asking safai karmacharis to also do cleaning as a service is nothing less than upholding the caste system through the backdoor.

Doron and Jeffrey’s article is a comment occasioned by the release of the ‘Swachh Survekshan’ rankings. Indore in Madhya Pradesh has been ranked first as the cleanest city for the second consecutive year.

In the beginning of the article itself, the authors argue that Indore is doing something right about cleanliness. They describe the methodology used by the municipal corporation in keeping the city clean. It uses close to 10,000 employees, and has deployed 1,000 ragpickers to segregate waste in the vehicles that collect waste daily from every household.

The authors argue that a clean city requires two ingredients for managing its households: the first is managing its waste, the second, its caste and prejudice.

According to them, Indore seems to have identified and addressed the first issue but it’s not clear what the authors’ position is on the second one, and whether Indore has succeeded in addressing it. This is the ‘unspeakable secret’ all along the article.

The article discusses the methods employed by Indore’s administrators in making the city clean but doesn’t explain the status of sweepers in the very same town. Instead, it make references to Gujarat, and to a book, Untouchable, written by Hazari nearly 70 years ago. The problem is that with such random references, which do not focus on Indore, the authors end up making at best a vague argument about the relationship between caste, sanitation and cleanliness.

There is, in fact, a strong relationship between waste, caste and labour but the authors fail to build this argument in the context of Indore. Most importantly, if Indore’s goal – or Swachh Bharat’s aim – of achieving a clean city can be achieved without breaking the caste stigma, then there is surely a problem with the approach itself. This the authors fail to recognise.

Most importantly, they argue, “For them [safai karamcharis] to do the systematic work required of modern towns and cities, they need to be rewarded, trained and valued.” What is the reward the authors are talking about? Are they saying that they are not being paid enough for their work? Or that they aren’t trained for the work? Who should value whom? Basically, the authors don’t problematise the present functioning of the system in the context of waste and safai karamcharis. Rather, as a solution, they argue that change of behaviour is needed. That we should move away from seeing safai karamcharis as volunteers doing some sort of social work, to recognising that it is work they are doing and that we should treat them and their work equally.

In my view, there is hardly any difference between the authors’ argument that safai karamcharis be rewarded and Narendra Modi arguing that this work is a ‘spiritual experience’ for them for which they must have been rewarded. Most importantly, though they agree that there is a particular caste engaged in cleaning, they don’t problematise that fact. Rather, respect, dignity, training and fair reward for steady work form the essence of their argument. In other words, the article doesn’t offer safai karamcharis a fundamental change.

The safai karamcharis do not argue for respect and dignity in isolation, but that they need to be released from the chains of scavenging. For this, neither the authors, nor Modi nor Gandhi have any argument to make. As I repeatedly argue, the Gandhian method can never remove bhangis/arundhathiyars from the shackles that will continue to entangle them.

In this context, it is instructive to take a look at the arguments Doron and Jeffrey have made in the past.

In ‘Waste and the City’, a short article by the authors in the edited volume, The City and South Asia (2014), they both talk about the statistics of waste produced in India, comparing it with North America and Europe. While discussing the waste that is produced and disposed, they talk about the dangers of living next to garbage. They suggest ways to reduce waste in urban India and demand mechanised and institutionalised collection methods.

Caste never figures in this analysis, nor in their Asian Currents article of December 2014, titled “Modi’s new broom aims to sweep India clean“. In this article, they examine whether the BJP can make the Swachh Bharath campaign more than a picnic for advertising agencies. And critique whether the campaign will create widespread waste management that is systematic, effective and sustainable. Largely, they were arguing in favour of a systematic method to deal with waste removal.

In the November 2014 ISAS Special Report, ‘Clean India!’ Miles to Go Before We Sweep?‘, Robin Jeffrey responds to the Swachh Bharat campaign introduced by Modi. As Indian cities expand, they face two issues: one, unheard of population density and the other is caste. The article discusses the amount of garbage produced that goes unprocessed. Jeffrey argues that a lot of it rots and spreads diseases, and henceforth disposal should be adopted and the government should follow other countries in this regard. He argues that the present problems faced by Indian cities are the same faced in 19th century Europe, North America and Australia. Citizens realised the relation between the city’s filth and diseases and local authorities took the task of providing clean water, sewage and drainage to all their residents.

The article notes that the other problem in India is caste, where a large number of Dalits work as safai karamcharis. For the author, the problem emerges from caste society’s belief that the collection of waste is someone else’s job. That is why people leave their environs dirty. “To change such deep feelings will require persistence and example,” Jeffrey writes, adding: “Having a Prime Minister from a lower caste, who is not a dvijya or twice-born, who has a remarkably strong personal mandate and who makes Clean India a signature campaign, is an important start”. Sadly it is the same prime minister, Narendra Modi, who wrote in his now withdrawn 2007 book Karmayog, that scavenging was an “experience in spirituality” for the Valmikis’.

Even in their latest article, it is unclear what Doron and Jeffrey aim for at when speaking about caste in waste. The only thing they argue in the present and in the past, is for those who think of cleaning waste as someone else’s job to change their mindset. They don’t dismantle the root of such thinking – caste – but go with Gandhi’s ideology that everyone should be involved in cleaning waste. An approach that preaches ‘cleaning’ as a voluntary service and simultaneously ignores the fact that only a particular caste is made to work in sanitation is an approach that reinforces the caste system. This is precisely the reason why the campaign ambassadors and celebrities in the photo ops for Swachh Bharat are from a caste where cleaning is not a traditional occupation.

The authors press for clean places through institutionalised mechanisms. Their demand for clean public spaces is driven by the need to combat the spread of diseases. The Western approach to sanitation was a response to the spread of contagious diseases and gave equal importance to personal hygiene and the cleanliness of public spaces. This thematic shift has led to a focus only on toilets as technology, forgetting that sanitation in India is not only a taboo but also a stigma. It is important that we design our own sanitation policy with lessons from the West but we need not copy the same methodology that they adopted. Let us not forget that caste is an unequal system and we need to derive a practice that removes safai karamcharis from the chain of this particular work. For this, we have to start from the beginning – and study how we understand waste in the first place.

Assa Doron and Robin Jeffrey’s written separate responses to Ravichandran Bathran’s critique are appended below.

Assa Doron writes:

Ravichandran Bathran is correct to note that we focus on behavioural change, but such change, we believe, must be understood within a wider waste economy. We agree that a Gandhian approach of frugality and self-sufficiency is a romantic lens, thinly dressed in the garb of Gandhigiri (à la Lage Raho, Munna Bhai) – a celebration of individual responsibility cast as the ultimate agent of change. Such Gandhian inspired views are clearly endorsed by the PM, who seeks to galvanise the population at home and the diaspora under the auspices of Gandhi, Swachh Bharat and the promise of vikas (development). But Gandhi’s spectacles have a limited vision for the densely populated, consumer-driven society of 21st century India, excreting an inordinate amount of toxic waste – from construction debris to human waste. Waste is, therefore, a symbol and a reality of this ever-changing landscape, yet cultural stigmas continue to stick to those who are charged with handling garbage and sanitation.

As we repeatedly point out in ‘Waste of a Nation‘, unless recognition and reward are given to those who handle waste – untouchables, poor Muslims, landless labourers – waste will continue to choke India. It is not a question of upholding caste structures or not. Caste is a social fact, anchored in institutions, social structures, and cultural attitudes. It infuses the system itself – from sanitation to waste collection – something we extensively document in our book, and which is central to recent studies on sanitation by Diane Coffey and Dean Spears’ Where India Goes and Mukul Sharma’s penetrating examination of Sulabh International and its Gandhian ideals.

We are all too aware that attitudes and behaviours are hard to change, so that those untouchables condemned to deal with waste before Independence, during Hazari’s time, are still experiencing multiple forms of prejudice and oppression. In rapidly urbanising India, waste is a product of a political, cultural and economic system in its most visceral sense. In a society that increasingly consumes growing quantities of throw-away products, everyone is implicated in the waste economy to differing degrees. Under such conditions, oppressed workers will find it difficult to escape from the exploitation, prejudice and alienation they face on daily basis; trapped in a double bind of ritual pollution and grave occupational hazards. Any spiritual gloss on the underclass conceals this moral degradation and grim reality, rather than scrutinising it.

There is no clean sweep when it comes to cultural prejudice regarding caste. Discrimination works in multiple ways, from spatial segregation, cultural schemas, to the denial of jobs, social services, and basic sanitation facilities. In practical terms, those at the bottom of the waste pyramid are struggling to avoid being crushed by the mounting volumes of detritus, and what is needed are just rewards, suitable technologies and recognition by the authorities and people of the value of their labour. Speaking about this “unspeakable secret” is aimed at effecting change and breaking the vicious circle of social discrimination and economic exploitation, validated by religious ideology.

Indore’s recent experiences with waste present an example of policies and techniques that a survey has deemed to be effective. The successes and pitfalls of Indore are worth examining to discover lessons about regulation, transparency and improvement in the conditions and opportunities of the people who deal with waste.

Robin Jeffrey writes:

There are a number of misunderstandings in Ravichandran Bathran’s interpretation of our recent piece in The Wire. To begin with, that piece was not an endorsement of Indore’s sanitation programmes, as Bathran infers, but rather a suggestion that Indore was worth inspection to see what in fact has happened there that might have lessons for elsewhere. That inspection is for people close to the action to conduct.

We welcome the chance to be part of a discussion of a conflict and a problem that have to be overcome to achieve the levels of public sanitation and health that India aspires to. Bathran’s comments provide an opportunity to try to clarify positions and definitions and to discuss policy that may effect desirable change. Achievement of a Clean India depends on erosion and elimination of prejudice, structures and practices based on caste. No sustained and genuinely Clean India is likely until then, and indeed, a genuinely Clean India will be only achieved in lock-step with the erosion and elimination of caste beliefs and practices. How are these goals to be achieved?

Gandhi’s legacy needs to be demystified and better understood. His position on cleanliness and waste, elaborated in “The Ideal Bhangi,” was patronising, unrealistic and intensely political, dictated by the need to keep Congress’s national base and major donors onside in the 1930s. B. R. Ambedkar blew apart “The Ideal Bhangi” in his withering response in 1937, entitled “The Vindication of Caste by Mahatma Gandhi.”

One of the cruel dilemmas of India’s predicament with waste management is this: how do you improve sanitation in cities and villages; provide essential human needs to people who do the work now, today; and – the most important aspect – ensure that they, and especially their children, can aspire realistically to different and better futures? Children of waste-workers should not be made to believe that their futures are decided, closed and confined to occupations dictated by birth.

The question is also one of class, because not everyone who currently works at the hands-on level of cleaning India is a Scheduled Caste. Poor Muslims, Scheduled Tribes and displaced, landless Hindus also work with waste. The word, “Dalit” is capable of encompassing a range of “the oppressed,” not simply people classified as Scheduled Castes, though the narrower definition is often what is meant.

To be sure, in Europe, North America and Australia, hands-on waste work is not particularly esteemed. Robin Nagle, the American anthropologist who worked as an ordinary labourer on New York garbage trucks, tells of the New York City co-worker who lived in a nice house but never told his neighbours what he did. He was able to provide “rich … social, educational and professional opportunities for his children” (Picking Up, p. 220). Part of the reason was that he belonged to a strong, class-based union and was decently paid. And he did not have to contend with questions about “what caste” he was. (It needs to be noted, however, that hands-on waste work in the US often has a large proportion of African-Americans).

What sorts of policies would move India in a direction that erodes the limitations on, and the prejudices against, people who work with waste? It’s 18 years since the Bhopal Conference, convened by the Madhya Pradesh government, and the Bhopal Declaration of 2002 – “Charting a New Course for Dalits in the 21st Century.” The 21-point “action agenda” had two particularly do-able recommendations. One was that governments must buy some of their requirements from “socially disadvantaged businesses”; another was that there should be “compulsory, free and high-quality education for all Dalits.” One could envisage, as a first step, Dalit-run businesses growing up around the recycling industry if such incentives were rigorously applied. And high-quality education is fundamental – education that leads to the skills and knowledge necessary to gain employment in any field.

But these are steps that will only show results in the medium and long term. A short-term step is to ensure that the people who work with waste – and there are many categories of such people – are equipped with, and become the specialists in the 10-tonne trucks, the honey-suckers, the transport and electronic infrastructure that are essential in the struggle to keep cities clean. Skills in mechanics, electronics and transport are transferrable to other industries, and those sorts of skills can be imparted now.

What other practical, immediate policy options are imaginable? What are the pathways to two desirable and inseparable goals – eroding caste and making a Clean India. The following list of possibilities may provoke better ideas.

Possibilities?

One, a national youth volunteer scheme – think of the NCC perhaps? – made up of idealistic graduates willing to serve for one or two years to help staff high-quality schools in the poorest neighbourhoods. Compulsory, high-quality education for Dalits was one of the recommendations of the Bhopal Declaration (Recommendation No. 9).

Two, widespread development and introduction of the appropriate, sophisticated equipment necessary for effective public sanitation.

Three, systematic, credentialed training programmes for waste workers in operating and maintaining the mechanical and electronic equipment necessary to keep urban places clean and minimise the dangerous and distasteful aspects of the work. Skills are transferrable to other industries.

Four, commitment by national and state governments to source a proportion of their needs from recycling industries run by Dalits, thus encouraging recycling and the growth of Dalit skills and wealth (Bhopal Declaration, Recommendation No. 15).

Five, since the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have their own television channels, empower and finance the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and National Commission for Scheduled Tribes to run television channels with a brief to giving visibility to issues related to SCs/STs.

There are no doubt better ideas about making a beginning. What are they? And how are profound changes to begin?","In rapidly urbanising India, waste is a product of a political, cultural and economic system in its most visceral sense.
Achievement of a Clean India depends on erosion and elimination of prejudice, structures and practices based on caste.
No sustained and genuinely Clean India is likely until then, and indeed, a genuinely Clean India will be only achieved in lock-step with the erosion and elimination of caste beliefs and practices.
(It needs to be noted, however, that hands-on waste work in the US often has a large proportion of African-Americans).

Tired and sore muscles are likely. Muddy gloves a given. And a sense of accomplishment a certainty.

But the one thing that volunteers in the annual Ohio River Sweep are most prone to compare after several hours of picking up garbage are unusual stories – because you just never know what will wash up on the banks of the Ohio and Licking rivers.

Strange things … like a snub-nose revolver and a weight attached to a chain.

Creepy things … like old baby dolls, a car seat, and a Big Wheel.

Gross things … like a camping toilet, soggy clothes, and the carcass of a 3-foot alligator gar.

Heavy things … like shopping carts, tires, a basketball rim, and televisions.

Mostly, however, it’s anything that floats: Styrofoam, soccer balls, lumber scraps, and the omnipresent plastic bottles – hundreds if not thousands of plastic bottles, so many bottles that you never want to drink out of one again.

On Saturday, volunteers will add to the collection of garbage and memories at three locations in Covington, as nature enthusiasts will team with people who hate litter to create a formidable force – a platoon of people sweeping the shorelines of the 981-mile Ohio River and its tributaries in six states from Pittsburgh, Pa., to Cairo, Ill.

“River Sweep is always an inspiring experience because you know that you are one of thousands of volunteers all working at the same time to keep our river valley clean,” said Jen Barnett, president of Keep Covington Beautiful, a local non-profit dedicated to cleaning up the City.

“Covington is lucky enough to be home to the banks of two rivers, so we must be stewards of these beautiful resources and make sure they are an asset to our community,” she said.

The non-profit is teaming with the City of Covington, the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission, and Rumpke Waste & Recycling to organize the work at three sites in Covington for the 2018 Ohio River Sweep event, scheduled for 9 a.m. to noon on Saturday.

“We really need volunteers,” said Sheila Fields, Covington’s Solid Waste & Recycling Coordinator. “This is a great event. It’s actually pretty fun.”

Last year about 90 volunteers participated, she said. Since 2014, over 7.1 tons of trash and debris have been removed from Covington’s riverbanks.

“In addition to keeping the riverbanks clean, we hope that increased public awareness about the conditions of our waterways will foster greater environmental concern for them and strengthen the conversation about how we as consumers and caretakers can change our behaviors to help save our precious natural resources,” Fields said.

Volunteers should wear shoes (boots if possible) and clothes that can get dirty. Sandals are not advised. Tools and clean-up materials are provided. Volunteers receive a T-shirt and a light breakfast and lunch to celebrate their hard work. For that reason, they’re encouraged to register as a volunteer at HERE.

144,https://foodmag.com.au/new-technology-offers-clean-alternative-toxic-chemicals/,"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",FOOD Magazine - Australia,New technology offers clean alternative to toxic chemicals,"Ideal for use in hatcheries, bakeries, dairies and food and beverage processing facilities, a new system that uses electro-chemical activation (ECA) has entered the Australian and New Zealand market. Comprising three components – high-purity salt, water and electricity – this sanitising system offers an alternative to concentrated chemicals and has proven to be just as effective, if not more effective, than traditional chemicals.

What is ECA technology?

Electro-chemical activation (ECA) refers to a process where an electrochemical cell uses electricity, high-purity salt and ordinary tap water to produce a cleaning and sanitising solution. It is also known as electrolysed water, electrolysed oxidising water (EOW), electro-activated water or electro-chemically activated water solution.

ECA produces both a cleaning solution and a sanitiser. The cleanser is an alkaline solution that cleans and degreases, while the sanitiser is a strong oxidiser that provides powerful antimicrobial activity.

ECA versus chemicals

Advanced ECA technology can be just as effective as traditional chemicals but comes without the health hazards and costs associated with concentrated chemicals. Traditional chemicals contain high levels of active ingredients to ensure they are effective – which are harmful to both people and the environment.

Because ECA solutions are produced onsite and are used immediately, they can eliminate the same microorganisms despite having low levels of active chemicals. For example, the Klarion sanitiser is twice as effective as concentrated bleach – 200ppm of Klarion sanitiser does the work of 400ppm of bleach.

With ECA equipment on site, facilities produce cleaners and sanitisers in ready-to-use concentrations on demand. This eliminates the hazards of having to dilute or mix chemicals and also removes the need to store or dispose of chemicals.

Also, workers don’t have to wear or use personal protective equipment (PPE) because there is no harm in the natural solutions produced by ECA. They are non-irritating, fragrance-free and there is no risk of chemical burn. This has the additional benefit of reducing costs for employers.

Other cost savings come in the fact that using the ECA equipment will result in savings of 20 to 30 per cent compared with the use of traditional chemicals. There is no capital expenditure as employers just pay based on the volume produced onsite.

Maintenance is also limited compared with using traditional chemicals – just a daily check of the cleaner and sanitiser pH levels and the salt level in the brine tank is required. The disposal waste stream is less harmful and doesn’t require any special treatment.

Why hasn’t ECA been widely used?

If ECA technology is as good as it sounds, why hasn’t it been widely adopted by the industry? Because until recently, there have been problems with salt residue and corrosion, particularly with commonly used surfaces such as stainless steel. While most salt is converted during the electrolysis process, traces would often remain in the output solutions.

However, one manufacturer has been able to successfully create an ECA technology that works with salt-free output. The Klarion patented technology by Spraying Systems is one that uses ECA but separates the salt source from the liquid flow path in the electrolytic cell via a charge-specific ion-exchange membrane. This results in a pure, salt-free output that can be used on stainless-steel surfaces without the risk of corrosion. The Klarion Cleaning and Sanitising System is also unique in that the electrolytic cell design has a longer cell life and is maintenance-free compared with other ECA technology.

Real examples

One of America’s most established organic bakeries, the Alvarado Street Bakery, adopted the Klarion Cleaning and Sanitising System after learning it could provide a safe, sustainable alternative to chemicals.

As an organic, kosher-certified, zero-waste bakery, there were three factors that determined their trial of the Klarion system. This included the challenge in validating the chemical use, worker safety and sustainability.

The 40-year-old, employee-owned bakery was using chemicals with high chlorine concentrations. Their first issue was in finding test equipment to validate the effectiveness of the chemicals used due to the high chlorine level. Another concern was the risk to worker safety due to the use of toxic chemicals and the waste run-off from these chemicals.

The Klarion system was installed easily into the bakery and was used with the existing sanitation standard operating procedures (SSOPs). Its first use was on food contact surfaces that were part of its adenosine triphosphate (ATP) swabbing program. The test results found a reduction in warn and fail numbers, as well as a reduction in cleaning time (it cut cleaning time by 15 minutes). The bakery then tested for pathogens in drains containing Klarion solutions and both drains passed the test.

Importantly, the worker response was positive. Employees found the system easy to learn and use and were impressed by the safety of the solutions. The fact that they did not have to worry so much about chemical exposure was a big positive. They also found that it was easier to remove lecithin and built-up residue and that the testing of the pH and ppm of free available chlorine was much easier with Klarion. The transition to using the Klarion system was seamless and painless – not one SSOP required modification.

Another example is that of a chicken hatchery in the US, which saved more than US$1,300 per month after adopting the Klarion Cleaning and Sanitizing System onsite generation system.

The hatchery had previously using traditional chemicals to clean and sanitise egg trays and other equipment. Concentrated chemicals in 208-litre drums required special storage space and needed to be diluted before use. This required workers wearing PPE and it also affected their morale – they felt uncomfortable about working with, and being regularly exposed to, dangerous and toxic chemicals. Additionally, the chemicals needed to be handled and disposed of carefully to avoid ground and wastewater plant contamination.

The Klarion EGS 6020 system was installed at the hatchery and it achieved the high standards of sanitation that were previously set – but through a much safer process. The worker safety and morale improved. Also, the hatchery found that they saved US$1,300 a month compared with the traditional chemicals, as they eliminated the costs of purchasing the chemicals, their disposal and the PPE that had been required for employees.","Comprising three components – high-purity salt, water and electricity – this sanitising system offers an alternative to concentrated chemicals and has proven to be just as effective, if not more effective, than traditional chemicals.

145,https://www.dairyreporter.com/Article/2018/06/13/Seven-steps-to-reducing-costs-by-increasing-Clean-in-Place-efficiency,"Sat, 16 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",DairyReporter.com,Seven steps to reducing costs by increasing Clean-in-Place efficiency,"A lot of these challenges center on the clean-in-place (CIP) operation, since inefficiency in this operation can represent a significant source of extra costs.

CIP, used by virtually every dairy operation, is the procedure for cleaning and sterilizing food processing equipment, Kyle Knutson, product manager, North America, at Emerson Automation Solutions told DairyReporter.

The process is conducted by circulating water and chemicals through sections (called circuits) of the plant.

This removes any product deposits and ensures the process equipment and pipework are clean/sterile and ready for the next process to be run. Typically, dairy plants run the CIP program at least once per day, or more, depending on the process and application.

Knutson said CIP programs differ from application to application but traditionally they consist of three basic steps.

The first is flushing. Dairies typically start their CIP process by running warm water through the pipes for a pre-determined amount of time.

Following this, an alkaline detergent and/or acids are circulated at a temperature between 140-167o​F, and third, hot water is circulated to disinfect the piping and rinse out any remaining chemicals.

These steps present measurement challenges that can induce energy loss and create waste, which ultimately leads to a higher cost of operation, Knutson said.

He noted all dairies share seven CIP challenges.

1. Product left in pipes​

During the CIP process, Knutson said, any product left over in the circuit will be unusable as soon as it encounters the caustic chemicals used for cleaning.

Pigging, a common practice used to clean pipes, is often not able to be performed, as intrusive measurement sensors, which penetrate a pipe, would be damaged.

Utilizing a non-intrusive temperature measurement allows a plant to avoid the need for thermowells or process penetrations that would impede the use of pigging, harvesting additional product before the CIP program begins, resulting in less product waste.

Using an advanced surface temperature solution that applies a thermal conductivity algorithm to measured ambient and pipe surface temperatures can provide an accurate and repeatable internal process measurement.

2. Chemical holding tanks​

Large tanks are used to hold chemicals utilized in the CIP process. Making sure that these chemicals are used efficiently and not wasted is vital to reducing costs and ultimately saving money.

A hygienic pressure transmitter with high accuracy at low-pressure ranges allows for repeatable and accurate readings. This ensures reliable hydrostatic level measurements at all times, while hygienic fork switches allow for reliable level alarms. Adjustable switching delay prevents false switching in turbulent applications.

3. CIP processes running too long​

Some of the most critical CIP measurements are return temperature and conductivity, Knutson said.

Accurate temperature measurements with drift alert and hot backup ensures temperature stays online and limits the need for additional CIP runs. Conductivity is also important to identify fluid changeover within a CIP process.

A four-electrode conductivity sensor intended for measuring in the pharmaceutical and food and beverage industries can be utilized to accurately measure conductivity.

The broad dynamic range of the sensor (1 - 1,400,000 μS/cm) makes it ideal for CIP applications. It also allows for quick responses to the needed temperature changes.

In addition, an advanced surface temperature solution produces accurate process temperature data without the need for pipe penetration. Surface temperature measurements can also help monitor temperatures in hard to measure places, ensuring that CIP processes are not running longer than necessary. This, in turn, limits waste of chemicals and utility heat.

4. Detection of milk and water phases​

During the CIP program, it is important to be able to detect different phases in the process. This allows the plant to differentiate between milk, water, and caustic chemicals, according to Knutson.

When plant operators have access to this information, they can fully utilize the product and ensure as little as possible goes to waste. Knowing what phase the process is in also allows for quicker changeover from CIP back to product production.

Utilizing density measurement phase detection, such as with a Coriolis meter, allows for dairies to identify different densities of the product, effectively making plant operators able to detect the difference between the product, water rinse, and caustic cleaning solution.

5. Maintaining turbulence for cleanliness​

Knutson said the CIP process requires that the liquid moving through the pipes maintains a certain velocity for optimal cleanliness. Liquid moving too slow can leave behind undesirable chemicals and spoiled product.

Utilizing accurate velocity measurement allows for plants to maintain the highest degree of sanitation. A Coriolis transmitter should be utilized to provide the most accurate measurement of velocity. It can calculate derived variables such as volume flow rate, flow totals, and concentration measurement which can then be translated into an output signal useful for process control.

6. Steam trap failure​

During the CIP program, condensed steam, known as condensate, is collected in steam traps and a condensate tank before being pumped back to the boiler. If the steam trap is failing, steam can be lost and require more energy to keep the plant running. Effectively monitoring the health of the steam traps ensures energy is not being wasted, thus decreasing energy costs as well as maintenance hours.

The solution comes in the form of a wireless acoustic transmitter that allows visibility into steam traps and pressure relief valves by accurately communicating acoustic level and temperature data. The steam trap monitoring software provides real-time, continuous information about steam trap conditions, energy usage, and emissions.

7. Utility steam heating​

Dairy processing uses more energy than any other sector of food processing, and Knutson said CIP, especially, accounts for a major portion of this energy use. In dairy plants, steam is used extensively for sanitation and cleaning during the CIP program. Inaccurately measuring steam while using it to clean equipment can be costly for plant operators.

Multivariable differential pressure (DP) transmitters can accurately measure the flow of steam, ensuring it is used efficiently and effectively. Ultimately, this leads to a great energy cost reduction.

Just knowing these seven challenges exist and that solutions are straightforward with the correct instrumentation can save dairy processors time and money in energy and wasted product, as well as help maintain efficient plant operations.

Emerson​ offers hygienic instrumentation and measurement solutions to help dairy processors address these issues and improve the quality of their products.","Dairies typically start their CIP process by running warm water through the pipes for a pre-determined amount of time.

Photo: Vincent Lali

Shack-dwellers from Tsunami informal settlement in Delft marched to the Cape Town Civic Centre on Friday morning to demand that the municipality upgrades streets, installs flush toilets, connects electricity to shacks, clears illegal rubbish dumps and activates an unused mast light.

Community leader Kwanele Mcaleni said the City last cleaned the streets in August 2016. “Our streets have holes that are filled with dirty water, but the City is neglecting them. We want the City to clean and improve them,” he said.

Mcaleni said the shack-dwellers are tired of relieving themselves in chemical toilets. “On hot days you come out of a chemical toilet drenched in sweat.”

He said about 3,500 shack-dwellers used 210 chemical toilets in the informal settlement. “The chemical toilets become full before the time for janitors to empty them. As a result, residents use the bushes nearby,” said Mcaleni. “Sometimes residents return from the bushes undressed after thugs rob them of their clothes and hard-earned cash.”

“Currently, we don’t have a place where we can dump water after we have washed dishes, taken a bath and done laundry,” he said. “If we deposit grey water in the chemical toilets, they will become full before time, and we won’t have a place to relieve ourselves.”

He said the shack-dwellers wanted a mast light located in Tsunami to work. “The City set up the mast light two years ago, but it is not yet operational. Now it merely serves to ornament Tsunami.”

He said residents wanted the mast light to operate and deter thugs from committing crime at night. “Residents die as a result of crime, and it is not easy for cops to work at night because Tsunami is dark.”

Mcaleni said people living in formal houses want shack-dwellers to stop drawing electricity from their houses. “House owners say their electrical appliances burn because the shack-dwellers draw electricity from their electricity boxes,” said Mcaleni.

“Recently, the house owners pulled all electric cables from their houses. They are gatvol with the shack-dwellers who want to get electricity from them.”

Now the shack-dwellers want the City to devise a plan to install electricity in Tsunami on a temporary basis, he said. “We know the City intends to relocate us somewhere and use the land as a cemetery. However, we want it to give us electricity while we are still staying here.”

When GroundUp visited the informal settlement on Saturday, filthy water was stagnating in potholes in untarred streets between shacks. Illegal rubbish dumps looked as if they had been cleaned, but there was still an overpowering stench.

Shack-dwellers said they are fed-up with staying beside the muddy and dirty streets. “My son comes into contact with the dirty water when he plays ball outside. He often asks me to scratch him as the dirty water makes him itch,” said Nikiswa Cengimbo, 36, who has a two-year-old son.

She said, “The water stinks. When a car moves through the water, a powerful stench spreads around and comes into my shack.”

“When the sun is hot, flies move into my shack and bother us,” she said.

Councillor Stuart Diamond, acting Mayoral Committee member for Informal Settlements, Water and Sanitation, confirmed receiving a memorandum of demands from the shack-dwellers.

“I addressed the community stating that we will listen to their call and will engage them on their memorandum,” said Diamond. He said he had already taken the memorandum to City staff and they were dealing with the demands.

“We take the memorandum incredibly seriously, and we will look for ways to craft a solution for the people of Tsunami,” said Diamond.","Tsunami informal settlement in Delft is a grim place, and residents are demanding that the City of Cape Town improves it.

In commemoration of the 2018 World Environment Day themed ‘Beat Plastic Pollution’, Oando PLC championed a clean-up exercise of the Ozumba Mbadiwe water way.

World Environment Day is an initiative by the United Nations (UN) to encourage worldwide awareness and action to protect of the environment. It is seen as the “people’s day” for doing something to take care of the Earth.

Speaking on the significance of the initiative, Kayode Boladale, GM Operations Integrity, Oando Energy Resources said: “We have taken up the mantle to clean up the Cowrie Creek Ozumba Mbadiwe waterway in a bid to beat plastic pollution which is a menace in Lagos.

“Did you know that plastic accounts for 10% of all the waste we generate? Did you know we buy 1 million plastic bottles every minute? Did you know it takes up to 450 years for plastic to decompose? With facts like these it is imperative that we start to rethink the way we use plastic for the good of the planet. We championed this initiative in order to set an example for others; individuals and companies to follow” he said.

With a population of over 170 million people, Nigeria produces more plastic waste than the infrastructure can manage. In Lagos, a population of 21 million inhabitants produces upwards of 10,000 metric tonnes of plastic waste daily. Only 40% of the waste is properly disposed of, the remaining 60% litters the roads and waterways.

In an interview on the current state of waste in the waterways, Damilola Famakinwa; Managing Director, Lagos State Waterways Authority (LASWA) said,“Lagosians litter the waterways with empty plastic bottles, nylon and various kinds of filth. This is totally unacceptable by any standard. We even have organizations emptying their waste water and various chemical pollution in the waterways.”

Plastic is extremely durable and environmental experts have reported that, “every bit of plastic ever made still exists.” As plastic debris float in the seawater, it absorbs dangerous pollutants. These chemicals are highly toxic and have a wide range of chronic effects, including endocrine disruption and cancer-causing mutations. When animals eat these pieces of plastic, the toxins are absorbed into their bodies and passed up the food chain, for example, when fishes and other marine species mistake the plastic items for food, they ingest the particles and pass these toxic chemicals through the food chain and ultimately to our dinner plates.

Speaking at the clean-up exercise, an employee of Oando who took part in the clean-up said: “I couldn’t have asked for a better way to spend my day; knowing that I played a part to reduce plastic pollution and in the process clean up my environment gives me a sense of fulfilment, I saved a few marine animals today. Having witnessed first-hand the amount of waste in our waterways, I’ve learnt that we have to treat our environment with respect, by disposing our refuse properly.”

The waterway clean up exercise is one of the many ways Oando PLC is actively supporting the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable; conserve and sustainably use the oceans, sea and marine resources; and ensure access to water and sanitation for all.

In line with creating a better environment, Oando recently moved into its new headquarters, the Wings Office Complex. The building has been coined one of the most energy efficient buildings in Lagos. It filters air supply at a minimum rate of 8 litres per person/second, has smart lighting systems and external cladding designed to limit direct solar gain.

At the end of the clean-up exercise, Oando successfully rid the Ozumba Mbadiwe waterway of plastic bottles weighing up to 5,000kg in one day.

Speaking, Alero Balogun, Head Corporate Communications, Oando PLC, said: “As a company, we will continue to play our part to make the world a better place by championing initiatives such as this to ensure that we leave a safe planet for future generations to inhabit. The Cowrie Creek waterway being right next to our new head office makes this initiative personal to the company. I urge everyone to reduce their use of plastics and when used to make an effort to recycle; if you cannot reuse it, refuse it.”","ADVERTISEMENTIn commemoration of the 2018 World Environment Day themed ‘Beat Plastic Pollution’, Oando PLC championed a clean-up exercise of the Ozumba Mbadiwe water way.

As part of its marine biodiversity management mission, the Directorate of the Environment organized a cleaning of the Saint Nicolas rocks on 15 June 2018.

These coral producing rocks, located at the exit of the Fontvieille port, are rich in biodiversity and must be preserved. However, they are subject to the pressures of human activities which result in the presence of waste, a large proportion of which comes from recreational fishing activities (fishing lines, hooks, etc). For two years, several cleaning operations have made it possible to remove much of the waste in this area.

This clean-up operation is also an opportunity to unite the various local players around a common environmental activity and has been organized in two stages:

The first day, 15 June 2018, is in collaboration with the following institutional bodies: the Prince’s Carabineers, the Fire Brigade, the Maritime and Airport Police Division, the Oceanographic Museum and the Scientific Centre of Monaco.

The second cleaning day will be held in autumn 2018 in collaboration with different Monegasque associations who are mobilizing for the protection of marine life.

Clean Harbour Program: new bins installed on the port

As part of the Clean Harbour program, new waste bins have recently been installed on the port of Monaco by the Urban Planning Department.

The enclosures located on the quay of the central T sometimes became a mini dumping site, where boaters deposited their bulky waste. In addition, during major events (Grand Prix, Monaco Yacht Show), when waste production was high, the Monegasque Society of Sanitation did not have access to those enclosures.

Now, a site with permanent access and large, buried and semi-submerged containers has been created.

During the installation, every precaution was taken not to pollute the aquatic environment, including the installation of an anti-pollution dam, and regular sampling and systematic water analyzes.

This new Clean Harbour space is also equipped with recycling bins (for plastic and for glass) and special bins for boating waste (for used oil and oil filters). In addition, traps have been planned for larger waste.

The buried containers are completely waterproof. A grate also recovers runoff in an oil separator near the terminal which collects used oil from boats. The new space will reduce pollutants that harm aquatic life.","These coral producing rocks, located at the exit of the Fontvieille port, are rich in biodiversity and must be preserved.

By the 2030 deadline, “a significant number of people” in 80 countries are unlikely to have access to clean water, while poor sanitation is expected to persist in more than 100 nations, WaterAid said.

Drawing on U.N. data, the UK-based group calculated some countries will need hundreds of years to provide safe drinking water and toilets for all their people, meaning countries collectively are thousands of years off track.

At current rates, Namibians would have to wait until 2246 for everyone to have clean water, while all Eritreans would not get it until 2507 and Nicaraguans not until 2180, WaterAid said.

It could be 500 years before every Romanian has access to a toilet, and 450 years for Ghanaians, it added.

Governments should fund water and sanitation provision from their own budgets, and work with utilities and private companies to reach people in isolated areas, said Carvalho.

“There’s money around - it’s just not allocated in the right way,” he said, urging international donors to increase spending on water and sanitation.

Other global goals to ensure healthy lives, reduce inequality and end poverty will be jeopardised until access to water and sanitation is prioritised, noted Carvalho.

WaterAid quoted World Bank data showing the knock-on effects of inadequate sanitation - which causes child deaths from poor hygiene and preventable disease - cost $220 billion in 2015.

Some countries, including Rwanda and India, have made substantial headway towards the water and sanitation goal, but sustaining progress remains a challenge, said Carvalho.

""For the nations collectively to be thousands of years off track in meeting these human rights is shocking,"" WaterAid Chief Executive Tim Wainwright said in a statement.

“Water, sanitation and hygiene is a global crisis,” said Savio Carvalho, WaterAid’s global advocacy director.

They attend services in the 24 chapels dispersed in the area.

The parish also holds spiritual formation, meetings and other pastoral activities or gatherings for its parishioners. The parish also offers a small farm next the church, which contributes to the daily sustenance of the Salesian community in Calinan. A water system is set up in Dacudao that provides an adequate safe water supply to about 2,000 residents.

Recently work needed to be completed to improve this water system. With the funding provided by Salesian Missions, the project entailed the installation of water pump and pump house, water tanks and pipe lines. An 8-inch, 100-meter deep water well borehole with a 6-inch casing was dug followed by the installation of a water pump. Constant discharge pumping tests were done and the construction of a pump house was also completed. The construction of the raised water storage stand and the installation of a water tank completed the project.

Residents of Dacudao are happy that they now have an additional source clean water. Many nearby residents are able to conveniently access water from the faucets strategically located in the farm. The new water supply was also effective is helping those affected by the December 2017 typhoon, Tropical Storm Vinta, which damaged a large area in Mindanao including those living in Calinan, Davao.

Flooding in many areas near the Davao River caused residents to be temporarily evacuated. Some of the families evacuated to the church parish where they sought refuge from the storm and flooding. The completion of the water project was very timely as it provided the evacuees clean and potable water for their daily needs. In addition, the new water system supplies the irrigation requirements of the farm. With it, the farm is expected to increase production of fruits and vegetables for the families that live near the farm.

UN-Water estimates that worldwide 2.1 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water services, and by 2050, the world’s population will have grown by an estimated 2 billion people, pushing global water demand up to 30 percent higher than today. UN-Water also indicates that around 1.9 billion people live in potentially severely water-scarce areas. By 2050, this could increase to around 3 billion people.

“Having access to clean water is essential for the health and safety of those we serve around the globe,” says Father Mark Hyde, director of Salesian Missions, the U.S. development arm of the Salesians of Don Bosco. “Improving water and sanitation facilities like this project in the Philippines brings a sense of dignity for the children we serve and ensures that teachers and students are working and learning in an environment that promotes proper hygiene and has safe drinking water. This reduces the number of waterborne illnesses that can affect those in our schools, keeping them away from important study time.”

Throughout the Philippines, Salesian missionaries offer a variety of educational and social development programs for youth, many with an emphasis on recreation and sports activities. The goal is to provide the opportunities necessary to gain an education and skills training to break the cycle of poverty and retain long-term employment.","A water system is set up in Dacudao that provides an adequate safe water supply to about 2,000 residents.

By FRANK CARINI/ecoRI News staff

Today’s composting toilets are not the equivalent of a port-a-potty stashed away in the basement. In fact, some models look similar to everyday commodes, but they all save water for drinking and showering. And they don’t stink, require chemicals to clean, or flush or discharge human waste into the natural environment.

The average single-family home in the United States uses about 88,000 gallons of water annually, according to a 2016 study. Some 24 percent of the daily usage, or about 30 gallons, is flushed down the toilet.

Despite federal regulations requiring that toilets use only 1.6 gallons of water per flush, toilets made before 1992 may be using up to 7 gallons a flush. Even with the reduced 1.6-gallon standard, however, a single toilet flushed five times a day will waste nearly 2,340 gallons of potable water annually.

“Unfortunately we don’t price or value water the way we should,” said Conor Lally, an ecological sanitation planner and installer with a background in watershed science and ecological design. “Composting toilets just make more sense because you are not creating that wastewater to begin with. It’s a better way of managing that material.”

The Providence resident and New York native co-founded Nutrient Networks to focus on “root cause solutions to the economic and environmental problems associated with conventional water, wastewater, and food systems.”

Those behind this fairly new endeavor, including co-founder Danilo Morales and composting toilet guru and vermicomposter Ben Goldberg, design, build, and install composting and management systems that divert valuable nutrients from the waste stream, reduce pollution, and help close the food-nutrient cycle.

They believe such efforts play a critical role in the larger movement toward localizing energy, water, and food, building soils, and improving public health.

Treating human waste with septic systems and wastewater treatment plants is costly in both energy and resources, contributes to soil and water pollution, contaminates drinking-water supplies, and leads to combined sewage overflows into important water bodies.

As the human population continues to increase — 7.6 billion and counting — planners and public-health professionals are beginning to recognize the need for environmentally sound human waste treatment and recycling methods. The notion of converting human waste to a usable resource, however, isn’t a new concept.

Wasting a resource

Lally’s first job out of college — he graduated from Boston University with a master’s degree in energy and environmental analysis — was working for John Todd Ecological Design doing constructive wetlands for wastewater treatment in Woods Hole on Cape Cod. His interest soon shifted to dry sanitation and composting toilets. He began working with Goldberg.

Lally said Todd’s ecologically designed wastewater treatment systems still have a place, “but what we started to realize was it was a smarter way of doing a stupid thing, because at the end of the day we were still facilitating people pooping in their drinking water.”

“It was a sexier way of cleaning it up, but at the basis of it still was maybe not the best option, so I became more interested in not creating the problem to begin with,” he continued. “I think that’s what composting toilets and ecological sanitation is all about.”

The work of Nutrient Networks includes educational workshops, graywater management and rain harvesting, urine diversion planning and installation, and composting toilet planning and installation.","And they don’t stink, require chemicals to clean, or flush or discharge human waste into the natural environment.

Three young innovators in Kenya have developed an award winning technology that harvests clean drinking water from the air, targeted at rural communities living in dry regions, and communities in urban areas lacking access to clean water. The innovation dubbed Majik Water is powered by solar energy and utilizes sponge like non toxic desiccant materials to generate water from the air.

According to Anastasia Kaschenko the Chief Technology Officer, Majik Water innovation can generate up to 10 litres of water daily, in regions with relative humidity levels of 55 to 60 percent. In Nairobi, Kenya and California where the innovation has been tested, it has achieved those results. The technology utilizes solar energy to power its components and processes, and requires about 300 to 500 watts of energy to run, supplied by a 400 watt solar panel array.

To harvest the water, air is pulled into the device by a solar powered fan, and the desiccant material absorbs the water droplets from the air. The desiccant material is then exposed to heat generated by solar energy causing it to release the moisture as water vapor. The vapor is then condensed into water and filtered with activated carbon. The clean water is then stored in a tank with a gravity fed tap system where it can be fetched without need for a motor.

The founders aim to station the Majik Water technology near water scarce urban communities or in rural arid areas where locals will buy the clean drinking water from them. For rural areas, a liter of water will be sold at an affordable price of 1 to 2 Kenya shillings (USD 0.0099 to 0.02).

They also aim to bottle the water and sell a liter at 12 to 15 Kenya shillings (USD 0.12 to 0.15) to urban customers. In Nairobi, a liter of bottled water depending on brand, costs from Kenya shillings 40 (USD 0.4) onwards.

“Our target price per liter of water will be competitive with the current water options available,” said Kaschenko.

Worldwide, 3 in 10 people equivalent to 2.1 billion people lack access to safe water at their homes according to the World Health Organization and UNICEF 2017 report. The United Nations also classifies Kenya as a chronically water scarce country with only about 56 percent of the country population having access to safe water. As a result roughly 80 percent of hospital attendance in the country is due to preventable diseases, and about 50 percent of these illnesses are due to water, sanitation, and hygiene.

In 2017, the Majik Water technology won the EDF Pulse Africa Award plus the 15,000 Euros cash prize, and in 2018, was shortlisted among nine finalists that pitched at the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Innovation Showcase.

156,https://www.parkrapidsenterprise.com/news/4471155-give-water-give-life-wellspring-brings-clean-water-africa,"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Park Rapids Enterprise,"Give water, give life: Wellspring brings clean water to Africa","Nine area residents visited Africa in May to see how the $862,465 in donations the Park Rapids Area Wellspring group raised since 2011 is creating health, jobs and hope.

Those journeying to Africa through the brush over rocky roads were Pastor Laurie Kantonen of Hubbard Methodist Church, Pastor Lee Kantonen of Joyful Spirit Church in Wadena and Deer Creek, Steve Steinborn who was accompanied by daughter Trisha Christianson of Fargo, Tony and Dorothy Platz, Mark Larsen and Fred and Lois Madsen.

""Hearing women talk about walking for many miles to get water, and then to see the brown water was heart-wrenching,"" Lois Madsen said. ""We were totally amazed with the progress that has been made to bring clean water and it made us feel our donations to Wellspring are being being put to tremendously good use.""

In Africa, Tony Platz said, women walk more than 12 miles a day to reach a river with putrid water full of bacteria and parasites and walk home carrying two 40-pound cans of water.

According to the World Vision, more than 700 million people do not have access to clean water, and more than 1,600 children under 5 die every day from diarrheal disease due to dirty water.

Wellspring for the World was founded in Fargo. Partnering with World Vision, Wellspring is bringing water to 10 African countries. Matching funds help donations go even further.

The goal is to fund 1,000 wells by the end of 2019 through the campaign ""Give Water, Give Life.""

So far, money has been raised for 668 wells.

A complete well package costs $15,000 and includes education on water sanitation and hygiene, drilling, maintenance and supervision to insure the well continues to provide water for many years.

""We saw a well being drilled that will bring clean water to over 100,000 people,"" Tony Platz said.

Locals do much of well work

Communities must meet five requirements to be eligible for a village well: a bathroom, washroom, garbage hole, table several feet above the ground with pans for washing dishes and a ""tippy tap"" made from two vertical poles with a rod across them and a rope with a bottle of water attached for handwashing.

""World Vision has to change the culture before they drill the well,"" Christianson said. ""These people have never learned hygiene practices. They get the whole community to buy into those and then the well comes in.""

Residents do much of the labor involved in placing the well.

""They dig all of the trenches, they lay all of the pipes,"" Christianson said.

Community members are elected to a water board that oversees the well. Solar power is used for water pumps at some sites, with extra water tanks for storing water to use during the rainy season.

Wells raise standard of living

Hubbard Methodist Church has been involved with Wellspring for about seven years. Their first summer campaign raised $20,000, and with the help of matching funds drilled five wells.

""Over and over, mothers would tell us that when they had clean water they didn't have to take their children to the doctor anymore,"" Platz said.

Water is purchased at kiosks for two or three shillings, with money going to support well maintenance. Money to buy water comes from day labor or selling things at local markets.

""Those who can't pay still get water,"" Larsen said. ""No one is turned away.""

Women and girls age 10 and older are traditionally the ones hauling water. With wells nearby, girls can stay in school and women have time for other occupations. One girl said the best thing about getting water was that her head and neck didn't hurt from carrying a 5-gallon bucket of water on her head every day.

""Because they're saving so much time not having to walk so far for water, they can use that time for other things,"" Christianson said. ""One woman expanded her garden, planted trees to sell the fruit and branches to be woven into fences to use with livestock, and is going into the brick making business. Also because her kids and grandkids are well enough to go to school she doesn't have to stay home and tend to them.""

This has raised the standard of living for families living near wells.

""These people have the same hopes and dreams we all have,"" Larsen said. ""They are just starting from a whole different place than we are in life.""

""It is a domino effect of the good things that can happen from having clean water,"" Platz said.

Schools welcome visitors

The group visited three schools in rural Kenya that had received wells. Schools are in session from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., with some children walking more than a mile each way.

""Children no longer have to haul dirty water to school now,"" Platz said.

One of the schools with a well is a boarding school for children with special needs. ""The administration and tribal chief were talked about the difference having clean water it is making in the students' lives,"" he said.

""The kids and teachers were very excited to see us,"" Christianson said. ""They sang songs and put on a program. At the end of the program they did a chant: 'Water means life. No water, no life.' These were kids who now had water and understand how important it is. They will be the future leaders of Kenya who will help their generation.""

Christianson is a teacher at Oak Grove. Third graders were doing a unit on walking for water and as part of their lesson they walked a mile to the Red River to get water and each carried a gallon jug of water back to school. ""They were exhausted,"" she said. ""That's when I talked to them about what I saw in Kenya.""

Donations welcome

The long-term goal is that by 2030 everyone in Africa will be within 15 minutes of a clean water source.

Wellspring for the World is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization. Donations may be sent to Wellspring at P.O. Box 936, Park Rapids, MN, 56470. For more information about the program, visit www.wellsppringfortheworld.org or follow them on Facebook or Twitter.

Platz encouraged youth and adults to consider going on next year's Wellspring trip. Sponsorship to cover the cost of the trip may be available. For more information, contact Platz (732-8029), Steinborn (701-261-2241) or Larsen (701-215-0565).

A""Wine to Water"" celebration will be held at Bella Cafe in Park Rapids from 5-8 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 20 to thank donors and share information about the Wellspring program. Wine and non-alcoholic fruit drinks will be served. Videos, pictures and flags from the African countries will be shared.

All thanks to Oando PLC and its Joint Venture (JV) Partners, NNPC and NAOC, the over 5,000 residents of Agbere Community, Bayelsa state were overjoyed at no longer being another statistic. They were finally taken off the appallingly high statistic of 69 million Nigerians without access to clean portable water, following the commissioning of a 20,000 gallon water scheme in the community.

According to the Oando representative at the commissioning, “The initiative is grounded in the fact that water is a fundamental human need. Each person requires at least 20 to 50 liters of clean, safe water, daily, for drinking, cooking, and simply keeping themselves clean. Sadly, today in Nigeria there is an alarming dearth of access to clean water, and at Oando, we want to bridge this gap especially in our host communities.”

The laudable water scheme will drastically reduce deadly water-borne diseases in the community such as typhoid fever, cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, hepatitis A to name a few. The scheme will also reduce the amount of time spent looking for water especially in rural areas, as noted by UNICEF - 19 million Nigerians walk long distances to collect unsafe water from lakes, streams and rivers.

One could rightfully say that Oando and its JV partners heeded the words of UNICEF Communications Specialist, Eva Hinds, who said: “Improving water and sanitation services as well as basic hygiene practices in Nigeria, calls for strong commitment from all partners-the Government, civil society, the private sector and communities.”

‎He said: “For Nigeria to achieve the global goal of providing access to safe water for every citizen by 2030, it needs to make water, together with sanitation and hygiene, a national priority. This goal is closely linked with three key results for the country - good health, environmental sustainability and economic prosperity.”

The water scheme, in line with goal six of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, ‘Ensure Access to Water and Sanitation for all”, will also reduce infant mortality rates in the Agbere community as diarrhoea a water borne disease remains the leading cause of death amongst children under ﬁve years of age in Nigeria.

In order to ensure the water scheme is maintained thereby ensuring it has a long life span and is able to support future generations in the community, the water plant came fully kitted with a 30KVA diesel power generating set with an external diesel storage tank and power connections as well as a shelter for the generator and treatment plant, a cased borehole of about 200m depth and a 10HP submersible pump, 3,000m reticulation / distribution water pipes with 30 fetching taps.

Speaking during the commissioning of the project, the Paramount Ruler of the Community, Chief John Maseri thanked the JV Partners for completing and commissioning the project. He noted that water was the most essential necessity of life and therefore, with the commissioning of the water project, NAOC JV has made life more meaningful for the people of the Community. The Paramount Ruler promised that the Community will continue to ensure that a conducive working environment is provided for the company’s operations and Community's development.

At a glance:

Startup: Clensta International

Based in: Delhi

Founder: Puneet Gupta

Founding year: 2016

Problem it solves: Helps soldiers cleanse themselves without water

Sector: Biotech

Funding: $500,000 from undisclosed investors

Constantly being on guard to protect the nation under freezing conditions is only one aspect of an Indian soldier’s reality. Subzero temperatures render seemingly mundane tasks like taking a bath nearly impossible and at times, soldiers go long periods without being able to cleanse themselves.

Skin ailments, then, become a very real risk.

Here, Puneet Gupta saw a business opportunity. His work took him to meet soldiers working in some of the harshest regions of the country and he saw soldiers had no access to water and there weren’t many opportunities to clean up other than when they headed back to the base camp.

Puneet Gupta, Founder, Clensta International

This inspired him to start Clensta International, a biotechnology firm, in 2016. Clensta International is incubated by IIT-Delhi and is situated at the Biotechnology Business Incubation Facility at IIT-Delhi.

The firm’s vision is to provide innovative and easy solutions for day-to-day health and hygiene-related problems by reducing the dependence on water. It has already come out with a resource-friendly hygiene product line, which was delivered to the government in 2017, and is now bidding for military contracts.

Now the solutions are being readied to be sold to consumers, and is prepped for the home and healthcare sectors as well, at various hospitals across the country by the end of 2018. Puneet calls Clensta a ‘waterless technology’ based products company.

The opportunity

“My mission is to ensure that our soldiers also have good hygiene in conditions where they cannot bathe in water. These products can be given to the priority sector too,” Puneet explains. This idea took root when he was visiting soldiers in the regions of Kargil, Siachen and Dras.

Clensta Waterless Body Bath and Clensta Waterless Shampoo remove dirt, dust and oil buildup from the skin and head, and moisturise the skin and hair. The products are an effective clinical solution to provide hygiene without the use of water. The shampoo has to be applied on the hair until it gets wet and has to be gently massaged onto the scalp and wiped off with a clean towel, while the body wash has to be poured onto the hands, applied on the body, massaged gently and then towel dried.

Puneet claims that Clensta’s 100ml bottle of shampoo or body wash saves more than 300 litres of water.

The business

Puneet was born in Delhi and holds an engineering degree. He is an alumnus of Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta. After completing his MBA in 2011, he received an honorary degree from the UK in 2015 and has worked with the DRDO and Honeywell in engineering services in the last decade.

Between 2011 and 2015, Puneet spent time studying business while he also consulted with several companies. Clensta was built through a $500,000 seed round, from friends and family, and with IIT’s support Puneet wants to take the firm’s solutions pan-India and global. The company is in talks with many distribution companies to distribute the product in the retail market.

“We are currently venturing into the B2B market and we are creating awareness about the product. We are in discussions with Indian, US, Dutch and Spanish defence industries for them to induct our products. We are even in discussion with NASA and European Space Agency (ESA) along with numerous hospital chains to use our product,” says Puneet.

Clensta is yet to break even as it has heavily invested in R&D. The company is primarily focusing on the following markets:

Defence forces: For soldiers posted at places where access to fresh water is minimal.

Medical care: For terminally-ill patients or patients who cannot take a bath.

Space agencies for space missions where water conservation is vital.

Travel and adventure: For adventure lovers who may not have access to water in jungles or mountain peaks.

The company has already set up global operations and has a subsidiary in the Netherlands and is exploring business opportunities with Africa, Asia, EU, North America as well as South America.

“The challenges in biotech products are that they have to clear regulatory compliances. Every country has its own norms for induction of biotech and cosmetic products and therefore it is important for us to ensure that the selection of ingredients, at the early stage, should comply with global standards,” says Puneet.

“India has the tech to build global products. These companies should scale up quickly,” says Sudhir Kumar Sinha, former professor at IISc and now co-founder of innovation company LabToMarket.

The UNDP goals for 2030 have 17 goals, of which ending poverty is agenda. Number six of the goals state that governments and citizens must ensure availability and conservation of water and sanitation for all. It is worth it to wait and watch if Clensta, which also has filed for a patent in this technology, will be out there as a leading company that has helped the world achieve that goal.

TIRUVANANTHAPURAM : Management of water bodies, from rivers to ponds and public wells, in the district that was cleaned up as part of different conservation programmes, has turned a headache for people’s representatives and officials. The district administration and legislators are planning strict enforcement of the new legislation that provides for three-year jail and Rs 2 lakh fine for contaminating water bodies. Awareness programmes to make the citizens more responsible towards the environment are also on cards.

Kattakkada MLA IB Satheesh hopes to address the issue through people’s participation and effective implementation of the Kerala Irrigation and Water Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2018.

About 90 ponds and 75 streams or canals were cleaned up as part of the Jalasamridhi project in his constituency. “In the case of ponds, we’ve formed protection groups with local residents as members. They are encouraged to conduct fish farming as it would help to keep them clean,” he said.

“The Kaduvakkuzhi-Anappad-Machel canal which was cleaned up in October is well kept, thanks to the support of the local population. But waste dumping is an issue for several other canals,” he said. After the Jalasamridhi project to raise the groundwater level, Kattakkada has embarked on a sanitation drive. A meeting of the District Collector and people’s representatives on July 10 will devise a proper plan to address the issue of waste dumping in public places, he said. “Several shops in the Kattakkada town drain out wastewater to the nearby canal. In such places with land constraint, an alternate solution has to be found,” he said.

Fish farming is the most viable solution for protecting public ponds, feels Parassala MLA CK Hareendran. The MLA is taking the lead for rearing 60 lakh fingerlings which will be transferred to the renovated ponds.“We’ve an attractive offer for the local residents. They can form a group and conduct the farming. The grown-up fishes would be in the six to eight kg range. The groups can sell them and earn revenue,” he said.

A model conservation project will be launched for the Chittar canal, says Hareendran. The Rs 5.12 crore project will see a pathway along its bank, he said. Hareendran has also started ward-level awareness programmes in association with the Health Department. “People are asked to desist from polluting water bodies and other public places,” he said.","Kattakkada MLA IB Satheesh hopes to address the issue through people’s participation and effective implementation of the Kerala Irrigation and Water Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2018.

PT HM Sampoerna (Sampoerna) was recently named a runner-up for best company in the community category of the Asia Responsible Enterprise Awards (AREA) for its commitment in carrying out its ""Access to Clean Water"" corporate social responsibility (CSR) program.

This program saw the company collaborating with the IDEP Foundation from 2015 to 2016 to help provide thousands of people with access to clean water in the villages of Gobleg and Selat in the Banjar and Sukasada subdistricts of Buleleng regency in Bali.

According to Ervin Laurence Pakpahan, who is the head of stakeholder regional relations and CSR at PT HM Sampoerna (Sampoerna), these kinds of CSR programs are an important part of business.

""Sampoerna always believes that business success is not just measured from a company's business performance, but also from its ability to provide a positive and continued contribution for the wider community,"" Ervin said at the AREA ceremony held in the Philippines on June 1.

Through projects such as ""Access to Clean Water"", which are part of the company's ""Sampoerna for Indonesia"" program, PT HM Sampoerna (Sampoerna) conducts a wide range of social activities to help improve the nation and inspire, motivate and provide a means for the people to do the best for themselves and for the country.

Thanks to this clean water project in Bali, some 13,000 beneficiaries in the areas were able to benefit. Clove farmers were able to access water for irrigation, and the communities received good sanitation facilities.

These improvements are particularly important considering that 50 percent of critical land in Bali is located in Buleleng due to the lack of water, especially during the dry season. At the same time, 30 percent of Buleleng's economy is supported by agriculture, according to the Environment and Forestry Ministry.

""We are always committed to giving the best not only for consumers but also for the wider Indonesian public. That is why we are proud of one of our PT HM Sampoerna (Sampoerna) for Indonesia projects, namely, Access to Clean Water, which has successfully helped people around Buleleng gain access to clean water, a feat that has received international recognition,"" Ervin added.

IDEP Foundation executive director Ade Andreawan noted that this program had been a boon for the Buleleng community.

Citing data from the Buleleng Health Agency, Ade noted that productivity of clove farmers in Gobleg village had increased from 180 tons in 2015 to 195 tons in 2016, while clove farmers in Selat village had increased their productivity from 248 tons in 2015 to 251 tons in 2016 as a result of this program.

Ade added that this program was unique in the way in which local communities in the two villages were involved in the construction phase of irrigation facilities in order to raise their sense of belonging to these facilities. The women provided food while the clove farmers volunteered to carry the materials.

""We wholly embrace the existence of this program. Now is the time for us to be careful and use these facilities wisely. Together with all of the social organizations at our village, we will try to preserve and control the pipe distribution system and the toilet facilities,"" said Putu Sedana, a resident of Gobleg village.

In addition to being in line with Sampoerna's CSR program, Access to Clean Water was also designed to contribute to the President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo administration's 2015-2019 National Mid-Term Development Plan (RPJMN) and Nawa Cita, Jokowi’s nine-point development program.

""We hope that we can continue to do other programs that can give benefits to the wider community,"" Ervin said.","According to Ervin Laurence Pakpahan, who is the head of stakeholder regional relations and CSR at PT HM Sampoerna (Sampoerna), these kinds of CSR programs are an important part of business.

The two rivers have been selected for a clean-up by the Department of Water and Sanitation for the 67 Minutes for Mandela Day campaign tomorrow.

Participants will head out to the two facilities as part of the Clear Rivers Campaign. It follows multiple calls from the public to restore the two rivers to their former glory. The rivers harbour litter, debris and foam due to pollution.

The department declared July a Clear Rivers Campaign month in partnership with various water stakeholders, including the Water Research Commission, CSIR, municipalities, World Wide Fund for Nature, NGOs and other environmental organisations.

Department spokesperson, Themba Khumalo, said the reason behind tomorrow’s campaign was to connect South Africans to the sources of water and the natural infrastructure, which were crucial for a water secure future.

The department also said Jukskei River had become a nightmare for environmentalists and rated among the worst polluted.

Statistics South Africa reported that the health of South Africa’s rivers had worsened over the years.

Khumalo said: “Many factors influence the health of the river ecosystem, geomorphological characteristics, hydrological and hydraulic processes, chemical and physical water quality and the nature of in-stream and riparian habitats. Measuring each of these in detail would be impractical.

“The river health programme therefore focuses on selected ecological indicator groups that are representative of the larger ecosystem, and are feasible to measure. In this way, complex data, collected for each indicator group, can be summarised and expressed in a format that is easy to understand.

“The need for water security, particularly in the face of global climate change and a multitude of anthropogenic impacts affecting our rivers, calls for a national and unified approach to protect our rivers, wetlands and broader catchments.”

According to the United Nations, contaminated water had become an issue in developing countries, where there was little infrastructure to deal with sewage and other water sanitation issues. People in developing countries dumped 95% of their untreated urban sewage into the same lakes and rivers they used for drinking and bathing.","THE MORETELE and Hennops rivers are the most polluted and harmful rivers in the city.

By Meleasie Goviro – EMTV News, Port Moresby

Hanuabada Village was hard at work over the weekend (June 30), ridding their streets and shorelines of waste pollution.

The clean-up exercise was led by World Vision under their ‘Hanuabada Annual Clean-Up Day’ project. World Vision Hanuabada Water and Healthy Life Project have been doing these annual clean up since 2016.

According to World Vision Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Operations Manager Stella Rumbam, community involvement has improved over the years. Mrs Rumbam also noted an increased in participation of organizations.

The Clean-up Days have seen a decrease in amount of litter annually, as people become increasingly aware of the importance of proper waste disposal. But Mrs Rumbam says there is more to be done.

“We also have to establish where all this rubbish is coming from. We cannot say that all the rubbish is coming from the communities here.There are (other) people living in coastal villages along the shoreline, we have ships, a wharf behind us. we have to establish facts about where the rubbish is really coming from” Mrs Rumbam said.

World Vision has partnered with UPNG’s Sustainable Coastlines PNG project to confirm this theory. Selected garbage bags have been taken back to the UPNG lab for analysis and data collection. The joint survey is expected to confirm where the rest of the litter comes from.

The challenge for World Vision now is how to keep that all that rubbish out of the bay when they have confirmed the sources.

Mrs Rumbam remarked that waste pollution aside, Hanuabada Village has the potential to be a tourism attraction. It’s popular houses on stilts over water, already have an alluring effect on locals and international tourist. But people hesitate to visit because of appalling accounts of waste pollution.","The clean-up exercise was led by World Vision under their ‘Hanuabada Annual Clean-Up Day’ project.

And to the ladies who are not so sure of how to clean and keep the place on point, do well to read and make notes because this piece gives you the important guidelines on what to use and how to use it.



The vagina is a self-cleaning organ which has its own natural way of getting rid of any unwanted stuff in there.



When it gets to that time of the month where the egg that was not fertilized is shed, as a woman, it is a necessity that you keep that place clean as much as you can. Most of us go through our periods very secretively and don’t really care to find out if our practices are hygienic or not. Sometimes we may wear the same pad for the entire day. Women in smaller towns and villages still use reusable unhygienic cloth during their cycle. And since periods are seen as unclean in some households, they are not allowed to use detergent to properly wash the soiled cloth.



1.Your sanitation method:







Of late, there are quite a number of ways including the use of sanitary pads, menstrual cups and tampons to stay neat. Choose one brand, whether it’s a tampon or pad, which you feel comfortable with and use for a while to know if it helps your needs. Regularly switching between brands can make you uncomfortable since brands are distinctive as we all are, befit everyone individually. Also, a painkiller on the side is advised for if abdominal pain becomes unbearable.



2. Change regularly:



Period blood – once it leaves the body, gets polluted with the body’s innate organisms. This happens even on days when you experience light flow. Changing your sanitary pad is very necessary because after wearing it for about 6 hours, the pad becomes damp with organisms from your vagina and sweat genitals which can lead to infections such as vaginal infections, pad rash and urinary tract infections. However, there are instances when you have a lesser flow and may not need to change your sanitary napkin.



3. Wash yourself frequently:



During menstruation, the blood usually enters tiny spaces like the skin between the labia and the crust around the opening of the vagina, so excess blood should always be washed away. This tends to beat bad odour from the vagina region which makes it important for you to wash your vagina and labia thoroughly with water before you change your sanitary pad.



4. Avoid using soaps or vaginal hygiene products:



As stated earlier on in this article, the vagina is a self-cleaning but sensitive organ that works in a balance of good and bad bacteria. Washing that sensitive area with scented soap can kill the bacteria and paving way for infections. Always wash the area in a motion from the vagina to the anus. Do not ever wash in the opposite direction because it can cause bacteria from the anus to lodge in the vagina and urethral opening leading to infections. It is advised that the use of soap inside the vagina is not good but can be used on the outer part.



5. Properly discard your used sanitary napkin:



It is of great importance to discard your used pad properly because they are capable of spreading infections. The used pad has a foul smell and that is why you should wrap it well before discarding it to ensure that the smell and infection is contained. But most importantly, do not flush used pad or tampons down the toilet because it can form a blockage and make toilet to back up. And wash your hands well after disposing of your used pad.","And since periods are seen as unclean in some households, they are not allowed to use detergent to properly wash the soiled cloth.

Former Port-of-Spain Mayor Louis Lee Sing.

FORMER Port of Spain mayor Louis Lee Sing says the neglect of drains and insufficient resources by central government to the Port of Spain City Corporation are two primary reasons why flooding persists in the capital. On Sunday, Port of Spain was under flood waters, as much as three feet on some roads, when the rain fell.

Lee Sing, who was mayor between 2010 and 2013 said he expects flooding to be part of the city’s future if the Ministry of Works and Transport does not get its act together and target the clearing of drains and other water courses in and around the nation’s capital.

On Sunday, practically all corners of the country were hit by persistent rainfall, with areas including downtown Port of Spain and Woodbrook among the worst affected. Lee Sing said from his experience, most of the funds allocated to the city corporations go to pay wages and not enough is left to deal with maintenance of drains and disaster response.

“There are drains in the heart of Port of Spain that are no longer drains because they have not been cleaned for a lifetime and the filth in it has now concretised.

“The reality is that Port of Spain, being below sea level, once there is a consistency of 40 minutes of rain, heavy rains as we had on Sunday and with high tides, there is bound to be major flooding,” Lee Sing said.

During his tenure as mayor, Lee Sing said, the corporation proposed to government “certain engineering solutions” to the flooding problem. “We did have a conference where we got in people from the Netherlands. (The) then ambassador of the Netherlands made some experts available to us who spoke at the conference which addressed the issue of how to go about solving flooding in Port of Spain. But none of that, of course, would go anywhere, even though we had the resources back then to do it...financial resources.

“Now, you have a situation where there are less financial resources and one wonders whether in fact the regular maintenance that ought to be done is being done. I drive around the city fairly often and I can’t say that I’ve ever gotten sight of the relevant crews doing that kind of work.

“I don’t know that we are doing the kind of work that is necessary to ensure that we spare our citizenry of the agony of destroyed cars, and impassable pavements and roads. We cannot continue this way.”

He said if showers like Sunday’s continued, “We are going to have some serious problems ultimately, because the rains would have brought more stuff down and the drains would have been further clogged.” He said the Ministry of Works and Transport needs to get involved, as the city does not have the resources.

“I am not making excuses for the city, but I want to say that the government talks a lot about autonomy for local government, but nothing has changed in terms of the powers, nor the authority, nor the ability to spend.” He said the budget for the upkeep of the city was $20-plus million. “You have the whole question of sanitation of the city, but the bottom line is the money given for development of the city is always very minuscule.

“So it is only when you have these kinds of challenges is the focus really on what matters most, and so we’ve got to be start taking local government seriously.”","CLEAN CITY DRAINSFormer Port-of-Spain Mayor Louis Lee Sing.

Mungu Rainbow Sports Academy of Ghana has undertaken a cleanup exercise at some portions of the Dansoman Beach in Accra as part of their preparations towards their participation in the Norway Cup.

The Mungu Rainbow football team is taking part in the Norway Cup tournament scheduled from July 29 to August 6, under the theme: 'Clean and Safe Environment among Footballers'.

The exercise was undertaken in collaboration with the Ministry of Sanitation and Water Resources and Elvis Collection, a private plastic waste collector.

The Mungu Rainbow football team was able to clean and collect waste of over 800 kilograms and these included: plastic bottles, foams, spoilt fishing nets, plastic bags, and pieces of woods, among others at the beach.

Edward Frimpong, the Assistant Captain of the team in an interview with the Ghana News Agency, said the exercise has been helpful and 'they as footballers have changed their behaviour towards the environment and actualised their intention by participating in this activity.'

Mr Samuel Mantey, one of the fishermen around the area, said it was an eyesore to see heaps of plastic waste along the beach and called on the government to put in place appropriate measures to curb the situation.

He commended the Mungu Rainbow football team for their effort in cleaning the beach saying this would give residents some relief.

The Mungu Football Club was formed through a keep fit initiative as an experimental approach by FFP, and after a year, registered with the District Football Association to play in the District League in Ghana.

The Club has created an opportunity for students in Mallan and Gbawe communities in Accra to participate in extra-curricular activities and explore their potentials in sports.","Listen to articleMungu Rainbow Sports Academy of Ghana has undertaken a cleanup exercise at some portions of the Dansoman Beach in Accra as part of their preparations towards their participation in the Norway Cup.

The road to success, however, was not always smooth sailing.

Back in 2013, founder, Kayne Litonjua was still a student in De La Salle University Manila taking up Applied Corporate Management. During his college days, he came up with the idea of starting a cleaning business, “it was just a sideline built from insight of people not having the time to clean their condo units. The first company I started with a close friend of mine was called “The Cleaning Lady” which was a total hit in Taft. We only had two cleaners back then and we were always fully booked. I remember we even did door-to-door and condo-to-condo permits. We only took online bookings and social media to keep the business afloat,” he recalled.

Kayne joined the corporate world after finishing his college degree. Due to the heavy workload and pressure, he and his partner were not able to sustain the business because of the operational demands.

It was in 2016 when his older brother, Kyle approached him about reviving the business, “he asked me if I wanted to revive the business with a more promising business model to lock in better service while maintaining healthy margins. Basically a business with a sustainable operational flow that can run on its own,” he recalled. Later that year, the Litonjua brothers launched Busy Bee Cleaning. “The name comes from the idea that colonies of bees are the most efficient and cooperative while working in harmony,” he added.





All about Convenience

“We wanted to provide an affordable solution to people who do not have the luxury of time to clean their homes, offices, and the like. We specialize in deep cleaning which already includes professional vacuuming of floors, extensive cleaning of areas, sheet and mattress cleaning, bathroom sanitation, air purification, and aromatizing,” Kyle elaborated. Clients can book through their Facebook page or by simply giving them a call. Currently, they cater to clients within Metro Manila, Parañaque, Rizal, Antipolo, and Bulacan.

Rapid Growth

Due to the tremendous response of their clients, Busy Bee Cleaning Co. has garnered a 4.7 rating in their Facebook page, “what sets us apart would be our competitive pricing, end-to-end service, highly advanced machines, and quality service tested and proven by the market. Our cleaners are thoroughly screened as well. Our clients don’t have to worry about leaving their homes,” Kayne pointed out.

They have grown remarkably this year, “we are currently at triple-digit growth versus last year’s low base. We are growing double-digit month-on-month this year increasing our base of loyal consumers. In terms of number of customers, we’ve already served around 600+ happy clients,” Kayne added.

Bright Future

The Litonjua brothers have projected a three-year plan to grow their business at its full potential.

“For now, we just plan to sustain our momentum first while expanding our offerings and solutions in the field of cleaning,” Kyle shared. But because of their success, several people approached them for franchise, “we are parking this idea first until we have perfected the business model. We are focused on expanding our business internally first to prepare for bigger, stronger growth. At this moment, our core focus is to ensure we perfect our service with the thought in mind of offering our clients a “cleaner, healthier home” to live in,” Kayne concluded.

What started out as a sideline back in college, has flourished into something even better. The Litonjua brothers have proven that a simple idea can turn into something big as long as one puts his heart and mind into it.","Back in 2013, founder, Kayne Litonjua was still a student in De La Salle University Manila taking up Applied Corporate Management.

The long stretch of coast had essentially turned into a dumping site until volunteers banded together to clean it up.

A few months later, olive ridley turtles began nesting there for the first time in 20 years.

Now municipal authorities are taking a new step in the battle against the plastic waste that afflicts Mumbai, and many other cities across the country, by criminalising the use of plastic bags – with fines of up to 25,000 rupees (£276) and jail sentences for repeat offenders.

India actually has a low per capita plastic consumption of just 11kg compared to western countries, where up to 10 times that is consumed each year, but its cities and water sources are visibly affected by plastic pollution.

In Mumbai especially, the long coastline is plagued by floating plastic litter. In the monsoons, when the seas rise and splash over onto roads, piles of plastic trash litter the city’s sidewalks and roads.

Authorities have already collected $5,000 in fines from 87 shops since the ban was enforced on Saturday, and chains such as Starbucks and McDonald’s have come under fire for failing to replace plastic packaging.

Mumbai is the largest Indian city to enforce the ban, joining a handful of countries such as Kenya and Rwanda to introduce jail time for using plastic bags.

Brought in by the state government of Maharashtra – home to 110 million people – the ban has huge potential to reduce India’s 26,000 tonnes of daily plastic waste.

“Plastic is like a demon, we all must come together to kill it,” Maharashtra’s environment minister Ramdas Kadam said on Monday.

The push towards reducing plastic is part of a national effort in India to clean up its cities and towns. In June, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called on world leaders to curb environmental degradation and plastic pollution.

“Plastic now threatens to become a menace to humanity. A lot of it never makes it to the recycling bin. Worse, a lot of it is non-biodegradable,” he said.

Bollywood stars have chimed in too, using their social media accounts and appearing in government advertisements to discourage plastic usage.

Critics, however, say the ban will affect small roadside businesses and market vendors, in particular, which rely on plastic bags to package items in markets.

Viren Shah, president of the Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association, told the Mumbai Mirror that 300,000 small businesses in the city had seen around 50 per cent of their sales drop since the ban, and there was confusion about which plastics were allowed and which ones were not.

He said around 2,000 small shops were forced to close over the weekend, and huge quantities of perishables, such as milk, yoghurt and juice, were wasted as retailers feared being slapped with penalties.

Shah said the small business owners are tallying up their losses and may go on strike on Wednesday until the government heeds their concerns.

“We had written letters to the government stating all grocery stores would buy back the recyclable plastic from the customers, but these suggestions were not taken,” he said, according to the Hindustan Times.

Residents and businesses in Mumbai were given a three month period, starting in March, to phase out the usage of plastic bags and find sustainable alternatives instead.

Plastic is the latest target in Modi’s Clean India programme, which also aims to tackle the country’s huge sanitation and public cleanliness problems through vast public awareness campaigns calling on citizens to pull up fellow Indians for littering or defecating in the open.

Some argue the campaign has become overzealous and ill-mannered.

In one recent controversial incident, a Bollywood actress shamed a Mumbai resident for littering. “Why are you throwing plastic on the road?” she was seen asking, in a video posted online by her husband, India’s national cricket captain Virat Kohli.

The man replied in a Facebook post, decrying Anushka Sharma’s behaviour. “The garbage that mistakenly went out of the window of my luxury car... was way less then the garbage that came out from your mouth,” he said.

The man has reportedly served the actress with a legal notice.

The Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) in pursuit of the ""Clean Accra Project"" has so far registered 472 Private Waste Collectors popularly called ""Borla Taxis"" who operate within the Metropolis to identify, coordinate, monitor and control their activities.

The Head of the ""Borla Taxi' registration team, Abraham Afful indicated that the three registration centres, Zoom Pak, Korle Lagoon Ecological Restoration Project (KLERP) near Mortuary Road and the AMA Waste Management Department has so far recorded 350, 120 and 2 registrations respectively, adding that the process had been successful.

The exercise which started on July 4, and expected to end on July 31, 2018 was to aid in further engagement with the operators to enhance their capacity in health, safety, environmental management and business development.

He however, stressed that the registration team had challenges of language deficiency, inability of the operators to provide their passport pictures for the registration and operators collecting refuse beyond the jurisdiction of the AMA, adding that the leadership of the ""Borla Taxi"" and Tricycle Operators Association of Ghana were of great help in translating the message into their various languages and making the operators understand their mode of operation.“This is an initiative of the AMA but it’s in line with the Ministry of Sanitation and Water Resource to identify the Borla Taxi Operators and coordinate their activities so as to regulate the work that they are doing...The registration is the initial step to build their capacity so they can contribute to cleaning the city of Accra,” he added.Mr. Afful urged all Borla Taxi Operators within Accra to register with the AMA as it was illegal to operate without a permit and therefore punishable by law.He also tasked city dwellers to desist from employing the services of Borla Taxi Operators who had no embossment stickers from the AMA.“It is compulsory for everyone operating a tricycle or Borla Taxi within Accra to have the sticker which is free. If you do not register, your tricycle can be seized. I will also like to encourage citizens to take centre stage with respect to cleaning their environment and not look down on the work of the borla collectors and corporate with them. If an operator does not have a sticker, you should not give your borla to them because it means that they are going to dump the rubbish illegally,” he stressed.He further commended the Chief Executive Officer of the AMA for the initiative to recognize and include the ‘Borla Taxi’ operators into the AMA waste management system, adding that it would go a long way to build their capacity.President of the Borla Taxi and Tricycle Operators Association of Ghana, Kwame Frimpong Olando, also commended the AMA for recognizing the role they play in keeping the city clean.He further appealed to the Assembly to designate areas specially for the Borla Taxi Operators so that they would not be harassed by the bigger Waste Management Companies, adding that it would be helpful if the AMA delegated some authority to the leadership of the ""Borla Taxi"" and Tricycle Association to check the activities of its members.gbcghanaonline.com","AMA registers 472 ""Borla Taxi"" operators under ""Clean Accra Project""| Updated Jul 22, 2018 at 7:22amSHARE THIS SHARE THIS 0The Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) in pursuit of the ""Clean Accra Project"" has so far registered 472 Private Waste Collectors popularly called ""Borla Taxis"" who operate within the Metropolis to identify, coordinate, monitor and control their activities.

In many parts of the world, the problem isn't just a shortage of water, it's that the available water is

dirty. Not surprising considering that 80 percent of the sewage in developing countries is discharged untreated. That's where devices like the SunSpring Hybrid come in. The shiny cylinder houses a self-contained water filtration system that can turn more than 20,000 liters of dirty water into drinking water every day. Perhaps more importantly, it can be set up quickly just about anywhere, as long as there is a water source like a river or a well nearby. Built-in solar panels and an optional wind turbine means it doesn't need a power supply, which means it could be used in remote regions without access to electricity or places hit by extreme weather events or natural disasters.



Drinking fog

There are those places where even dirty water is scarce, like the Atacama desert in northern Chile, or parts of the Anti-Atlas Mountains in Morocco. One thing those places do have in common though, is a lot of fog. But you can't drink that. Or can you? Fog collectors make the seemingly impossible, possible. As the misty mass passes through the weave of large vertical nets, tiny droplets of water get caught on the fabric and slowly trickle down the meshing into a collection system. The idea isn't new, but people have been tinkering to make fog collectors more efficient and durable, and to bring the technology to the remote areas that are ideally suited for its use.



Don't flush

But getting your hands on clean water isn't everything. Using it economically is very important, too. One place where we waste a lot of water is the toilet. A single flush on a traditional US toilet can use up to 26 liters of the precious resource. At the same time, one third of the world's population still doesn't have access to a real toilet, a massive burden on the environment and a major health risk. So how can we provide toilets to those who don't have them and avoid flushing so much water down the pan? The Nano Membrane Toilet just might do the trick. The odorless high-tech toilet uses no water or external power and turns excrement into water (though not of drinking quaity) and ash, using the biomatter as an energy source in the process. And as futuristic as this may sound, it's no pipe dream. The design by researchers at Cranfield University won the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation 'Reinvent the Toilet Challenge' and working prototypes are already being tested in the field.



Floating farm

About 97.2 percent of water on the planet is salty, making it unsuitable for the cultivation of food. But Leilah Clarke, a design student from the University of Sussex turned that notion on its head when she created floating farm pods that generate their own fresh water. The idea is quite simple: As the pods float on the ocean, water evaporates below them and rises in the dome. When the vapor hits the glass, it condensates and runs down the sides, watering the plants growing inside. While still a prototype, farms like this, floating off the coast of sun-drenched desert countries could provide food without tapping into limited groundwater.","Producing drinking water, no power neededIn many parts of the world, the problem isn't just a shortage of water, it's that the available water isdirty.

The first-ever global assessment of water and sanitation in schools - carried out by the World Health Organization and UNICEF - shows that 620 million children do not have decent toilets at school and around 900 million cannot wash their hands properly.

Ensuring that children attend school and complete their education is crucial to a country's development but a lack of decent hygiene facilities discourages students, particularly girls, from attending school and completing their education.

The assessment found a third of schools around the world do not have adequate toilet facilities and nearly half - 47 per cent - do not provide soap for children.

Almost 900 million children have to contend with a lack of basic hygiene facilities during their education, putting their health at risk and meaning some have to miss school.

""You can't have a quality learning environment without these basics,"" Dr. Rick Johnston of the World Health Organization, a lead researcher on the project, said.

""Children may not come to school at all if there's no toilets ... Then, when they are at school, they are not going to at their very best if they not able to use a decent toilet or if they are not properly hydrated.""

World leaders have signed up to global pledges to provide safe water and hygiene facilities for all and ensure every child gets a comprehensive education by 2030 under the UN's sustainable development goals.

A lack of safe water and sanitation facilities can cause dehydration, illness, and even death, according to the study.

Access to clean water is a constant struggle for the 500 residents of Po Ploom, an isolated community located on a strip of grassland stretching along the eastern border with the Dominican Republic. (Image credit: Ivonne Santiago)

Getting clean water is a constant problem for the 500 residents of Po Ploom, an isolated community situated on a strip of grassland extending along the eastern border with the Dominican Republic.

Fewer than half of Haitians in rural areas such as Po Ploom have access to clean water and satisfactory sanitation, putting them at risk for waterborne illnesses.

In 2016, a private, anonymous donor concerned about Po Ploom’s clean water problem reached out to New Vision Baptist Church in Tennessee to find a solution. As an expert in water treatment technologies research, Santiago, an educator for 25 years, was approached to design a water filtration system in Haiti.

UTEP students in the civil engineering senior design course created a solar-powered water purification system for Po Ploom that would be simple to maintain and easy to work.

Santiago and a team of volunteers from UTEP, Solar Smart Living and Industrial Water Services (IWS) in El Paso went to Haiti in April 2018 to set up the system.

Like a majority of communities in Haiti’s countryside, Po Ploom does not have electricity. Its only water source is Lake Azuéi, the largest lake in Haiti.

Known in the neighborhood as Étang Saumâtre, or “brackish pond” in English, the western part of Lake Azuéi has brackish water, which is not as salty as seawater but saltier than fresh water. On the eastern side of the lake, residents have access to fresh drinking water, which they also use for washing and bathing. Those who can pay for it buy powder bleach to sanitize the water before consuming it.

In 2016 Santiago traveled to Haiti for the first time to assess the requirements of the community.

A few residents travel two hours to the Dominican Republic or across the lake to buy pouches or gallons of drinking water. But for most of Po Ploom’s families who earn $20 a month selling charcoal, store-bought water is an extravagance they cannot afford.

Six UTEP engineering students adapted a design proposed by IWS and Solar Smart Living—two local partner companies that specialize in solar power and reverse osmosis.

The students developed a unique and innovative system that integrated reverse osmosis desalination and solar energy to eliminate contaminants from the water. They first planned to pump the water from Lake Azuéi, but water samples revealed that the lake’s seawater would be too hard to clean. As an alternative, Santiago contracted a well driller from the Dominican Republic to come to Po Ploom to dig a well measuring 200 feet deep.

Once in the purification system, the water is sanitized by reverse osmosis—a process that eliminates inorganic solids, such as salts from water by forcing the water under pressure through a semi-permeable membrane. The clean water is then pumped into a storage tank where Po Ploom’s residents can stock up their plastic containers and pitchers during the day.

Since there is no electricity at the site, the system is run by 24 industrial-size batteries that are charged by 42 solar panels.

A week after the system began functioning on April 6th, 2018, 10,000 gallons of water had been generated.

Santiago, a licensed Professional Environmental Engineer in Texas, New Mexico and Puerto Rico, has been involved in water quality projects in the United States, Juárez (Mexico), and Puerto Rico.","Fewer than half of Haitians in rural areas such as Po Ploom have access to clean water and satisfactory sanitation, putting them at risk for waterborne illnesses.

Apart from mortality and morbidity, poor access to WASH services also negatively impact on other aspects of the lives of children as they lead to increased absenteeism from schools; high drop-out rate in schools, especially among girls and the non-attainment of high level of developmental potentials.

Besides, they retard the physical, cognitive and psycho-social development of young children, which are important correlates of educational performance. In addition, women and girls confront the indignity and danger of open defecation; and urinating close to the homes, bushes, near water sources such as rivers, ponds, which further degrades the environments.

This is unfortunate because Nigeria is a party to the United Nations Declaration of the Right to Water, which entitles every one living in Nigeria to sufficient, affordable, safe and acceptable water for personal and domestic uses. It is indeed shameful because Nigeria is a party to the eThekwini commitments and ‘Ngor Declaration which affirmed and reaffirmed improved access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) by billions of people in Africa. Among other undertakings, of Ngor Declaration, African agreed on an Action Plan, which articulates the critical actions to be further developed, funded and monitored aimed at reducing by half the proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation.

Similarly, the African Ministers’ Council on Water (AMCOW), the body responsible for sanitation and hygiene in Africa, during the 4th African Conference on Sanitation and Hygiene convened by the government of Senegal; reaffirmed the human right of all to access safe drinking water and sanitation.

The little progress made on WASH in Nigeria is a manifestation that the road from eThekwini in South Africa, to Ngor, in Senegal, has been very rough and bumpy as far as improving access to WASH by billions of people in Africa is concerned. In this regard, ministers and senior officials gathered again for the World Water Day celebration and launch of the UN Water Development Report 2017 at Durban, South Africa. They emerged with an action plan upon which hopes of sustainable use and management of water resources could be assuaged.

Lofty as the action plan may be, executing it requires commitment on the part of governments. So, it is heart-warming that the Federal Government is not oblivious of that fact and has taken proactive steps towards implementing projects that will ensure that Nigeria meets SDG N06, which is focused on access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all. Besides, the official steps mark an end to open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in precarious situations. Hence, the Federal Government revisit of the Ota Regional Water Supply Project 30 years after it was, raises a ray of hope of its completion, after all.

However, it is hoped that revisit of the project will follow through to the completion of the project life cycle, which is billed to last for 12 years – preparatory stage between 2016 and 2018; the expansion stage, between 2019 and 2025 and the consolidation stage between 2026 and 2030.

Now that the current government has woken up to the realities that little progress has been made in the area of human right to safe drinking water and sanitation and intervened, both the current and successive governments should ensure that they deliver on this project.

Meanwhile, the Federal Ministry of Water Resources (FMWR) as the mandate ministry in the sector should coordinate, monitor and evaluate every phase of the project in line with the MoU. In this connection,the Ministry of Environment with sector-related mandates, especially in the areas of environmental sanitation and water pollution should live up to its billings too in area of sanitation. Other ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) with some involvement in the sector including Education, Women’s Affairs, Youth Development, Special Duties, Information and National Planning Commission should work together for Nigeria to meet SDG N06 target in 2030, because the Ota Regional Water Project is just a tip of the iceberg in terms of what is needed to meet the goal.

Also, relevant state and LGA apparatus should enhance the interventions of the federal government for a trickle-down effect of this lofty programme for the people. In the main, the civil society organisations (CSOs), particularly WASH related NGOs and the media supportive role are also critical in the delivery of Ota Regional Water Project. As such, they should work and advocate for the completion of the project life cycle; promotion of accountability and good practices in terms of the project quality and standard.

The Office of the Citizen should also play an active role in ensuring that government delivers on the project by raising issues concerning the project to the plane of discussion, because government revisiting of a project does not equate completion. Only vigilance on the part of the people and CSOs robust monitoring and evaluation report can save this human development project.","While we may not look at the validity of the data, it is obvious that access to potable water and improved sanitation has markedly declined in the country.

Swajal Water helps bring clean drinking water to the slums and rural areas of India.

In certain parts of India, clean drinking water is scarce. However, a unique solar powered water dispensing unit known as Swajal Water, is helping to address the lack of safe drinking water in the nation.

The first “Water ATM” received funding for development back in 2011.

The creator behind the solar powered water dispensing systems is Vibha Tripathi, a scientist with a passion for solar energy and improving the lives of the poor.

She is the founder of Saurya EnerTech, a company that initially specialized in offering workshops, training and seminars on solar energy to organizations, when it first became operational back in 2008. Tripathi has also helped develop Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Kanpur’s expertise in flexible organic solar cells.

Since then, Tripathi has been involved in many projects, including Swajal Water, for which she received a small grant to develop the system from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in 2011. It took two years to complete the project, but eventually the water dispensing machines – known as “water ATMs” – ran on solar power and the quality of water dispensed is monitored remotely through modern technology.

There are now 400 locations in India that have installed this solar powered water system.

Since its water systems have taken off, the company has been rapidly growing its network, even as the design of the system has evolved. Currently, the water ATMs have been installed in 400 locations across the country.

Many of the systems are installed in urban slums, rural areas and public places, such as hospitals, pilgrimage centers, railway stations and schools.

“We have had instances where not just student attendance went up, but also teacher presence increased because they could take water from school to their homes,” says Advait Kumar, co-founder of the company and Tripathi’s son, reported Forbes India.

Kumar added that when they had started their project, it was a novel idea, but not so much anymore.

“It has become popular and there are many copycats now,” Kumar said of the system. “But the ‘water ATM’ term we coined is our trademark.”

Presently, over 76 million Indians do not have access to safe drinking water in the country and, every year, more than 140,000 children succumb to diarrhea due to unsafe water and poor sanitation. The National Sample Survey Organisation estimates that of every 1,000 households in India, only 896 in urban areas and 858 in rural areas have access to sufficient clean drinking water.

Although these solar powered water ATMs are not the solution to India’s access to clean drinking water problem, it has certainly helped.","Share this...Pinterest Linkedin Reddit StumbleUpon TumblrSwajal Water helps bring clean drinking water to the slums and rural areas of India.

The bulk of the power consumed currently is for cooling, he said.

They have moved into newer technologies like using heat pumps, district heating and cooling and completely disrupted their energy footprint,"" he said, referring to China’s new direction in dealing with the problems of cooling.

“There are technologies that are available in the world that helps us to decouple energy intensity and economic growth but what is important here is to put the policy framework in place and look at how to implement them in the larger context of urbanization,"" Purushothaman said. Danfoss is looking at solutions in a similar manner as it is also a firm believer in district cooling and newer refrigerants to help counter the imminent global warming that is likely to be the result of future demands for cooling. This is where the country has great potential not just for economic development but also to make a difference for a cooler planet, Purushothaman added.

The city Department of Sanitation removed 223 street-corner waste containers from the neighborhood and others around the city to supposedly curb littering, the New York Times reports.

But Harlem residents and neighborhood advocates say their street corners are already turning into dumping grounds as people continue to toss trash where the cans used to be.

“It’s a very big problem. It’s not just an eyesore — it’s a health issue that negatively impacts the people who live and work in this community,” said local state Assemblywoman Inez Dickens, who says her office has fielded more than 150 complaints about the disappearing bins.

Now, errant rubbish no longer contained by litter baskets blows around streets and lands in front of homes and businesses — which lands property owners in hot water with the city.

“Every day, they’re getting violations, and yet there are no trash cans,” Dickens said of homeowners and shopkeepers in her district. “We know the city has to raise revenue, but not on the backs of residents and small-business owners.”

The can-don’t attitude is part of a larger push by Sanitation to rein in litterbugs who illegally drop their household trash in public bins, city officials said. This year alone, 1,131 waste receptacles have been plucked up off city streets, the Times reported.

The MTA tried a similar gambit in 2012 but ultimately scrapped the plan after the state comptroller reported that the counterintuitive move had the highly intuitive result of leading to more garbage in subways.

Still, reps from the Sanitation Department say the plan has worked for them.

“It seems counterintuitive, but it has been very effective,” said Commissioner Kathryn Garcia. “We’re just not seeing the same amount of litter and trash on those corners.”

Similar measures in Ridgewood, Queens, were a slam dunk, according to community board member Paul Kerzner, who previously convinced the city to remove 63 of the neighborhood’s 67 bins.

“Every single one of them was abused — they were all overflowing,” he said. Now the street is “immaculate.”

But the city has already reinstated five baskets in Harlem following pushback from residents there.

“We will continue to monitor the new baskets for improper disposal, and they may be again removed should problems reoccur,” officials said in a statement.","Public waste receptacles in Harlem were overflowing, so what did the city do?

178,https://www.bakingbusiness.com/articles/46930-ingredient-advancements-make-clean-label-cakes-feasible,"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Baking Business,Ingredient advancements make clean label cakes feasible,"The delicacy of cake’s structure and the cohesiveness of its ingredients make cakes a difficult bakery product to reformulate. Conventional ingredients have worked well in the past, and mimicking their functionality with clean label ingredients has proved formidable for formulators.

“One of the biggest challenges in cleaning up a cake formulation is providing functionality such as shelf-life stability of traditional cake ingredients with clean label alternatives,” said Chris Thomas, principal technical service technologist, Ingredion. “Traditional dough conditioners and preservatives like mono- and di-glycerides are highly functional in cake systems but are often not recognizable ingredients to consumers.”

Starches, flours and gums can replace these functionalities in a label-friendly way. Ingredion’s Novation functional starches and Homecraft multi-functional flours maintain moistness in cakes in a similar way as modified food starches, but they appear on the label as “corn starch” or “tapioca flour.”

“Novation functional starches and Homecraft multi-functional flours have cleaner flavor profiles compared to many of their chemically modified counterparts,” Mr. Thomas explained. “This allows the flavor components in cakes to come through with more flavor intensity and an overall brighter flavor perception.”

Functionality is important, but taste is still king when it comes to desserts like cake.

Chicory root fiber, recently classified by the Food and Drug Administration as dietary fiber, can provide some functionality in the way of texture while also cleaning up the label. Sensus America’s chicory root fiber ingredients’ properties can improve the texture of cakes. Like sugar, chicory root fiber provides bulk in a bakery formulation and helps formulators fill in gaps that may appear when reformulating for clean label.

Emulsification is another tricky part of clean label reformulation. Cake batter’s structure is built on aeration, and emulsifiers assist in the incorporation of air and the dispersion of shortening throughout the batter system. Replacing emulsifiers is a major hurdle that bakers must clear when cleaning up cakes.

“The biggest challenge in cleaning up cake formulas is replacing the functionality of traditional emulsifiers such as propylene glycol monoester, polyglycerol ester, polysorbate 60 and sodium stearoyl lactylate, which are all very functional in traditional cake manufacturing,” said Peggy Dantuma, director, technical sales, bakery, Kerry Ingredients. “They provide aeration, processing tolerance and improve overall eating quality throughout the shelf life of the cake.”

Emulsifiers work in tandem with many ingredients to create the aeration effect. Shortening and leavening agents in a formulation all work together with emulsifiers for even dispersion and absorption of air to create the texture and bite of a cake crumb. Replacing these traditional emulsifiers is often not a one-to-one process as all these ingredients work together to bring a desirable cake batter to life. Ms. Dantuma said there has been progress with enzyme technology to partially replace emulsifiers as well as many new leavening agents on the market that don’t rely on aluminum. Kerry’s Harvest Sunlec, a sunflower lecithin, is a fat system that can improve texture and eating quality.

Brolite’s clean label softeners and emulsifiers can replace conventional ingredients with minimal negative impact on the cake formulation.

“The only difference most customers notice is in their ingredient declarations,” said Jeff Nelson, western vice-president of sales, Brolite Products.

These previously considered niche ingredients have been seeing more use recently, he continued, which is lowering costs and making these ingredients more readily available.

Corbion takes a systematic approach with its Pristine line of cake mixes and bases.

“Our clean label cake mixes, bases and icing stabilizers allow bakery manufacturers to remove complex ingredients from their labels without impacting quality, taste, texture or consistency,” said Ashley Robertson, market manager, bakery, Corbion.

DuPont takes its wide range of ingredients and collaborates with bakers to develop custom blends under its Grindsted Freedom mixes.

“These blends contain an optimized ratio of ingredients, including locust bean gum, lecithin and enzymes,” said Sarah Mann, senior application technologist, bakery, DuPont Nutrition & Health. “They have been developed to achieve volume, strength and improved crumb structure when removing traditional ingredients.”

Preserving flavor and shelf life

The high-moisture content of cakes gives these desserts the moist eating quality that consumers expect from a good cake. However, all that water activity makes them prone to mold growth, which hinders shelf life stability.

Natural mold inhibitors like ascorbic acid can be used to keep mold at bay. Kerry Ingredients offers Biobake Enzymes to improve shelf life.

DuPont’s PowerSoft and PowerFresh enzymes keep baked foods like cakes fresher longer while maintaining their eating quality. PowerSoft, in particular, helps maintain moist texture and crumb resilience in sweet goods.

In addition to providing other functionalities, Corbion’s Pristine cake mixes and bases can maintain freshness and shelf-life stability.

The latest in clean label ingredients can also assist in enhancing a cake’s desirable flavor. Ingredion’s Novation functional starches and Homecraft flours have clean flavor profiles that don’t compete with the cake’s intentional flavors.

“This allows the flavor components in the cakes to come through with more flavor intensity and an overall brighter flavor perception,” Mr. Thomas said.

To provide cake formulations with flavor, Kerry Ingredients offers some natural flavors and extracts.

“Our dairy taste systems allow the use of real butter for both flavor and texture,” Ms. Dantuma said. The company’s Simply Sprinkles toppings are also pho-free and contain colors derived from natural sources.

Clean label is a trend that appears here to stay, and cakes can benefit from simplified ingredient lists. Consumers who are health-conscious still want to indulge every now and again, and a list of recognizable ingredients can make them feel better about a decadent dessert.","Conventional ingredients have worked well in the past, and mimicking their functionality with clean label ingredients has proved formidable for formulators.

What is the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG)?

It is a registered trust that runs the ‘Namami Gange’ mission — India’s most ambitious endeavour to clean the Ganga river. The NMCG has a ₹20,000-crore, centrally-funded, non-lapsable corpus and consists of nearly 288 projects. Previous attempts to clean the river have been unsuccessful because treatment infrastructure never kept pace with the scale of pollution and riparian Sstates and the Centre had not ensured that pollution was checked at source before being emptied into the river. The NMCG’s thrust is on roping in the private sector to not only set up sewage treatment plants but also maintain them. In return, the government offers to contribute 40% of the capital costs upfront and disburse the rest — with a profit margin — over 15 years subject to performance indicators being met. The mission also has projects to clean the ghats, rid the river of biological contaminants and improve rural sanitation and afforestation.

What is the scale of the pollution involved?

Most of the Ganga’s pollution is due to five States on the river’s main stem — Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar and West Bengal. Approximately 12,000 million litres a day (MLD) of sewage is generated in the Ganga basin, for which there is currently a treatment capacity of just 4,000 MLD.

Industrial pollution from tanneries in Kanpur, distilleries, paper and sugar mills in the Kosi, Ramganga and Kali river catchments is a major contributor.

What is the status of the cleaning exercise?

Last week, the National Green Tribunal (which is hearing petitions around Ganga-cleaning projects) pulled up the government for its tardy job and said that the stretches between Haridwar and Unnao were “unfit for drinking and bathing” and that authorities should display “health warnings”. Union Water Resources Minister Nitin Gadkari has promised that 80% of the river will be cleaned by May 2019. His predecessor, Uma Bharti, had promised a clean river by 2018. So far, the State governments have concentrated on superficially cleaning the river by using trash skimmers and improving crematoria-infrastructure.

The Union Water Resources Ministry has been focussed on ensuring a transparent tendering and bidding process. Only this year have treatment plants at Haridwar and Varanasi begun to be constructed. In May 2014, there were 31 treatment plants with a capacity of 485 MLD. As of May 2018, 94 projects, with a treatment capacity of 1,928 MLD, were under way. A financial audit in March suggested that while ₹20,601 crore had been sanctioned for 193 projects, only ₹4,254 crore had actually been spent on their implementation.","The mission also has projects to clean the ghats, rid the river of biological contaminants and improve rural sanitation and afforestationWhat is the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG)?

MADURAI

Lauding the students of Balamandiram School here for keeping the campus clean, Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao on Thursday said the students should also ensure personal hygiene by keeping school toilets dry and free of odour.

Inaugurating ‘Wash in schools (WinS) and Menstrual hygiene,’ a pan-India campaign initiated by Rotarians in support of ‘Swachh Bharat: Swachh Vidyalaya’, launched by Human Resources Development Ministry, he said many children neglected personal hygiene. Not only parents, the teachers too had a role in educating children, especially girls, on issues related to hygiene.

The children should be asked to wash their hands before having food. Similarly, they should be explained the need to wash their hands before and after using toilets. Being hygienic would enhance their manners, which was the first step for success, Mr. Rao said.

While girl students generally dressed well, the boys did not take much care for their dress, he said and urged boys to present themselves in good dress.

Appreciating the Rotarians for coming forward to educate girls on menstrual hygiene, the Collector sought their support in building toilets and providing water on school campuses.

Rotary Governor R.V.N. Kannan said ‘Wash in schools’ programme was aimed at educating girl students on sanitation-related issues and menstrual hygiene. Faculty members Kavita Fenn Arunkumar, Hemalatha Muruganandam, Alli Rani and Neelavathi Gopalakrishnan engaged students in an interaction. V. Ravindranath, District Advisor, offered felicitation.

From the 1900s, the use of the bucket system to remove human wastes gave way to more hygienic systems that today has evolved.

Along the way, there is a growing recognition that wastewater treatment is the solution to community sanitation by properly treating wastes into safer forms that is then released into the environment.

As Indah Water Konsortium (IWK) celebrates the country’s independence, the company reflects on the evolution of sewage processing and plans to expand its role to be the premier wastewater company.

According to IWK CEO Faizal Othman, as the population grew and villages became towns and then cities, the need for more efficient wastewater management arose.

He said today’s mechanised sewage treatment plants service larger areas and impart a positive impact on the environment.

Modern processes separate the wastes into effluent, which when treated, yields cleaner water that can be used in industries or released to the environment. The second component – the sludge – is further processed for safe disposal or even recycled.

These functions become a form of resource protection that helps rivers become cleaner and provides a positive effect on the water supply.

“It actually has the function of cleaning the river,” said Faizal.

Such large plants cater to larger populations; for example, the Pantai 2 regional sewage treatment plant serves 1.4 million people, while another is the upcoming Langat plant which is built with certain unique features.

IWK is thus poised to ensure public hygiene, sanitation, environment protection, resource protection and now even resource recovery.

IWK aims to be the premier waste water management company by 2020, says Faizal.

Clean-up initiatives

As part of the National Day and Malaysia Day celebrations, IWK will implement several initiatives from Aug 27 to Sept 14.

To celebrate 61 years of independence, IWK will desludge septic tanks at 61 selected areas such as charitable homes and places of worship – institutions that normally find it difficult to engage IWK’s services.

Unconnected systems in the form of septic tanks amount to about 1.2 million tanks, as well as an equal number of the pour-flush system, mostly used in the kampung. These are not connected to IWK’s system and septic tanks should be emptied periodically – at least every two years.

“As of today, out of about 2.5 million septic tanks and pour-flush types, less than 10% are serviced regularly and 90% do not receive adequate treatment services, and this contributes to river pollution,” said Faizal.

To assist, IWK ensures the B40 segment of society receives the same level of service, while providing assistance to this segment when it comes to paying for the services.

Along the way, it is eager to share the importance of treating such wastes via programmes that engage the public.

River revival

Faizal also mentioned the “Friends Of The Rivers” programme which identified 21 strategic rivers located within the vicinity of its 21 unit offices all over the country to receive cleanups.

IWK works together with universities, communities and other major companies with a similar vision and uses its river project to engage in educating these parties.

Through the “Friends Of The Rivers” initiative, IWK aims to also identify the root causes for problems resulting from direct discharges.

These problems could be due to factories, commercial areas, restaurants and houses that are not served with proper treatment services. When they discharge their wastes within an area, these collect and compound into a larger problem further down river.

In IWK’s programmes, customer engagement programmes conduct evaluations to monitor how the public views its services. In that way, the community helps IWK meet its objectives.

There is also an ongoing programme that provides 30% to 50% of the treated water to industries that only require industrial-grade standard water supply, in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Through that, IWK hopes to utilise 30% of the treated effluent by year 2030.

As IWK envisions to be the premier waste water management company by 2020, it builds its objective to go beyond managing sewage, expanding towards managing industrial wastes from factories, markets and food outlets.

Faizal said IWK is also looking into managing wetlands – a concept of waterways that offer the opportunity to instal treatment before the water gets released into the rivers.

Into the future

IWK developed a four-year plan starting with manpower excellence and optimisation via Transformasi IWK 2020 which was initiated last year to create a culture of innovation and continuous improvement.

Competitions among the employees to create innovations that help the company be more efficient and cost-saving in its processes was an outcome of the plan.

This year became one of innovation and technology, the next year is for business diversification, while 2020 will look into assessing the progress.

IWK’s engagement with the community will also be transformational and progressive as it desludges and processes wastes within an area, as well as educate and raise awareness in the community of wastewater treatment benefits.

Following its theme of IWK Sayang Malaysia, IWK will be eliciting pledges from its employees on how they plan to pledge for Malaysia as individuals. It also invites customers to respond with their expectations of the company.","As Indah Water Konsortium (IWK) celebrates the country’s independence, the company reflects on the evolution of sewage processing and plans to expand its role to be the premier wastewater company.

Thousands of cleaners are busy separating plastic from other rubbish as more than two million Muslims wrap up a pilgrimage to Mecca that presents a huge environmental challenge for Saudi Arabia.

The Mamuniya camp in Mina near the holy city is dotted with colour-coded barrels -- black for organic waste and blue for cans and plastics for recycling.

It's all part of an initiative to reduce the environmental footprint of the hajj, one of the world's largest annual gatherings.

More than 42,000 tonnes of waste are produced during the pilgrimage to Islam's holiest sites, according of Mohammed al-Saati, head of sanitation for the Mecca municipality.

""We're facing some real challenges, primarily the sheer volume of waste produced ... along with the number of pilgrims, the limited space around the holy sites, different nationalities and the weather,"" Saati told AFP.

""Islam as a religion does not encourage excess,"" he added.

""Pilgrims can be friends of the environment. It starts by raising awareness back home.""

The hajj, which started on Sunday and ends on Friday, drew nearly 2.4 million Muslims from around the world this year, according to official Saudi figures.

More than 13,000 sanitation workers and supervisors were hired during the pilgrimage season, which saw temperatures rise to 44 degrees Celsius (111 Fahrenheit) this week.

Green hajj

A handful of camps in the town of Mina, the site of the symbolic stoning of the devil ritual during hajj, have begun to implement plans to turn ""green"", cutting back on waste and encouraging pilgrims to do their part.

Banners hanging near the Kaaba, a black structure inside Mecca's Grand Mosque towards which Muslims around the world pray, also featured the recycle logo this year.

Authorities aim to cut waste volumes by two-thirds by 2030, Saati said, with a plan that speaks to both environmental ethics and religious belief.

Sorted waste collected from the pilgrimage sites will be sold to companies that handle recycling.

All proceeds will be given to charity in standing with the Muslim belief in ""sadaqah,"" or voluntary donations.

Workers in bright green vests made their way across the streets and alleys, picking up soda cans and plastic water bottles as pilgrims packed their things to return home.

Signs encouraging pilgrims to sort their waste could be seen across the Mamuniya camp -- along with signs reading ""Sadaqah, not litter.""

""The idea of an environmentally friendly camp is really important to us, to preserve the sanctity of the site,"" said Hatem Mumena, the camp's general manager.

But he admits there is still far to go, as the numbers of pilgrims attending hajj is expected to rise. Saudi Arabia hopes to welcome some 30 million pilgrims per year by 2030.

""This is just the beginning,"" Mumena said.","It's all part of an initiative to reduce the environmental footprint of the hajj, one of the world's largest annual gatherings.

In June, the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs released the Swachh Survek-shan-2018, which had the rankings of 4,203 cities on sanitation and municipal solid waste management (SWM). I have serious problems with the ranking as well as the message that the survey is sending out to cities and citizens on SWM. Let me elaborate.



The survey has awarded cleanliness, but has not recognised sustainable waste management practices. Moreover, it has failed to reward decentralised citizen-driven initiatives. The majority of the top 50 cities may be visibly clean, but do not have appropriate systems for processing and disposal. They collect waste and dump it in poorly managed landfills and dumpsites. Take the case of Chandigarh, which has been ranked as the third best city. It has no effective system to segregate waste at source and the city’s processing plant is caught in a legal turmoil. The New Delhi Municipal Council (ranked 4) and the South Delhi Municipal Council (ranked 32) do not collect or segregate waste, and 80 per cent of waste processing happens through poorly maintained waste-to-energy plants—the Okhla plant has been under intense scrutiny for causing pollution. Similarly, cities such as Tirupati, Aligarh, Varanasi and Ghaziabad—all ranked highly—have no proper processing and disposal mechanisms in place.



It is shocking that the survey has poorly ranked cities that actually have sustainable waste management mechanisms simply because these cities do their waste management in a highly decentralised manner and do not depend on door-to-door collection of waste by the municipalities.



Take Alappuzha (ranked 219) or Thiruvananthapuram (ranked 286) in Kerala for instance. These cities received low rankings because they had adopted household and community-level waste management systems. Most of the waste in these cities is converted into compost or biogas at the household or community-level itself. Inorganic waste like plastic and glass, is sent for recycling. These cities make money from solid waste, rather than spending crores of rupees in collecting and transporting waste to landfills. And these cities are also clean. To say that Varanasi is cleaner than Thiruvananthapuram is difficult to digest.



So what model is Swachh Survekshan propagating? Is it a model that is capital intensive and involves door-to-door collection, segregation, centralised processing and disposal in landfills? Or is it propagating a low-cost model like that of Alappuzha or Ambikapur in Chhattisgarh which is based on segregation, decentralised processing, recycling and reuse of waste. And there are no landfills or protests over landfills in these cities, like the one happening in NOIDA right now.



Unfortunately, the survey results convey the message that visible cleanliness is more important even if cities practice unsustainable waste management practices. The truth is a majority of towns and cities cannot afford the highly capital intensive and centralised landfill-based model. They need sustainable low cost models. A SWM system that makes money is more likely to be sustainable than those that bleed the municipalities. The Swachh Survekshan-2019 must keep this in mind.

(This article was first published in the 16-31 July issue of Down To Earth under the headline 'Sweeping verdict').","The survey has awarded cleanliness, but has not recognised sustainable waste management practices.

Kochi : Floods in Kerala pose a great challenge to the state health authorities as they struggle to check a possible outbreak of epidemics, a problem associated with the deluge, official sources said in Kochi on Thursday.

The impact of floods in the densely populated state can be widespread, they said, adding that this includes deterioration of water quality and risk of epidemics.

People who returned to their flood-ravaged homes said their toilets and other sanitation facilities had been rendered useless and water in wells was contaminated with waste.

""We are anxious, but we are confident that we will be able to tackle this situation,"" health minister K K Shailaja Teacher said.

She said the state health department was taking all measures, utilising all its available resources and working actively to check the outbreak of epidemics.

""We have a strong team. We are (well) equipped (and) we will tackle this situation,"" she added.

Reports from the hilly district of Wayanad said thousands of decaying carcasses of cows, goats and pigs were being dumped in rivers as their scientific disposal became impossible due to inability of their owners to return from the relief camps.

The situation in North Paravoor in Ernakulam district was no different.

People who returned to their houses in villages devastated by the floods said it was impossible for them live there due to the foul smell emanating from the animal carcasses.

Officials said they are equally worried about health risks posed by e-wastes.

Tonnes of electronic items like televisions, computers, mobile phones, refrigerators and air conditioners can be found strewn around in the streets of flood-hit towns of Aluva, Ranni, Chalakkudi and North Paravoor.

Disposal of e-waste is also a big challenge. It could contribute to the possibility of outbreak of an epidemic in the fast urbanising, densely populated state, officials said.

With flood waters receding in most places, the Kerala government has taken up a massive task of cleaning houses and public places filled with slush left behind by the massive deluge that claimed 231 lives, besides causing large-scale destruction.

The government has set up a control room here to coordinate the cleaning process across the state and the civic bodies have been entrusted with the task of managing the work, official sources said.

The unprecedented deluge also brought out the extraordinary heroism, compassion and unity of people of the state.

Amid the devastation, what appears as a silver lining is nothing but the glimpses of human heroism and Kerala's unrelenting spirit of compassion and resilience in the face of a disaster.

Fishermen, who risked their lives venturing into the troubled waters, played a decisive role in rescue operations.

Thousands of fishermen from far-away places reached the flood- stricken areas at Ernakulam, Alappuzha, Thrissur and Pathanamthitta districts as soon as they received distress calls.

Their selfless efforts were recognised and hailed by media and by the state government.

The government had arranged trucks to take fishermen and boats to the flood-hit areas.

""I didn't think about anything else, when I heard about floods in Ranni,"" said Freddy, a fisherman from nearby Vizhinjam, who rushed to the spot which is about 150 km away from his place.

""More than my safety, I was thinking about the urgency of saving lives,"" he said.

Fishermen from all coastal areas in the state took part in the rescue operations and they could reach even to remote areas with their vessels.

A 32-year-old fisherman Jaisal K P from Tanur in Malappuram district became a hero after a video of him bending down in water for women to step on him so that they can get into the rescue boat became viral in social media.

""I think the relief activities are my responsibility to a so a society at a time of crisis,"" Jaisal had said.

Youngsters turned up in thousands at various centres for voluntary rescue and relief works.

""There were more than 45,000 youngsters who immensely contributed to the relief works,"" IT Secretary M Sivasankar said.

All the flood-hit areas witnessed an incredible turn up of youngsters everyday to help ensure food, medicine and other facilities at various relief centres.

Not only money and materials, but land too was donated to the flood-hit.

M P Wilson, a farmer from Kaniyampatta in Wayanad district is among those who were ready to give up their land to reduce the misery of fellow human beings.

He handed over documents related to his land of 19.5 cents to the District Collector, in order to ensure fair distribution to the distressed.

People from all walks of life, irrespective of their political beliefs, joined together to face the difficult situation.

""This unity and compassion will help us overcome the disaster and rebuild the State,"" Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said.

""I want to thank everyone, including children who were keen on donating their savings to the Chief Minister's Distress Relief Fund,"" Vijayan said.

The State Cooperative Department has promised to build 1,500 houses for the flood-hit.

A total of Rs 5 lakh would be spent on each house with an area of 600 sq ft, State Co-operation Minister Kadakampally Surendran has said.

Cooperative Societies in each area will supervise the construction work and the beneficiaries will be selected in consultation with the respective district administration.

Vijayan on Thursday spent time with many of those put up in relief camps, hearing to their problems and assured all help.

The CM took the helicopter to visit the relief camps in Chengannur, Kozhencherry, Alappuzha, North Paravoor and Chalakudy, covering three districts.

""There is no need for any anxiety, government will provide funds to rebuild homes,"" Vijayan told the people in the camps, many of them unable to hold back tears.

The chief minister, who was monitoring the rescue and relief operations from the Secretariat in Thiruvananthapuram, decided to visit the camps to get a first-hand knowledge of the sufferings of the people, many of whom had lost their homes and belongings.

The government has also decided to handover kits containing foodgrains, rice, sugar and dal besides clothes for children and nighties for women to people returning homes from relief camps.

With the rescue operations almost over, a massive clean-up drive of houses and public places filled with mud deposits and debris has begun.

A control room has been set up in Thiruvananthapuram to coordinate the cleaning process across the state, official sources said on Thursday adding civic bodies have been entrusted with the task of managing the work.

Over 50,000 volunteers have taken up the task of cleaning up houses and public places filled with mud deposits and debris dumped by the floods.

Squads with electricians and plumbers will also be visiting homes to provide necessary help to the people, officials said.

A Thiruvananthapuram-based NGO has launched a unique 'toy collection' drive for the children living in relief camps.

RIGHTS, the outfit, is collecting dolls, toy cars, story books, crayons, footballs and cricket bats for children in relief camps to rid their minds of the shock and distress caused by the unprecedented floods.

The objective of the drive is to give a psychological support to the children, whose woes were not getting much attention amidst the plight of the elder people, Director of RIGHTS, Radhalakshmi said.

Besides collecting from public, the outfit approached some crayon and book companies also.

""We have visited several relief camps across the state to distribute essential materials we collected. One of the most worrying scenes there was that of the children,"" she told PTI.

""They have lost their books, pencils, toys...everything. Especially the plight of the kidsbelonging to marginalised families living on the banks of rivers whose houses were completely destroyed in floods. The pain of a child who lost his only toy is unimaginable,"" she said.

If they get some toys, books or crayons at this point of time, it may bring back some colours in their life, the activist added.

The outfit is particular that only fresh toys would be collected for the flood-hit children, but used story books are acceptable.

The NGO has already distributed some toys and books in relief camps in worst-hit Alappuzha district.

The next lot would be ready for distribution next week, its volunteers added.","Vijayan on Thursday spent time with many of those put up in relief camps, hearing to their problems and assured all help.

He said most of the 221 projects under his ministry worth Rs 22,238 crore are at advanced stages of completion.

“Considering the pace at which the works are awarded and getting completed, we are hopeful that by March 2020, river Ganga will be completely clean. It is a difficult task, but we will complete,” the Water Resources and Ganga Rejuvenation Minister said.

The government’s flagship project has progressed well and nearly 70-80 per cent of the work will be completed by March 2019, he added.

Gadkari said apart from cleaning the Ganga river, work is also undertaken to clean the tributaries and nallas that flow into the main river.

“All these projects are done by private players and I have not given any responsibility to any of the corporations. I cannot depend on the government for taking ahead these projects and so we have given the responsibility to the private sector to monitor them real-time using the best IT methods,” Gadkari said.

The minister was speaking at an event here organised by the Indian Merchants’ Chamber (IMC).

The Namami Gange Mission consists of 221 projects 194 of which deal with constructing STPs, rural sanitation and bioremediation largely spanning Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand, which are responsible for most of the pollution, he said.

Gadkari said over Rs 3 lakh crore worth road projects, were stalled before he took charge of the ministry.

“We introduced the hybrid annuity model (HAM) in the road sector giving it a boost. Similarly, we introduced the model in sewage treatment and already two projects are under implementation,” he said.

Works on two projects (50 MLD in Varanasi and 82 MLD in Haridwar) have been started under the HAM and other projects that are sanctioned include Naini, Jhusi, Phaphamau, Unnao, Shuklaganj, Mathura, Kanpur, Mirzapur, Gazipur and Farrukhabad in Uttar Pradesh; Digha, Kankarbagh and Bhagalpur in Bihar; Howrah, Bally and Tolly’s Nalla (Kolkata), Kamarhati and Baranagar in West Bengal, he said.

“These sewage management projects will take care of the current gap in sewage treatment and also sustain the sewage treatment for future,” Gadkari added.

He further said that work has started on the National Waterway 1 project from Varanasi to Haldia and there are plans for four multi-modal transit systems, 16 river ports, nine ferry services and eight Ro-Ro services.

“On the lines of air traffic control (ATC), we are starting river traffic control system between Haldia and Patna and we hope to take it up to Varanasi in one month,” Gadkari added.

How BBMP spent SBA money

In 2017,was placed in the 210th place among 434 Indian cities in the clean city rankings. In 2015, it was the seventh cleanest city. The Swachh Bharat Mission was launched on Oct 2nd byto achieve universal sanitation coverage and to stop open defecation in India. The two-pronged strategy under this mission included sanitation coverage in rural and urban areas and solid waste management, with 2019 set as the deadline for a Swachh Bharat - to coincide with’s 150 birth anniversary.While a rousing call has been made to construct toilets under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and create an open defecation-free India, thethinks there are other matters of grave importance like constructing a compound wall for a crematorium and building a wall for a graveyard, with the Swachh Bharat funds.While the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (SBA) funds were to be used for construction of toilets, sanitation and solid waste management, documents available with the Bangalore Mirror indicate that more than 100 crore has been diverted to other uses.There are more instances where SBA funds have been diverted for non-SBA projects between April 1, 2016 and March 31, 2018.This despite Sec 8.6 of Swachh Bharat Mission clearly stating, “ Under no circumstance shall this fund be utilized for purchase of vehicles, construction and maintenance of buildings, creation of posts and payment of salary, and purchase of furniture and fixtures.”Besides using SBA funds to construct facilities not mentioned in the guidelines of the mission, the BBMP claims to have constructed a toilet near Fishland Hotel in Gandhinagar for a whopping Rs 20 lakh.The news of diversion of SBA funds has evoked strong reactions from citizen activists. Objecting to the misuse of SBA funds, Nethra Narayan, JD (S) leader in the BBMP Council, said, “ There will be no problem if the BBMP authorities use the funds for the development and upgradation of the existing public or community toilets. I am against the misuse of the funds meant for the construction of the public toilets for other purposes.’’Civic activists are not happy with the BBMP diverting the funds, meant for the construction of public toilets and solid waste management, since these are crying needs in Bengaluru. “The claim of spending Rs 20 lakh for a small toilet is shocking. It indicates that the BBMP never improves. Diverting SBA funds for other purposes is illegal,’’ says Nalini Shekhar, a social activist and co-founder of Hasiru Dala, a non-profit organization helping marginalized waste pickers in Bengaluru.Expressing shock over the dreadful condition of public toilets in Bengaluru, Ravikumar S of Full Circle, a NGO working for promoting environment resource conservation and community leadership, said, “We had conducted a survey on public toilets in Padmanabhanagar. I am surprised to see that most of the public toilets are situated near the bus stand. The BBMP authorities have forgotten about the needs of the floating population in that area. The condition of existing toilets is anyway below par. BBMP should make toilet construction a priority.’’Blaming the lackadaisical attitude of the BBMP authorities towards hygiene, Kathyayini Chamaraj, Executive Trustee, CIVIC, Bengaluru says the BBMP authorities have not taken measures to improve the infrastructure for solid waste management or construct public or community toilets at various slums in Bengaluru. “How can the BBMP authorities expect Bengaluru to get the required Swachh Bharat rank and join the list of clean cities in the country if they fail to provide basic infrastructure? I want the BBMP authorities to use SBA funds for the right purposes,’’ says Chamaraj.Coming down heavily on the BBMP authorities for misusing the funds, S Amaresh, Managing Trustee, Right to Information Study Centre, said that he had already written a letter to the Central Bureau of Investigation to probe the misuse of SBA funds. In response, the Prime Minister’s office has confirmed receipt of his letter and asked the Chief Secretary ofto take appropriate action and keep Amaresh informed.When contacted, BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad said that the civic body has not received the required funds from the Central government for the construction of public and community toilets in Bengaluru. “We have received a meagre amount from the Central government.

Express News Service

HYDERABAD: The accidental death of a GHMC worker in Rein Bazar, after she was hit by a police patrol vehicle while on duty, has once again highlighted the lack of safety measures and precarious conditions under which they perform their duties.

Speaking to Express, they said that every minute on the job, they are afraid of being run over by speeding vehicles or attacked by stray dogs. Sanitation worker B Vinoda calls it a “life and death situation”. “Every time we step on to the streets with a broom in hand, we are worried if we will come under the wheels of a speeding vehicle. We need helmets like those worn by construction workers. I am not sure if that will help us, but we will have the confidence of wearing a security gear,” says Maheshwari (name changed) .

While traffic cones are used during road construction or repair works, it’s not used when workers are sweeping. “GHMC is yet to incorporate such mechanism,” says a supervisor on condition of anonymity. “It will create a boundary and help drivers steer clear of workers. It’s high time this is considered,” he said. GHMC officials have responded to the tragedy with a promise to secure more machines to sweep the main roads.

“One of our staff has died and it’s an unfortunate incident. It was due to negligent driving. To prevent such accidents in future, we will source more machines to sweep main roads,” said additional commissioner for sanitation, Sruti Ojha.

By Egufe Yafugborhi

PORT HAR-COURT— NATIONAL Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency, NOSDRA, has said that stakeholders are handicapped in the actual cleaning of oil polluted Ogoniland, Rivers State, due to continued oil spill and illegal refining in the area.

Port Harcourt Zonal Director of NOSDRA, Cyrus Nkangwung, who made the disclosure, said that the development had caused delay in implementation of the United Nations Environmental Programme, UNEP, cleanup directive following the growing health dangers on a large scale in the polluted Ogoniland.

He also said that the challenges with proper disposal of large volumes of stolen oil impounded from illegal bunkering syndicates had also aggravated the pollution in the area.

Nkangwung said, “The problem in Ogoni is that we are afraid that if we clean up the place, it will be polluted again. Re-pollution will become a problem and we will be wasting money.

“Right now, if you go to Bodo, you will discover that the place that had been cleaned has been re-polluted by a seized vessel by the army. The vessel sank and released oil into the water environment. That is a fear we are having and it appears as if everybody is handicapped by it.”

On efforts at checking some of these challenges, Nkangwung said a Harmonised Standard Operating Procedure, HSOP, was being put in place to guide stakeholders on proper handling and disposal of seized oil products without aggravating the pollution in the land.

“Now we are working in synergy with Navy and the Army, NNPC and other stakeholders. A HSOP about to come onboard, where if the military seizes a vessel, NOSDRA takes statistics of what is there, then we hand it over to NNPC for recirculation.

193,https://horizon-magazine.eu/article/worms-water-fleas-and-bacteria-could-bring-clean-water-remote-areas.html,"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Horizon magazine,"Worms, water fleas and bacteria could bring clean water to remote areas","An estimated 2.3 billion people around the globe are without basic sanitation, while 844 million do not have access to clean water, despite both being considered as key human rights. Even in Europe an estimated 62 million people lack access to adequate sanitation and 14 million are without a basic drinking water source.

Treating sewage and providing drinkable water often requires large, expensive facilities that consume considerable amounts of energy to keep running. This means people in remote locations or poor areas are often left without such services.

But researchers believe it may be possible to deliver affordable water treatment to these places with the help of tiny animals that gobble up the pollution in water. Scientists working on a project called INNOQUA are developing biofilters which use living creatures to filter water - earthworms and tiny crustaceans called Daphnia.

These creatures devour the sludge and other pollutants, such as ammonium, as part of a series of water cleaning modules that can be set up and left to run with little need for maintenance.

‘Most people will have some idea of the role that earthworms play in the soil,’ said Dr Eoghan Clifford, a civil engineer at the National University of Ireland, in Galway, and technical director of the INNOQUA project. ‘They are doing something similar in the wastewater technologies we are using.’

In soil, earthworms will munch their way through plant debris and manure to help break it apart, while also extracting chemicals like nitrogen and phosphorous from the material.

The INNOQUA project is instead using earthworms to break up the sludge that will often clog filters at sewage plants. It is attempting to use the creatures as part of a filter that contains woodchips and gravel to trap solid material from raw sewage effluent so the worms can then break it down.

‘We have been quite surprised by how effective this filter has been.’ Dr Eoghan Clifford, National University of Ireland

Excreted

Bacteria living in the woodchips then complete the job by further breaking down the material excreted by the worms.

‘The worms break down the sludge and solid matter, which prevents the system from clogging,’ explained Dr Clifford. ‘This means it requires a lot lower maintenance than other types of systems. This is important for small-scale systems in remote locations.’

The INNOQUA project is aiming to set up 11 demonstration projects in different countries all over the world to test how its animal-based filter system will work in a variety of settings. One of those sites will be in a remote community close to the highland village of Littlemill, in Nairn, Scotland.

Scottish Water, which is one of the partners on the project, currently has to send trucks hundreds of miles to collect sludge from septic tanks in remote communities. In some cases, these tankers have to make long ferry journeys to reach island communities where there is no local wastewater treatment.

It is hoped, however, that the filter system being set up by INNOQUA will be able to clean the wastewater produced by a community of 19 people at the site in Scotland.

Dr Clifford said that early results from a prototype filter using municipal sewage in Galway have shown that the earthworms can remove more than 90% of the ammonium and over 95% of the organic carbon from the wastewater, although they are now testing the limits of how much sewage the system is able to handle while trying to reduce its size.

‘We have been quite surprised by how effective this filter has been,’ he said. ‘But the earthworm technology will in itself not treat wastewater to a reusable standard, so it needs to be partnered with other technologies to further treat the water.’

This is where the Daphnia – also known as water fleas – come in. The INNOQUA vision is for several different water treatment systems to be used together as modules that can be combined to clean water to the standards required in different countries or uses.

Suspended

Daphnia are tiny filter feeders that consume material suspended in water, including potentially harmful bacteria. A prototype of this filter is being tested by the University of Girona, Spain, at a wastewater treatment site outside the village of Quart, just a couple of kilometres outside Girona itself.

‘The Daphnia are in charge of cleaning out particles after most of the carbon and nitrogen has been removed,’ said Dr Narcís Pous Rodríguez from the University of Girona, who is leading the testing of the Daphnia filter. ‘Our system can currently cope with a flow range of 700 to 3,000 litres a day.’

Demonstration sites for the project will include Ireland, Scotland, India and Ecuador, presenting a wide range of different conditions. Daphnia are sensitive to temperature so one solution could be to install the filter underground in countries where they might be affected.

After the Daphnia treatment, wastewater might need further treatment with ultraviolet light, for example, before it can be considered safe for reuse in most countries.

There can also often be other synthetic chemicals in wastewater that can be difficult to remove without expensive industrial processes. Pollutants like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which are now thought to cause cancer in humans, were once widely used in many consumer products as coolants, lubricants and additives, but are long-lasting once they leach out into the environment and have become a major contaminant in water supplies worldwide.

The most common route for destroying PCBs is to either incinerate contaminated soils or to treat polluted water with other chemicals to degrade them.

But researchers working on a project called Cryo-bacteria-reactor are aiming to use living organisms to tackle these pollutants. They have developed a method for immobilising bacteria into porous structures so that they can strip PCBs out of the water as it is filtered through the material.

‘There have been some attempts to use bacteria already but as free cells in the sludge of water treatment systems or using bioreactors with immobilised bacteria,’ said Dr Irina Savina, a chemist at the University of Brighton, UK, who is leading the project. ‘There are difficulties in keeping the bacterial biofilm stable in these existing systems and they can often be relatively inefficient.

‘We have been able to produce a three-dimensional porous material directly from bacteria with a minimal amount of polymer.’

Currently the Cryo-bacteria-reactor team have been testing their technique using bacteria that degrades chemicals that they are using as models for PCBs. The living bacteria are fixed in place inside a sponge-like material that has pores 20-150 micrometres in size. They were able to biodegrade relatively high concentrations of the chemical contaminants over 2.5 to 5 days to leave just trace amounts behind.

These bacterial sponges can be reused at least 10 times, according to the project’s research, while they can also be frozen for storage, before being later re-activated.

‘We can adapt the bioreactor to use local bacteria species that have the ability to tackle different chemicals,’ said Dr Savina. ‘It gives us an environmentally friendly way of removing pollutants from water.’

According to data by the National Commission for Safai Karamcharis, since January 2017, 123 workers have died while engaging in acts of manual scavenging.

One part of the question is whether there is the political willingness to tackle the issue, which has a deep-seated caste element to it. But the other is capability. Can India switch to a less hazardous system to clean its sewers and septic tanks, and if so, are there other cities that can serve as a model?

The practice of manual scavenging involves workers physically entering sewers or septic tanks to clean out excreta. The work has historically been connected to Dalit communities in India, making its prevalence not just a question of capability but also one of social mores. India outlawed the practice in the 1990s, yet manual scavenging continues across the country, and frequently leads to deaths.

The immediate neighbourhood does not offer much in the way of positive examples for India to follow. For instance, manual scavenging is also prevalent in Pakistan. In 2017, a worker in that country fainted while cleaning a septic tank. According to reports, after he was taken to hospital, he died as the doctor refused to touch his “dirty body”. Pakistan is also grappling with a sanitation crisis. According to a report published in Dawn in March, Karachi produces more than 1,703 million litres of sewage every day. In April, the Pakistan Supreme Court ordered all sewers to be cleaned before the monsoon. A month earlier, the court-appointed judicial commissioner on water and sanitation dismissed workers who refused to clean sewers.

Bangladesh too is struggling with sewage and waste disposal. It still depends on manual labour to clean septic tanks and sewers. According to the Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority, only 20% of the city is served by a piped sewer network and the city relies on individuals and private contractors to manually remove septic tank sludge.

Countries a little further afield have moved to other models to manage their sewage.

Some countries have taken steps to adopt either sustainable methods of sewage disposal or use machinery to treat effluent. “Mexico adopted the ecological sanitation model, which closes the loop on sewage treatment,” said Martin Macwan, founder of the Navsarjan Trust in Gujarat. Ecological sanitation is a waste management model that treats human excreta, wash water and urine as agricultural resources that can be safely collected, stored and treated. “In America on the other hand, they use machinery but there are proper tunnels and equipment in place. Our problem is that because of caste, the government does not want to invest in any machinery. They know that there is cheap manual labour available.”

The western approach

An analysis by India Spend, based on data that the government had released in December 2015, found that 70% of India’s sewage remains untreated. When the Central Pollution Control Board carried out an inventory of sewage treatment plants in the country in 2015, it was found that there were 816 sewage treatment plants, out of which only 522 are functional. The remainder were either not functioning or under construction.

Arkaja Singh, Fellow at Centre for Policy Research, said that the country’s poor infrastructure and low engineering standards of sewers and septic tanks made them hazardous workspaces “There is an interplay of caste, poor public engineering standards, workers’ availability and poorly specified infrastructure,” she said. “Our sewage plants deal with plastic and debris together, which is wrong. This creates a lethal cocktail of gases and leads to clogging. This is not something machines can deal with either.”

She added that India borrows from countries in Europe and America when it comes to planning public infrastructure, but not in a holistic manner. For instance, Singh pointed out that there are supposed to be a number of safeguards in place in sewage treatment plants. These include the placement of certain lamps within the plant, which determine the presence of harmful gases. Such safeguards are rarely, if ever, seen in India. “They [western countries] have industrial safety standards in place which clearly specify and distinguish between safe and unsafe work,” she said.

Singh pointed out that a number of Asian countries, including Japan, Singapore and Malaysia, have successfully tackled the problem of sewage management.

Malaysia’s transformation

In Malaysia, for instance, sewerage management has evolved in a phased manner from primitive systems to more mechanical and automated systems since the country’s independence in 1957, a study by the Centre for Policy Research in 2017 noted. The study said that this was “mainly due to the development of technologies in the sewerage industry. The evolution has also involved the movement from non-mechanical systems to more mechanical and automated systems. New and improved equipment has also been continuously introduced due to technological advancements. Over time, this has increased the expectations regarding environmental standards and the skill level in the design, construction.”

Ambarish Karunanithi, the researcher who conducted the study, said that the transformation required political will. “In the 1950s there were instances of Chinese migrants who were made to do manual scavenging,” said Karunanithi. “It was not an overnight decision. Malaysia started to make this shift to mechanisation not because there was activism in place to eradicate manual scavenging like in India, but because they wanted to promote the country as a tourist destination. There was a big push from the government for this.”

The study also pointed out the approach taken by the Malaysian government, which highly subsidised the construction and maintenance of sewage plants. They also carried out surveys and outreach programmes to educate citizens about how often they should get their septic tanks cleaned. “They gave people enough time to adjust to the tightened standards,” said Karunanithi. “Now, the workers who clean septic tanks will not even go inside. If they see that the tank can’t be cleaned, they will build another one.”

So, if technical solutions are available, why is there no action by Indian authorities to end manual scavenging?

“The government is comfortable because they know that there are a group of people who are forced to do this job,” said Karunanithi. “If there was no one to do it, then they would have used their brains to start modifying designs of the sewage plants.”

Shomona Khanna, a lawyer at the Supreme Court who has represented the Safai Karmachari Andolan in several cases, said there is complete denial on the part of the state machinery when it comes to manual scavenging. “Whether it is the state, Centre or even the Indian Railways, the common argument they give is that whatever is happening is not under the purview of manual scavenging,” she said. “In cases that I have worked on, the argument from the state is that since workers do not carry excreta on their head, it is not manual scavenging. The Indian Railways has argued that since they have flush latrines installed, workers cleaning the waste from the tracks is not manual scavenging. Why is it that the Indian state has not been able to find a solution? Why are a particular set of lives so expendable?”","Can India switch to a less hazardous system to clean its sewers and septic tanks, and if so, are there other cities that can serve as a model?

As the saying goes CLEANLINESS IS NEXT TO GODLINESS, Denmark’s Music group TOTAL HIP REPLACEMENT Band is currently in Ghana in collaboration with S24 recording Studio to embark on a project that will boost the campaign for clean water and good sanitation in Ghana especially the rural areas.

As one of the major crisis that leaves the whole country a nightmare is sanitations, Music Producer Joseph Appiah also known as Kwik action established to komfaonline.com that they have already recorded a song with the titled NSU PA which was composed, Arranged and Recorded by him and features the Denmark music group.

Mr. Appiah continued to assert that as education is universal, they intend to look at another project titled CLEAN WATER workshop in the rural areas.

“Education is a universal right! So therefore educating the masses through music in the area of sanitation will help the campaign properly, another area we are looking at is to organize CLEAN WATER workshop especially rural areas. “He said.

As a music producer for past 15 years, Mr Appiah believes that passing their Sanitation campaign messages through music will the boost the agenda therefore making it easier to capture the attention of the masses.

“I believe I can use my music to promote Clean Water/Sanitation message across the world

We believe music can be used as an instrument for addressing many of the developmental challenges confronting our society today.

Music can be used as a tool to raise awareness of the issues that our people face daily. Issues related to illiteracy, environment, sanitation and many more, The creative arts ministry must encourage initiatives like this to sell Ghana positively as an investment and Tourism destination and to communicate the beauty of Ghana and her cultures.” He added

According to Mr. Appiah Musician Union Of Ghana(MUSIGA) has already endorsed the agenda and they are looking forward to earn the endorsement of other international bodies.

“This collaboration has been formerly endorsed by the Musician Union Of Ghana(MUSIGA) and we looking forward to partner with DANIDA,USAID,UNISEF and the EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTEL AGENCY to strengthen the bond between Ghana and Denmark in the area of Clean Water/Sanitation” He continued.

Water is essential for survival, but imagine if the only water you or your child had access to came from a dirty pond miles from home. This is the reality for more than 660 million people around the world who lack access to a safe water source.

A Birmingham, Alabama based non-profit has been a major player in working to end the water crisis around the world. Neverthirst was started in 2008. Co-founder and executive director, Mark Whitehead experienced a pivotal moment while listening to a sermon by Dr. David Platt at the Church of Brook Hills. Platt challenged congregants with a simple question: “Have you disconnected the blessings God has entrusted to you from the purposes God intends those blessings to be used for?” Whitehead considered the blessings we enjoy here in the United States and felt the call to share the gospel “to the ends of the earth” by first meeting the physical needs of impoverished people.



This year, Neverthirst is celebrating its ten year anniversary. In ten years the organization has served more than half a million people through more than 10,000 water projects. In places like India, Cambodia, Chad, Uganda, Nepal, and Myanmar, Neverthirst is working with local partners to provide access to clean water through bio-sand filters and wells with hand pumps. The gospel is shared with each water project through the pastors in the communities where Neverthirst is working.

The results have been staggering. When Neverthirst first started in 2008, 1.2 billion people lacked access to a safe water source. Now the number is 660 million. “It’s truly amazing to reflect on ten years as a ministry and all that God has done around the world,” Whitehead says. “We would have never dreamed that ten years into the ministry we would be able to help over 500,000 people gain access to a safe water source and ultimately get the opportunity to hear about the love of God.”

But still much work must be done. According to World Health Organization, every day more than 800 children under the age of five die from preventable diseases caused by poor water, and lack of sanitation and hygiene. That’s why Whitehead feels an urgency while looking ahead to the next ten years. “We’re committed to playing our part in ending the water crisis but we can’t do it alone,” he says.

On Thursday, September 13th at 6:30 p.m., Neverthirst will hold a 10 Year Celebration at Noah’s Event Venue in Hoover (2501 International Park Place). It will be an event that has come full circle for Whitehead. The pastor who inspired the mission, Dr. David Platt, will be the keynote speaker. In addition, dozens of virtual reality simulators will be available for guests to try on and feel like they are half a world away as they experience “virtually” what it’s like to be on a Neverthirst project. All are invited and the event is free; but, it is necessary to R.S.V.P. by visiting NeverthirstWater.org.

What does the future hold for Neverthirst and the people it serves? “It truly takes an army of people getting involved to make an impact,” Whitehead says. “We are so thankful for how God continues to move in the hearts of people that want to make a difference! We’re really excited about the years ahead and being able to continue to help families throughout Africa and Asia gain access to a safe water source.”

Whitehead believes there will be an end to the water crisis in our lifetime. But just as was preached ten years ago in that pivotal sermon, it will take men and women who have experienced God’s blessing to be obedient to His purpose.","Alabama based Neverthirst celebrates 10 years of providing clean water and hopeWater is essential for survival, but imagine if the only water you or your child had access to came from a dirty pond miles from home.

Even when the period of unavoidable confusion leading to compulsive construction to house the human deluge had subsided, the unplanned nature and bad engineering decisions were not discarded, in fact, they seem to have been institutionalised.

One example of this is what we have done to tributaries of Yamuna through the several Delhi Master Plans.

From Badarpur and Tughlakabad in the southwest to the central Delhi Ridge, there were almost a dozen streams big and small that eventually merged into the Barapullah stream before joining the Yamuna near a place where the Nizamuddin station was to come up later.

Beyond the Delhi Ridge all the way to north-west Delhi, there were another half a dozen streams that merged into Sahibi, and a couple of others that joined the Yamuna through the stream that flows through Burari.

On either side of these streams were large tracts of agricultural lands that were gradually built over, through the expansion of the villages located amidst farms, through changing land use – mostly done through the agency of land mafias and later regularised by amending the master plan as has been done recently through permitting commercial activity in residential areas.

The primarily agricultural lands, that sloped gently from either side towards the streams, were built over the next few decades without any civil works like drainage and sewerage systems being laid. The wastewater from tens of thousands and later hundreds of thousands of houses located in these ‘unrecognised, irregular colonies’ flowed into the streams, polluting them, killing them and eventually clogging them.

These streams were not only the natural aquifers of the city, replenishing the water table during monsoons, they were also the carriers of runoff during the monsoons and of regular drainage of clean water from the Aravallis into the Yamuna.

These tributaries of Yamuna have now become the largest pollutants of the river and because we believe in brushing all our dirt under the carpet, we have concretised them. Because they are now concretised and because we have built roads on top of them, we do not know what is going on beneath these swanky roads. What is really going on in the deep recesses of these carriers of filth is something that we will return to in a little while.

We will come back to these drains because we need to connect a few more dots to complete the gory picture. The storm water drains that flank each road and street in Delhi are one of the dots, in fact a filthy streak that runs through the city.

Storm water drains and the city’s filth

The idea of these storm water drains is to drain all the rain water and carry it to the river. All our footpaths are built on top of these drains. There are openings every 20 or 30 metres on the footpath, known as manholes, that are supposed to be covered with metallic lids, and openings that connect to the storm water drains along the platform berm. Many of the manhole covers are missing. This is a clever device invented by our civic authorities to keep the burgeoning population of the metropolis in check. The open holes are used regularly by the citizenry, including the sanitation staff, for disposing off their waste.

Throughout the year, dust, paper, plastic, bits of tyres, packaging material, rags, discarded shoes and sandals, styrofoam, nails, rusted tins and all manner of waste finds its way into the storm water drains. This happens because there is no check on keeping them clean and free of the waste that modern civilisation thrives on. It is because of this neglect that the storm water drains are chocked and so every year a frenzied flurry of activity precedes the arrival of monsoon in Delhi. Everyone – the NDMC, the three MCDs, the PWD, the CPWD, all the MLAs MPs and cabinet ministers from Delhi declare that all drains have been desilted and the city is ready to face the monsoons.

In fact, what is done is that the accumulated filth of the drains is dug out and piled on the roads. It is not removed and taken to the rubbish dump and there are many reasons for this. Those who pile up the dirt and those who have to remove it are two separate departments. So much like our society, there are those who generate the filth and there are those who were born to remove it. Convenient isn’t it?

We do not have enough trucks to remove this filth. Since the rubbish dumpers are unable to remove the trash generated by the city on a daily basis, where is the time and where are the dumpers to remove this additional load, and finally, where is the place on the rubbish dumps for this added filth? So it is allowed to be spread evenly on the entire surface of the roads under the tyres of the millions of vehicles and eventually, no one can see it, till the arrival of monsoons that is. And when the rains come, this sludge flows back into the storm water drains and clogs every road once again.

The fourth factor contributing to the clogging of our roads is the fact that a large number of residential areas, many in the irregular colonies, and many of our urban villages are not connected to the sewer system of the city and so every so often when their septic tanks get clogged, the filth is pumped out and poured either into the storm water drains or into what used to be the tributaries of the Yamuna and are now the single largest pollutants of the river.

All this also eventually blocks the channels, because filth does not flow as easily as water, and when a heavy shower hits the city, all our storm water drains fill up and clog our roads.

The day is not far when we will get the kind of rain that had recently hit Kerala.

Global warming, before it dries up all the rivers and melts all the glaciers, is going to bring in torrential rains. When that happens, the nallahs, that would have all been concretised by then, will not help replenish the water table, all the water will rush into the river and if Haryana opens up the gates of Hathnikund and Tajewala barrages due to a heavy downpour upstream, and the level of the Yamuna rises suddenly as it had in 1978, we are most likely to have a reverse flow in the drains, in our sewer system, that also drains into the Yamuna, and in our storm water drains, not all over the city but in all the low-lying areas, all the residential complexes built in the floodplains of the Yamuna and along the streams.

This is not an alarmist scenario. Unless we de-concretise all our streams, unless we start to recycle all our sewage, unless we learn to keep our storm water drains clean, we are just waiting for a really heavy downpour.

That is it.

We will have our flush systems bringing in all the filth of the city into our homes and the city will drown in its own filth.

Nearly 50,000 people in 16 towns across Sri Lanka received better access to water and sanitation facilities at public institutions they visit, work or study in, as a result of an inspired community initiative executed in 2017-18 by Brandix, the country’s single largest apparel exporter.

The Brandix Model Village programme, which serves communities located within both a five-kilometer and ten-kilometer radius of the Group’s factories, engaged in the construction and donation of 74 water supply or sanitation projects to schools, hospitals, police stations, community centers, and places of religious worship during the year 2017 – 2018. The areas benefitted through these projects included Katunayake, Ekala, Giritale, Rideegama, Seeduwa, Batticaloa, Kahawatte, Koggala, Rambukkana, Ratmalana, Avissawella, Minuwangoda, Mirigama, Welisara, Pannala and Wathupitawala - locations that are home to 22 Brandix factories.

The Brandix Model Village programme is inspired by the temple, school and tank-centered village development concept, and initially identified and addressed water and sanitation related needs of people resident within a five-kilometer radius of Brandix factories. The second phase, embarked upon in 2017-18, extended its reach beyond the five-kilometer radius to ten-kilometers, to help 38 schools, 19 places of worship, seven hospitals, and four police stations, while also ensuring the completion of six standalone community projects.

Commenting on the Brandix Model Village programme, Ms. Anusha Alles, Head of Corporate Social Responsibility of the Brandix Group, said: “Inspiring communities by improving their quality of life with access to clean water and sanitation has been the central theme of our Corporate Social Responsibility agenda since the very beginning. The very visible impact of the first phase of the Brandix Model Village programme inspired a ripple-like extension that we hope will continue to benefit more and more people every year, and lead, ultimately to the elimination of the many issues faced by communities in areas where Brandix has factories.”

Since the inception of the Brandix Model Village programme in 2015, the company has helped alleviate water related problems faced by more than 161,000 people with a total of 234 community water supply and sanitation projects.

The Brandix Model Village programme focuses on assisting public institutions and communal locations by bringing communities together and building a sense of ownership that has lasting beneficial impacts. These projects enable the Group’s factories to play a role in the community, and become important contributors to the wellbeing of the people in their neighbourhoods. As a result, Brandix factories, which are usually among the biggest employers in the beneficiary communities, become an intrinsic part of the social fabric of the villages and towns assisted under the programme.

202,https://www.thehindu.com/society/the-first-robots-clean-indias-sewers-25-years-after-manual-scavenging-was-outlawed/article24841833.ece,"Sat, 01 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Hindu,"The first robots clean India's sewers, 25 years after manual scavenging was outlawed","Sewer Croc, Bandicoot and 14 other machines are in various stages of development and deployment, with no help from the Centre

In February this year, in Thiruvananthapuram, with at least a dozen cameras on him, Sateesh S. Nair tentatively punched a series of red buttons on a large arachnidian machine — India’s first ‘manhole cleaning robot’ called Bandicoot. Nine engineers, all in their early 20s, the creators of the robot, looked on a little nervously: this was going to be the first public demonstration of Bandicoot, still very much a beta version. Nair’s eyes shifted between the screen on the machine and a manhole a few feet away as the robot juddered to life. A spindly pneumatic arm lunged out and clamped open the manhole lid and four aluminium legs plunged into the abyss. A loudspeaker blared music, a scooper ‘hand’ emerged from the bowels with a sizeable heap of sludge and deposited it into a bucket.

Nair, wearing a gleaming yellow helmet, matching gloves, a road safety jacket and new boots, smiled for the cameras. But this time last year, a photo in a Malayalam daily had captured Nair immersed chin-deep in sewage, a stick in hand, cleaning a manhole in Thiruvananthapuram.

It is what Y. Manikandan, 32, still does in Chennai. When he sets out to work in the morning, carrying a plastic bucket, a stick and shovel, his wife Muniammal is never quite sure he’s going to make it back home safe. There have been days when he has come close to losing consciousness from the toxic fumes; others, when he has feared he’ll drown in the turgid water.

And when he does return, it’s tough shaking off the shadow of the day’s work: his limbs are covered in rashes, and he barely eats because the stench of excreta doesn’t go away even after he has bathed “with Dettol”, says Muniammal.

Manikandan, a Dalit, is employed by a contractor to clean sewers and septic tanks in Chennai’s Vyasarpadi area for ₹360 a day. He lowers himself into manholes, sometimes holding on to a co-worker’s hand so he doesn’t go under. He uses a metal rod and his bare hands to dislodge the debris that clogs the lines: sanitary pads, e-waste, tree roots, human hair. And he must haul himself up before the carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulphide from the waste water knock him out.

He describes this daily drill as “abayakaramana velai” (dangerous work). “We risk our lives every day,” he says. Between 2014 and 2016, as many as 1,268 men died while cleaning sewers, according to Safai Karmachari Andolan (SKA), an organisation that works to eradicate manual scavenging.

Rooted in caste

It has been 25 years since manual scavenging — a practice rooted in the caste system and carried out largely by Dalits — was outlawed, and five years since the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 stated that it is the ‘duty of local authorities and other agencies to use modern technology for cleaning of sewers’. But it is only now, and with no help from the central government, that the first technological innovations are emerging.

Vimal Govind, the CEO of the Genrobotics team that created Bandicoot, had just finished designing a ‘power exoskeleton’ — inspired by James Cameron’s Avatar — a 14-ft machine that mimics human movements, when the Kerala government approached him to design a sewer-cleaning robot.

With funds from the Kerala Startup Mission, and several months of intensive research, they came up with a ‘spider robot’ that can stretch its legs and immerse a camera into the manhole so that the operator can guide its automated arm to shovel debris or direct a water jet into sewer lines to unclog them.

There were R&D problems: the team discovered, for instance, that manholes are not consistent in shape or size: “some are square, some are round; some cylindrical, some conical, their diameters vary,” says Govind. Bandicoot today is no longer the odd mangle of tubes and wires it started as. It has been simplified in terms of user interface, it is more compact and made of a lighter carbon fibre. And outside Kerala, the robot has been acquired in Tamil Nadu’s Kumbakonam town and in Anantapur district in Andhra Pradesh.

Tech challenge

If Bandicoot weighs 60 kg, Sewer Croc can be lifted with one hand — but it is fierce. In June this year, a group of 10 senior engineers — aerospace, mechanical, electronic, robotics, mechatronics and software — demonstrated the little robot they had created pooling in their personal resources, at the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWSSB).

Sewer Croc, named after its faintly reptilian look, is less than half a metre long, fitted with powerful blades, and spring-loaded wheels that let it manoeuvre narrow sewage pipes. It comes with a rover camera that rotates 360 degrees to locate debris. The machine, made of corrosion-resistant steel, is powered by a high-velocity water jet.

The Sewer Croc team came together last year following a spate of deaths of manual scavengers, and after a meeting with SKA’s national convenor, Bezwada Wilson. “We first took time to understand the reason for the alarming number of deaths and to see where exactly we can come up with technology that can help save lives,” says Germiya Ongolu, who retired as Deputy General Manager (Design), HAL, and leads the Bengaluru-based Ajanta Technologies.

Sewer Croc was not their first innovation. They also created a device that can be attached to a manhole lid to read the concentration of poisonous gases and sound an alarm if the levels are high.

HMWSSB is in the process of placing orders for 28 Sewer Croc machines, now being fine-tuned to fit pipes of different dimensions. Later this month, the machine will be showcased at a sanitation technology forum organised by SKA in Delhi, along with 14 other innovations developed across the country to replace manual scavenging.

Meanwhile, the urban affairs ministry has posed a ‘technology challenge’ to individuals, companies, institutes and others to identify solutions to clean sewers and septic tanks. The winners are to be rewarded on October 2 at the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention in Delhi. But this, says Bezwada Wilson, is too little, too late. “When we have such a huge problem that’s putting thousands of lives at risk, the government seems to have transferred the responsibility of finding a solution to individuals and organisations.”

The fact that such little investment has been made on innovations for sewage cleaning in a country that has just announced its first manned space mission reveals “the structure of the caste mindset that assumes a certain section of people are born to clean,” he says.

A slew of interventions are needed to end manual scavenging, Wilson continues, including better methods of sanitation in the railways — where one of the largest sections of manual scavengers are employed to clean tracks — and more efficient machines to empty septic tanks. “It is not going to be possible to eliminate manual scavenging unless we create the right technologies,” he says.

Underutilisation of funds has been the biggest drawback that could further delay Modi’s flagship ‘Namami Gange’ programme.

New Delhi: Union minister for water resources Nitin Gadkari may have claimed that the Ganga will be clean by 2020, but a close look at the Modi government’s flagship ‘Namami Gange’ programme tells a different story.

At an event on 30 August, Gadkari had said most projects under the programme were at advanced stages of completion. His remark came on the back of criticism about “slow progress” in implementing the Ganga cleaning projects, one of the major electoral promises of the BJP before the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.

An analysis of the various projects, being implemented by the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), shows that underutilisation of funds has been the biggest drawback that could further delay the Namami Gange programme.

For instance, if the money spent is taken as a measure of progress, the most successful (66.81 per cent) has been a project run by the ministry of drinking water and sanitation, aimed at building toilets in the villages around the Ganga.

The next best performing component would be the construction and revamp of the ghats and crematoria along the river, on which 36 per cent of the allocated money has been spent.

However, no work has begun to date when it comes to projects such as institutional development, even three years after the Namami Gange was approved by the BJP-led NDA government.

Similarly, the sewage infrastructure improvement project has shown little progress with only 3.32 per cent of the sanctioned amount spent so far.

ThePrint takes a look at the progress of the various schemes based on data from NMCG’s July 2018 project status report.

Sewage treatment infrastructure

According to NMCG’s estimates, about 2,900 million litre per day (MLD) of sewage is released into the Ganga every day.

Since May 2015, a total of 66 projects have been sanctioned to construct sewage infrastructure, of which only six have been completed. The money allocated for these projects is Rs 11,176.81 crore, of which Rs 371.47 crore or 3.32 per cent has been spent so far.

The report envisages the creation of a sewage treatment capacity of 1,178.75 MLD. But the capacity created so far is 0.06 MLD. There is a plan to create 2039.75 km of sewage network. Out of this, 53.94 km or 2.64 per cent of the sewage network has been laid so far.

A majority of the projects were sanctioned in 2017. The deadline for most projects ranges from end of this year to early 2020. Until now, there are only five projects in which more than 50 percent work is complete. In fact, 28 projects are still at the stage of tendering.

According to an NMCG official, the delay can be attributed to the fact that in the first two years of the Namami Gange programme — from 2015 to 2017 — an attempt was made to understand why older sewage treatment plants hadn’t functioned optimally.

“For example, now we have decided to switch to a ‘hybrid annuity model’ instead of DBOT (design, build, operate and transfer) model. Under the new model, 60 per cent of the payment to the operator will be spread over 15 years, thus ensuring accountability,” he said.

NMCG, the nodal agency for implementing the Ganga cleaning project, also introduced the concept of ‘one city, one operator’ to improve coordination among various bodies.

According to Shashi Shekhar, former secretary, ministry of water resources, many projects were tendered “very recently” because states didn’t cooperate initially.

“Initially, the new projects based on hybrid annuity model and ‘one town, one operator’ met with a lot of resistance from states,” he said.

“State agencies wanted to implement the new projects themselves. It was after the new governments were elected in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh that the states came onboard,” Shashi Shekhar added.

Both UP and Uttarakhand elected BJP governments to power in March last year.

On average, it takes 24 months to get a sewage treatment plant (STP) to be fully functional after a year-long tendering process gets over.

According to a former NMCG official, another factor that delayed the project was that then water resources minister Uma Bharti was keen on giving the projects to the states for implementation, but senior NMCG officials had opposed the idea.

“This led to a lot of back and forth. The process got delayed by more than a year,” he added.

The official also pointed out that most states are not capable of executing projects, lack the required funds and “suffer from rampant corruption”.

The former NMCG official also said that because of this a lot of time went into ensuring NMCG became a more empowered organisation, “insulated both from the ministry and the minister” and had the authority to sanction large-scale projects.

Institutional development

Under this, a total of nine new projects have been envisaged at a cost of Rs 773.9 crore. No expenditure has been incurred on these projects until now even though Rs 21.12 crore has been released.

According to the report, Rs 639.97 crore will be given to the Central Pollution Control Board for strengthening its laboratories across states and for setting up a CETP (common effluent treatment plant) in Jajmau on the outskirts of Kanpur to deal with the waste generated by the tanneries in the city.

The administrative approval and economic sanction for the same came through only in June this year and no money has been spent on these projects yet.

According to the NMCG official, these projects were sanctioned last year but there was a lack of clarity on how to proceed with them.

“It was unclear whether the money was to be given to the states for setting up labs,” he said.

“In addition, World Bank funding is also there, so it becomes a sensitive issue. We have to follow their technical specifications and procurement guidelines,” the official added.

However, a former CPCB official claimed NMCG assumed that state boards had the capacity to set up the laboratories themselves, which delayed the project.

Of the total sanctioned amount, Rs 554.00 crore will be spent on setting up the CETP in Jajmau. Tanneries have long been considered a major polluter of the Ganga, discharging at least 50 MLD of untreated waste into the river.

According to Shashi Shekhar, for many years, NMCG had been unable to reach an agreement with the state authorities on what to do with the tanneries.

“The suggestion was to dilute the waste. But we wouldn’t be able to measure that,” he said.

“Whenever there is a hard decision to make, states have their vested interests…also some of the tanneries had political patronage and held the whole thing to ransom,” Shashi Shekhar claimed.

“SPCB wasn’t supporting us. We had to go through various complications to make sure that the environment was conducive,” he added.

Another project envisaged is the establishment of Ganga monitoring centres. No funds have been released for this yet. According to the report, an annual plan for this has been developed and the process to set up a technical committee is underway.

Two of the new projects are aimed at using archival images to reconstruct the Ganga of the past and to create a database of high-resolution images of the Ganga basin. The report maintains that this project is underway.

Project implementation support and research projects

Under this, about 22 new projects have been sanctioned at a cost of Rs 353.53 crore, out of which Rs 93.38 crore has been spent so far. This component mainly includes initiatives such as biodiversity conservation, afforestation and research projects.

This also includes a project worth Rs 7.69 crore, primarily aimed at establishing a monitoring centre and rescue and rehabilitation centres for aquatic wildlife. Of this, Rs 3.12 crore has been spent so far. The progress mentioned in this regard, however, only refers to the celebration of the World Environment Day at the Wildlife Institute of India in June this year.

According to the NMCG official quoted above, this might only describe the progress achieved in a particular month. A look at an earlier NMCG report published in May too, however, shows similar results — it mentioned a five-day workshop on biodiversity conservation and the celebration of the World Forestry Day and the World Water Day.

Similarly Rs 17.14 crore has been sanctioned for “planning the restoration of aquatic species” which will include community-based conservation programmes. Of this, Rs 7.11 crore has been spent so far. The progress described in this regard, however, only mentions a two-day training workshop for officials of Narora Atomic Station in UP and staff of the forest department on ‘aquatic species conservation and Ganga rejuvenation’.

Another official at NMCG, however, claimed that there is extensive work being done for the preservation of biodiversity which so far includes a baseline survey of the wildlife, collecting data and “training thousands of people”.

Ghats and crematoria

A total of 37 projects related to the construction of new ghats and crematoria as well as the revamp of existing ones have been conceived under Namami Gange. Of these, three projects have been completed so far while four are still under tendering process. Out of the sanctioned money of Rs 722.18 crore, Rs 261.44 crore has been spent so far.

According to the NMCG official, 151 new ghats are being constructed, of which 36 ghats have been completed. The rest will be ready by the end of this year, the official said.

Cleaning of ghats

This includes three projects aimed at cleaning the 84 ghats in Varanasi, 72 in Haridwar and four in other cities along the Ganga.

A total of Rs 43.87 crore has been sanctioned for this project, out of which Rs 8.02 crore has been spent on cleaning the ghats in Varanasi. For the other ghats, only the administrative approval and expenditure sanction has been granted so far.

Asked why ghat cleaning been taken up in a staggered manner, the NMCG official said that the project in Varanasi was the first of its kind and considering the progress it made, a decision was made to extend it to other cities.

River surface cleaning

This involves the use of trash skimmers to clean the river. The sanctioned cost for this is Rs 55.24 crore, of which only Rs 2.05 crore has been spent.

Composite ecological task force (CETF)

The report mentions the creation of a task force comprising ex-servicemen under the Namami Gange programme. It will be involved in activities such as plantation of trees, patrolling of sensitive areas along the river for biodiversity protection and monitoring the river for pollution.

No expenditure has been incurred out of the sanctioned Rs 167 crore on the CETF until now. The report, however, mentions that 141 people have come forward to be part of CETF.

Shashi Shekhar said, it is unclear under what law the taskforce will be empowered to perform its duties.

Bioremediation

According to the report, the Namami Gange programme includes eight projects for bioremediation — the process of using naturally occurring microbes for accelerating the breakdown of pollutants.

A total of Rs 26.94 crore has been sanctioned for this but no money has been utilised to date despite the fact that all eight projects have received administrative approval.

Bioremediation is being used only on an experimental basis currently, the NMCG official claimed.

Under this scheme, spearheaded by the ministry of drinking water and sanitation, more than 10 lakh latrines have been constructed in 4,465 villages near the Ganga. The sanctioned cost of this is Rs 1,426.26 crore, of which Rs 953.00 crore has been spent so far.

Previous NMCG reports also mentioned a UNDP-run project, aimed at improving rural sanitation in Jharkhand which had been closed. A sum of Rs 127.83 crore was sanctioned for this, of which Rs 5 crore was spent.

The road ahead

In fact, NMCG data accessed by ThePrint shows that Namami Gange got off to a slow start, picking up pace only in 2017-2018.

Only five new projects were approved in 2015-2016 and the expenditure incurred by NMCG was Rs 602.60 crore. The number peaked to 36 projects and expenditure went up to Rs 1,625.11 crore in 2017-2018.

According to a senior NMCG official, things changed substantially after October 2016, when NMCG was empowered to sanction projects up to Rs 1,000 crore. This, according to him, explains why a majority of the projects have been sanctioned in 2017.

“Now, we (NMCG) can sanction projects. The file does not have to move from one place to another,” he added.

Further, it took at least two years to get clarity and plan how to proceed with new projects, he said.

According to a former NMCG official, another reason for the Namami Gange’s now accelerated pace is the speedy decision-making process.

“The decision-making process has become much faster now. His (Gadkari’s) main challenge is dealing with environmental flow of the Ganga,” he added.

For 2018-19, NMCG has approved four new projects and the overall expenditure incurred is Rs 825.35 crore until August. The projected expenditure for this year is Rs 3,100 crore.

However, despite all this, experts have expressed reservations about Ganga being clean by 2020.

“The government is beating around the bush and not hitting on the core issue,” said Mallika Bhanot, member of Ganga Ahvaan, a citizens’ forum.

“The flow of the river has been severely compromised. It is not possible to fulfill the aim of rejuvenation until they address this issue,” she added.

Echoing a similar view, Shashi Shekhar said while NMCG could be able to complete most projects by 2020, it is doubtful whether the river will be really clean by then.

“How much water does the Ganga have? The solution to pollution is dilution (of sewage) or ensuring increased flow of water,” he added.

GUNTUR: Putting the city civic administration on high alert, Guntur district collector Kona Sasidhar has asked the officials to take all measures to prevent the seasonal fevers, including dengue and malaria. He constituted special teams to combat mosquito menace in the city.

District collector reviewed the measures initiated by the GMC with the commissioner Shrikesh B Lathkar and senior officials of health and Mepma here on Monday. He said that special officers should be appointed to 22 divisions, which were already identified as prone to the fevers.

“The fight against the mosquitoes should be taken with a serious note and take public support. No one should suffer with the fevers,” he directed. He asked the senior officials to closely monitor the cleaning of storm water drains and handling of sanitation works properly. He asked the Mempa project director to deploy staff from the agency to carry out the campaign programmes in the city.

He warned that he would not spare anyone who does not handle the work assigned to them seriously. He directed the GMC public health wing to carry out massive campaign drive in slum colonies across the city. He said that the sanitation staff should visit every household and see that the water should not be stored in the drums and tanks for more than 24 hours.

The district collector asked the GMC officials to ensure proper supply of drinking water to avoid people storing water in cans and tanks. He said that people would not keep water stored if they get water supply regularly.

Sasidhar had also asked the officials to visit the apartments to check whether the overhead tanks were getting cleaned by the apartment committees as they would become the breeding centres for mosquitoes. He said that special sanitation drive should be taken in the divisions wherever a fever case is reported.

Later, the district collector held a review with the district officials in the collectorate. He asked the officials in municipal towns and villages to take anti-larval drive in entire district. He said that officials should concentrate on sanitation in both urban and rural areas.

District Panchayath officer Aruna, district medical and health officer Dr Yasmin, mission for elimination of poverty in municipal areas (Mepma) project director Salim Khan, municipal health officer Dr Sobha Rani and city planner Chakrapani were also present.

205,https://www.bakingbusiness.com/articles/47067-the-first-step-in-formulating-clean-label-cakes,"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Baking Business,The first step in formulating clean label cakes,"Clean label has been an opportunity for indulgent cakes in a health-obsessed food environment, but it’s also been a challenge because of issues of lost functionality and product quality.

“Traditionally, consumers had to pick between moist, decadent cakes and applications with simplified ingredients because bakers could not achieve the same functionality when using clean label solutions,” said Ashley Robertson, market manager, bakery, Corbion.

A successful cake batter can be broken down in a few ways. It’s a balance of tougheners and tenderizers. Tougheners like flour, milk solids, egg whites and salt give cakes their structure. Tenderizers — sugar, fat and egg yolks — keep things moist, one of the most desirable characteristics of a finished cake. A cake that consumers will eat cannot have one without the other.

Cake batter also can be understood as a complex oil-in-water emulsification. This helps attain another important aspect of cake batter: aeration. Proper aeration is essential to leavening. It contributes to the crumb moisture and the tenderness of the bite. Air entrapment is a delicate process, one that is affected on a molecular level and has repercussions in the final texture of the cake. Emulsifiers and shortening allow bakers to achieve the aeration they need for the desired crumb, moistness and cake volume.

The delicacy of cake batter means there isn’t much room for error. Change must be handled with care.

“When it comes to simplifying ingredients in sweet baked goods like cakes, even minor formulation changes can affect taste, texture and freshness,” Ms. Robertson said.

Those changes toward simpler labels have not always been easy on the cake industry. Bakers are replacing artificial flavors, colors and preservatives as well as partially hydrogenated oils. Additives like sodium stearoyl lactylate and chlorinated/bleached flour ingredients like DATEM and polysorbates don’t stand a chance with the label-conscious consumer.

These ingredients, however, contribute to batter stability and aeration, volume, texture, moisture and freshness.

“For example, DATEM is typically used to create a strong gluten structure in the batter while polysorbates can be used to enhance shelf life and texture of popular snack cakes,” Ms. Robertson explained.

Collaboration between bakers and ingredient suppliers have resulted in some innovation breakthroughs. Formulators have honed in on what consumers actually want from ingredient lists and finished product, and that has resulted in more functional ingredients.

“Suppliers are offering new alternatives to help shorten the ingredient list and replace undesirable ingredients,” said Sarah Mann, senior application technologist, bakery, DuPont Nutrition & Health. “Although some alternatives may not fully replace the functionality of certain key ingredients, there are more options available now than there were just a few years ago.”

Defining clean label

Understanding what clean label actually means to bakers — and their consumers — has been an important step in successful reformulation of cake batters.

“Getting a clear definition of what is considered clean label can be a challenge when it comes to cakes and sweet goods,” said Jeff Nelson, western vice-president of sales, Brolite Products. “It seems there are many different definitions of clean label and what exactly can or cannot be on a clean label.”

This definition can be unique to each baker, retailer and consumer.

“Research indicates consumers prefer a shorter ingredient list, less chemically sounding ingredients, fewer artificial ingredients and minimally processed foods,” Ms. Mann explained. “So consumers prefer a much more simple and understandable ingredient list.”

According to Ingredion’s proprietary research conducted by MMR Research Associates, the clean label trend can be marked by two themes: simplicity and healthy halo. Simplicity refers to fewer and more familiar ingredients, and healthy halo supports nutrition expectations. According to the study of 309 U.S. consumers, 79% of respondents said it is important that they recognize all ingredients on food and drink packaging. The same percentage considered a short and simple ingredient to be important.

And while there is no official definition of what makes an ingredient list clean, the research suggests three criteria are most critical to cleaning up the label. No artificial ingredients, removal of perceived negative ingredients, and organic were all ranked as the most important by manufacturers regarding their clean label products. Consumers’ top three health claims, according to Ingredion’s research, were natural, no artificial ingredients and no additives.

Regardless of its flexible definition, clean label has staying power as a trend, which has led bakers to reformulate. According to the findings in Ingredion’s study, 69% of manufacturers have reformulated for clean label during the past two years, and 81% expect to do so over the next two years. Seventy-three percent believe clean label is here to stay.

Equipped with this information, product developers can work with suppliers to pinpoint what ingredients they’d like to replace in their cake batter formulations.

Together at the drawing board

After defining what clean label means, the next hurdle will be reformulation. For a category such as cakes, it takes a collaborative effort between baker and ingredient supplier.

“The other major challenge is the ability to remove these particular ingredients and replace them with ingredients that still give the same functionality, quality and shelf life consumers prefer,” Ms. Mann said. “It is important to identify the challenges bakers are facing in our initial conversations. Then we can work with bakers to provide a solution that is specific to their needs.”

Despite progress that’s been made, Peggy Dantuma, director, technical sales, bakery, Kerry Ingredients, said there is still much work to be done. Striking this balance of label demands and finished product quality requires revisiting every ingredient’s role.

“This usually means re-engineering the entire formula as there are not currently drop-in solutions for these traditional ingredients,” she said. “Kerry assists bakers by educating them on the functionality of the various ingredients and then evaluating ways to minimize the negative ingredients while maintaining product quality.”

Understanding how the ingredients function means starting with the specific application. Cake formulations, for the most part, use a similar roster of ingredients: flour, sugar, eggs, shortening, dry milk solids, salt and leaveners. Starches and emulsifiers play important roles, too. But from pound cake to angel food, the specific ingredients and their ratios change to create the finished texture and eating characteristics that mark that application.

“It’s important to consider the type of cake such as angel food, Bundt and sponge, as well as the desired quality and consistency of the product when making the switch to cleaner labels,” Ms. Robertson said.

Corbion works alongside bakers to find a system that meets both the specific application’s needs as well as those of the consumer.

“For example, if a baker is looking to remove ingredients that traditionally help with product softness and moistness, we take steps to ensure the clean label solution we recommend delivers the same functionalities, which in turn helps maintain product taste and quality,” Ms. Robertson explained.

Throughout the reformulating process, Corbion conducts taste tests to make sure the final product will not fall short of consumer expectations of taste, texture or consistency.

“If necessary, we go back to the drawing board and modify solutions to match the characteristics that are most important to each baker’s brand and specific applications or consumer preferences,” she said.

By collaborating with ingredient suppliers and incorporating the latest in clean label ingredients, cake bakers can re-tool their formulations to create a functional quality product with a cleaner label.","“It seems there are many different definitions of clean label and what exactly can or cannot be on a clean label.”This definition can be unique to each baker, retailer and consumer.

The National Human Rights Commission today urged the government to ensure people’s right to live in a clean and healthy environment as guaranteed by the constitution.

At a discussion organised by the NHRC today, NHRC officials expressed concern about the adverse impact on public health caused by environment pollution. The discussion focused on Article 35 (4) of the constitution, which guarantees citizens’ right to safe drinking water and sanitation as a fundamental right, and Article 30 (1) which states: Each citizen shall have the right to live in a clean and healthy environment and enjoy harm caused by pollution.

NHRC Chairperson Anup Raj Sharma, who presided over the discussion, said the three levels of government lacked co-ordination to address the issues. He also said that there was a lack of proper mechanism to measure the impact of pollution on general people.

“Although the constitution has guaranteed people’s right to live in healthy environment, lack of laws and policies have also made it difficult to implement the constitutional provision,” he added.

NHRC Spokesperson Mohana Ansari said that the government was oblivious to environmental degradation and was only concerned about pollution.

“We are worried that the government has become a mere spectator to continuing degradation of water resources and damage done to river basins. These are the factors that have a long-term impact on the environment. The government should take immediate steps to address the issues,” said Ansari.

Bhaktapur Municipality Mayor Sunil Prajapati, Kathmandu Metropolitan City Deputy Mayor Hari Prabha Kadgi, Lalitpur Sub-metropolitan City Deputy Mayor Gita Satyal, Joint Secretary at the Ministry of Forests and Environment Chandra Man Dangol along with other government officials attended the discussion.

Industrial effluents contribute to the rest of the pollution.

Officials see an opportunity in bending the river water pollution curve by cutting the main pollutant under the Centre’s Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) for universal sanitation coverage.

They say this can be done if the technology being used to make villages and towns open defecation-free (ODF) is carefully monitored to ensure no faecal sludge contamination.

Under the SBM, 4,471 villages have been declared ODF along the Ganga basin with almost complete coverage in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh . Only 694 villages came under the ODF category in 2015-16.

“There are 132 gram panchayats in the state along the Ganga. No sludge, grey or black, is discharging into... the Ganga,” said Namami Gange (Uttarakhand) CEO Raghav Langar.

Considering the domestic sewage load in the river is so high, officials are banking on SBM to bring down this load in the coming years even as there has been little improvement in the Ganga waters quality.

“We have not seen any perceptible difference in the faecal coliform (bacteria) levels in the Ganga stretches flowing through Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand in the past four years,’’ said A Sudhakar of the CPCB’s water quality division. “There is a marginal decrease in biochemical oxygen demand (the amount of dissolved oxygen needed to break down organic waste in water) levels,’’ he added.

Sudhakar said they have data of the last four years showing these trends. “But it has not been compiled yet and hence cannot be shared.”

The SBM guidelines say if there is no sewerage facility, an on-site treatment system like twin pits, septic tanks, bio-digesters, or bio-tanks should be constructed for the collection, treatment and disposal of sewage.

Experts say building toilets is a part of the solution. “We have to understand that the excreta are going into a box, a pit or a tank. Along the Ganga, the water table is quite high and if these tanks are not de-sludged properly, then the wastewater can leach into the groundwater,’’ said Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) programme director Bitush Luthra, who is tracking SBM implementation in urban areas.

“Often in many towns, there is no control over the design of these tanks or on how they will be emptied.”

He said they recommend very careful monitoring of septic tanks or pit designs, reuse of sludge for compost and a decentralised approach in treating the sludge.

Tata Institute of Social Sciences assistant professor Pratibha Ganesan’s study also found that septic tanks being used in many urban areas under SBM cause “second-generation problems either due to faulty construction or careless treatment of faecal sludge”.

The study was carried out across eight states to explore the implementation of septic tanks in villages.

It found tanks with no soak pits and non-cemented bottoms have both environmental and health impacts.

SBM director Yugal Joshi said twin-pit toilets being built under the mission are also treatment plants and do not require any faecal sludge treatment. “The excreta turn into nutrient-rich compost after a year.

It is safe to be used on farms. We are creating mass awareness on this through a multimedia campaign and interpersonal communication in villages and soon these issues will be resolved.” He insisted that there is a natural improvement in the Ganga waters quality as all villages on the river banks have been made ODF.","Domestic sewage from towns and villages along the Ganga is the main source of pollution (over 70%) in the river, a Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) assessment has found.

209,https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2018/09/fda-wants-rose-acre-farm-inc-to-clean-up-its-nc-shell-egg-farm/,"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Food Safety News,FDA wants Rose Acre Farm Inc. to clean up its NC shell egg farm,"You would be correct if you assumed a lot of cleanup would be required after a 10-state outbreak of Salmonella braenderup that last spring required a North Carolina shell egg farm to recall more than 206 million eggs. It was the largest recall of shell eggs in the United States since 2010.

The cleanup responsibility falls on Seymour, IN-based Rose Acre Farms Inc., the nation’s second-largest egg producer and owner of the Hyde County, NC, shell egg farm. It is one of 17 egg production centers owned by Rose around the country.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently let Rose Acre Farm again know that the processing area of its shell egg farm in Hyde County, NC, tested positive for S. braenderup, the outbreak strain, in numerous locations and that its laying houses were rife with rodent activity.

FDA disclosures came in a Sept. 6 warning letter to Marcus Rust, Rose’s chief executive officer. The warning letter details FDA’s findings from its inspection of the Rose Hyde County, NC location, which occurred from March 26 through April 11, 2018. Among other infractions, FDA said Rose was in violation of its egg safety rule.

The warning letter, signed by Ingrid A. Zambrana, FDA’s director for the Atlantic District, says epidemiological, traceback, and laboratory evidence all point to the North Carolina shell egg farm owned by Rose as “the likely source of this multi-state S. braenderup outbreak.” During the inspection, FDA collected environmental samples from the poultry houses and processing plant.

“FDA laboratory analyses of the environmental samples collected found the presence of S. braenderup in six (6) environmental swabs in the processing plant in Zones 2 and 3 (Sample #1036614) and two (2) from manure in egg laying house #9 (Sample #1001781),” according to the warning letter.

“Additionally, Salmonella heidelberg (S. heidelberg) was found in eleven (11) environmental swabs in the processing plant in Zones 2 and 3 (Sample #1036614) and one (1) environmental swab from manure in egg laying house #10 (Sample #1005461). S. heidelberg has been shown to be able to contaminate eggs via the transovarian route and has been implicated in multiple egg-associated outbreaks.” the letter adds.

S. braenderup and S. heidelberg are both human pathogens that can cause food to be adulterated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act).

Additionally, environmental positives were found in multiple locations in the processing area, mostly where there was standing water or condensation from the ceiling or walls. Rose’s rodent control measures were also found to be inadequate.

“A review of the pest monitoring forms for the period of September 1, 2017, through March 22, 2018 (29 weeks) revealed the following five houses were consistently operating in a rodent activity range that required corrective actions:

Laying house 9 – for 14 weeks, rodent counts were between 11 and 27

Laying house 10 – for 26 weeks, rodent counts were between 12 and 22

Laying house 11 – for 11 weeks, rodent counts were between 11 and 22

Laying house 12 – for 18 weeks, rodent counts were between 11 and 19

Laying house 13 – for 20 weeks, rodent counts were between 11 and 18

“Also, from March 26 through March 28, 2018, the investigators observed more than forty (40) live rodents in eight out of twelve laying houses, specifically:

Laying house 10 – Approximately four to five (4-5) live rodents in the pit staging table, several in the pit area, and more than ten (10) rodents in the pit staging area, including baby mice

Laying house 13 – Multiple live rodents running around the pit staging area and burrowing in and out of manure piles, and five (5) live rodents in the manure pits

Laying house 9 – Three (3) live rodents in the manure pit, one (1) live rodent running across the upper-level floor, and two (2) dead rodents on the ground.

Laying house 11 – One (1) live rodent in the manure pit, one (1) live rodent on the bird platform, one (1) dead rodent, and rodent burrows observed in the manure piles and the large gravel in the front of the laying house

Laying house 5 – Three (3) live rodents downstairs, in rows 4 and 5

Laying house 8 – Two (2) live rodents downstairs, in rows 1 and 4

Laying house 6 – One (1) live rodent, in row 1 pit area

Laying house 2 – One (1) live rodent downstairs, in row 4 pit area “

FDA blamed the large rodent infestation on Rose’s poor employee practices and said that without using sanitizers, cleaning alone does not remove microorganisms on surfaces.

“Throughout the inspection, the investigators observed equipment such as conveyor belts, chains, rail guards, buffers, egg transport arms, egg clappers, production computers, and exterior equipment surfaces with an accumulation of dried eggs, shells, and grime post sanitation,” the warning letter says. “These same areas were observed uncleaned on multiple days during the inspection pre and post sanitation.”

FDA recognized Rose for the recall earlier this year of 206 million shell eggs, produced at the North Carolina facility from Jan. 11, 2018 to April 12, 2018. The agency has asked Rose to respond within 15 days to the warning letter with documentation of its corrective actions.

Rose was provided with FDA’s inspection observations last April 11, and responded on Aug. 6 with a “restoration plan” for the Hyde County facility. “We are aware that you are currently diverting shell eggs from this farm to egg products processing,” FDA’s district director wrote. “Further, you have stated that you are in the process of depopulating all flocks and cleaning and disinfecting all laying houses. Thereafter, you plan to conduct environmental testing of each laying house as verification of your cleaning and disinfecting. In addition, you have contracted and are currently working with a professional rodent extermination company to address the rodent issues at your firm. Furthermore, you committed to improving your good manufacturing practices (GMPs), procedures for cleaning and sanitizing, and environmental monitoring program in the processing plant. We will verify the implementation of your corrective actions and their adequacy during the next FDA inspection.”

The public first learned of the S. braenderup outbreak on April 16, 2018, and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) declared it over on June 14, 2018 with 45 confirmed illnesses in the ten states. Eleven required hospital care. All of the outbreak victims survived.

Undoubtedly, inadequate sanitation is just one out of the major causes of ailments, especially in children. Therefore, keeping one’s hand clean through improved hygiene is one of the most important steps that can be taken to avoid getting sick and spreading germs to others. This can be achieved by the singular act of washing our hands regularly with soap and clean, running water.

To this end, a leading personal and home care product company, Saponaria Industries Nigeria Limited, is fully committed to helping build better awareness in the community to drive home the need for good hygiene and sanitation through it novel initiative, ‘Sanitol – A Million Clean Hands’. Again, this is because improving sanitation in Nigeria will have significant beneficial impacts on households and communities.

Multi-pronged Initiative

This initiative is a multi-pronged mission that is founded on a strong sense of corporate social responsibility and manifests in several ways. Starting from this month of September, items like liquid hand wash soap and various other cleanliness products, from the stables of Saponaria Industries Nigeria Limited, would be supplied to various communities in Nigeria, especially for schools bathrooms and toilets on a monthly basis.

Saponaria Industries is a fast moving consumer products company with an array of market leading brands across the personal care, home care and beauty and cosmetics categories. The firm’s strong manufacturing capabilities and distribution strengths are augmented by a continuous focus on brand innovation that fits into a larger corporate mission; to contribute to a cleaner, healthier Nigeria. For many years it has through its Sanitol range of medicated products ran the ‘Keep Naija Clean’ programme.

The company through its ‘Sanitol – A Million Clean Hands’ programme recently embarked on an initiative in which it has begun to place the Sanitol range of soaps, hand wash and hand sanitizer in at least 100 schools over the next six months, while also educating teachers and children on the far reaching benefits of a simple act of washing hands with soap and clean water.

Focus on the Less Privileged

Speaking during the flag off event for “A Million Clean Hands” campaign held at Dr Teslim Elias Model Primary School, Isale Eko, Lagos State, the company’s Managing Director, Mr. Ashish Misra, explained that personal hygiene and sanitation must be a focus for both Nigeria and Saponaria.

“People must know that washing hands with soap and water is the first line of defence against disease and illness”, he noted, adding that, ‘A Million Clean Hands’ will target schools in lower income communities so that the Sanitol product and message reaches the most vulnerable communities.

On what informed the idea for the choice of areas for the exercise, he said, “There are multiple types of areas like the high and low income areas. But our focus really is to go to areas which are slightly socially and economically underprivileged. “These are areas with problems of access to hygiene products and also needs education, which is why we would consistently, chose slightly low income areas, so that the impact is heightened as spread of diseases and infections are higher in areas like these.”

“We want to focus on communities where the idea of hygiene and sanitation still has to take root. This is where the outbreak of disease is likely to happen because condition of living is terrible with still waters everywhere, which breed mosquitoes and infections; here people cook and relieve themselves at roughly the same place.”

“We can always go to Lekki and Victoria Island but in these areas they already have a conscious habit of hygiene. But in areas like Isale Eko, Ajegunle, Mushin and the likes, with children in such communities, the idea of hand washing has to still take root and sometimes the financial strength is not available to go and buy these products. The education and distribution will help this effort and that is why we are choosing schools of this type and in fact, we are going to take this further to places like Kano, Kaduna, Zaria, Onitsha, Aba and Port Harcourt.”

“In communities like these, we want to reach out to the children in slightly under privileged areas so that not only do they get the message but they are able to share it with their friends and parents and their immediate communities. We would have different schools but we want to concentrate on areas like these because of the incidences of deceases and healthcare challenges are more in areas like these.”

Inculcating Hygienic Habits

Speaking further, Misra said, “Our idea is to make sure our products are placed in school bathrooms and we will provide a month supply. We want to start the process. The idea is to start the habit; it is the habit that is the key. We would provide enough for them to have for a full month. Once they get into the habit for a month, they will provide for themselves. They might find other soaps but the idea is to ensure the habit of hand washing before and after toiled is entrenched. The idea is to make sure the toilets and bath rooms are equipped for a full month.”

To ensure that the practice of washing the hands regularly, most especially after using the toilet is imbibed, Misra said, “We have done multiple exercises, one of which include education, so we have consistently educated children. October 15 is Global Handwashing Day and this year’s theme focuses on the links between handwashing and food. So we are going to take the advantage to educate people once again.”

“Right now, many organisations are reaching out to us and are using our products for demonstration; it is actually funny that you have to do a demonstration on good hand hygiene behaviour. A lot of people are not aware of this. We are very sure that having the soaps in the bathrooms is enough to spark off that behaviuor and the idea here is to ensure that the products are available in the communities, especially in the schools’ toilets.

“Again, in some schools in these communities, the toilets are not in good condition and water is not available. Electricity is not also there to pump water. So we are also working with organisations to ensure that at least a hand pump is provided. For example, we are contributing to convert one building in Dr Teslim Elias Model Primary School, Isale Eko into a bathroom. So, it is a sustained multilayer effort. But the clear idea is to provide products. What we are doing in terms of building bathrooms may not be a massive exercise because we have quite a number of people we want to reach. We are sure we can reach at least a million children with our products and we hope the children will take this back to the communities they come from”.

Misra who revealed further that there were still a lot of children to be reached, noted that after the flag off of the exercise, the firm will reach as much as possible and basically the communities’ schools first. The moment our target of a million clean hands is completed, we can now go with another product of ours, Gentle Baby Soap, to hospitals, for newly born children, new mothers, expecting mother and children. So we would keep reaching out to different parts of the communities”, he added.

On what his company would gain from the monthly exercise, the MD said, “We are into the business of making soaps, so the more people use soaps regularly, it will not only be of benefit to the company but also beneficial to the communities because if people don’t use soaps to keep themselves clean, or even when they use soaps infrequently, it leads to diseases and unhealthiness. But the moment people get into the habit of using soaps regularly and we are able to instill the inhabit perpetually, we would see the market for our larger portfolio of hygiene and health related products growing and then we would have more healthier people in the communities. So our focus is to grow the market as an industry in a whole and also to ensure that the habit of hygiene is instilled.”

By | Published: 11:58 pm 4:22 pm

Hyderabad: A day after Ganesh idol immersions, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) made intensive efforts across the city to clear garbage with various stretches along which the immersion procession was taken out being strewn with garbage on Sunday.

On an average, GHMC clears 4,100 tonnes of garbage in the city every day. The Ganesh immersion meant the municipal corporation had to clear an additional 7,300 tonnes of garbage over the last four days. On Sunday alone, about 2,060 tonnes of garbage was cleared.

GHMC has appointed 8,600 sanitation workers en route 370 kms along which the Ganesh processions were taken out in the city. It was mainly along the routes leading to the Hussain Sagar where lanes and footpaths had piles of garbage.

GHMC Commissioner M Dana Kishore said GHMC had deployed 10,000 staffers from its sanitation and entomology wings to clear the garbage on Sunday. Soon after the main processions were completed, sanitation workers took the task of clearing garbage.

80,000 idols immersed

Over 80,000 Ganesh idols were immersed in 35 lakes in the city. In Hussain Sagar alone, more than 15,000 Ganesh idols were immersed.

Kishore said the immersion of a record 80,000 Ganesh idols were conducted smoothly without any untoward incidents. He appreciated the sanitation staff for their efforts in managing cleanliness in the city.

To avoid lakes getting polluted from Ganesh idols, 23 ponds were created especially for immersion, in which 34,886 idols were immersed, he added.

2,700 tonnes of debris cleared

It was a Herculean task for the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) to clear the remnants of the festival from the city lakes.

Till Monday evening, 2,700 tonnes, primarily frames and idols and other puja material, were lifted and carted away by workers. For this, HMDA engaged tippers, earthmovers, trash collectors and other equipment.

An amount of Rs.26.25 lakh was sanctioned for removal of remains from Hussain Sagar on NTR Marg. The collected garbage was being shifted to the transfer station of the GHMC at Lower Tank Bund.

HMDA officials said the cleaning operations would be completed by September 29. Water quality samples were collected before the immersion to compare the water quality after cleaning operations.","The Ganesh immersion meant the municipal corporation had to clear an additional 7,300 tonnes of garbage over the last four days.

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA , Sep 20 2018 (IPS) - Achuar indigenous communities in Ecuador are turning to the sun to generate electricity for their homes and transport themselves in canoes with solar panels along the rivers of their territory in the Amazon rainforest, just one illustration of how indigenous people are seeking clean energies as a partner for sustainable development.

“We want to generate a community economy based on sustainability,” Domingo Peas, an Achuar leader, told IPS. Peas is also an advisor to the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon, which groups 28 indigenous organisations and 11 native groups from that South American country.

The first project dates back to the last decade, when the Achuar people began to install solar panels in Sharamentsa, a village of 120 people located on the banks of the Pastaza River. Currently they are operating 40 photovoltaic panels, at a cost of 300 dollars per unit, contributed by private donations and foundations.

""Communities have to be at the centre to decide on and design projects that help combat poverty, because they allow electricity without depending on the power grid, and they strengthen the defense of the territory and benefit the people. It's about guaranteeing rights and defining development processes."" -- Victoria Tauli-Corpuz



The villagers use electricity to light up their homes and pump water to a 6,000-litre tank.

“There is a better quality of services for families. Our goal is to create another energy model that is respectful of our people and our territories,” Peas said.

The Achuar took the next step in 2012, when they started the Kara Solar electric canoe motor project. Kara means “dream” in the Achuar language.

The first boat with solar panels on its roof, with a capacity to carry 20 people and built at a cost of 50,000 dollars, began operating in 2017 and is based in the Achuar community of Kapawi.

The second canoe, with a cost of 35,000 dollars, based in Sharamentsa – which means “the place of scarlet macaws” in Achuar – began ferrying people in July.

The investment came partly from private donations and the rest from the IDEAS prize for Energy Innovation, established by the Inter-American Development Bank, which the community received in 2015, endowed with 127,000 dollars.

The Achuar people’s solar-powered transport network connects nine of their communities along 67 km of the Pastaza river – which forms part of the border between Ecuador and Peru – and the Capahuari river. The approximately 21,000 members of the Achuar community live along the banks of these two rivers.

“It was an indigenous idea adapted to the manufacture of canoes. They use them to transport people and products, like peanuts, cinnamon, yucca and plantains (cooking bananas),” in an area where rivers are the highways connecting their settlements, said Peas.

The demand for clean energy in indigenous and local communities and success stories such as the Achuar’s were presented during the Global Climate Action Summit, convened by the government of the U.S. state of California.

The event, held on Sept. 13-14 in San Francisco, was an early celebration of the third anniversary of the historic Paris Agreement on climate change, reached in the French capital in December 2015.

Native delegates also participated in the alternative forum “Our Village: Climate Action by the People,” on Sept. 11-14, presented by the U.S. non-governmental organisations If Not US Then Who and Hip Hop Caucus.

Right Energy Partnership



The Indigenous Peoples' Major Group for Sustainable Development (IPMG), made up of 50 organisations from 33 countries, launched the Right Energy Partnership in July. In Latin America, organisations from Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru and five regional and global networks are taking part.



The consortium seeks to ensure that alternative projects are aligned with respect for and protection of human rights and provide access by at least 50 million indigenous people to renewable energy by 2030 that is developed and managed in a manner consistent with their self-determination needs and development aspirations.



This would be achieved by ensuring the protection of rights to prevent adverse impacts of renewable energy initiatives on ancestral territories, strengthen communities with sustainable development, and fortify the exchange of knowledge and collaboration between indigenous peoples and other actors.



The Alliance decided to conduct a pilot phase between 2018 and 2020 in 10 countries. The first countries included were Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Nicaragua, and Australia, the United States and New Zealand could also join, as they have indigenous groups that already operate renewable ventures and have success stories.



In addition to Ecuador, innovative experiences have also emerged from indigenous communities in countries such as Australia, Bolivia, Canada, Guatemala, Malaysia, Nicaragua, the Philippines, and the United States, according to the forum.

For example, in Bolivia there is an alliance between the local government of Yocalla, in the southern department of Potosí, and the non-governmental organisation Luces Nuevas aimed at providing electricity from renewable sources to poor families.

In Yocalla, a municipality of 10,000 people, mainly members of the Pukina indigenous community, “755 families live in rural areas with limited electricity; the national power grid has not yet reached those places,” project consultant Yara Montenegro told IPS.

Thanks to the programme, which began in March, 30 poor families have received solar panels connected to lithium batteries, produced at the La Palca pilot plant in Potosí, which store the fluid.

Each system costs 400 dollars, of which the families contribute half and the organisation and the government the other half. The families can connect two lamps, charge a cell phone and listen to the radio, replacing the use of firewood, candles and conventional batteries.

The development of clean sources plays a decisive role in achieving one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Goal seven aims to establish “affordable and non-polluting energy” – a goal that also has an impact on the achievement of at least another 11 SDGs, which the international community set for itself in 2015 for the next 15 years, within the framework of the United Nations.

In addition, the success of the Sustainable Energy for All Initiative (SE4All), the programme to be implemented during the Decade of Sustainable Energy for All 2014-2024, which aims to guarantee universal access to modern energy services, and to double the global rate of energy efficiency upgrades and the share of renewables in the global energy mix, depends on that progress.

But most of the groups promoting an energy transition do not include native people, points out the May report “Renewable Energy and Indigenous Peoples. Background Paper to the Right Energy Partnership,” prepared by the Indigenous Peoples’ Major Group for Sustainable Development (IPMG).

That group launched a Right Energy Partnership in July, which seeks to fill that gap.

For Victoria Tauli-Corpuz of the Kankanaey Igorot people, who is the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, energy represents “a problem and a solution” for indigenous people, she told IPS at the alternative forum in San Francisco.

“The leaders have fought against hydroelectric dams and I have also seen projects in the hands of indigenous peoples,” she said.

Because of this, “the communities have to be at the centre to decide on and design projects that help combat poverty, because they allow electricity without depending on the power grid, and they strengthen the defense of the territory and benefit the people,” she said.

“It’s about guaranteeing rights and defining development processes,” she summed up.

Examples of projects that can be replicated and expanded, as called for by the U.N special rapporteur, are provided by communities such as Sharamentsa in Ecuador and Yocalla in Bolivia.

Sharamentsa operates a 12 kW battery bank that can create a microgrid. “A power supply centre is planned that allows the generation of value-added products, such as plant processing,” Peas said.

In Yocalla, the plan is to equip some 169 families with systems in December and then try to extend it to all of Potosí. But Montenegro pointed out that alliances are needed so that the beneficiaries can pay less. “In 2019 we will analyse the impact, if the families are satisfied with it, if they are comfortable,” she said.

For the first time in more than 50 years, a trip to Mountain Boy Basin will reveal only wild, pristine wilderness, thanks to the massive and diverse efforts of prison inmates, local children and teenagers, recovering addicts and a pack string of horses and mules.

Prior to this week, several tons of rusty, old rebar and metal cable littered the otherwise scenic spot on the east side of Independence Pass that is popular among skiers and hikers. The debris — a result of an abandoned snow fencing experiment in the early 1960s — was unsightly but also a hazard to people and wildlife in the area, Independence Pass Foundation Executive Director Karin Teague said. In the past few weeks, she’s spotted elk, bighorn sheep, deer, moose and mountain goats up on the pass.

“(It’s) amazing to me that no one has impaled (himself or herself),” said Teague, who is familiar with the terrain through her work with the foundation and as a local who skis the area.

With Teague at the helm and assistance from the U.S. Forest Service, the foundation launched the Mountain Boy initiative three years ago as part of its greater, decades-long mission to clean up the pass.

What’s different about the Mountain Boy project, however, is that the site’s wilderness designation forbids the use of vehicles and mechanized equipment. Therefore, the Independence Pass Foundation relied solely on the grit and strength of volunteers and the pack string to haul out the heavy remnants.

Over the years, the foundation has forged unique partnerships within the community, which Teague said, “We absolutely count on for our difficult projects like this one.”

One is with the Buena Vista Correctional Facility, which sent a crew of eight male inmates and one supervisor to help with the Mountain Boy Basin undertaking.

The arrangement is one of the foundation’s more profound and mutually beneficial exchanges, Teague said.

“The skills they all bring to this project, I mean, they are half the reason why we’re able to get this rebar out of the ground, because they figured out how to use these jacks and how to tie the chain just right, and how much leveraging (is) needed, and they’re very clever with tools and finding solutions to problems,” Teague said. “Something I never could’ve done on my own, so they’ve been a great gift.”

Aside from their distinct skill set, Teague believes the experience — being outside in the fresh alpine air, working with animals, hiking hills, solving problems and lifting objects — does wonders for the inmates’ psyche, morale and sense of accomplishment.

“Personally I can’t say enough about the impact … it helps them, for a while, thrive,” she said.

At the direction of the Buena Vista Correctional Facility, under the Colorado Department of Corrections, The Aspen Times was not allowed to interview or note commentary from the inmates or photograph their faces. Also per the facility, this story did not publish until the inmates completed their time at the project.

During a work day Sept. 19, the inmates treated the animals with compassion and care, brushing their manes and sneaking them snacks. The men worked diligently and their disposition was upbeat.

One crew member has “been really inspired by his work up here,” according to Teague. He has discussed with her his post-prison plans of living off the grid in the southern part of the state.

Another inmate, who Teague said “really came to life on this project,” shared with her his hopes of introducing his son to the wilderness after leaving prison.

“They are people who can and will be highly contributing members of our community if we give them a chance,” Teague said.

She added, “It is absolutely my favorite part of the job, working with these young men.”

Another valuable asset on the Mountain Boy Basin mission was the U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Regional pack string.

The project, however, marked the pack string’s swan song in the region.

Glenn Ryan, a “lead packer” for the Forest Service and member of the Mountain Boy Basin team, said budget cuts and higher-ups are to blame.

He said they don’t know what is going on in the field.

“I got to admit, I’m a little bitter they’re shutting us down with the massive budget cuts. But we work. We work out in the woods, we do projects like this,” said Ryan, who has been with the service for nearly 30 years.

“That’s just all work that’s not going to get done in the woods anymore. It’s a pretty sorry state of affairs that we’ve got going right now,” he added shortly after.

Asked if wildfires are a factor in the budget cuts, Ryan said the slash in Forest Service funding “was in the works” before.

“We’re just not getting work done out in the field, real work, and that’s what the public wants, is work. … They want to see people out in the field getting work done, like (the inmates) here with us, they’re getting stuff done on public lands,” Ryan said. “We’ve got a regional forester, we’ve got deputy regional foresters, we’ve got directors, we’ve got deputy directors, and everybody’s got secretaries and they’re not out in the fields, they don’t know what the heck’s going on.

“I mean, this is an organization, I guess you could say I love, and there’s a bunch of us at this lower level, at the field level, (who) feel that way, and I’m sorry for the public, you know, the service we do, for the American people and for their land.”

In a day and age where people turn to technology to solve everything, Ryan added, there is irreplaceable value in “good, old-fashioned” hard work.

The horses and mules can each haul about 140 pounds, with half distributed on each side.

Throughout three-and-a-half days this summer, the pack string, inmates and Independence Pass Foundation crew collectively removed more than 13,000 pounds of rebar and metal cable out of Mountain Boy Basin.

Teague said it feels “really good to get all of that debris out of the wilderness and into a recycling center,” but the lack of a pack string in the future will be “a real loss for the district and the region.”

215,"https://riverdalepress.com/stories/clean-up-begins-at-site-of-spy-house,66580","Sun, 02 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Riverdale Press,Clean-up begins at site of ‘spy house’,"Posted Sunday, September 2, 2018 12:05 am

A pair of workers cloaked in yellow hooded ponchos gazed over the mini wasteland, a filthy patch of leafy urban squalor — a space some neighbors say has suffered far too long from neglect.

Greg Lombardi lives next door to the vacant lot at 5437 Fieldston Road — the site of what some residents suspected to be the “former spy house” the U.S. government reputedly used to keep tabs on the looming Russian diplomatic compound behind it on West 255th Street. Since that house was removed, however, Lombardi says the lot has been transformed into an “overgrown dump infested with feral cats, skunks and raccoons.”

Closed in by a ramshackle chain-link fence with a dark green, frayed fabric covering, the land is owned by Talner Congregation Beth David on Mosholu Avenue, purchased for $400,000 in 2011, according to city property records. The congregation reportedly had plans to build a synagogue on the site which, Lombardi said, appears to have no access to utilities.

While the buildings department had approved the congregation’s plans for the new building, according to spokesman Andrew Rudansky, it never happened.

The why, however, remains a mystery.

A series of photographs on the congregation’s website that appear to have been taken over several days in August and September 2013 show the small, two-story white house, tractors on the site, the house all but torn down, the compound’s imperious façade towering in the background, and what looks like the aftermath — chunks of splintered wood, debris.

Joseph Fink, whom Lombardi identified as the president of Talner Congregation, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Morris Dreisinger — who refused to verify the correct spelling of his name — and whom Lombardi said is the congregation’s vice president — said the lot had “sadly slipped through the cracks” and promised the congregation would tackle cleanup “imminently.” As for the fence, Dreisinger said, they’d “straighten it out,” but refused to elaborate.

“It’s all in the process of being corrected,” he said.

But words alone won’t cut it for Lombardi — a chef in Manhattan, who’s lived in the Riverdale area for nearly 20 years — or for his neighbors, who aren’t exactly singing the congregation’s praises.

Utilities or none — and local lore as to the true purpose of the long-gone house aside — Lombardi says he just wants the land properly cleaned and the rickety fence maintained or removed, calling its condition “a shame.”

“It’s like a jungle,” Lombardi said. “You can’t walk to the street in front of it, the weeds are so overgrown.”

But Lombardi doubts taming the “jungle” is any big task.

“A landscaper there, a dumpster, and a little cleaning crew, and it could be knocked out in one day,” Lombardi said. “The fence looks like it’s going to fall. You’ve got to take care of it. We don’t need (Talner Congregation) to make it a beautiful park. We just need them to clean it. I walk my dog out there. I’m afraid of ticks, and God knows what’s walking around in there.”

But on the bright side, cleanup at long last appears to be underway. Lombardi spotted a machete-wielding local fellow who reportedly does odd jobs in the neighborhood hacking away at the overgrown brush a few days after The Riverdale Press started looking into the issue on Aug. 12.

Finally, the sidewalk was clear. Still, there’s a long way to go.

Lombardi and neighbor Martha Diaz stood in the rain the next day, assessing years of neglect — a secluded pocket of green, wood, wildness that, spruced up, could offer a kind of charming rusticity, a mini oasis. But instead, it remains an eyesore, as well as a potential safety hazard. Lombardi had taped a tennis ball to a pole jutting out from the fence to protect passersby.

“There’s like a big family of cats that live in there,” Lombardi said. “It’s insane.”

Ever since around the time the rumored spy house was demolished, Diaz said, the lot “has been an absolute disaster. There’s trees, or weeds that grew into trees, all over the place. I’ve seen rats go through here over the years.”

Last year, Diaz said, a pair of giant barrels sat collecting water, attracting legions of mosquitoes, until her husband took a big stick and pushed them over, draining the water and shooing away the pests.

“It’s disgusting,” Diaz said. “People throw garbage in there.”

Thanks to the small work crew, “for the first time, you can actually see the ground,” Diaz said. “We call it ‘our jungle, the rainforest.’ It’s progressively thicker. It gets wilder all the time.”

At one point, Diaz said, the weeds were taller than her.

The city’s sanitation department inspected the lot Aug. 14, department officials said, finding what they described as minimal loose wood — the house’s original timber, according to Lombardi — and a small amount of litter. The curb and sidewalk, however, they deemed clean.

Sanitation officials said they’d asked the city’s health department to order Talner Congregation to clean the lot — required before sanitation could even enter the lot, since it’s a locked, fenced private property. But if the congregation didn’t comply within a few days, the county supreme court would take a look at the mess and could grant sanitation permission to go in and clean.

Health department officials, meanwhile, said they’d investigate, but that they had no records of inspections or complaints for the location.

In the meantime, Lombardi at least can find solace in the fact cleanup’s finally happening.

“They really cleared it out,” Lombardi said. “You couldn’t see past this fence. It looks like they cleared out most of the garbage, too. They even cut back the tree grow-over, everything. Looks good.

“As long as they’re doing something, as long as it’s getting cleaned up, that’s all I wanted. I can’t be happier.”","The congregation reportedly had plans to build a synagogue on the site which, Lombardi said, appears to have no access to utilities.
Joseph Fink, whom Lombardi identified as the president of Talner Congregation, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
“The fence looks like it’s going to fall.

‘Swachhata Hi Seva’ movement began on a great note today. I salute all those who engaged in Swachhata activities. The efforts are deeply appreciated. I invite more people to enrich #SHS18 with their participation over the next fortnight. Lets fulfil Bapu’s dream of a Clean India. — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) September 15, 2018

High functionaries, including the President of India, Union ministers, governors of states, chief Ministers etc. are falling head over heels to extol this programme.

The new Swachhata hi Seva drive has thrown ministers, state CMs into a tizzy. (Photo: @BJP Twitter)

I am sorry to pour cold water over this elation, but I believe this announcement as well as this programme is just a stunt.

Rerun of the same gimmick

In fact, one Swachhata Abhiyan were announced in 2015, but it soon became evident that it was only a gimmick and shenanigan.

On television, one could see prominent people using brooms to sweep away garbage, which had a few moments earlier been brought and deposited there.

One lady MP (a former film actress) was seen walking with a broom on a Mathura street — the broom seeming to be taller than her, but not appearing to touch the ground.

We need industrial society in India to achieve cleanliness. (Photo: Reuters)

What we must learn from the West

In my opinion, we will never have real cleanliness in public places until we create an industrial society in India, as in the Western countries.

Today we see mounds of garbage lying everywhere in Indian cities, people throwing litter everywhere without batting an eye — polluted rivers, polluted air, polluted foodstuffs.

In feudal societies, cleanliness was only to be maintained within one's house, but not outside it. There were no garbage bins outside the house, so one just chucked the garbage out of the house.

On the other hand, in Western countries like the US, there are garbage bins outside almost every house, and there are larger garbage bins for each colony.

Every child is taught by his/her parents that garbage is not to be dumped anywhere, but must be put in the garbage bin inside the house, from where one takes it usually at the end of the day to the bigger garbage can outside the house, and that is collected by the municipality regularly.

No one in the West throws litter on the road or public place, like parks etc. If one takes his dog for a walk, and the dog excretes on the road, one has to pick up the excreta (with plastic gloves, which everyone carries when taking out a dog for a walk ) and throw it in a garbage bin.

In India, on the other hand, no one would do that. If one is travelling in a car and has some litter, he just tosses it out of the car window onto the road.

In Western countries, the rivers are clean, in India they are polluted.

In India, almost everything is polluted, including water and air. (Photo: Reuters)

In Western countries, one can drink tap water as it is safe to drink. In India, almost everything is polluted, including water and air. So, one uses aquaguard or some such device to avoid falling sick.

Recently, the Supreme Court came down heavily on the Delhi authorities for the piles of garbage lying in several places in Delhi, but I doubt whether its directives will have any effect.

Much earlier, the Supreme Court had directed cleaning of the Ganga and the Jamuna rivers, but they remain as polluted as before, if not more.

Cleanliness is not photo opportunity. (Photo: Twitter)

Why swachhata will remain elusive

Swachhata is a feature of an industrial, not a feudal, society. India is still semi-feudal, and so Swacchata will remain an illusion until we create an industrial society.

Why is cleanliness of public places a feature of an industrial society, and not of the feudal societies?

To explain this, one must understand that in feudal societies, human groupings were small, and scattered over wide rural areas, and the main occupation of people was agriculture.

On the other hand, in industrial societies, human groupings are large, and are concentrated in cities, where most people work in factories, offices and other establishments, and are in close contact with one another.

So, in industrial societies, if a worker falls sick due to some disease, he may infect others in his factory or establishment, which might affect the function of the factory.

Also, since bacteria and viruses are not selective between employers and employees, the managers and proprietors of factories or establishments may also catch the infection.

Industrial societies are highly integrated, and there is a great deal of interaction among its members. So, if one person falls sick, he is likely to infect others with whom he interacts.

Hence, it is essential to have a high degree of hygiene and sanitation in industrial societies. Otherwise, the society may not be able to function at all.

It is not that the Western societies always had a high level of cleanliness.

In the early years of their industrialisation, there was little regard for cleanliness or hygiene, because industrialists were only interested in making money.

Hence, for a long period rivers like the Thames etc. were full of industrial filth and human excreta.

In America, though the basic industrialisation had been completed by the end of the 19th century, even till the early decades of the 20th century, there was little interest shown by the authorities and society to ensure a high level of cleanliness and food safety.

It was later that the realisation dawned among the authorities and society in general that without a high level of cleanliness and sanitation, industrial society could not function smoothly.

The act of cleaning-up should begin early, as part of a social norm. (Photo: Twitter)

The publication of Upton Sinclair's famous novel The Jungle awakened the American authorities and the society to the urgent needs of imposing strict food security regulations. Also, there are now stricter rules in Western countries against air and water pollution.

In Western countries, there are laws against littering etc. But even without these laws, people would not throw litter on roads and other public places, because they have been taught since childhood by their parents that littering is something just not done.

So, it is a social, not a legal norm, which prohibits littering.

There is no such social norm in Indian society.

So, we can keep having as many Swachhata Abhiyans we may like, but these will be nothing but stunts, and Swachhata will keep eluding us until we create an industrial society. And that still seems decades away.

The event was part of the organization’s initiatives on World Clean Up Day to raise awareness on the dangers of plastics on the environment, humans and marine life.

The event drew 150 volunteers of all ages, who came together, to remove 100 kilograms of debris from the shoreline for which 80% were plastic wastes. The debris included hundreds of plastic bottles, water sachets, dozens of food wrappers, construction materials among several others.



The volunteers came from the New Ningo Community, New Ningo D/A Basic B School, Good Shepherd Methodist Church New Ningo, Association International School Accra, international volunteers from Accra.

On the mission to impact the next generation of Plastic Punchers on good waste management practices, the team segregated the waste at the beach and collected a full container with about 100kg of plastics.

On the other side were some other activities including a creative art workshop on the environment, where the children expressed themselves with regards to the plastic issues and marine lives.

During the “Find the turtle nest game” children were exposed to the importance of marine conservation and acquired knowledge on the turtle nesting process as well as the dangers the turtles may encounter in the ocean and on the shore.

The plastics collected from the beach will be turned into bricks for construction by Transformers International and the returns will be used to improve the sanitation situation in the community.

All though we take it for granted, sanitation is a physical measure that has probably done more to increase human life span than any kind of drug or surgery (Deepak Chopra). The word sanitation also refers to the maintenance of hygienic conditions, through services such as garbage collection and wastewater disposal.Zimbabwe has become engulfed in filth. Almost every street and gutter in our communities is choked with solid and liquid waste. There is so much negligence and no show of concern when people are disposing off refuse generated at homes and workplaces. Rubbish and waste materials are haphazardly dumped anywhere in the environment, spreading deadly diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea and malaria.Several measures by successive legislators to curb this national menace have not yielded the desired results.clean up campaigns and environmental awareness programs have been put up by government and various private sector companies and NGOs to make Zimbabwe a clean and safe environmentally friendly country.However, most Zimbabweans seem not to recognize the importance of sanitation in the country as they show no interest in the clean-up exercises and are, therefore, reluctant to participate. This apathetic attitude, is hampering the government's intend of making zimbabwe the cleanest country in Africa.Zimbabweans must show commitment when it comes to sanitation since cleaning our communities will help reduce conditions that breed diseases such as cholera.Natural disasters such as flood may also be prevented when drains and gutters are cleared for running water to pass freely.The horrors of Gweru and Chitungwiza are enough to remind us on the dangers of living in dirty surroundings.

Progress to date

SDG6 establishes the template for all the infrastructure focused SDGs, highlighting how considerable progress has been made since the turn of the century, while still raising the alarm over the many millions of people who still lack access to basic services.

For example, the proportion of people globally who are forced to still undertake the practice of open defecation has fallen from 20 per cent in 2000 to 12 per cent in 2005. But that still leaves 892 million people without any access to sanitation of any sort, while 2.3 billion people lack access to a basic sanitation service - defined as an improved facility that is not shared.

Similarly, as of 2015 5.2 billion people had access to safely managed drinking water on site, but that still left 1.3 billion people travelling up to 30 minutes to access an improved water source and a further 844 million people without access to even basic water services.

Inevitably, those without access to water and sanitation services are concentrated in those rural areas where the costs of providing water infrastructure are highest. ""Achieving universal access to basic sanitation and ending the unsafe practice of open defecation will require substantial acceleration of progress in rural areas of Central and Southern Asia, Eastern and South-Eastern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa,"" the UN warns.

Somewhat bizarrely SDG6 does not directly reference the significant risks the water sector faces from projected climate impacts, but it does highlight how progress is urgently needed to improve water management and tackle water stress.

For example, the most recent SDG progress report cites a survey that found 22 countries, mainly located in Africa and Asia, are experiencing a ratio of fresh water withdrawn to total renewable freshwater resources above 70 per cent, which according to the UN ""indicates strong probability of future water scarcity"".

""In 15 of these countries, withdrawals totaled more than 100 per cent of the renewable freshwater resources in the country,"" the report added.

At the same time, across 157 countries surveyed in the past year the average implementation rate for integrated water resources management stood at just 48 per cent. And for 62 countries sharing cross border water resources only 17 reported that agreements were in place to co-operate on water management across all their transboundary basins.

Overseas Development Aid for the water sector has increased steadily to $9bn in 2016, but despite water's central role in meeting other health and development goal its share of overall aid spending has remained flat at five per cent for the past decade.

Business implications

The central role of the private sector in providing water infrastructure and/or services in many countries means SDG6 was always going to have an impact on businesses. However, the inclusion of sustainable water management and water stress in the goal means its reach is expanded to cover all businesses worldwide.

No business can operate without water, while all supply chains across all industries are threatened by water stress and related risks.

Targets 6.3 and 6.4, which incorporate pledges to reduce water pollution and ""substantially increase water efficiency"" by 2030, point to new regulations and standards in multiple jurisdictions.

Meanwhile, target 6.5's commitment to implement integrated water resources management at all levels suggests water intensive industries can expect to face more pressure from governments to work with authorities and other stakeholders to tackle water risks.

As such, SDG6 is a goal that all businesses have to engage with in some way, whether they are at direct risk of water-related impacts or not.

Business Risks

SDG6 is one of the keystone SDGs underpinning much of the anticipated progress on health and wider economic development. As such a failure to meet it risks undermining growth in many developing and emerging markets. More worrying still, security experts remain fearful that the 'water wars' could become a genuine threat to international stability as climate impacts worsen and countries clash over scarce water resources.

The SDG may not mention climate resilience specifically, but scientists have been clear that flooding and droughts are two of the most severe threats associated with escalating climate risks. As such a failure to get a grip on the targets covering water efficiency, sustainable basin management, and water-related ecosystem services could lead to significant disruption for global supply chains, with agriculture and manufacturing at particular risk.

High profile stories of factories at loggerheads with the communities in which they are located over falling water tables have already emerged, but they risk becoming an increasingly common occurrence.

More specifically, the promise of action to tackle water pollution and improve water efficiency is likely to lead to new regulations in many markets, which could see businesses that are slow to respond left at risk of fines and/or reputational damage.

Business opportunities

Many leading businesses are already taking action to tackle water-related issues. A host of manufacturing and food companies have recognised the threat water stress could pose to their operations, cost base, and licence to operate, and as such are investing in water efficiency measures and even full water basin management strategies that involve the reforestation and management of upland areas.

For businesses, the benefits of such programmes are obvious as they tend to reduce costs and risk profiles, while also delivering reputational gains and biodiversity improvements.

SDG6 also promises significant business opportunities beyond the economic growth and productivity gains universal access to safe water and sanitation should unlock.

The water sector has not been known for its innovation in recent decades, but the pledges to cut water pollution, improve water efficiency, and specifically back capacity building programmes in developing countries, ""including water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies"" should all open up new market opportunities.","6.5 By 2030, implement integrated water resources management at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate.

Despite the country's remarkable progress in access to water and sanitation, 41 percent of all improved water sources are contaminated with E. Coli bacteria, the report cited, suggesting a high prevalence of fecal contamination in water.

Today, 98 percent of Bangladesh's population has access to water from technologically-improved sources, but E. coli contamination was found present in 80 percent of household tap-water across the country, it said.

E. coli (Escherichia coli) is a bacteria commonly blamed for causing diarrhea. Some forms of E. coli are also responsible for food poisoning, pneumonia, breathing problems, and urinary tract infections.

Bangladesh can reduce poverty and accelerate growth faster by taking urgent action to improve the quality of water and sanitation, said the report, “Promising Progress: A Diagnostic of Water Supply, Sanitation, Hygiene, and Poverty in Bangladesh” that the World Bank released in a programme at a city hotel.

It found that poor quality of drinking water affects the rich and poor, rural and urban population alike, but the poorest section of the population suffers three times more from water and sanitation related gastro-intestinal diseases.

Though Bangladesh has successfully eliminated the practice of open defecation, about 50 million people use shared, rudimentary toilets, and only 28 percent of toilets are equipped with soap and water, the report pointed out. In urban areas, slums have poor access to clean water and safe sanitation.

“Poor water quality and sanitation can hold back a country's potential because unsafe water and poor sanitation are linked to nutritional disadvantages in early childhood,” said Sereen Juma, World Bank acting country director.

“In Bangladesh, more than one-third of children under [the age of] five are stunted, limiting their ability to grow and learn,” he said. “Bangladesh has made great strides in expanding access to water and can build on that progress by focusing on improving the quality of water and sanitation.”

“Only about half of manufacturing enterprises in Bangladesh have toilets. Only half of the primary schools have separate toilets for girls, and one in four adolescent girls miss school during menstruation,” said George Joseph, World Bank senior economist and co-author of the report.

A safe water and sanitation environment would encourage more women to participate in the workforce, he said, adding that there is scope for Bangladesh to improve access to sanitation beyond the household level to public places, schools, health facilities, and workplaces.

Speaking as chief guest, Md Nazrul Islam, state minister for water resources, said the government is working on improvement of water and sanitation, and the report's findings would be helpful for further work.

This report is a part of the World Bank's WASH Poverty Diagnostics initiative in 18 countries, including Bangladesh.

Khairul Islam, country director of WaterAid, and Dr Hossain Zillur Rahman, executive chairman of Power and Participation Research Centre spoke, among others.

TurnitIndia Education Pvt Ltd Regional Director (South Asia) Ashim Sachdeva said policing faults should not be the sole priority, and parents should get involved in their children's activities to instill values.","Nearly half of the country's “safe” water -- supplied from technologically-improved sources -- is contaminated with E. coli bacteria, which is responsible for various intestinal diseases, revealed a World Bank report released in the capital yesterday.

SAP Work Manager solution supports the effective management of City of Cape Town’s water and sanitation workload to improve service delivery to nearly four million residents.

As one of the largest metros in South Africa, the City of Cape Town is tasked with providing an annual average of around 880 million litres of clean, safe drinking water daily to residents, businesses and industry, as well as effectively collecting and treating wastewater from the city.

This requires world-class management of water catchment areas and appropriate storage and treatment of wastewater to ensure a healthy and safe community for all residents.

“Water and sanitation services provide people with dignity and the provision of these services at all levels remains a challenge,” said Peter Flower, Director Water and Sanitation for the City of Cape Town.

“Cape Town is a growing city, there is a consequential growth in the demand for water. We have ageing infrastructure (some of our dams and pipelines are more than a century old), and recently, the impact of the severe drought conditions.

“Mobility is one of the strategic initiatives of the department to help in addressing these challenges and will go a long way towards ensuring both infrastructure and financial sustainability.”

To support its water and sanitation efforts, the City of Cape Town implemented a comprehensive mobile solution for the automation of asset management and field service processes.

SAP Work Manager empowers the City of Cape Town’s workforce with digital tools to more efficiently install, inspect, maintain and repair water and sanitation assets. The technology enables workers to access, complete and manage their assigned work orders and service requests via their mobile devices. The mobile application is a key building block of the asset management master plan.

Mobility is enabling the city’s skilled maintenance teams to perform their work more efficiently and effectively and is providing it with near real-time information that is analysed to improve future decision-making.

The key benefits of SAP Work Manager include increasing first-time resolution rates and improve workforce safety and productivity to effectively install, maintain, inspect, and repair mission-critical asset. It also prolongs the life of assets with guided work flows and timely processing of work orders, notification and asset master data, whether online of offline.

SAP Work Manager is deployed on premise and system and software requirements vary by specific customer scenarios. For example, SAP Work Manager, cloud edition is deployed in the cloud and available as software as a service (SaaS).

According to Mehmood Khan, Chief Operations Officer at SAP Africa, the rise of smart cities is driving change in the public sector to improve the citizen experience.

“In this era of connected citizens, local government institutions are increasingly looking for ways to improve service delivery and better engage with citizens,” he said.

“At the same time, a need to minimise operational expenditure by reducing maintenance costs associated with key infrastructure assets is driving the adoption of next-generation digital tools and making a positive impact in society.”

The City of Cape Town uses SAP Work Manager mobile applications to support several key function areas, including:

The Water Engineering Maintainer Application (WEMA) is designed for artisans or ‘maintainers’ to receive, execute and manage maintenance work orders through a mobile device, supporting greater team efficiencies

The Water Engineering Supervisor Application (WEZA) is designed for superintendents to manage the allocation, release and review of team work orders

The CityReads Meter Reading Application is designed to digitally capture meter readings in-house and in real-time

The DisconnectReconnect Application is designed to manage the capturing of field information by the technician for disconnection and reconnection of work orders

The City of Cape Town is also adding further applications to its SAP Work Manager solution.

“We are also excited about the recent implementation of the Reactive Issues Management Application (RIMA), which drastically improves the speed with which customer notifications can be actioned and responded to by field workers,” said Aden Veldsman, Principal Water Inspector for the City of Cape Town.

“This is having a positive impact on service delivery and is enhancing productivity by replacing paper-based processes.”

With CityReads, the city no longer relies on third-party meter reading software service providers for support and maintenance, as all necessary support work can be provided internally. The SAP Work Manager solution enables real-time data capturing on a mobile device, including meter readings and photographs, which are all uploaded directly to the SAP solution.

This is making a positive impact in terms of workforce optimisation and improved data accuracy, as no recapturing of critical data is requiring, minimising the likelihood of human error.

The CityReads app has also enhanced the meter reading cycle by improving the turnaround time for uploading of meter readings. To date, the meter reading teams have captured over 3.7 million meter readings using the CityReads mobile application at an average speed of 45 to 70 seconds per meter.

“The huge success of these mobility projects can be attributed to three main factors – SAP Work Manager being a solid, stable platform that does not require any back-end development; users recognising the value of the applications to execute their daily tasks; and excellent project team members,” added Flower.

Khan says the future of asset management in the digital age begins now.

“As government institutions move to establish smart cities fit for the digital age, having access to accurate, real-time data becomes imperative,” said Khan.

“The growing pervasiveness of connected assets via Internet of Things (IoT) technology, as well as the rise of a mobile-connected workforce, are creating unprecedented demand for quality data and the tools that can realise value from such data. By implementing the latest digital tools to empower its workforce in delivering one of the most important services, access to reliable water, to citizens, the City of Cape Town has taken a confident step towards enhancing its reputation as a world-class city for all.”

As part of SAP’s ongoing commitment towards helping cities across the continent to run best, the company recently took part in the Annual African Academic Forum, in Cape Town. The forum helps find innovative solutions to enhance, complement and tackle learning and teaching challenges across Africa by introducing 21st century skills to the traditional curriculum to meet the demands of the digital economy.

Instead, the women in the household must walk to fetch it, sometimes travelling miles carrying plastic or earthenware pots, possibly with a child or two in tow, to the nearest safe source – regularly repeating the journey up to three times a day. In the scorching summer months of April and May, when temperatures regularly exceed 40C, it is a particularly gruelling daily ritual – and when they get home they must complete their other household chores: cooking, washing, bringing up the children, even helping on the family farm.

These women are reminiscent of the many-armed Hindu goddess, Durga – they have so many daily tasks, they could doubtless do with an extra set of hands. But they aren’t the exception. This is the reality for millions of From the Western Ghats and the mountainous north-east to the arid desert state of Rajasthan, women across the country act as collectors. And this gender specific role has a severe impact on every aspect of their lives, from their health and social life to education and their ability to have a real say in the community.

It is estimated that 163m Indians still don’t have access to clean, running water. Until that’s fixed, this significant national problem will prevail, with women paying the biggest price.

A woman’s burden

collection in India is a woman’s job, irrespective of her physique – and there’s no respite, even when she’s menstruating, ill, or has something else to do. As groundwater resources are placed under increasing pressure due to over-reliance and unsustainable consumption, wells, ponds and tanks can also regularly dry up, escalating the and placing a greater burden on women to travel long distances. Access to unsafe drinking water also results in the spread of water-borne diseases. And women are often the first victims of both water scarcity and water pollution.

In urban areas, long queues of women with colourful plastic water pots are eye-catching. But such images also highlight problems of water scarcity and the long waits they endure for the water tankers that deliver it in cities.

Urban woman, especially on the outskirts of cities and in slum areas, face the particular burden of this water scarcity. In some areas, water is occasionally supplied in the middle of the night, meaning that these women are deprived of sleep and their productivity is affected. Indeed, there are women in the global south who are denied education purely because they have to collect water rather than go to school. In fact, one report revealed that almost 23% of girls in India drop out of school on reaching puberty due to a lack of water and sanitation facilities.

When girls have to drop out of school to help their mothers collect water and perform other household tasks, they are denied their right to education – which is now a fundamental right under Article 21A of the Indian Constitution. The saying goes: “Educate a woman, and she shall educate her family” – well, not these women. And because they’re missing out on the opportunities education provides, so are their other family members.

Collecting water is an irksome journey, especially in dry areas during heat waves. But it can be a dangerous one, too. Women may risk physical attack, for example, or abuse. The situation is made worse by the lack of adequate sanitation facilities both at home and en route to the water source. And things are even worse for women from the lower strata of society who are even denied access to water sources like public wells. This caste discrimination persists even though the Indian Constitution – which ensures equal access to public wells without any discrimination based on religion, race, caste, and sex – is 70 years old.

What the law says

India is a federal democratic country divided into the centre (or union government), 29 states, and seven union territories. The power to make laws is divided between the union government and the states as per Schedule 7 of the Constitution of India, 1950. Accordingly, state governments can legislate on issues related to water, except for those matters involving inter-state rivers and water disputes.

However, the central government has also initiated several programmes and policies to ensure universal access to water in rural and urban areas, such as the National Rural Drinking Water Programme. Access to water is, after all, a fundamental right, covered by the “right to life” that is guaranteed by the Constitution. Indeed, Indian law far predates the international human rights regime on this. The broader human right to water was only recognised in 2002 under General Comment 15 of the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR).

The three obligations on states regarding the human right to water – “respect, protect and fulfill” – have been recognised by the Indian courts in several cases (such as Subhash Kumar v State of Bihar, 1991 and Vishala Kochi Kudivella Samprakshana Samiti v State of Kerala, 2006). However, there is no legislation in India that explicitly recognises and implements this fundamental right to water. Instead, every five years, each new government brings with it its own pet programmes for water supply – and none of them have genuinely addressed the issue of water collection for women nor suggested any practical way to ease their burden.

How to tackle the crisis

Several parts of India face severe water scarcity and drought during the summer months. The reason for this water scarcity lies at the grass-roots level – unsustainable water consumption and unscientific ways of managing water supply. Traditional water sources and groundwater recharging points, such as tanks, ponds, canals and lakes, are either neglected, polluted or used or filled in for other purposes.

Only with the constructive involvement of all of society’s stakeholders can this problem be solved. And it must be solved soon. With the increasing threat of climate change, water scarcity could soon be an irreparable issue – and not just for women, but for everyone in society.

Four years ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Swachh Bharat Mission to achieve the vision of a ""Clean India"" by 2019. Fittingly, Oct 2, 2019 is also the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, who championed sanitation as a national priority.

Over the last four years, India has made great progress, building more than 86 million toilets for households, and declaring nearly half a million (470,000) villages free of open defecation.

Singapore has travelled this journey too. Since independence, we have worked hard to create a clean and green living environment for our people.

In the early days, many homes were not sewered. ""Nightsoil"" was collected in buckets, and transported by malodorous trucks to sewerage plants. Often the human waste was dumped into nearby streams and rivers, polluting and poisoning the waters. Unsanitary living conditions created many public health problems, including frequent outbreaks of waterborne diseases.

Our founding fathers resolved to act decisively. They launched a national campaign to ""Keep Singapore Clean"". We sewered up every home, cleaned up our rivers, and made Singapore a clean and green city. In particular, we cleaned up the Singapore River.

In the process we had to clear thousands of squatters, backyard industries, pig farms, and countless other sources of pollution in the catchment of the river. Today, a clean Singapore River flows through the city into Marina Reservoir, which feeds into our national water supply.

India is a country on a vastly different scale from Singapore. The River Ganga is almost a thousand times longer than the Singapore River. Yet there are some parallels in Singapore's and India's sanitation journeys.

First, both countries' experiences demonstrate the importance of vision and leadership. The late Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and Prime Minister Modi both made it a priority to keep the country clean and green. They personally led public campaigns to raise awareness and mobilise the masses. Both picked up brooms, and joined the people to clean the streets.

Prime Minister Modi has said that Mr Lee was a ""personal inspiration"", and that he had drawn from Mr Lee's idea that ""transformation of a nation begins with a change in the way we are"". Indeed, the Swachh Bharat Mission is not just a programme to clean India's environment, but a deeper reform to ""transform the way we think, live and work"".

Second, success requires long-term national commitment. Singapore implemented a Sewerage Master Plan to separate our sewerage and drainage networks. The aim was to prevent rainwater from being contaminated, so that it could be collected and used. At the same time, Singapore recycles used water from sewage treatment plants, purifying it through reverse osmosis, to produce Newater, an ultra-clean, high-grade water fit for drinking.

We took one problem: what to do with used water, and turned it into a solution to another problem: water scarcity.

In India, the nationwide push to implement the Swachh Bharat Mission with key stakeholders, such as industry and schools, has shown promising results. The ""2018 Unicef Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene in Schools: Global Baseline Report"" highlighted that almost all schools in India have sanitation facilities built, compared to just 50 per cent of schools in 2006.

Third, both Singapore and India value international cooperation. The same solution may not work in a different country, but we can all benefit by learning from others and sharing experiences.

I congratulate India on successfully hosting the inaugural Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention, which has brought together leaders, practitioners and experts from around the world to share their sanitation stories. Singapore too hosts international forums such as the biennial World Cities Summit and Singapore International Water Week.

In 2013, to raise awareness of the global sanitation challenge, the United Nations adopted Singapore's resolution ""Sanitation for All"", to commemorate Nov 19 as World Toilet Day.

Singapore is happy to share experiences with India as it continues to develop more liveable and sustainable Smart Cities across the country. Singapore has collaborated with India's Town and Country Planning Organisation to train a hundred officials in urban planning, and water and waste management. Singapore also looks forward to cooperating with states like Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra to provide urban solutions as they develop their cities.

I wish Prime Minister Modi and the people of India the very best in the Swachh Bharat Mission to ""Clean India"". I also look forward to further cooperation between our two countries to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goal of clean water and sanitation for our peoples for generations to come.

With nearly 79,000 displaced by disaster, temporary shelter also a priority

For survivors of the September earthquake and tsunami on Sulawesi Island, which has killed more than 2,000 people, the struggle to find clean water and shelter continues for the 78,994 people displaced by the disaster.

One of them is Mas’ad, who was in her home with her three children when the first earthquake hit. “We ran away from the house. When the tremor hit for the second time, it broke my house,” she says. “Thankfully, my three children survived.”

Mas’ad, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, says she is living with relatives in Dampal village, in Donggala, one of the worst-hit areas, while her husband is working in the nearby city Palu.

“I can’t stand living in these camps,” she says. “There are no toilets, and we must go to the hills to find clean water.”

Mas’ad stands in front of her home, destroyed by the earthquake, with a tarp provided by Oxfam. Photo: Irwan Firdaus/Oxfam

Oxfam and our local partners on Sulawesi are setting up water treatment filters in areas where displaced people are seeking shelter. We are also distributing hygiene kits: buckets for storing clean water as well as soap, toothbrushes and toothpaste, shampoo, soap powder for washing clothes, and diapers. Clean water, and hygiene items are crucial to help avoid the outbreak of water-borne diseases following a disaster that damages water and sanitation systems.

Listiani, 40, says she and her family have been seeking shelter in Balentuma village, along with 319 people. “So far, we have taken water from a nearby river,” she says. “All this time, we have lacked clean water.” Oxfam installed a water treatment system in the village to serve the displaced people there.

Temporary shelter solution

To help people with uninhabitable homes like Mas’ad, Oxfam and our local partners in this area are also distributing 500 tarpaulins they can use for shelter. “I want to set up the tent in front of my house so it could be easier to cook near my home,"" Mas’ad says. She says Oxfam also gave her a sarong, a popular form of clothing in Indonesia.

Oxfam intends to assist half a million people affected by the earthquake and tsunami on Sulawesi in the coming months.

In a forum on Tuesday, ADB Vice President Bambang Susantono said water demand in the Asia-Pacific region could rise by over 50 percent by 2050, a trend which could be fueled by the growth of megacities.

Susantono estimated that Asia and the Pacific requires $800 billion in investment over the 2016 to 2030 period in water and sanitation infrastructure alone.

“Investments are desperately needed. The ADB estimates Asia and the Pacific requires $800 billion in investment over the period 2016-2030 in water and sanitation infrastructure alone,” Susantono said.

“The ADB’s sovereign water portfolio is growing to an estimated $5 billion a year by 2020. But taking it all together with other donors’ financing, much work is still required to fill the financing gap, including crowding in the private investment,” he added. Susantono said water insecurity costs the global economy $500 billion annually with a total drag of 1 percent or more of the global GDP.

ADB President Takehiko Nakao added that in 2016, disaster-related losses in Asia amounted to $87 billion, of which 25 percent was connected to flooding.

Over the past 20 years, Nakao said, Asia has incurred half of the estimated global economic cost of water-related disasters.

“About 300 million people in the Asia and Pacific region do not have improved access to water and 1.7 billion lack access to basic sanitation,” said Nakao. “Innovations and new technologies provide the means to help ADB developing member countries advance their water management, including river basin management, flood control and water pollution; and service delivery such as water supply, sanitation and irrigation.”

The ADB said in its recently approved Strategy 2030 the importance of water was highlighted in the context of climate change, disaster resilience, the water-food-energy nexus, rural development and food security, and livable cities.

The Manila-based multilateral also said water projects, based on Strategy 2030, have been using the latest technologies and innovations to improve development impact.

The ADB is now using satellite remote sensing to quantify agriculture productivity improvement and guide investments in the irrigation sector.

It is also doing substantial work to crowd in private finance and leverage domestic finance, which is another important element of Strategy 2030.

In order to discuss water and the options that can make the region more water secure, over 800 participants gathered at the ADB headquarters in Manila for the opening of the Asia Water Forum 2018, focusing on “Information, Innovation, and Technology.”

The forum—the fifth held at the ADB headquarters since 2002—provides a platform to share knowledge and experiences to help ensure water security for the Asia and Pacific region.

Since its founding in 1966, the ADB has spent a total of $45.88 billion on water projects. The ADB’s active water sector operations amount to nearly $14 billion and this is growing—another $14 billion in investments is planned between now and 2020.

The ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 67 members—48 from the region. In 2017 the ADB operations totaled $32.2 billion, including $11.9 billion in cofinancing.","AT least 3.4 billion people could face water insecurity by 2050 due to an increase in demand for clean water supply, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has warned.

EWN revealed on Wednesday that the costly Giyani Bulk water project, which was meant to supply 55 villages in the area with water, is now in limbo.

The cash-strapped Department of Water and Sanitation was holding back the completion of the project with Limpopo based construction company Khato Civils having to retrench nearly 1,000 workers earlier this month due to the department’s failure to pay up.

The project was launched by former President Jacob Zuma in 2014 with the aim of addressing water shortages in Giyani.

This multi-billion rand project has only supplied five out of the 55 villages with water over the last four years.

This Giyani resident has told EWN that after all that money and time, they still don’t have access to water.

“If you can go around all the villages of Giyani, you won’t believe that people are still using wheelbarrows to travel long distances to fetch water.”

He says it saddens them as the Giyani community that there are no repercussions for those failing to deliver on promises.

“No one cares, what are the end results?”

One of the community members and a former employee at the Giyani Water Bulk project told EWN they’re considering taking to the streets to force government to pay the remaining money to Khato Civils so they can go back to work and the project can be completed.

UB Engineers Without Borders works to bring clean water to Nicaraguan community

By JANE STOYLE WELCH and EMILY SUGARMAN

“I believe what is special about EWB (Engineers Without Borders) is that even though we work on a project utilizing our skills like other engineering clubs, we are not just working on this project for a competition; we are actually going to impact the lives of over 250 people by providing them with clean drinking water. ”

“It was the most beautiful place I have ever been to. From the top of the hills, we could see miles and miles of mountains, trees and coffee bushes,” says Aaron Chaney, secretary of UB Engineers Without Borders (EWB) and a student in the Department of Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering (CSEE).

Chaney is referring to La Laguna, a community in the central highlands of the Department of Matagalpa in Nicaragua. Located 22 miles from the nearest infrastructural municipalities, the community formed a five-year partnership with UB’s chapter of Engineers Without Borders – USA to work together to provide clean drinking water to La Laguna.

In January, five of the club’s members — Chaney and fellow CSEE students Carlos Abreu and Evan Supple, mechanical engineering students Gavin Amos and Scott Scheers — and UB alumna Rosaleen Nogle (MS ’07, BS ’05, Civil Engineering, and BA Anthropology ’05), an assistant principal engineer with the Buffalo Sewer Authority, traveled to La Laguna to visit their partner community for the first time and evaluate the situation.

Once there, they discovered they would face some unexpected challenges.

“The team observed that there were about 50 homes. They were not clustered together in a typical village, but rather spread over almost nine square miles of rainforest, mountains and quick sand connected only by dirt walking paths. The village had over 250 residents and over two-thirds of the children were sickened annually by contaminated drinking water,” Nogle says.

The team conducted an initial assessment to better understand how to design an effective and sustainable solution to La Laguna’s water issue. Team members tested the water source for bacteria and heavy metals to determine the type of filter to use, measured elevation changes so they could design a distribution system and determined the type of piping to use.

Another constraint was that they had to use materials that were readily available so the villagers could maintain the system and fix any future damage themselves.

“The biggest thing that caught my attention was that the people lived without all the technology and advancements that we have here in the U.S.,” Abreu says. “I’ve learned how much I’ve taken for granted. The atmosphere is much more relaxed, which probably contributes to a healthier mind and soul.”

None of the community members were proficient in English, and Abreu was the only EWB member fluent in Spanish, so in addition to cultural differences, miscommunication was a potential issue. But the team overcame communication challenges with creativity and patience.

“By the end of the week, the participants had learned some of each other’s languages and we all learned valuable lessons regarding non-verbal communication and the necessity of observation in order to design, construct and maintain an engineering project,” Nogle says.

She was inspired to participate in the project by an interest in serving disadvantaged communities and in helping develop future engineers. She has worked to address issues of inadequate access to proper sanitation and drinking water in the most rural parts of Erie County and in the city of Buffalo through her work for the Erie County Division of Sewerage Management, Erie County Health Department, and now the Buffalo Sewer Authority.

“Over and over again, I have heard criticism directed toward engineers that they don’t respect the expertise of end users; that engineers design infrastructure that is not constructible or that once constructed is not usable. In being offered the opportunity to work with these engineering students, I saw a way to help remedy this situation moving forward,” Nogle says.

Back in Buffalo, the team is continuing to work on the design of the system. The project is multi-dimensional, and requires a variety of skillsets and specialized knowledge.

“I am a biomedical engineering major,” says past EWB president Erin Maloney, “whereas other members of the club are environmental, civil and mechanical engineers, and computer science majors. Each person brings a different perspective to the venture. This kind of collaboration is more similar to the workplace than a typical academic project.”

The club plans to return to La Laguna next spring to work on the project. They plan to install a pipeline and basin system that provides filtration, chlorination and central distribution — sourced from a year-round flowing mountain stream that is dammed approximately half a mile from the center of La Laguna.

“I believe what is special about EWB is that even though we work on a project utilizing our skills like other engineering clubs, we are not just working on this project for a competition; we are actually going to impact the lives of over 250 people by providing them with clean drinking water,” Maloney says.","Chaney is referring to La Laguna, a community in the central highlands of the Department of Matagalpa in Nicaragua.

This was said by City of Windhoek Councillor Loide Kaiyamo who delivered a statement at the late commemoration of global hand washing day at Goreangab informal settlement yesterday. Worldwide, the event was commemorated on Monday, October 15.

In her remarks she said the health and hygiene promotion campaigns should focus on promoting hand washing with clean water and soap.

“Unfortunately, despite interventions being put in place to contain the outbreak, the cases of hepatitis E are still increasing,” noted Kaiyamo.

The Ministry of Health and Social Services declared an outbreak of hepatitis E on December 14 last year.

To date, there are 3,630 cases of hepatitis E virus in seven of the country’s 14 regions. And so far, 31 deaths have been reported, of which 14 are maternal deaths.

The event also coincided with the health and hygiene promotion month, which was equally observed at the occasion.

The City of Windhoek, the United Nations’ Children Fund (UNICEF), the Namibia Red Cross Society and other stakeholders gathered to speak on the importance of hand washing.

Kaiyamo said the commemoration was to re-emphasise the importance of washing hands with clean water and soap as the primary and most effective barrier to preventing diseases among communities.

“Clean hands – a recipe for health,” was the theme for the event.

“This theme reminds us to make hand washing a part of every meal and at all times to wash with clean water and soap at critical times, especially before eating, cooking and after visiting the toilet,” she said.","WINDHOEK - There is need to intensify the provision of essential municipal services such as water and sanitation in order to contain the hepatitis E outbreak as more people are being infected by the disease.

Wastewater treatment—or the safe disposal of human fecal waste—is an important part of contemporary infrastructure and critical to ensuring the health of populations. When infrastructure does not meet the needs of the population, policymakers refer to this as a “gap” in the infrastructure. A “gap” implies a lack of coverage, or a physical breakage. Solutions are focused on closing or fixing the gap between covered and uncovered areas, between one piped system and the next.

In India and many other countries, wastewater infrastructure is a complex constellation of approaches, priorities, and elements that display multiple levels of success and failure. In addition to pipes, bioreactors and other treatment facilities, open or underground earthen drains carry untreated sewage to surface waters and render living spaces dangerous and unhealthy. Caste discriminations direct who carries out the dangerous and stigmatizing labor involved with cleaning up fecal waste and transporting and disposing of this waste when infrastructure systems are broken or non-existent. To create safer facilities, wastewater flows require scientific and systematic measurement, institutional coordination to ensure connectivity among components, and engineering innovations, especially in crowded urban spaces. These conditions mean that infrastructure is more than a physical or material problem, conceived in terms of presence or absence. Infrastructures are dynamic systems with social, political, and cultural elements that create a patchwork of projects and priorities. A review in WIREs Water considers infrastructure disarray as a more appropriate metaphor for the sanitation challenges in India today.

India’s significant sanitation challenges are addressed by a variety of actors. While the government is spearheading the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission) and the Namami Ganga Abhiyan (Clean Ganga Mission), non-state actors and their communities are confronting, reproducing, or grappling with disarray. The review by presents three cases of struggle with infrastructure disarray. One case describes how a religious group, called the Art of Living Foundation, used bioremediation to eliminate the odor and break down the biological oxygen content in a large wastewater drain. Although civil society protest through a series of court actions did shut down the unauthorized bioremediation it was unable to reduce the dangerous toxic wastewater flows in this drain. The second case recounts how a religious and science leader in Varanasi measured the sewage levels in a large drain and pushed officials and experts to think differently about flow, technology and wastewater treatment. Nevertheless, mismatches between flows and new facilities perpetuate disarray. The third case explains why a human rights leader struggles to end the ideologies and practices that force Dalits, the most oppressed of the caste groups in India, to clean up the messes created out of disarray.

Moving away from the notion of “infrastructure gap”, the concept of disarray points to the range of engagements, successes, innovations, challenges, and failures in living with wastewater.

dfcu Bank’s Head of Marketing, Jude Kansiime handed over the cheque to the Prime Minister of Obwa Kyabazinga bwa Busoga, Dr. Joseph Muvawala at his offices on Thursday 11th October 2018.

Speaking during the handover, Jude Kansiime, reiterated dfcu’s commitment towards positively impacting the lives of communities in and around the bank’s business operations.

“Access to clean and safe water is a key driver for adequate sanitation and hygiene which not only enhances good health, early childhood development but also impacts learning performance and productivity. Instead of spending time fetching water, the pupils can focus more on their studies,” said Jude Kansiime.

Corporate social responsibility

dfcu’s Corporate Social Responsibility programme is hinged on number of pillars which include; Child and Maternal Health, Environmental Management, Community Development and Emergency Intervention.

Under these pillars, dfcu Bank supports a number of initiatives with the belief that the wellbeing of the individuals and communities which benefit from them will experience tangible transformation.

According to the Minister for Water and Environment, in Obwa Kyabazinga bwa Busoga Dr. Najib Bateganya Lukooya, while some schools currently have access to an onsite water source or piped water supply, they are still faced with challenges of intermittent supply; high risks of cross-contamination due to poor sanitation and hygiene or use of unsafe water sources, and lack and/or inadequate capacity for rainwater harvesting/safe storage facilities for drinking water.

“dfcu Bank’s contribution will go towards phase I of the project which is focusing on facilitating rain water harvesting and storage during the rainy season for use in the dry season.

The country has long had an obsession with hygiene and cleanliness. And this month marks a big milestone: Founding father and first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew kicked off the Keep Singapore Clean campaign 50 years ago this month.

Cleanliness campaigns were already well-established by that time, but this one was different. It was the first time the government used fines as a method of social control. But Singapore’s economic advance seemed to short-circuit its initial success. By any measure, Singapore is clean. But not for the reasons you might think.

Clean and Green

If you’ve ever walked in the same direction as a rubbish truck as it idles up the street on its daily collection here in Singapore, you immediately understand why the city is cleaned so relentlessly. The dumpster perfume really slaps you in the face.

In cities with a cooler climate, it’s probably okay to go a little longer between household collections. But in the hot, humid tropics, it’s an urgent task. Lingering household and commercial waste can be downright dangerous

“If you have littering like you see in other countries, it can breed rodents, flies, cockroaches. They are all carriers of bacteria and germs,” said Edward D’Silva, chairman of the Public Hygiene Council. Mosquitoes are an even bigger worry. You won’t get malaria here, but in a bad year, there’ll be tens of thousands of cases of dengue.

Clean and Green

When he introduced the Clean and Green policy, Lee Kuan Yew had loftier goals in mind. It was part of a larger push that included changes to public health laws, the relocation of street vendors into hawker centres, the development of proper sewage systems and disease control measures. At the same time, the population moved from Kampongs (Malay-style villages with wooden huts) into housing estates with better infrastructure.

“We have built, we have progressed. But no other hallmark of success will be more distinctive than that of achieving our position as the cleanest and greenest city in South Asia,” he said in 1968.

In addition to adverts, there were public education activities, lectures by health officials and spot checks by the government. There were also competitions which highlighted both the cleanest and the dirtiest offices, shops, factories, government buildings, schools and public vehicles.","And this month marks a big milestone: Founding father and first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew kicked off the Keep Singapore Clean campaign 50 years ago this month.

The first major study of water pollution within the past few decades has found that the Clean Water Act (CWA) of 1972 succeeded in substantially reducing water pollution.

According to research conducted by a team of scientists from both Iowa State University and UC Berkeley, the CWA managed to improve water quality across at least 240,000 different sites throughout the United States.

Quantifying The Impact Of The Clean Water Act

US citizens remain worried about the quality of water, as Gallup polls suggest the primary environmental concern of Americans is water pollution, above even the effects of climate change and air pollution. The Clean Water Act was passed in 1972 to impose a system of regulations on companies, industries, and individuals that pollute waterways, often by dumping waste in rivers or lakes.

The Clean Water Act has been responsible for the approval of over $650 billion in grants provided by the federal government to various cities and states in order to facilitate the treatment of sewage, by creating new sewage treatment plants or upgrading currently existing plants.

While the Clean Water Act has driven the creation of many wastewater treatment projects, attempts to quantify the impact the act has had on water quality have been difficult, primarily due to the many different databases maintained by local agencies around the country. To get past the issue of fragmented data sources, the research team compiled data originating from three different national repositories of water data. In addition to this, the team identified the location and date of every municipal water treatment grant.

The team of scientists analyzed data from approximately 240,000 sites across the United States, collected over the course of 39 years from 1962 to 2001. Out of the 25 different measures used to track pollution, almost all of them displayed notable improvement since the act was created. Examples of better waterway health include decreased fecal coliform bacteria levels and increases in dissolved oxygen concentrations. Around 12% of rivers have become safe for fishing in the years between 1972 to 2001.

Not only was there a general decrease in the pollution of water, the analysis conducted by the research team also implies that the water quality of areas downstream from sewage treatment plants experienced a significant improvement after a municipality was given a grant to improve its treatment of wastewater. The researchers also concluded that it costs approximately $1.5 million to keep an area of the river in fishable quality for one year.

The Cost-Benefit Balance

Despite these findings, a variety of economic analyses have estimated that the benefits associated with the CWA are mainly outweighed by the costs of the program. The researchers looked at 20 different economic analyses to discover the conclusions of their cost-benefit analyses. What’s interesting is that when compared with the impacts of other environmental protection acts like the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act apparently has a greater cost compared to benefits while other acts have greater benefits compared to costs.

Joseph Shapiro, one of the researchers and associate professor of resource economics and agriculture at the College of Natural Resources UC Berkeley, explains the research team was shocked to find that the benefits found for the program were so low in comparison to the stated costs, especially when considering the evidence that water pollution has dramatically declined over the decades the CWA has been enforced.

The research team suggests that many of the economic analyses done on the Clean Water Act could be failing to account for certain benefits like fewer industrial chemicals in waterways (chemicals that are not currently included in the testing of water quality) and better public health due to cleaner water.

Benefits Unaccounted For

There are multiple ways of assessing the cost-benefit ratio of a policy. Aggregating all the monetary costs and benefits of a policy is one way to evaluate it, but it is also important to evaluate nonmonetary costs and benefits. Nonmonetary benefits and costs are not always immediately apparent. For instance, the cost of a policy such as the Clean Water Act would not only include direct investments into wastewater treatment programs, it would also include indirect investments made by industries and companies during their attempts to improve wastewater treatment and management. Indirect benefits may include increases in housing prices within a treated region or a decreased amount of travel needed to find a suitable swimming or fishing spot.

The research team did their own analysis of the cost-benefit ratio for the Clean Water Act and then combined their results with the results of 19 other analyses done by the EPA and hydrologists. According to the researchers, the economic benefit of the legislation was a little less than half of the costs incurred by the project. However, Shapiro is suspicious that these analyses may not tell the whole story behind the effects of the CWA. Shapiro explains:

Many of these studies count little or no benefit of cleaning up rivers, lakes, and streams for human health because they assume that if we drink the water, it goes through a separate purification process, and no matter how dirty the water in the river is, it’s not going to affect people’s health. The recent controversy in Flint, MI, recently seems contrary to that view.

Shapiro goes on to say that other uncounted benefits to waste treatment are the thousands of chemicals that go untested for in water. Currently, water treatment plants only test for the presence of a few hundred different chemicals, yet industries located in the US produce around 70,000 different chemicals, meaning it is quite possible that the current studies aren’t tracking the presence of many chemicals being reduced by the CWA.

Shapiro says that even if the economic costs did outweigh the economic benefits, Americans shouldn’t be too quick to give up on the Clean Water Act or a desire for clean water generally. Shapiro says that there are many different ways to enhance the quality of water, and while some of the methods used to improve water quality may be an excellent investment, others may not be. Therefore, it is possible for the Clean Water Act to both be a valuable and important project overall and that some of its methods may fail a cost-benefit test.","Photo: LubosHouska via Pixabay, CC0 Photo: LubosHouska via Pixabay, CC0The first major study of water pollution within the past few decades has found that the Clean Water Act (CWA) of 1972 succeeded in substantially reducing water pollution.

Fittingly, October 2, 2019 is also the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, who championed sanitation as a national priority. Over the last four years, India has made great progress, building more than 86 million toilets for households, and declaring nearly half a million (4,70,000) villages free of open defecation.

Singapore has travelled this journey too. Since independence, we have worked hard to create a clean and green living environment for our people. In the early days, many homes were not sewered. “Nightsoil” was collected in buckets, and transported by malodorous trucks to sewerage plants. Often the human waste was dumped into nearby streams and rivers, polluting and poisoning the waters. Unsanitary living conditions created many public health problems, including frequent outbreaks of water-borne diseases.

Our founding fathers resolved to act decisively. They launched a national campaign to “Keep Singapore Clean”. We sewered up every home, cleaned up our rivers, and made Singapore a clean and green city. In particular, we cleaned up the Singapore River. In the process we had to clear thousands of squatters, backyard industries, pig farms, and countless other sources of pollution in the catchment of the river. Today, a clean Singapore River flows through the city into Marina Reservoir, which feeds into our national water supply.

India is a country on a vastly different scale from Singapore. The River Ganga is almost a thousand times longer than the Singapore River. Yet there are some parallels in Singapore’s and India’s sanitation journeys.

First, both countries’ experiences demonstrate the importance of vision and leadership. The late Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and Prime Minister Modi both made it a priority to keep the country clean and green. They personally led public campaigns to raise awareness and mobilise the masses. Both picked up brooms, and joined the people to clean the streets. Prime Minister Modi has said that Mr Lee was a “personal inspiration”, and that he had drawn from Mr Lee’s idea that “transformation of a nation begins with a change in the way we are”. Indeed, the Swachh Bharat Mission is not just a programme to clean India’s environment, but a deeper reform to “transform the way we think, live and work”.

Second, success requires long-term national commitment. Singapore implemented a Sewerage Master Plan to separate our sewerage and drainage networks. The aim was to prevent rainwater from being contaminated, so that it could be collected and used. At the same time, Singapore recycles used water from sewage treatment plants, purifying it through reverse osmosis, to produce NEWater, an ultra-clean, high-grade water fit for drinking. We took one problem: what to do with used water, and turned it into a solution to another problem: water scarcity.

In India, the nationwide push to implement the Swachh Bharat Mission with key stakeholders, such as industry and schools, has shown promising results.

The “2018 UNICEF Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene in Schools: Global Baseline Report” highlighted that almost all schools in India have sanitation facilities built, compared to just 50 per cent of schools in 2006.

Third, both Singapore and India value international cooperation. The same solution may not work in a different country, but we can all benefit by learning from others and sharing experiences.

I congratulate India on successfully hosting the inaugural Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention, which has brought together leaders, practitioners, and experts from around the world to share their sanitation stories. Singapore too hosts international forums such as the biennial World Cities Summit and Singapore International Water Week. In 2013, to raise awareness of the global sanitation challenge, the UN adopted Singapore’s resolution “Sanitation for All’, to commemorate November 19 as World Toilet Day.

Singapore is happy to share experiences with India as it continues to develop more liveable and sustainable Smart Cities across the country. Singapore has collaborated with India’s Town and Country Planning Organisation to train a hundred officials in urban planning, and water and waste management.

Singapore also looks forward to cooperating with States like Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra to provide urban solutions as they develop their cities.

I wish Prime Minister Modi and the People of India the very best in the Swachh Bharat Mission to “Clean India”. I also look forward to further cooperation between our two countries to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goal of clean water and sanitation for our peoples for generations to come.

A new 5,000 cubic metre earth dam near Yombays Village in the Nugaal area of Puntland, Northern Somalia, will bring clean, safe water to over 5,000 people in the area, of which over 4,000 people are from nomadic pastoralist communities. The dam was built by the Puntland Ministry of Environment and Climate Change in collaboration with Yombays Village, with the support of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and with funding from Global Environment Facility.

Recurrent drought has devastated communities across Puntland, with a prolonged drought from 2016 to 2017 destroying livestock populations and forcing thousands to migrate. The Yombays area has been highlighted as one of the areas most affected by drought, and existing small water structures in the area, called berkedes in Somali, are unable to store sufficient water for the surrounding pastoral and rural communities.

The earth dam, so called because they are built using earth materials and local clay to improve sustainability and stability, was handed over to the Yombays community in early October for their management.

Speaking at the handover of the facility, the Minister of Environment & Climate Change, Hon. Saleban Haji Abdulle, said the earth dam was a cost-effective way to store water and manage environmental resources. “Because of climate change, drought is recurring at a faster rate and with more severity than before. Land degradation and desertification are a result of human consumption, we are not using the environment in a sustainable way. Therefore, we need to use techniques such as this one to protect and conserve the environment and prepare a better future for the coming generations,” he said.

Mr Sayed Sahibzada, Head of UNDP Area Office for Puntland, congratulated the Ministry and Yombays village committee for their success in completing the dam. “The dam is one of a series of dams and water structures UNDP is supporting the Puntland government and communities to build. UNDP is committed to working with government partners and Somali people to build resilience to drought through projects such as this one,” he said.

The UNDP Climate Change Resilience programme has supported the construction and repair of 5 earth and 3 sand dams and repaired over 30 berkedes in Puntland in 2017 and 2018, with funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF). UNDP continues to work with vulnerable communities across Puntland to improve access to water, address deforestation and desertification, and build long term resilience to climate change.

Globally, about 55 out of 1000 children cannot make it to their 5th birthday and diarrhoea is one of the main causes. About 70 per cent of cases of diarrhoea could be associated with poor food hygiene which can be easily addressed with proper hygiene practices including handwashing with soap. Diarrhoea also contributes to undernutrition among children. In Afghanistan, nearly 41% of children under the age of five years suffer from a chronic form of malnutrition called stunting. Studies indicate that handwashing with soap, can reduce stunting by 15 per cent and prevent diarrheal disease by up to 48 percent, and is considered as one of the most cost effective and simple public health interventions.

In an event held today at the Malika Suraya High School in Kabul as part of this year’s commemoration, Government officials, teachers, parents and communities across the country, made the call to ‘wash hands with soap’ during the critical period; after using the toilet, cleaning a baby, before handling food and before feeding children.

Dr. Mohammad Ibrahim Shinwari, the deputy minister of general education stated, “Handwashing is a crucial behaviour for students. It not only prevents them from disease but they can adopt the behaviour and serve as agents of change for other family members and communities’.

Young girls aged 10-16 years joined representatives of the Ministries of Education, Public Health, Rural Rehabilitation and Development, Hajj and Islamic Affairs and UNICEF at a handwashing with soap demonstrative exercise, to raise awareness about the importance and simplicity of this life-saving action.

‘According to the Health Management Information System, over three million cases of diarrhoea among under five children were reported in 2017”, states Dr. Mamosai Zewar, Deputy Minister of Public Health,” Handwashing is not only important for the prevention of diarrhoea and stunting but it is also linked with the prevention of Polio, emphasized Zewar.

Studies have shown that more than 40 per cent of diarrhoeal diseases among school children is contracted in schools’ environment due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions. Use of sanitation facilities and handwashing with soap can significantly protect children from diarrhoea.

“The very simple act of habitual handwashing with soap can save many lives. Halting the spread of diarrhoeal disease is not complicated or costly, it is just vital that handwashing with soap becomes a normal routine for everyone, adults and children alike. Handwashing with soap is one of the most cost effective and reliable low-cost ‘vaccines’ that can prevent communicable diseases, says. Adele Khodr UNICEF Representative in Afghanistan

The initiative seeks to invest in integrated and appropriate WASH solutions focusing on improving access to reliable, clean and safe water supply to promote total sanitation, hygienic environment, and healthy-productive children in public primary schools of Busoga.

dfcu Bank’s Head of Marketing, Jude Kansiime handed over the cheque to the Prime Minister of Obwa Kyabazinga bwa Busoga, Dr. Joseph Muvawala at his offices on Thursday 11th October 2018.

Speaking during the handover, Jude Kansiime, reiterated dfcu’s commitment towards positively impacting the lives of various communities in and around the bank’s business operations.

“Access to clean and safe water is a key driver for adequate sanitation and hygiene which not only enhances good health, early childhood development but also impacts learning performance and productivity.

Instead of spending time fetching water, the pupils can focus more on their studies,” said Jude Kansiime.

dfcu’s Corporate Social Responsibility program is hinged on number of pillars which include; Child and Maternal Health, Environmental Management, Community Development and Emergency Intervention.

Under these pillars, dfcu Bank supports a number of initiatives with the belief that the well-being of the individuals and communities which benefit from them will experience tangible transformation.

According to the Minister for Water and Environment, in Obwa Kyabazinga bwa Busoga Najib Bateganya Lukooya, while some schools currently have access to an onsite water source or piped water supply, they are still faced with challenges of intermittent supply; high risks of cross-contamination due to poor sanitation and hygiene or use of unsafe water sources, and lack and/or inadequate capacity for rainwater harvesting/safe storage facilities for drinking water.

“dfcu Bank’s contribution will go towards phase one of the project which is focusing on facilitating rain water harvesting and storage during the rainy season for use in the dry season.

“Our target is to serve 110 public primary schools which is equivalent to over 70,000 children as direct beneficiaries,” he added.

Busoga has a water stressed belt, which easily dries up during dry seasons and people along this belt have limited access to clean and safe water.","At least 4,000 children in Busoga region will have access to reliable, clean and safe water in the coming months following dfcu Bank’s announcement of a contribution of shs 20 million (twenty million Uganda shillings) towards a Clean Water initiative by the Obwa Kyabazinga bwa Busoga.

Tripathi is a seer and the national coordinator of Kanpur-based Ma Ganga Pradushan Mukti Abhiyan Samiti, an outfit led by Swami Harchetan. When he started sprinkling the “holy water ” on the officials, the police was called and he was forced to leave the premises. Tripathi says he did this only to debunk the claims of officials that river-cleaning operations were yielding results. “Why did they stop me from sprinkling holy water,” he asks. His organisation is now going to launch a movement to boycott bathing in the Ganga in the next Kumbh Mela, which begins on January 15, 2019. After three decades of efforts to clean the national river, it is a sad state of affairs that the river is not even fit for bathing. According to a map of Ganga river water quality presented by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to National Green Tribunal (NGT) in August 2018, only five out of 70-odd monitoring stations had water that was fit for drinking and seven for bathing (see ‘The filthy stem’,).



Initiatives to clean the Ganga began with the Ganga Action Plan I in 1986. Till 2014, over Rs 4,000 crore had been spent. But the river has remained dirty. So when the National Democratic Alliance government launched the Namami Gange in mid-May 2015, there was a new hope. It was the biggest-ever initiative—over Rs 20,000 crore was allotted. Prime Minister Narendra Modi made it his personal agenda and set a deadline: “Ganga will be clean by 2019”, it has now been extended to 2020.



Namami Gange is being implemented by the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), and its state counterparts—State Programme Management Groups. NMCG would establish field offices wherever necessary. The National Ganga Council (NGC) was created.

And to give it utmost importance the Prime Minister was made the head of it. This council replaced the National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA). NGC would have on board the chief ministers of five Ganga basin states—Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh (UP), Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal—besides several Union ministers and it was supposed to meet once every year.



The Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Ministry signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOUS) with 10 other ministries to synergise the activities under the Namami Gange. The government said it would involve grassroots level institutions such as urban local bodies and panchayati raj institutions to implement the programme.



An Empowered Task Force, headed by Union Water Resources Minister, was created and it has on board the chief secretaries of the five Ganga Basin states. It was supposed to meet once in every three months. State Ganga Committees have been formed, which would be the nodal agency to implement the programmes in a state. Besides, these committees would conduct safety audits of the river and take remedial measures.





The Centre had also said it would establish a 4-battalion Ganga EcoTask Force to spread awareness about pollution and protecting the river. The government is contemplating a legislation to arrest and fine those found flouting norms. The government also tasked seven Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) to prepare a report on the best strategies to clean up the river. IITs batted for a Ganga basin approach, which meant not only cleaning the Ganga, but its tributaries as well. The report, Ganga Rejuvenation Basin Management Programme (GRBMP), submitted in March 2015, says that instead of establishing a few projects on the stretch of the Ganga, the whole river basin—that is all the states coming under the main stem of Ganga and its tributaries—must come under the ambit of the programme.



The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), in its report in December last year, said, “The NMCG neither circulated GRBMP to different ministries/departments for consultation and seeking their opinion, nor finalised the GRBMP for initiating the long-term intervention on the Ganga.” The document on NMCG website which talks about the towns under consideration for pollution abatement belong to five states on the main Ganga stem—Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal—and not the ones which lie on the tributaries of the Ganga. Cleaning of the Ganga needs a strategy where the NGC has to find effective solutions to the challenges that the previous programmes have failed to address. This would entail addressing untreated waste that flows into the river, restoring the flow of the river, sludge management in Ganga basin towns, cost overruns in execution of projects and governance glitches.



Challenge I: Sewage treatment



Sewage treatment plants (STPs) have been at the centre of Ganga pollution abatement. As per Namami Gange targets, STPs with over 2,000 million litres a day (MLD) capacity had to be rehabilitated of which only 328 MLD have been done. A look at the status of all the projects undertaken makes one doubt whether the government would even achieve its revised deadline. As far as sewage infrastructure projects are concerned, 68 projects were sanctioned after the Namami Gange was approved by the cabinet and only six were completed till August. Till August 31, 2018 a total of 236 projects, including STPS, had been sanctioned out of which only 63 had been completed.

The government has said that the new projects are delayed because land acquisition and other related activities were taking a lot of time. However, poor performance in rehabilitating old STPs does not stand the test of time scarcity.

The issue is just not with the construction or rehabilitation of STPs but also their performance. Every STP installed has design parameters for Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Total Suspended Solids (TSS). Consider the STP at Kanpur, which holds the dubious distinction of being home to the “most polluted stretch” of the Ganga. The 5 MLD domestic waste water treatment plant at Jajmau in Kanpur had BOD and TSS level in effluents as 65 mg/litre (against design parameter of 30) and 92 mg/litre (against design parameter of 50), according to the April-May 2018 report of Kanpur Jal Nigam. The report says that BOD and TSS levels of the effluent is higher than the norms because industrial waste and chemicals are illegally mixed with the influents in a plant not meant to treat industrial pollutants.



Another problem with STPs is that they are not able to get the total amount of influents, primarily due to lack of sewerage network in the city. A total network of 2,071 km of new sewer line projects was sanctioned after Namami Gange came into being but only 66.85 km has been laid. The STP that treats domestic waste water in Kanpur’s Jajmau has a capacity of 130 MLD but its April-March average was only 60.5 MLD. According to NMCG, all the existing plants in Kanpur have a capacity of 414 MLD but are getting only 230 MLD as influents.



For any city, STPs are being designed according to their sewage generation. The problem lies in the way sewage generation is estimated. “The estimation of sewage generation is based on the assumption that 80 per cent of the water supplied is returned as waste water. Some recent data compiled by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) shows that actual measured discharge of waste water into Ganga is 6,087 MLD, 123 per cent higher than the estimated discharge of waste water,” says a paper authored by Raghu Dayal in the Economic and Political Weekly in 2016. V K Mishra, president of Varanasi’s Sankat Mochan Foundation (SMF), reiterates that the very methodology of calculating sewage generation is faulty. SMF was given the task of constructing an STP of 35 MLD near Assi Ghat at Varanasi in 2010. Mishra, who is also a professor in IIT-BHU, says, “We carried out a three-day schedule for the Assi drain and to our utter surprise we found that the discharge was 63.5 MLD. That was way back in 2010.” Mishra says that when the entire city is not having piped water supply, how can this become the criteria for calculating sewerage generation? Mishra’s argument also finds support in UP State Annual Action Plan (SAAP) 2017-2020, which says the coverage of piped water supply in Varanasi is less than 60 per cent. In Kanpur and Allahabad it is less than 60 and 40 per cent respectively. Kanpur, Allahabad and Varanasi are considered hot spots of Ganga pollution in the entire stem.



But domestic sewerage is not the only cause of concern. The industry, especially the tanneries in Kanpur’s Jajmau area have several times attracted the wrath of both the Supreme Court and NGT. The government of UP said to NGT on March 30, 2017 that it has, in principle, taken a decision to shift the tanneries from Jajmau to some other place that is under consideration. However, the government was also open to the idea of installing appropriate anti-pollution devices, including a chromium recovery plant. It is mandatory that tanneries treat chromium either through their own small plant or a made in cluster and then transfer the waste to a Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) run by the government. According to submissions made by the UP government in NGT there are three clusters housing tannery industries—Jajmau, Unnao and Banther. Jajmau has the maximum concentration of 400 tannery industries and NGT wrote in its order, “The industries at Jajmau are discharging much more than 9 MLD industrial effluents, mainly containing chromium. There is no enforcement of consent conditions by Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board which requires all industries to send their chrome liquor to the Chrome Recovery Plant and pay for the treatment. Industries are finding it easy to dispose their entire waste, including the chrome liquor, in the common drain which carries both domestic as well as industrial waste.” NGT’s observations find eerie resonance in the April-May 2018 report of Kanpur Jal Nigam. It says that chromium concentration in tannery effluent is 110.2 mg per litre.



When Down To Earth (DTE) visited the CETP, chromium had formed a separate layer over the waste water and was visible with naked eyes. Against the design parameter of 175 BOD per 100 ml and TSS 200 mg/litre the effluent had the former at 203 mg/litre and the latter at 253 mg/litre. A visit to Jajmau and nearby villages unveils the reality on the ground. There is no board outside any of the four tanneries right on the bank of Ganga in Wajidpur village and they seem to be running almost anonymously. One can see that they are discharging waste into the Ganga. “Outlet pipes throw dust which we inhale every day,” says Chhotu Nishad, a resident, showing his pierced skin. Hair fall, skin infections, heart and lung problems are common in every family DTE spoke to.



Sheikhpur village is located just a few kilometres away from the Jajmau tanneries. Lakshmi Shankar Nishad, a 50-year-old resident, shows his left foot on which skin has almost peeled off. “We are suffering from many more skin infections. This is because tanneries are discharging their waste water directly into drains and the water of drains has mixed with groundwater which has become infected.” Another resident, Sri Krishna says people are becoming impotent in the village and doctors tell them to leave the area. “How can we? Our homes and farms are here,” he says.



Not sensing any progress in controlling pollution, NGT in July last year gave more than 100 specific directions related to 86 drains going into the Ganga, Ramganga, Kali and the Pandu rivers. “The government agencies have submitted compliance report regarding most of the directions. But what I gather from the field is that most of the submissions are coloured,” says M C Mehta, who has been fighting cases on the Ganga in the Supreme Court and NGT.



Besides cleaning the Ganga, the Namami Gange also talks about afforestation as an important activity as it helps groundwater recharge. According to NMCG, it has already spent Rs 114 crore on afforestation but to no avail. Showing the plants being planted, assistant professor in Allahabad University Pramod Sharma says, “They have planted kachnaar and gulmohar plants. They can only be used for decorative purposes. What is required for the Ganga is bargad, peepal, gular and neem as they help in better conservation of water.”



Challenge II: Restoring the flow



There is another fundamental problem that will ensure the holy river remains dirty. A river is a self-purifying system only when water flows through it. The Ganga fails this basic test except during monsoons. So it’s not just about unclean Ganga. It is about the existence of Ganga, experts say. Vijay Dwivedi, an Allahabad-based activist, who has formed a Ganga Sena which takes up cleaning of the river regularly says that in monsoons the water level in Ganga is good enough. “But you should have come in April or May. There is not even knee deep water. People graze cows, learn driving and play cricket on the surface of Ganga.” Gopal Nishad, a boatman at Sangam says, “Even the fish die in summer due to lack of water. People coming to ghats usually don’t go for boat rides in summer and it hits us badly.”



B D Tripathi, in-charge of Banaras Hindu University’s Ganga Research Centre, says, “The water level in the river is going down at an unprecedented rate. Also if the flow in the river is maintained it can solve the problem of 60-80 per cent of organic pollutants and we may not require such an elaborate programme.” He also says that unlike other rivers, the Ganga has three special properties because of the path it treads naturally. “The Ganga has medicinal properties that can treat skin infections. These properties come due to medicinal plants on the path of Ganga. Also the Ganga is very rich in minerals and has bacteriophages which kill the bacteria. If you chain the Ganga with barrages and canal diversions and therefore alter its natural path, it will lose these properties.” He says due to restrictions and decrease in flow, the velocity of water decreases and siltation increases and therefore minerals of the water settle down at the riverbed.



All these surmises get credence in the paper published by IIT-Kharagpur’s Abhijit Mukherjee and others in August 2018 which says that according to their estimates the baseflow amount of the river has decreased by 56 per cent in 2016 as compared to the 1970s. The decrease in flow has led to an increase in groundwater extraction for various uses.



According to a report published by Wildlife Institute of India in May 2018, 16 existing, 14 ongoing and 14 proposed hydroelectric projects on the Bhagirathi and Alaknanda river basins have turned the upper stretch of the Ganga “ecological deserts”. To deal with these projects, A K Gosain, professor at IIT-Delhi and a member of the panel that has drafted the Ganga protection law, says, “The designs of hydroelectric projects can be tweaked in such a manner that they consume less water. It may raise the cost of the projects but should be done for long-term preservation of the Ganga. It is now for the government to decide whether it comes out with such a mandatory policy or not.”



Challenge III: Sludge control



The river has another persitent problem that is going to be more pronounced. “I have a toilet in my home but the two pits under are overflowing with waste. How do I use it?” says Rashid Ali of Chhapri village in Allahabad district. He and his family is back to defecating in the open near the Ganga. Other villagers also narrate similar issues and say the construction of toilets has compounded their problems because the overflowing toilets have also made their homes dirty. The damning indictment is supported by many people living in cities along the banks of the Ganga.



A staggering 99.93 per cent villages lying on the banks of Ganga, also known as Ganga Grams, have been declared open defecation free (ODF) by the government under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM). As per SBM data, more than 2.7 million toilets have been constructed in over 4,000 villages till September 17, 2018. Not surprisingly, CAG in its December 2017 report casts aspersions on the claim. The report said the state government was to verify the ODF status through its own teams or through a third party but 1,144 villages of UP and Bihar didn’t get it done. The whole objective of making villages lying in the Ganga basin to be ODF was to reduce the faecal coliform levels in the Ganga. Against the standard of 2,500 per 100 ml, the faecal coliform ranged from 2,500 to 2,40,000 per 100 ml in the Ganga basin cities in May 2018, as per data provided by pollution control boards of five states along the Ganga basin.



A back-of-the envelope calculation by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a Delhi-based non-profit, showed that about 180 MLD sludge would be generated in five Ganga basin states when they become ODF (see ‘Sludge crisis’,). And if proper faecal sludge management is not in place, it would invariably pollute the Ganga. What should cause further concern is that faecal sludge is a bigger pollutant than sewerage. While the BOD of sewage is 150-300 mg/l, that of faecal sludge would be 15,000-30,000 mg/l.





Experts say that while toilets were constructed, hardly a thought was given to management of sludge. According to a study conducted by CSE, most of the cities surveyed had twin-pit technology which is not recommended in low-lying areas. The National Policy on Faecal Sludge and Septage Management (FSSM) 2017 also anticipated the challenge as more and more toilets are constructed. As urban households without toilets obtain facilities under SBM, it is likely that many will acquire on-site arrangements like pit latrines and septic tanks in cities at locations where sewerage systems are not available. Thus, while the containment of human waste will be largely achieved, its safe disposal still poses a huge challenge.



A sanitation expert who works with an international non-profit in Delhi says, “There has been no management at all. What was required along with construction of toilets was several interventions to manage sludge, which clearly did not happen.” Even septic tanks don’t seem to be working out due to laxity. An International Water Management Institute (IWMI) paper published in January 2017 after studying three Ganga basin cities—Gangaghat, Mugalsarai and Unnao—says, “Most households (up to 97 per cent in Gangaghat) rely on septic tanks, but these are not properly maintained. Septage is collected every 10-15 years, even though collection every three years is the recommended practice for optimal septic tank performance.



Consequently, septic tanks that could potentially remove 60 per cent of suspended solids and 40 per cent of the organic matter from domestic wastewater have almost no treatment capacity.”



The paper highlights another problem. It says that the pollution from the cities flows through a network of small and progressively larger open drains, which eventually flow into the Ganga. None of the three cities has a scheme for management of solid waste, most of which is dumped in the streets, clogging open drains and adding to the pollution load. Only a fraction of this waste is collected by the Nagar Palika Parishads and dumped at the city limits without treatment or recycling. “Officials have come here several times. They go to ghats to survey how the beautification is going on and leave. This drain never catches their attention,” rues Govind Prasad Dikshit, a seer residing in Brahawat ghat near Bithoor.



Challenge IV: Cost overruns



Cleaning up the massive stretch of 2,525 km that the Ganga traverses is a programme where regulating the finances becomes as big an issue as any other. The UP SAAP 2016 says that the Ganga basin towns would require Rs 5,794 crore just for the creation of sewerage networks in the state—more than one-fourth of the entire outlay of Namami Gange.



Another catch is with the finances of STPs. Now the government says that the new STPs are being constructed under Hyper Annuity Model under which the developer has to take care of the maintenance of the project for 15 years. As per this model, 40 per cent of the capital cost quoted would be paid on completion of construction while the remaining 60 per cent will be paid over the life of the project as annuities along with operation and maintenance expenses. This payment is linked to the performance of the STPs—the quality of the water treated by it. The report of the IIT consortium had also pitched for a model whereby the service provider receives remuneration for providing “reusable-quality water over a reasonably long contract period”. So are there enough monitoring machines installed to check the quality of the treated water? Highly-placed sources in NMCG say there aren’t. A detailed questionnaire, including one on this was sent to the Director General, NMCG, Rajiv Ranjan Mishra, but it went unanswered.

The IIT report predicted the cost of treating sewerage to be about 1 paisa per litre at 2010 price levels. However, the cost would escalate due to the fact that deadlines are not met. Many of the projects sanctioned as early as 2011 could not meet their deadlines even after they came under the ambit of Namami Gange. Sample the case of STPs to be built in Varanasi with the assistance of Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). A close look at the development of the project has quite a story to narrate. It was sanctioned on July 14, 2010 at a cost of Rs 496 crore with a deadline for completion in 2017-18, with some parts to be completed in 2016. Documents accessed by DTE reveal that there was absolutely no physical progress of the plant at the end of December 2014, the year in which the Modi government took over, with JICA concurrence for technical bid awaited. The situation was exactly the same by December 2015. STP construction was completed by 34 per cent in December 2016. Then the government issued a revised sanction of the project and pegged the cost at Rs 641.19 crore with a revised deadline of June 2018. That deadline could also not be met and it was revised to October 2018. That is not one odd sample in UP. Bihar has similar cases. A 17 MLD STP was sanctioned in the state’s Begusarai district on March 8, 2010 at a cost of Rs 65 crore. The project is aided by the World Bank. The NMCG documents reveal no progress took place till December 2016, the original deadline. In December 2017, the tender was cancelled. Revised sanction was issued in March 2018 with escalated cost of Rs 230 crore and a deadline of January 2020 and it has now become a project of the Central government.

Besides, CAG also pointed out poor financial management for the programme in its December 2017 report. It said, “Only eight to 63 per cent of the funds were utilised during 2014-15 to 2016-17 for the river clean-up programme.” A corpus of Rs 198.14 crore (as of March 31, 2017) was available in the Clean Ganga Fund. It is a fund under which entities or a commoner can contribute for the Ganga clean up. However, NMCG could not utilise any amount out of the Clean Ganga Fund and the entire amount was lying in banks due to non-finalisation of action plan.



NMCG replied (on August 2017) that after its constitution as an authority and its operationalisation by December 2016, the pace of various projects has accelerated. This is likely to result in achievement of not only physical targets but also higher expenditure progress by the end of 2017-2018. However, NMCG documents reveal that till August 31, 2018 though projects worth Rs 22,323 crore have been sanctioned but total funds utilised were only 23 per cent of it.



The CAG also came down heavily on Centre for spending injudiciously on media blitzkrieg. As per New Advertisement Policy 18 of Directorate of Advertising and Visual Publicity (DAVP), all Central Government Ministries/Departments/Attached and Sub-ordinate Offices/Field Offices are required to route their advertisements through DAVP only. CAG observed that NMCG hired other advertising agencies for releasing print advertisements in leading national newspapers across the country and incurred an expenditure of Rs 2.46 crore, which include Rs 36.06 lakh and Rs 5.23 lakh as agency commission and service tax. This was in violation of government policy and resulted in avoidable payment, the CAG said.



Challenge V: Governance glitches



The cleaning of the Ganga requires seamless coordination between the agencies responsible for carrying out different tasks. This calls for vision and a clear-cut governance strategy. The water resources ministry signed MOUS with 10 ministries for better implementation of Namami Gange. However, till date no detail is available as to how these ministries are functioning for better convergence. Vinod Tare of IIT-Kanpur who helmed the consortium says, “The Ganga Action Plans lacked the coordination of ministries. It is still lacking in Namami Gange. If the departments do not coordinate well, the programme will not achieve desired objectives.” Ganga Mahasabha’s head Swami Jitendran-and Saraswati says, “After the memoranda were signed, nobody knows what they did. I tried enquiring often, but to no avail.”





The draft Ganga protection law is with the government but experts question its utility. “It is immaterial whether you come up with a new law or not. What is required is an autonomous body for the rejuvenation of Ganga which is independent of the government when it comes to its functioning. Instead of bureaucrats, it should consist of experts well-versed with the river,” says environmentalist G D Agrawal, the 86-year-old former IIT-Kanpur professor who is on an indefinite fast to save the Ganga from June 22, 2018.



The gazette notification by the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, issued on October 7, 2016 read: “The NGC shall meet at least once every year or more as it may deem necessary.” A senior official in the ministry confirmed to DTE that not a single meeting of NGC has taken place since then. The lone NGRBA meeting chaired by PM Modi took place on July 4, 2016.



The Empowered Task Force led by Union minister of water resources has met only thrice after the gazette notification while it was supposed to meet once every three months. It has met twice under the chairmanship of the then minister Uma Bharti and once under Nitin Gadkari, who took the charge of the ministry in September 2017. The mandatory exercise of conducting an annual Ganga safety audit has not been done even once.



Also the top post of NMCG is working like musical chairs with seven senior officers appointed since 2014. The first head Rajiv Ranjan Mishra is back at the helm after five changes. A former head told DTE on the condition of anonymity, “Every chief came with his own micro-plannning, the moment those plans would start taking shape there was a transfer. This is one of the prime reasons for the underperformance of NMCG.”



Tare says if the governance is to be improved the programme has to be decentralised. “It is highly centralised as of now with the government sitting at the top deciding what to do. People who are living in the Ganga basin have to be involved to achieve the required results. The programme can’t succeed unless it has a bottom-up approach.”



Almost four years since Modi’s promise of cleaning the Ganga, cities along the river remain highly polluted and data shows that people might be drinking partially-treated sewage. Will Ganga ever be cleaned and is there any deadline possible?



Tare says: “It is not that easy a job that one can give such short deadlines. It may be politically correct to do so but not scientific. In fact, it is an ongoing process and will take many years for which I don’t think any deadline can be given now.”

The Ganga has to be clean by 2020, says the government

But an assessment by Down To Earth magazine says even as the deadline draws near, the river will not run clean – despite river-friendly budgets and politically correct rhetoric

Lucknow, October 30, 2018: Almost four years since Prime Minister Modi promised a clean Ganga, the river continues to run polluted and people living in cities along the river might be drinking what is at best partially treated sewage, not Gangajal: says an assessment of the state of India’s most celebrated and revered river. The government has claimed that Ganga will be clean in 2019 (the deadline has now been extended to 2020). The assessment, done by Down To Earth, a “fortnightly on the politics of development, environment and health” which Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) helps publish, emphatically states that the river will continue to run as – and even more – polluted as ever.

The assessment and the issue of the magazine covering it was released here today at a Media Briefing. Journalists from Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar and West Bengal attended.

Addressing the assembled journalists at the Briefing, Richard Mahapatra, Managing Editor, Down To Earth, said: “The Namami Gange campaign was launched with much fanfare and had aimed high, but it has had little to show in terms of achievement. Till August 31, 2018, only a little more than a quarter of the total number of projects sanctioned under it had been completed.”

The magazine has reproduced a mapping of the Ganga river water quality done by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) – according to this, only five out of the 70-odd monitoring stations on the river had water that was fit for drinking; only seven had water that was fit for bathing.

Why the Ganga will continue to flow polluted

Sewage treatment – falling far short of the targets

Efficient and effective treatment of sewage is at the centre of any clean-up plans for the river. As per the Namami Gange targets, sewage treatment plants (STPs) with over 2,000 million litre a day (MLD) capacity had to be rehabilitated -- of this, a mere 328 MLD have been covered. “A look at the status of all the projects undertaken makes one doubt whether the government would even achieve its revised deadline,” says Mahapatra. Till August 31, 2018 a total of 236 projects including STPs had been sanctioned, out of which only 63 had been completed.

Another area of concern is data on sewage generation. STPs are designed on the basis of the amount of sewage a city generates – but estimations of sewage generation have been found to be inaccurate. Down To Earth quotes a study report and CPCB data to say that the actual measured discharge of wastewater into the Ganga is 123 per cent higher than what has been estimated.

Flow of the river – thinning rapidly

Except during monsoons, water flow in the Ganga has remained a major concern. Experts say the water level in the river is going down at an alarming rate – if the flow in the river can be maintained, it can take care of the problem of 60-80 per cent of organic pollutants in the river. But everything points to a future in which the flow will continue to diminish. Numerous hydroelectric projects on the Bhagirathi and Alaknanda have turned the upper stretches of the Ganga into ecological deserts, says the Down To Earth assessment. The baseflow amount of the river has decreased by a huge 56 per cent in 2016, as compared to the 1970s.

New toilets, new sludge – but where will it all go?

A staggering 99.33 per cent villages on the banks of the Ganga have been declared open defecation free (ODF) by the government under the Swachh Bharat Mission. Millions of toilets have been constructed – 2.7 million in over 4,000 villages. The objective was to reduce the faecal coliform levels in the Ganga. But in May 2018, against the standard of 2,500 per 100 ml, faecal coliform in the river ranged from 2,500 to 2,40,000 per 100 ml!

Simply building new toilets to declare villages ODF is, therefore, not the solution. The analysis by Down To Earth shows that about 180 MLD of sludge will be generated in the five Ganga Basin states (Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal) when they become ODF. If proper sludge management is not done, this would invariably pollute the Ganga. What should cause further concern is that faecal sludge is a bigger pollutant than sewage – while BOD of sewage is 150-300 mg/litre, that of faecal sludge would be 15,000-30,000 mg/litre. The Ganga cannot run clean unless the sludge generated is managed effectively.



Cost overruns and governance glitches

Ganga basin towns would require Rs 5,794 crore just for building sewerage networks in Uttar Pradesh -- reports the analysis – which is more than one-fourth of the entire outlay of Namami Gange. The clean-up programme is dogged by delays, which is leading to tremendous cost escalations. According to the National Mission Clean Ganga, projects worth Rs 22,323 crore have been sanctioned but only 23 per cent of the sanctioned amount had been utilized till April 2018.

To add to the financial mismanagement, there are problems in governance. The water resources ministry had signed MoUs with 10 ministries for better implementation of Namami Gange, but – says the Down To Earth analysis -- there is no clarity on how different ministries are coordinating. While experts have raised doubts on the efficacy of the draft Ganga protection law (which is with the government at present), the various bodies and agencies created to deal with the issue do not even find the time to meet regularly.

Said Mahapatra: “The present government and all the agencies that it has created to clean the Ganga have a distinct advantage: of learning from the failures and mistakes of the past 30 years. But will they?”

They could, however, hear reports.



City Engineer Darren Adame, supported by City Manager Rick Klein, reported the alleys are looking very clean and the clean-up operation using dumpsters is working efficiently. They estimate alley cleanup cost $61,000 total last year and about $2,500 so far this year. One problem noted was that non-residents are taking advantage of the situation as well as contractors. Known out-of-city dumpers are being turned back. Adame said the dumpster time will be extended for a couple of days because of the inclement weather Monday and Tuesday. The compacter has processed an extra 130,000 pounds of refuse. Adame reports more positive than negative feedback.



City clean-up has set up two 20-yard boxes at the ball field off 22nd and Bradish for the rest of this week, until Friday afternoon.



In the usual sanitation report, 40 yard box services are up two for the month and down three for the year. Twenty yard box services are up six for the month and down eight for the year.



Director of Water and Waste Water Tom Seaba condensed his regular report. He began with the certifications earned in the department. Zeke Vigil earned his Level B Waste Water Treatment Certification; David Salas and Chris Menges earned Level D Waste Water Treatment Certification. Meghan Yergert passed he Level 1 Distribution Certification.



At the Reverse Osmosis Plant, two chlorine leaks near the pumps were repaired Well #11 flow meter was repaired and all other well flow meters were tested. Routine maintenance on Degasifiers and HVAC controls were done. A collapsed wall was hauled away and hill re-sloped on the west side of the three million gallon tank. In Distribution, a main leak was repaired on Third Street near Steen. The crew installed a connection for the Colorado Department of Transportation facility east of La Junta and prepared for city-wide safety presentation on confined spaces scheduled for Wednesday.



The new wastewater treatment plant is now rated at 72 percent complete. On October 4, the Colorado Water Resource Power Development Authority toured the plant. The 23 participants admired the work of Moltz Construction, our contractor, and the quality, management and pace of the project.



In wastewater, 29.95 million gallons were treated, removing 40 cubic feet of screenings and 36 cubic feet of grit. The annual jetting program was completed on the west side of the city on August 18; 7,349 feet of main were jetted in emergency calls. Collection lines in the industrial park were cleaned, cut and viewed with camera.



Line Crew Supervisor Reuben DeLeon reports unusually heavy use of the electric trailer, which had been set up for different functions ten times this year, including three times this month. The Arkansas Valley Regional Medical Center lost a 500 kilovolt transformer at the west site of the hospital. The crew replaced it with a 750 kilovolt transformer.



Cement pads have been poured at the Lewis Bolt and Nut in New Addition. The transformers will be set and wire pulled in to the transformer and terminated. The crew has removed the transformer at the primary school in order for the electrical contractor to pull in the new conductor. The line crew has been doing some line maintenance on the G52-10 and G52-30 at Walmart and downtown circuits will continue as time allows.



The crew has been removing trees under the AB52-2 line at Sixth and Topeka to Tenth and Topeka to eliminate outages. This circuit is the alternate feed to Walmart. They have also removed trees under the 69 kilovolt line that feeds the Industrial Park Substation. Trimming is complete for the season with a total of 1,546 hours, about 300 more than last year.



The non-quorum meeting was adjourned, with Resolution Concerning Utility Policies delayed to the next meeting, along with a Resolution Recommending to City Council the Adoption of the 2019 Proposed Budget for the Electric Fund, Water Fund, Sewer Fund and Sanitation Fund, to be presented by City Attorney Phil Malouff.

Doing this sounds simple enough: keep surroundings clean, and practice basic hygiene, including handwashing.

And yet observing basic hygiene is not that easy for millions of people worldwide. Limited access to clean water makes regular handwashing a luxury for people in impoverished communities, including in the Philippines. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, during her presidency, blew her top during a visit to a public school near Malacañang that didn’t have running water in the lavatories. The problem was addressed in the school, but many other communities around the country are still waiting for the installation of modern water facilities.

If you have to draw water from a communal artesian well or buy water by the pail, you will use water sparingly, and regular handwashing will look like a luxury. Cholera, which has been eradicated in advanced economies, has resurfaced in underdeveloped communities that lack access to safe water and modern sanitation facilities. Infants and young children are at highest risk of potentially deadly infections arising from unsafe or inadequate water supply.

Convincing people about the health benefits of handwashing has taken on such urgency that a special day has been dedicated to it. This year’s observance of Global Handwashing Day on Oct. 15 emphasized the importance of regular handwashing in keeping food safe, preventing diseases and enabling children to grow strong and healthy.

With this year’s theme of “clean hands – a recipe for health,” the challenge is making handwashing a practice that comes naturally even to the poorest Filipinos. This is best achieved if there is universal access to modern water facilities.","Doing this sounds simple enough: keep surroundings clean, and practice basic hygiene, including handwashing.

Taking care of the internal and external cleanliness of the body has remained with us. However, the awareness that we need to keep our public places clean has taken a beating. This has happened because Bharat - the greatest economy on the planet 25 decades ago - decimated itself under the expert care of colonial guile. Industries were destroyed. Taxation was backbreaking. This slowly took us to a place where no one had the means, energy or resource to maintain public hygiene and sanitation.

Unfortunately, even after independence, governments have not taken enough care to organize cleanliness in the public space. This is not a complaint. Maybe we had other things to do. But today, we know that lack of public hygiene is costing the nation dearly.

Malnourishment and lack of public hygiene generally complement each other. Repeated bouts of bacterial and parasitical infection in the digestive tract take away the ability to absorb nutrients. This has happened to millions of children in the country.

The lack of toilets is also a major issue for women. With the population growth in the last few decades, a woman has no private space left outside. So the government's initiative to build millions of toilets across the country in the last four years is much needed. But while most of India now has access to a toilet, there are still various cultural and logistics issues that the government is trying to address.

It has to be understood that in this country, nothing changes just by changing policies. It takes an emotional movement, which is what I believe Prime Minister Narendra Modi is doing with the Swachh Bharat movement. The process of wanting to clean India is not an overnight job. At the same time, if we can inspire all citizens, it would happen much more quickly.

When the Prime Minister announced Swachh Bharat on Independence Day a few years ago, a certain section of society was making comments, ""Why is the Prime Minister talking about pedestrian issues when there are larger issues to be addressed?""

These people do not realize that a large mass of India is pedestrian. Addressing pedestrian issues is of national interest. Without creating a clean nation, developing a nation into a great possibility will be out of question because the infections we carry within us will not allow us to become full-fledged human beings.

Besides the individual's role, today, there are many technologies evolving in the world to transform filth into wealth. There is no such thing as waste. It is just a question of whether we know how to use something or not. The time has come when we have to learn to transform everything and use it for our well-being. What was earth, we made into filth. We must at least be able to transform it back to earth.

There is substantial knowledge - both traditional and new - on how to do this. We must make the transforming of filth into wealth a part of our national ethos. Every city, municipality and village panchayat must take it up.

For example, a city like Mumbai generates 2.1 billion litres of sewage per day. Most of it goes to the sea. But if this is treated and used in micro-irrigation, it can water thousands of hectares of agriculture. If you add up sewage from 200 Indian cities and towns, it comes to 36 billion litres which can micro-irrigate 3 to 9 million hectares. Whether it is river pollution, plastic waste or domestic waste, if you show people that what they think is filth can become wealth, you will not find any filth anywhere.

Swachh Bharat is not just the Prime Minister's movement. It is a crucial step for India to move ahead and truly prosper. Our jawans are standing at our borders, risking their lives every day. Our farmers work hard to feed the nation. Our industrial workers are sweating it out to give us a foothold in the world. One simple way through which we can show our love for our country is by creating Swachh Bharat.

I'm sure if all of us are determined, we can turn this into a clean nation in twelve months' time. Let us take this commitment that before Mahatma's Jayanti in 2019, we will create a clean India on every level - on the streets, at home, in rooting out corruption, and in our own minds and hearts.

Remember, this is a culture that built consciousness of cleanliness through public drainage systems before any other.

Let us make it happen.

I’m a native of an eastern Himalayan state where fresh, clean water and rainfall is in such abundance that we can’t help but take them for granted. When I came to Delhi for my higher studies, I was low-key aware of the alarming levels of pollution and the gloriously polluted Yamuna, whose waters have sustained this city, its people and its famous empires for centuries. Fortunately, I got admission in a North Campus college and unfortunately, had to stay in a PG in Hudson Lane on the banks of the infamous Najafgarh drain. Now, anyone familiar with this area would recognize the overpowering stink wafting throughout the surroundings, resembling the odor of rotten eggs and ten times worse than 2-day-old decaying detergent water.

You will agree that water bodies are always a great boon during the summers – because of the cool breeze that they provide – unless it is the Najafgarh drain whose stench-carrying breeze is totally not something to look forward to. I used to cross the drain every day on my way to college, the swirling water a toxic black and opaque (your sensory perceptions are enough and you don’t need a pH meter to know how toxic the waters are), carrying floating islets of solid wastes like plastic bottles, plastic bags, one or two parts of rubber tires and some chappals, and dissolved liquid wastes from industrial and domestic sources etc was an everyday sight.

Now, I’m a bit more aware of the myriad pollution issues in Delhi than I was when I first arrived here. Although I have never visited the looming landfills of Delhi, living near the Najafgarh drain is the closest I have ever been to witness the problems locals face across Delhi, when harmful, polluting practices encroach on their daily lives. Hence, as a part of my curiosity, I will briefly explain the current scenario of the Najafgarh drain and some of the issues related to it.

While only 2% of Yamuna’s length lies in Delhi, 70% of the total pollution in the river comes from the city.

The Najafgarh drain originates in the Alwar-Rewari region of Rajasthan and Haryana in the Aravalli Hills, with its sources in the Sahibi river (an offshoot of Yamuna) which has been turned into Najafgarh Lake, where sewage gets dumped from Gurugram. In 1978, this drain was channelised “with the objective of integrating it into the storm-water drainage system of the city”. It enters from Dhansa, south-west of Delhi and after a length of 40km traversing through the city, it joins the Yamuna in the north. Apart from attracting many species of birds, it also attracts sewage dumping with over 140 drains contributing to 60-70% of Yamuna’s pollution and is one of the largest of the three watersheds in Delhi (Barapulla and Shahdara). The Drain’s basin is made up of 144 wards and occupies 67% of the NCT area and houses 8.76 million people or 52% of the city’s population.

What Are The Immediate Effects?

The drain contains algae and other microbes that feed on the organic load of the drain which results in the production of hydrogen sulphide, carbon dioxide and methane which are the most potent greenhouse gases. Not only that, but these gases also increase the rate of chemical oxidation of iron and corrosion of copper which further degrade the linings of refrigerators and air conditioners, causing frequent leakage of gases releasing CFCs and aerosols in the air. Also, due to the oxygen-deficient conditions of the drain’s water flowing into the Yamuna, these pollutants are choking the life out of the aquatic ecosystem of the river.

Amidst this, the Delhi Jal Board in 2017 has entered into a 5-year research collaboration with the University of Virginia on the Yamuna River Project “to place riverfront restoration and development at the forefront of national consciousness”. The strategies adopted starts with the cleaning of the Najafgarh drain in Phase I of the project – encompassing purification of the water, sludge removal, solid waste removal and cleaning septage. Also, over 200 drains and water bodies of the city are going to be rejuvenated. The idea behind the project is to bring people closer to the water bodies by making the drain an integral part of Delhi as its asset.

In the face of Delhi’s polluted air and water, the dying lakes and the issue of water scarcity, cleaning, and rejuvenation of the water bodies is of the utmost importance. Reviving water bodies such as lakes and ponds leads to the creation of a water recharge zone that addresses the issue of water scarcity along with providing an aesthetically pleasing environment for the citizens and home for the migratory birds. Hence, the priority for both the government and the citizens in this endeavour should be the cleaning of the Najafgarh drain as almost 60-70 per cent of the pollution in the Yamuna comes from the Najafgarh drain alone and handling that single drain could enliven the river again, stated NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar.

Though it seems the message has conveyed a half to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government in Khyber Pakhtu Kha.

Last week, Chief Minister Khyber PakhtunKha Mahmood Kha also enthusiastically initiated the clean and green drive in Peshawar and has directed the authorities of the Water Supply and Sanitation Program (WSSP) to utilize their capabilities to the best of their level in ensuring clean and green Peshawar.

He had vowed to utilize all the resources to make Peshawar the most beautiful city of Pakistan. In the same inauguration ceremony of the Clean and Green Pakistan campaign, the CM KPK reiterated his commitment and said that the clean and green project was top priority of the Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf (PTI)-led provincial government even appreciated the WSSP for their hard work though the maintainance of sanitation, hygiene and garbage dumping is still a dream to the residents of Peshawar across the length and breadth of the city.

Peshawar is swamped with waste dumps, garbage heaps and unhygienic gutter water accumulated all over the place which also contaminates drinking water. Despite the instructions of Chief Minister Mahmood Khan earlier a week, no major clean and green drive arrangements for waste dumping, filth depots placements and tackling the issues of stinking sewerage water can be witnessed anywhere in the city. On the other hand, local administration seems careless and slapdash of the provincial government’s extensive plans for beautification of the city.

Local government’s lethargy and lack of concern is flagrant and is required stringent measures against deliberate ignorance and idleness of the responsible of criminal negligiance.

While talking to the Dunya News, one of the local of Peshawar complained that this junk heap is home to many white collar people where one even cannot take breath due to the stink of garbage and grimy gutter water.

Another resident was annoyed at PTI’s token display initiative of Clean and Green Pakistan and said the local government’s performance with regards to the cleanliness and sanitation in Peshawar is absolutely awful for years and years.

India has just completed its biggest city gas distribution auction that would extend coverage to more than half of its 1.3 billion people across a third of the nation’s area. This project aims to see 10 million homes linked to gas grids by 2020 and bring relief to smog filled cities.

“There will be a lot of requirement for steel pipelines coming in from next year,"" said E.S. Ranganathan, managing director of Indraprastha Gas Ltd., which supplies gas for homes and transport in New Delhi and its suburbs. This will require about 12,500 kilometers of pipes within the next three to four years, he said.

India is seeking to double the share of natural gas in the country’s energy mix to 15 percent by 2030, while slashing emissions by a third. The country, which the World Bank said in 2016 was home to 14 of the 30 most polluted cities on the planet, is building gas pipelines and new import facilities to increase use of the fuel.

“The gas economy and pipeline industry move in tandem,"" according to Dinesh Kumar Sarraf, chairman of the state-run Petroleum & Natural Gas Regulatory Board. “The deeper we push gas use, the greater will be the need for pipelines.""

Winners

Low penetration of pipes, and government measures such as setting up the National Gas Grid and revamping the water and sanitation infrastructure, provide a domestic business opportunity of more than 300 billion rupees ($4 billion), Jindal Saw Ltd. said in its annual report in August.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mandate for gas outreach is expected to boost earnings of the smaller mills such as Maharashtra Seamless Ltd., Ratnamani Metals & Tubes Ltd., Jindal Saw, and Man Industries India Ltd., according to IndiaNivesh Securities Ltd.

“We are bullish on the pipe makers as there is a significant demand pickup as well as improvement in the overall tender activity by the government-run oil and gas companies that will significantly contribute to the growth,"" Saurabh Kapadia, a senior analyst, said by phone from Mumbai. “With the higher oil price, we expect a spurt in exploration and production investments and thereby higher demand for seamless pipes.""

These companies face little competition from imports after the government levied an anti-dumping duty on supplies from China last year, Kapadia said. Among pipe makers, Maharashtra Seamless is his preferred pick.

Shares of Maharashtra Seamless rose as much as 1.7 percent in Mumbai to the highest level in three weeks, while the broader stock index fell.

Higher Capex

Maharashtra Seamless expects its revenues to rise at least 20 percent annually over the next two years and has more than doubled its spending this fiscal year, Chief Financial Officer Ashok Soni said in June. He said he expects increased demand mainly due to a boost in capital expenditure by oil and gas firms as India pushes for energy self-sufficiency.

“Globally economies are shifting from oil to gas, and natural gas distribution companies have revived their investment plans, which include construction of new pipelines as well as replacement of aging pipelines,"" Ramesh Chandra Mansukhani, chairman of Man Industries, said in an interview.

Prime Minister Imran Khan has launched ""Clean and Green Pakistan"" initiative at a ceremony in Islamabad today.

Speaking on the occasion, he said a country-wide campaign for cleanliness would be launched Saturday next and this would be sustained over the next five years. President, Governors, Ministers and Chief Ministers would participate in ceremonies aimed at making Pakistan clean and green.

He said the plan involves a holistic approach aimed at taking care of air, ground and water pollution.

The Prime Minister said the initiative would have four aspects.

Imran Khan urged members of the civil society to complement efforts of the Government in creating necessary awareness about sanitation and environmental issues. He said cleanliness would form part of the syllabus from class one to five and a beginning has been made from institutions of the Federal Capital.

He said as part of the integrated solution, dumping sites would be identified from village to tehsil level for disposal of solid waste. Waste-to-Energy projects would be undertaken around these sites for generation of electricity to meet local requirements of power.

A cleanliness competition would be held among tehsils after every two months and their concerned officials would be rewarded or penalized on the basis of state of cleanliness in their areas of jurisdiction after every six months.

He said orders have been issued to all petrol pumps and CNG stations to keep their toilets neat and clean and they would be penalized in case of non-compliance.

The Prime Minister said monitors and volunteers would help Government monitor progress in realization of the cherished objective of making Pakistan clean and green. Advocates and ambassadors of clean and green Pakistan would also be designed from different segments of the society including media, celebrities and sportsmen.

The Prime Minister said other countries of the region have made remarkable progress and there is no reason why we can't make Pakistan clean. Emphasizing the need for cleanliness, he said toilet facility is available just to 42% Pakistanis and lack of this facility also impacts upon tourism. He said it would be Endeavour of the Government to ensure that there is toilet in every home during the next five years.","PM launched Clean and Green Initiative in IslamabadPrime Minister Imran Khan has launched ""Clean and Green Pakistan"" initiative at a ceremony in Islamabad today.

The prime minister launched the drive at Islamabad College for Girls by planting a sapling and sweeping the lawn of the college.

Khan was accompanied by his Adviser on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam, Special Assistants Iftikhar Durrani and Naeemul Haq and Senator Faisal Javed besides representatives of international organisations.

Holding the broom, the white-clad prime minister also picked up garbage and disposed it off before proceeding to wash his hands, setting an example for youngsters to follow proper cleanliness methods.

On the first day of the nationwide movement, ceremonies were held across the country to clean various localities and plant trees, attended by citizens as well as government authorities.

While addressing the ceremony in Islamabad, the prime minister congratulated the students and teachers of the college for holding a successful launching ceremony of the five-year-long drive for a cleaner and greener Pakistan.

Khan recalled the role played by students for fundraising of Shaukat Khanum Hospital across the country and urged them to replicate the same dedication for this drive.

The premier expressed concerns over polluted rivers in the country and pollution rising to an alarming level in Lahore, particularly in winter.

He said according to a study, excessive pollution shortens life expectancy by 11 years on average.

“The rising pollution will mar the future of our upcoming generations,” he added.

He said besides cleanliness, enhancement of the green cover was equally essential as Pakistan was the 7th-most affected country for global warming.

He said after successful completion of a 'billion-tree tsunami' in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the government had launched a five-year '10-billion tree tsunami' across the country.

Khan said the glaciers will deplete fast if the world failed to tackle the challenge of global warming and the planet will become unlivable for the future generations.

He hoped that after plantation of 10 billion trees, the weather pattern of the country would be changed altogether.

The prime minister said the cleanliness drive will not remain confined to posh areas but it will also cover the slums and reiterated his governments plan to regularise and provide housing to slum dwellers.

The drive also includes the construction of landfill sites in all areas to ensure proper disposal of garbage.

The prime minister also interacted with representatives of international organisations and shared with them the government's future plans to cope with climate change and global warming.

Later, Advisor Aslam told APP the government would change the public mindset and behaviour to make this initiative a success.

He said the drive would be funded by both the government as well as donors.","Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday kicked off a countrywide 'Clean Green Pakistan' drive to tackle the challenges of rising pollution and global warming and with a resolve to create a Pakistan ""even cleaner than Europe"".

Yesterday, the United Nations honoured me with the ‘Champions of the Earth Award’. While I was extremely humbled at receiving this honour, I do feel that this award is not for an individual. Instead, it is recognition of the Indian culture and values, which have always placed emphasis on living in harmony with Mother Nature.

It was a proud moment for every Indian to see India’s proactive role in mitigating climate change being acknowledged and appreciated by the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres and Erik Solheim, the executive director of the UNEP.

Human beings and nature have a very special relationship. Mother Nature has nurtured and nourished us. The first civilisations were established on the banks of rivers. Societies that live in harmony with nature flourish and prosper.

Today human society stands at an important crossroads. The path that we take hereon will not only determine our wellbeing but also that of the generations who will inhabit our planet after us. The imbalances between our greed and necessities have led to grave ecological imbalances. We can either accept this, go ahead with things as if it is business as usual, or we can take corrective actions. Three things will determine how we as a society can bring a positive change.

The first is internal consciousness. For that, there is no better place to look than our glorious past. Respect for nature is at the core of India’s traditions. The Atharvaveda contains the Prithvi Sukta, which contains unparalleled knowledge about nature and the environment.

It is beautifully written in Atharvaveda, “Salutations to Mother Earth. In her are woven together ocean and river waters; in her is contained food which she manifests when ploughed; in her indeed are alive all lives; may she bestow us with that life.

The ancient write about the Panch Tatvas — Prithvi (Earth), Vayu (Air), Jal (Water), Agni (Fire), Akash (Sky) —and how our life systems are based on the harmonious functioning of these elements. The elements of nature are manifestations of divinity.

Mahatma Gandhi wrote extensively on the environment and even practiced a lifestyle where compassion towards the environment was essential. He propounded the doctrine of trusteeship, which places the onus on us, the present generation, to ensure that our coming generations inherit a clean planet. He called for sustainable consumption so that the world does not face a resource crunch.

Leading lifestyles that are harmonious and sustainable are apart of our ethos. Once we realise how we are flag bearers of a rich tradition, it will automatically have a positive impact on our actions.

The second aspect is public awareness. We need to talk, write, debate, discuss and deliberate as much as possible on questions relating to the environment.

At the same time, it is vital to encourage research and innovation on subjects relating to the environment. This is when more people will know about the pressing challenges of our times and ways to mitigate them.

When we as a society are aware of our strong links with environmental conservation and talk about it regularly, we will automatically be proactive in working towards a sustainable environment. That is why, I will put proactiveness as the third facet of bringing a positive change.

In this context, I am delighted to state that the 130 crore people of India are proactive and at the forefront of working towards a cleaner and greener environment.

We see this proactiveness in the Swachh Bharat Mission, which is directly linked to a sustainable future. With the blessings of the people of India, over 85 million households now have access to toilets for the first time.

Over 400 million Indians no longer have to defecate in the open. Sanitation coverage is up from 39% to 95%. These are landmark efforts in the quest of reducing the strain on our natural surroundings.

We see this proactiveness in the success of the Ujjwala Yojana, which has significantly reduced indoor air pollution due to unhealthy cooking practices that were causing respiratory diseases.

Till date, over five crore Ujjwala connections have been distributed, thus ensuring a better and cleaner life for the women and their families. India is moving at a quick pace in cleaning its rivers.

The Ganga, which is India’s lifeline, had become polluted in several parts. The Namami Gange Mission is changing this historical wrong. Emphasis is being given to proper treatment of sewage.

At the core of our urban development initiatives such as AMRUT and the Smart Cities Mission is the need to balance urban growth with environmental care. The over 13 crore soil health cards distributed to farmers are helping them make informed decisions that will boost their productivity and improve the health of our land, which helps the coming generations.

We have integrated objectives of Skill India in environment sector and launched the schemes including Green Skill Development Program for skilling about 7 million youth in environment, forestry, wildlife and climate change sectors by 2021. This will go a long way creating numerous opportunities for skilled jobs and entrepreneurships in environment sector.

Our country is devoting unparalleled attention to new and renewable sources of energy.

Over the last four years, this sector has become more accessible and affordable. The Ujala Yojana has led to the distribution of nearly 31 crore LED bulbs. The costs of LED bulbs have reduced and so have the electricity bills and the C emissions.

India’s proactiveness is seen internationally. It makes me proud that India remained at the forefront of the COP-21 negotiations in Paris in 2015.

In March 2018, world leaders of several countries converged in New Delhi to mark the start of the International Solar Alliance, an endeavour to harness the rich potential of solar energy and bring together all nations that are blessed with solar power.

While the world is talking about climate change, the call for climate justice has also reverberated from India.

Climate justice is about safeguarding the rights and interests of the poor and marginalised sections of society, who are often the biggest sufferers from the menace of climate change.

As I have written earlier, our actions today will have an impact on human civilisation much beyond our time. It is upto us to take on the mantle of global responsibility towards a sustainable future.

The world needs to shift to a paradigm of environmental philosophy that is anchored in environmental consciousness rather than merely government regulations.

I would like to compliment all those individuals and organisations who are working assiduously in this direction. They have become the harbingers of a monumental change in our society. I assure them all possible support from the government in their pursuits.

Together, we will create a clean environment that will be the cornerstone of human empowerment.

TOCO/ Sangre Grande Regional Corporation chairman Terry Rondon yesterday said relief supplies cannot be delivered to some places in the region because of garbage accumulated there as a result of last weekend’s floods.

While the corporation has been doing what it could to clear the garbage, Rondon said it is too much.

He said the corporation needs help and is appealing for additional trucks to be sent to Sangre Grande to assist with garbage removal. Rondon also said some cesspits overflowed and are posing a health hazard. “We don’t have the equipment” he said.

Rondon said the Works and Transport Ministry has been sending teams to assist with clean up operations. He said the Health Ministry needed to send personnel to help in spraying the affected areas. Rondon identified Vega de Oropouche and North Oropouche among two of the worst affected areas

Tunapuna/Piarco Regional Corporation chairman Paul Leacock said the corporation has been receiving help from the San Fernando City, Point Fortin Borough and San Juan/Laventille Regional Corporations in its clean up efforts.

Leacock said there has been progress in cleaning up the Greenvale and Oropune areas. He said the main challenge has been traffic in the area as residents try to get home. Leacock urged burgesses to hold strain and rest assured that everything possible is being done to restore their lives to normalcy.

Mayaro/Rio Claro Regional Corporation Glen Ram claimed the corporation received no help from the Government to deal with flooding in the area. Until recently, Ram said Cedar Grove was impassable and relief supplies could not be delivered to people who spent days marooned in their homes.

Noting the corporation has only one working sanitation truck at this time, Ram appealed to other local government corporations to assist with additional trucks. He said farmers in places like Plum Mitan lost all their crops. Ram hoped the Agriculture Ministry would properly compensate them.

A statement issued by the Rural Development and Local Government Ministry listed ongoing relief efforts at several corporations. The ministry said 1,100 households were affected in Toco/Sangre Grande and 60 per cent of them have been sanitised. An additional 160 workers were hired to help with clean up efforts. Additional water trucks were also made available.

In Tunapuna/Piarco, 12 shelters were opened to assist approximately 900 displaced people. Five shelters are currently still occupied by flood victims. The Mayaro Civic Centre, which was being used as a shelter, was closed because its occupants were able to return to their homes. The ministry said 11 areas in Mayaro/Rio Claro were assessed and completed. These included Cooper Trace. Mafeking and Sesame Street. Cedar Grove, Gould Street and Cham Road are among 11 areas in the region still being assessed.The Arima Borough Corporation has been lending support to the Tunapuna/Piarco Regional Corporation with clean up and assessment control, the ministry said.","Corporations face challenges with flood clean upResidents make their way through floodwaters on the main road in Sangre Grande on Saturday.

Here are the stories — in no particular order — of 30 such people who have kept their neighbourhoods clean, through hard work, determination and persistence.

Md Saifi, Md Haneef

An ageing duo has transformed a garbage-strewn corner of Delhi’s Daryaganj—59-year-old Mohammad Ahmad Saifi and 64-year-old Mohammad Haneef, known locally as Jai and Veeru (a reference to the 1975 blockbuster Bollywood film Sholay), collect trash from households every morning and evening in the “Chatta Lal Miyan ki Gali Bahar Wali” neighbourhood, and transport it to the collection point.

Phool Kumari

When it comes to hygiene, Phool Kumari of Bihar’s Sasaram district does not compromise. When her husband and in-laws refused to pay for a toilet, she mortgaged her mangalsutra for Rs 8,000 to construct a toilet. Her fame spread quickly and she was appointed a brand ambassador of the Swachh Bharat mission.

Anand Rai

A little over four years ago, Anand Rai started India Rising, a small group for young people, which gathered every Sunday, without a break, to clean various neighbourhoods of Agra city in Uttar Pradesh. Now, the initiative has attracted many people under the current president Nitin Johri, and has received several accolades.

Dehradun youth

A group of young people, ranging from Class 7 pupils to postgraduates, have spent every Sunday for the past seven years beautifying the neighbourhoods of Dehradun, Uttarakhand. Called “Making a difference by being the difference”, they have pressed the local government to plant more trees and have painted around 40 walls in the city.

Pradeep Kumar

In 2007, Bareilly law professor Pradeep Kumar started a small four-page newspaper called Jagar Samachar, which changed the face of the city by undertaking a popular campaign against the use of plastics. His paper also filed a petition in court against the local municipality for dumping waste in rivers.

Dulerai Chawda

For the past three decades, Dulerai Chawda has been cleaning the drains and streets of his neighbourhood Gujarati Mohalla in Jharkhand’s Dhanbad city. He uses his scooter to pick up garbage every morning and then sweeps the streets. His children have now grown up and left the house, but he has not taken a break.

Rajesh Shukla

In 2008, Rajesh Shukla started cleaning the ghats of Varanasi alone. With a megaphone in one hand and a broom in the other, he would sweep the steps of the ancient city’s many ghats on the river Ganga. Now, he is famous among seers and tourists alike as the man who spends three hours every day cleaning holy sites.

Vijay Kumar Nirala

After he joined Usri Gogri middle school in Bihar’s Khagaria district as a headmaster in 2017, he worked night and day to transform the school. Now, bereft of stained walls, heaps of garbage and dirty water, the school has won a state-level award for cleanliness and has been nominated at the national level for a cleanliness award.

Deepak Madhok

Deepak Madhok created a movement in Varanasi in 2012 when he formed an organisation called Jaago Banaras and sent photos of dilapidated streets and overflowing drains to local officials. But when no action was taken, he went to the Allahabad high court. The high court issued a notice to the local administration, setting things in motion.

Jodie Underhill

In 2008, during a trek, British citizen Jodie Underhill, 42, was disgusted by rubbish heaps atop mountains in Himachal Pradesh. She started working in McLeod Ganj and Triund. In 2012, she co-founded an organisation called “Waste Warriors” that has cleaned up more than 400 spots in Dehradun.

Rajashri Sadani, Shreya Bothra

If the railway station at Aligarh looks clean now, two local women are to be credited. These two women, Rajashri Sadani and Shreya Bothra, have led efforts to pick up garbage and beautify the station, winning accolades from the local government and even Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Harsh Jha

A cleanliness movement Harsh Jha, 22, started in Bihar’s Bihariganj is now spreading across the district. After a summer internship with the Swachh Bharat mission, Jha formed teams of 8-10 young people and got down to cleaning the streets of the town . Now, they also work with locals, making them aware of hygiene practices.

Anamika Chowdhury

For 18 years, Anamika Chowdhury has been working to clean the city of Allahabad and its ghats on the river Ganga. She has put together a team of more than 600 people and regularly conducts competitions to spur hygiene awareness in the city.

Janki Mahto

Janki Mahato might be 74, but he doesn’t miss a single day of cleaning up his neighbourhood in Jharkhand’s Dehar village. For the past 24 years, the frail man with a broom in one hand and a garbage collection bag in the other is a regular sight in the village.

Sudhakar Tyagi

Sudhakar Ranjan Tyagi has changed the face of parks in UP’s Muradabad, after his retirement from the Railways in 2017 as chief welfare inspector. He spent his time cleaning parks and planting saplings in the clearings so that people don’t throw garbage again. Now, his efforts have borne fruit.

Puran Singh

When the local company stopped picking up trash in the Boulia neighbourhood of Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh about four years ago, Puran Singh decided to take matters into his own hands, literally. Every morning, he started cleaning the garbage himself. While he was ridiculed at first, he has inspired local youth into a movement.

Keshav Krishna

Keshav Krishna,39, might be a small businessman but he has a big dream. A resident of Bihar’s Motihari, Krishna runs a “selfie with safai” campaign where he encourages young people to take selfies of themselves cleaning neighbourhoods. He also wants to end the usage of polythene bags in the city.

Dorothea Kerketta

The credit of making Karangagudi village in Jharkhand’s Simdega district open defecation-free (ODF) goes to former village chief Dorothea Kerketta, 73, say locals. The retired schoolteacher used her pension for the construction of toilets in the village and educated people about the need to build more such facilities. Because of her efforts, Karangagudi was declared the first ODF village in the district.

Jamnadas Prajapati

It took one man and his resolve to spark a mini-revolution in Ghaziabad’s Vijay Nagar Sector-9 E-Block. Jamnadas Prajapati’s legs were damaged in an accident a few years back, but that didn’t stop the retired head postmaster from cleaning up a park outside his house. Inspired by Prajapati’s efforts, several other citizens joined in. Today, eight parks in the area have witnessed a complete turnaround because of Prajapati’s efforts.

Islam Hussain

Social activist Islam Hussain began his crusade against plastic waste almost 27 years back. The Kathgodam, Uttarakhand resident founded an organisation, Pahal, to spread awareness about the adverse impacts of plastic on the environment. Hussain believes the only way to save the environment is to educate the youth about the dangers of pollution. He also ensured a livelihood for women in several localities by getting them trained to manufacture paper bags.

Mangesh Ghildiyal

When Mangesh Ghildiyal took over as the district magistrate of Rudraprayag on May 17 last year, he took people by surprise. In just a few days, he started personally cleaning more than a dozen drains across the district. He also held meetings in all wards to spread awareness about sanitation. Ghildiyal says cleanliness is one of the most important things in his life.

Rajkumar Maurya

The chief of Ajaipur village in Pindra, Varanasi district, UP, Rajkumar Maurya sweeps a 500-metre stretch in the area with a broom for about two hours daily. While cleaning the village, Maurya also talks to passers-by to spread awareness over cleanliness. People in the village tell Maurya to leave the sanitation work to those employed by the administration in the area, but he has a piece of advice for them —everyone should personally participate in cleaning their neighbourhoods.

Pravin Bharti

Pravin Bharti has become the voice of change in the villages of Jharkhand’s Lohardaga district. He believes cleanliness should have a place in all walks of life – physical, mental and in one’s actions. Bharti has organised more than 30 Swachhta camps in the district. He has visited several schools and villages, speaking to people of all ages about the need to protect the environment by keeping it clean.

Neeraj Sharma

Neeraj Sharma, a project coordinator for Swachh Bharat Mission, doesn’t need an introduction in Mainpuri, Uttar Pradesh, where people listen to him with rapt attention on cleanliness and the need to stop open defecation. Locals say his efforts stand out among the non-governmental initiatives and he inspires the youth to contribute toward building a cleaner nation

Bhai Randheer

From Samastipur in Bihar to Haridwar and Gangasagar to Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, Bhai Randheer’s Ganga campaign has touched many cities. He is trying to make sure that the water as well as the ghats of the Ganga are clean. He even observes a fast to spread awareness. A resident of Samastipur, his journey started in 2000. And he says it will continue till the Ganga is free of pollution.

Vinod Jha

Teased by a friend from Chandigarh over a garbage-strewn park in his neighbourhood, Delhi resident Vinod Jha decided to become a change agent. Jha, who runs a cyber cafe, transformed the park for good. Jha is now a champion of cleanliness and greenery.

Amit Kumar Sahara

Amit Kumar Sahara begins every day in Doomar village of Katihar by cleaning the streets with the help of a team of youngsters who joined his efforts after getting inspired by the 26-year-old. Sahara says one of the best ways to keep diseases at bay is by ensuring cleanliness. The History graduate’s initiative has found support in his parents and district officials, who have appointed him as a ‘Swachhta Doot’ in the area.

Rajaram

Rajaram, a farmer in Lakhimpur Kheri, Uttar Pradesh, is not paid for what he does with utmost sincerity. No one has even told him to spread the message of cleanliness. Yet, he blows his whistle whenever he sees someone going to the fields to defecate in the open, in an effort to prevent them. He was inspired by a government campaign to make his village open defecation free. Impressed, the village chief has gifted him a jacket. He has indeed made an impact.

Viswajit Prasad

Viswajit Prasad is the founder of Change India Foundation, which carries out cleanliness campaigns and does wall paintings in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand. He said his organisation took up the work after a 2016 cleanliness survey, in which the city lagged behind. Prasad asked people on social media to share photos of places strewn with garbage. His team went to those areas and carried out cleanliness drives with the help of residents.

Monica

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cleanliness campaign struck a chord with Monica, who decided to something on her own. Three years ago, she started making fertilizer from bio-waste at her house in Faridabad in the National Capital Region. Soon, she began to supply fertilizer to the Resident Welfare Association of her society. Inspired by Monica, others in her society followed suit. Now, she goes to other cities to train people and municipalities.","Here are the stories — in no particular order — of 30 such people who have kept their neighbourhoods clean, through hard work, determination and persistence.

Econet, through Higherlife Foundation, will continue with its clean-up campaign in Budiriro and Glen View in the next 10 days amid indications that the outbreak has been contained as no new cases had been reported by the end of last week.

The two high-density Harare suburbs are believed to be the epicentre of the recent cholera outbreak which has claimed 54 lives during the past month.

Tremendous progress has been registered so far in containing the becterial desease, with First Lady Amai Auxillia Mnangagwa joining hundreds of volunteers in Budiriro and Glen View last week for the clean-up campaign.

Yesterday, Econet and Higherlife Foundation representative Mr Lovemore Nyatsine said it is encouraging that the affected communities are stepping up to join the group in the clean-up campaign.

“We have cleaned areas and dumping sites in the epicentres of Glen View and Budiriro.

“The clean-up campaign has so far been amazing and we have seen great progress as the community is now getting more involved,” he said.

“We have 300 volunteers present for the clean-up campaign in the epicentres until the 31st of October.They are currently there as we speak,” he said.

Other stakeholders have been providing water treatment facilities, sanitation and hygiene products, including supplying clean and safe water to the affected areas.

Higherlife Foundation, led by Mrs Tsitsi Masiyiwa, was established in 1996. It is a non-profit organisation funded by Econet Wireless, which has given over $15 million to fight cholera.

The foundation has been working closely with the Health and Local Government ministries, the City of Harare and other public and private institutions to offer support.

In order to contain the disease and prevent future outbreaks, Government has embarked on a vaccination exercise, which is still ongoing.

More than 390 910 people were vaccinated during the first phase. The vaccination programme is targeting a total of 1,4 million people.

President Emmerson Mnangagwa, some Cabinet Ministers and Members of Parliament were also vaccinated last week.

Health experts say vaccination provides protection for three to five years.

The Ministry of Health and Child Care maintains that diseases such as typhoid and cholera can only be contained through provision of potable water, including proper solid waste management, sewage reticulation and basic personal hygiene.

266,https://www.reminetwork.com/articles/james-lee-senters-healthy-outlook/,"Tue, 09 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",REMI Network - Real Estate Management Industry Network,Fresh and Clean and DryIt: A healthy outlook,"James Lee Senter, best known as Lee, is among the most recognizable figures in the professional cleaning industry. A well-known public speaker, inspector for all the major carpet manufacturers across southern Ontario and an Institute of Inspection Cleaning and Restoration Certification approved instructor who also presently serves as president of the Canadian Flooring, Cleaning and Restoration Association, Senter has made a name for himself as the go-to guy when something needs to be fixed.

“I’m an education hog,” laughs the owner of both Fresh and Clean and DryIt. “Because of my never-ending thirst for knowledge and honest passion for the business, I get a lot of referrals from many of the large janitorial companies when they’re faced with troublesome tasks like stubborn stains. I’ve become a handy person to have on my competitors’ side.”

Senter’s focus on offering premium or, what he calls, “problem-solving services” has really taken off in the last few years thanks to the reputation he’s garnered.

A fixture in the industry for four decades now, Senter is also known for being green before his time – a pathway he took out of necessity. In 1979, one year after he landed his first job as a carpet cleaning technician at Ottawa-based Dominion Carpet Cleaning, Senter was diagnosed with hepatitis C, which was then called non-A, non-B hepatitis. The news was unexpected – 95 per cent of people with the potentially lethal virus are unaware they have it, according to the World Health Organization, likely because it often doesn’t trigger any symptoms.

“The doctors determined the cleaning chemicals I was using were attacking my internal organs and I was told I either had to get out of the business or change what I was doing,” he says matter-of-factly.

Having found his calling, Senter chose to find a way to do his job using chemicals that were less hazardous to his liver, such as powdered enzymes as a cleaning pre-spray (though his sinuses have paid the price of daily use), and non-toxic household items like peanut butter to tackle chewing gum and other sticky residue in carpet, egg whites to get rid of coffee splotches, sour milk to eliminate ink and lemon juice as an all-purpose stain remover.

With a new lease on life, Senter uprooted and moved to Toronto in the late ‘80s, where he was employed as an early morning newspaper delivery man while, at the same time, working in the marketing department of a local cleaning company. Looking to grow his savings, Senter squirreled away his cleaning-related paycheques to avoid spending his hard-earned cash only to find out it was all for naught.

“One day, an employee came in and told me his cheque didn’t clear and it soon dawned on me that I had a wallet full of cheques that were worthless,” Senter recalls. “I immediately went to the owner to air my grievances and quit but instead of giving me my money and sending me on my way, he offered me 50 per cent of the business.”

This second life-changing event marked the beginning of Fresh and Clean in 1988, the name purposefully chosen to signify a fresh start for Senter. But despite his optimistic outlook and best efforts to grow the business, his new partner failed to change his precarious ways and Senter sold his share after just two years. Shortly thereafter, the company went under.

“My partner was no good with money, so I guess it was doomed for disaster from the get-go,” he says.

But in 1993, Senter resurrected the company name as Fresh and Clean’s sole proprietor and moved it in the direction he originally intended. At first, carpet cleaning was the main source of business but as the textile floor covering lost market share to hard surface flooring in the ‘90s, Senter diversified – a strategy that has proven successful time and again. First, Fresh and Clean offered hardwood sanding and then gradually moved into laminate floor maintenance, but the payday never fully materialized as he had hoped. That’s when Senter decided to adopt a green marketing strategy.

“It made perfect sense,” he says. “Not only was I committed to using products that would reduce the risks of adverse health effects but I had become a carpet and upholstery cleaning instructor for Chemspec, a growing specialty chemical distribution company that was the leader in green cleaning products.”

Fresh and Clean soon became known for using eco-friendly cleaning solutions and was the first building service contractor certified under the Canadian Sanitation Supply Association’s green sustainability program. Its primary cleaner is a 100 per cent food-based, scent-free product that has achieved the prestigious Carpet and Rug Institute Seal of Approval.

At the forefront of adopting the best products and practices, newer tools in the company’s green cleaning arsenal include a proprietary cleaning pre-treatment for heavily soiled carpets — a plant-based micelle surfactant – which, again, is safe to use and has no significant odour, HEPA vacuums that filter the air and microfiber cloths that trap the dust particles, resulting in not only a cleaner environment but a healthier one, too.

Around the time that Fresh and Clean began to gain more market share because of its green cleaning policy, the company branched out into water damage restoration as another road to growth. But in 2006, Senter suffered a setback, albeit a temporary one.

“My insurance company told me I had to divest Fresh and Clean of its disaster restoration services or it would cease coverage,” he explains. “Instead of dwelling on this, I saw it as another opportunity to move ahead.”

So, that same year, Senter established DryIt, whose mission is to dry flooded facilities “in place,” wherever practical, instead of removing building components, remediating and rebuilding. This strategy minimizes downtime, is less costly for clients and leads to a more sustainable business, he says.

Today, DryIt provides a variety of emergency services beyond water damage restoration, including mould remediation, asbestos testing and removal, fire and smoke damage cleanup, trauma scene cleanup and specialty drying.

In addition to expanding its service offerings, Senter’s two companies have increased their geographic reach beyond Toronto to serve more than 5,000 residential and commercial spaces across the entire GTA, as well as in Hamilton and Barrie, Ont. He expects Fresh and Clean’s customer base will further grow because of its new partnership with the world’s second largest retailer, Costco, which Senter forged in June.

“After Sears shuttered its doors in Canada earlier this year, the people behind the retail chain’s carpet cleaning launched Costco carpet cleaning in which we’ve been hired to do the jobs,” he explains excitedly.

Though looking forward to what the future holds, Senter is still very much grounded in the present, which involves overseeing the rollout of an online review system. A significant investment, it will provide Fresh and Clean customers the opportunity to rate their service. Clients that score lower than a five will automatically receive a return visit to address outstanding issues.

“We’re taking a very proactive approach to make sure the job is done to our customers’ satisfaction,” says Senter, adding he intends to personally train one person with his skill set to remove stains at no charge upon such follow-up calls. “We are in the people-pleasing business and this will set us apart from others in the marketplace.”

As for DryIt, Senter is in the final stages of perfecting a second online system. Three years in the making, it will enable clients to track their insurance claims in real-time when it launches in November.

“Unlike the cleaning industry, quality of work is not the top priority in the disaster restoration business,” he explains. “What’s important to these customers is that workers are on time and the project is finished promptly, followed by professionalism and then work quality.”

When ranking what matters most to him, Senter says he hopes to leave a legacy for raising the bar of health and safety in the cleaning industry.

“I want people to realize through my education efforts that there are great repercussions if we don’t respect what we do,” he says. “I’m a perfect example: I’m allergic to mould, I suffered liver disease as a result of the chemicals used in the cleaning industry and have full flown DDD (degenerative disc disease) from performing repetitive movements with incorrect posture, or poor ergonomics. Despite the sector’s progress, it’s important not to ignore that the cleaning industry still consists of a lot of chemistries and practices that can cause severe harm to human beings.”

With a view to extend the Centre’s flagship Swachh Bharat campaign to courts, the Supreme Court of India is set to launch the “Swachh Nyayalaya” project. Chief Justice of India Justice Ranjan Gogoi to launch the project on the occasion of Law Day on November 26.

The vision of the project was presented by Supreme Court judge, Justice Madan B Lokur at the pre-launch function of the project on Friday. It would be undertaken by NITI Aayog and the Union Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation along with the Department of Justice. The Supreme Court will oversee the implementation of the same.

The project would include construction and maintenance of washrooms in over 16,000 court rooms, and would move on to weeding out of files, thereby clearing out significant amount of space that can then be put to some other use.

“So really the idea behind this Swachh Nyayalaya is to have those general clean up in terms of maintenance, in terms of house keeping issues, of course, providing toilets, washrooms and all that is one of the aspects of housekeeping and maintenance but equally important are issues of garbage disposal,” Justice Lokur explained.

He, in fact, gave the example of the apex court, informing those present that a large bar room was made here by weeding out old and unnecessary files.

He further refused to accept the deadline of 2020 fixed by government agencies to complete the Swachh Nyayalaya project, hoping that it can be completed within a span of six months. For this purpose, he suggested involvement of District Collectors.

The budgetary requirements have been identified as well, with an estimated amount of Rs. 15-20 lakh required for renovation of every court. A total outlay of Rs. 700 crore, to be provided by the Central government, is therefore desired.","With a view to extend the Centre’s flagship Swachh Bharat campaign to courts, the Supreme Court of India is set to launch the “Swachh Nyayalaya” project.

The interactive map (below) shows the extent of Bath’s proposed clean air zone where certain vehicles could be charged to enter.

Plotted out on Google Maps, the area is around 2.4km2 - and incorporates not just the city centre but nearly as far south as Oldfield Road and spanning north up Camden Road.

The most easterly road is Pulteney Gardens and the western boundary is Park Lane.

Inside the proposed clean air zone boundary are public transport hubs like the bus and railway stations, two petrol stations and nine car parks.

For sports fans, Bath Cricket Club is inside the zone but Bath Rugby Club just straddles the boundary.

The inclusion of part of the A36 sparked a backlash from the Road Haulage Association - higher polluting HGVs, along with buses and coaches, would be charged £100 a day to enter the zone.

If it is introduced in late 2020, drivers of cars, taxis and vans that do not meet clean air standards will face a £9 a day charge.

The vehicles set to be charged are:

Pre-Euro 6 diesel vehicles, including hybrids (older than approx. 2015)

Pre-Euro 4 petrol vehicles, including hybrids (older than approx. 2006)

The zone boundary has changed since it was first proposed.

Some residents said they wanted to be included, others were certain they did not.

Bath & North East Somerset Council, which is consulting on the plans, said it wanted to set a boundary that works for the community.

It is keen to hear from residents about how they will be affected and is consulting until November 26.

More than 3,000 people have responded so far.

Environmental protection and licensing manager Cathryn Brown said: “We're under no illusions about the significance of these proposals.

“We recognise the impacts both positive and negative to people who live, work, commute and run businesses in bath and the wider North East Somerset area.

“We need feedback from the community to get answers.”

She said it was about time the traders rose to their responsibilities by ensuring that they desisted from throwing waste into drains and keep their surroundings clean to prevent the outbreak of environmental related diseases such as cholera and typhoid.

Madam Dapaah made the call when she was taken round by the Accra Metropolitan Chief Executive, Mr Mohammed Adjei Sowah, to inspect the Agbogbloshie and Kokomba markets in Accra during a special clean-up exercise.

The Minister asked the traders to stop displaying food items on the bare floor while urging cooked food vendors to move away from drains to prevent contamination of the food by flies.

'As market women there is the need to pay attention to food preparation, handling, storage and display to keep us healthy.'

Madam Dapaah urged the assemblies to intensify their efforts at ensuring hygienic conditions in the markets, saying; 'It is too common in our markets and communities to observe bad environmental practices, which affect our health.'

Mr Sowah said the attitude of residents of Accra towards clean-up exercises must change adding that the issue of environmental cleanliness was not the responsibility of the Government alone.

'We all must prepare to help achieve the desired effects,' he said.

'When you see your neighbour dumping waste into the drains you must challenge him or her. I appeal to the communities to be proactive to unhealthy practices such as open defecating and dumping of refuse.'

The AMA Chief Executive urged the traders to inform the Assembly whenever they have concerns with sanitation.

The traders at the Agbogbloshie Market pleaded for refuse containers to help prevent the indiscriminate dumping of waste in the area.","Madam Cecilia Abena Dapaah, the Minister of Sanitation and Water Resources, has called on traders at Agbogbloshie and Kokomba Markets to keep their environment clean to avoid selling contaminated food items to buyers.

Bath residents have spoken out about plans to charge drivers of higher-emission cars £9 to enter a city centre clean air zone.

The plans are out for consultation and residents are able to submit their comments to Bath and North East Somerset Council until November 26.

For non-compliant buses, coaches and heavy goods vehicles the fee could be as high as £100.

Newer vehicles and fully electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles will not be charged. Other exemptions, such as for disability and military vehicles, will apply.

Readers have also had their say in letters submitted to the Bath Chronicle.

Routes around the zone will be impacted

(Image: Artur Lesniak/ Reach plc)

How does B&NES think that any person of average intelligence would swallow some of the assumptions in this proposal?

For example, the much clearer downloaded version of the map of the proposed clean air zone, shows the Cleveland Bridge traffic lights to be within the zone.

Both Bathwick Street and much of London Road are outside the zone.

Now consider the following B&NES assertion: ""assessments also show that the majority of roads outside the zone would not see an increase in traffic etc"".

Clearly this restriction will force considerable extra traffic to take routes around the zone, and most notably via the Batheaston Toll Bridge, or by the inadequate network of routes on the northern and southern slopes?

I'll will however grant B&NES credit for designing a scheme, that will on the face of it, have the effect of diverting through lorries to the A350 near Chippenham, something which I guess Wilstshire County Council haven't yet noticed?

The inherent financial penalties will hit everyone hard, but especially the young.

Charging scheme must be fairer to all

(Image: Artur Lesniak)

As someone who participated in a trial congestion charging scheme in Bristol some years ago, I was interested to read the proposals for Bath.

The Bristol scheme made me use public transport more even when the financial incentive had been removed, despite the best efforts of First Bus to make bus travel as frustrating as possible.

However, I think there are some faults in the proposals for Bath.

A road charging scheme needs the back up of an alternative good public transport system. This would include direct buses to the main destinations such as the centre, RUH and universities. This is not the case particularly for traffic from the east. Buses in many areas are already crowded and unreliable as are local rail services. Only charging older vehicles will be seen as unfair. A wealthy parent can take their child on a walkable/cyclable school trip in a new SUV or 4x4 for free whereas the poorly paid mobile care worker or delivery driver who can only afford an old vehicle will have to pay. A further error in only using the Euro 4 and 6 certification scheme is that this ignores the wider global issue of carbon dioxide generation. Many of the cars certified to the newer standards, such as the Vauxhall Insignia reviewed this week, generate twice the CO2 emissions of some older chargeable cars. The push to get people into newer cars does nothing to relieve congestion and ignores the large emissions and pollutants generated by the manufacture of a car and its scrapping. If there is to be a charge then it needs to be lower, e.g. comparable to a bus fare, and levied on all vehicles.

Plan singles out the less well-off

(Image: Artur Lesniak/Reach Plc)

So here we have it, Cllr Goodman on local TV, with a face like a wet weekend, telling us the only way to ‘clean air’ is by introducing a Congestion charge.

Since one of the people on their little transport quango was something to do with Transport for London, I suspected that this would be B&NES’ predictable ‘knee-jerk’ response. Like any normal-minded person I welcome any steps to improve our air quality in Bath, but not by singling out the less well-off and using the money to subsidise bus companies and hauliers while they get their vehicles down to the new emission levels.

Is First Bus acting on the CAZ message on the back of some of its buses, and retrofitting its high-emission buses with cleaner engines, at its own expense? In my opinion, there is little chance of B&NES fairly giving financial support to residents and local businesses that need it most to undertake the upgrades, and check out the Amenity tip on a weekend to see how well ant-idling enforcement would work.

All successive administrations ever needed to do to improve air quality, was to get heavy lorries out of our city, initially by linking the A46 to the A36, and making by-pass provision to take heavy lorries around Bath when coming east from Bristol.

As for congestion zone cameras, I don’t think many of your readers will ever have realised the impact these ugly great black CCTV (ARP recognition) cameras are likely to have on our National Heritage Georgian architecture, not to mention all the extra paint that has to be slapped on our roads.

As I recall, B&NES even came un-stuck operating the bus gate, and were ordered to pay back hundreds of wrongly imposed penalties!

Cllr Goodman claims that the charging zone has been re-drawn to eliminate the chances of any non-exempt vehicles using other routes as rat-runs. Good luck with that one.

And as for the consultation period, it will take many people till Christmas just to fathom out the consultation questionnaire. As usual, I think this is done to dissuade us all from contributing.

Will B&NES be setting up a ‘phone-in line’, to tell people whether their vehicles are exempt or otherwise?

Why not send out the questionnaires with the council magazine to every household?

But now for my main objection, and that is the disastrous effect congestion charging will have on our independent businesses.

Many people will either limit their journeys into Bath, or simply go elsewhere. I’ll bet B&NES councillors and officers alike all drive cars new enough to avoid any possibility of paying a charge.

Finally, I understand Transport for London is sitting on £millions of un-enforceable congestion charge penalties from foreign, stolen and un-traceable vehicles, which means we have to ‘prop-up’ running the scheme, and it is even alleged that when Mayor, ‘Red’ Ken Livingstone had to make an extra contribution to the first year’s running of the London charges.

Zone will kill shops before air kills people

(Image: Artur Lesniak/Reach)

Well done B&NES! If you haven’t made it difficult enough for independent traders in Bath with sky-high rents and rates, followed by hiking parking charges, you’re now ready to deliver the coup-de-grace with a £9 Clean Air Zone charge for shoppers driving into the city. As one shopper put it, it will now cost her £13 with parking and CAZ charges just to walk through the door of a shop.

Ah, say fervent environmentalists the economic cost is worth it because the CAZ will save lives. But will it really? Do particulates and nitrogen dioxide actually cause deaths?

A 2017 University of Cambridge study questions a recent claim that air pollution kills 40,000 people each year in the UK. The study concludes that there may be “attributable deaths” but not actual deaths because no one has death by air pollution put on their death certificate.

It may well make existing illnesses worse but again these can only ever be guesses. One medical study sensationally estimated that particulate pollution may lose “340,000 years of life” every year, but spread over the adult population that amounts to three days per person.

More precisely air pollution can affect those with cardiovascular problems and that may bring forward an early death by up to two years. Overall the study concludes that these are statistical estimates so no one really knows. Perhaps it might make more sense to spend the money it would cost to introduce a CAZ in Bath to help those with particular health problems to move away from the London Road where air pollution peaks at rush hour.

As one commentator put it about the headlong rush to cut carbon emissions by 80 per cent by 2050, the EU estimates the economic impact could make us all 24 per cent poorer.

Whereas the IPCC’s own analysis says estimated unhindered climate change at worse would only reduce the average person’s income by 2 per cent. So why are we giving up 24 per cent to prevent a loss of 2 per cent?

Sometimes, as in all things, the cure can be worse than the perceived illness. Think on that B&NES!

What about traffic of new hotel?

Is it only me, or is their an anomaly in the council trying to deter pollution by charging cars entering the city zone, while at the same time granting a new 198-bed hotel next to the college which will draw 100 vehicles a day to service it?

It would be much better to have a student block right next to college, which would require less vehicular support.

Feeling the effects

Surely no one can object to clean air and the potential health benefit for those living in city areas.

The council's administration deserve a lot of credit for bringing forward tangible measures to improve air quality and I applaud their efforts when previous administrations tinker at the edges, without much effective result.

My concern though is for my residents in Bathavon North Ward. It is an area which provides at least two particular routes that is likely see increased traffic, a potential reduction in air quality, increased traffic nuisance and accident risk effects as a consequence of the zone's introduction.

Charlcombe Lane through the hamlet of Charlcombe and the High Street and Mill Lane to the Bathampton Toll are two such places.

The council really ought to be monitoring current traffic levels and air quality in such areas now so they can either reassure residents that there has been no effect from the zone's introduction or take measures to tweak the zone so that these villages are unaffected by the knock on effect of the Air Quality Zone.

The Prime Minister’s vision of a ‘Swach Bharat’ and open defecation free country did catch attention of the general public and saw the support of many on the ground. But the authorities in the city, even after repeated pleas by multiple activities, citizens and the media, seem to ignore the requests of maintaining the installed toilets in the city.

While several citizens Pune365 spoke to opined that due to lack of basic facilities like lights, availability of water, regular cleaning etc, they tend to avoid using the public toilets, some also said that it is not just the authorities who are only responsible. Some have argued that their failure to provide a clean environment or fix any repairs using a plumbing service similar to I Need The Plumber (ineedtheplumber.com/toilet-repair-service/) means they are more likely to wait until they are home than use public toilets.

Lack of basic infrastructure at a public toilet.Satish Gaikwad, a city-based civil engineer, says that these public toilets are just placed in the city so that no one points at the authorities that they aren’t doing anything. “Think about people in the slum areas or near the Pune railway station, bus depot and others places where they do not have access to toilets. They are the ones who use these public toilets a lot. At least for them they should have installed toilets and clean them otherwise they will resort to going to the nearby river bed to defecate. Moreover, toilets at Swargate bus stop or even Pune railway station are not cleaned. These are public places that ought to have such basic services,” adds Gaikwad.

Sara Screwala, a teacher says, “The toilets are in the worst condition and cannot be used even in times of emergencies. Elderly women, children, pregnant women among others face a lot of difficulty without them. A dirty toilet means an invitation to various diseases. There’s nothing worse that wanting to use the toilet, but you see that it has been blocked and no amount of flushing will help. This is just one reason that looking into something like commercial plumber vancouver and using the services that professionals like these offer will help make all the difference when it comes to maintaining the hygiene of local washrooms. There are these mobile toilets placed at different spots in the city but I have seen a lot of them locked or in a pathetic condition.

“However, it is our fault too that some of us take public property for granted. How much time does it take to flush a toilet? We soil them and say, they aren’t cleaned. Yet, we also cannot get away with the fact that some toilets even do not have 24×7 water supply to deal with this problem. Ideally, it is the authorities and the citizens who need to take the responsibility and try to improve the conditions of the toilet in our city,” she adds.

However, it is not just Pune, many cities in the country are also faced with this problem. Seeing no improvement in the conditions of public toilets in the country, Harry Sehrawat and Archit Aggarwal, IIT-Delhi students, invented a unique instrument to let women take charge of their own safety.

“In my early days I used to see my sister struggle a lot while travelling in terms of getting a clean and hygienic washroom while travelling. Later, my sister was detected with UTI too. This is was the first time I was introduced to the fact that dirty and unhygienic toilets can cause infections and diseases,” says Harry Sehrawat.

“After I got admitted to IIT-D, I came across various projects analysing the conditions of public washroom conditions in Delhi. Lack of poor infrastructure, hygienic environment, cleanliness was some of the problems we narrowed down onto. We thought of two ideas, either develop auto-cleaning devices, hire people to clean the toilet using the machine or completely eliminate the physical contact with the toilet seat. Since the first would cost huge investment, we went with the latter.

“This is how ‘Stand and Pee’ (Sanfe) was developed which allows women to stand and pee too. This device is made of up biodegradable paper that can be used ones and then discarded. The device is designed keeping in mind the biological structure of the intimate part of a women and can be used by anyone, young or old. The device is safe to use, menstrual friendly and is tested by real people. It can be currently ordered online for just Rs 10. It will soon be available at the nearest Apollo Hospital.

“Public toilets in the rural areas are a major problem; hence we will soon be reaching the rural parts of the country and will be making the cost even cheaper in the later weeks. Improving the hygienic conditions in India is our aim hence is targets are the urban poor and rural areas in the country. With the support of the government, I hope we will be able to reach out to the majority of women in the country and provide them with options for safe and hygienic washroom experience,” adds Harry.

““

Boulous Enterprises Limited, (BEL) in conjunction with Suzuki Motor Corporation of Japan have again reiterated the importance of a clean and healthy environment which it says impacts the well being of people. For this reason, the two companies have continued to invest in clean up the world campaign in some cities in Nigeria. This year’s Bolous/Suzuki clean up the world campaign is the seventh edition held in Inagbe Resort and Leisure Island, Lagos, as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR).

Just like the previous editions, the clean beach campaign is aimed at improving the eco system as well as reducing environmental pollution and especially focussed on the fishing communities, which are the major users of the four-stroke marine engine, an upgrade of the two-stroke engine that was banned by the Federal Government in 2012 because of pollution and the danger it poses to health. Speaking at the event, which had in attendance members of the fishing community and graced by the baale of Okun Glass, Inagbe, Chief Ismaila Musa among others; Austin Obahor, Corporate Sales Manager, Boulos Enterprises urged members of the community to always maintain good hygiene by cleaning up their environment.

According to Obahor, though the programme is an annual event, the fishermen should always ensure the shores are always clean. Obahor noted that Suzuki Marine has always aimed at providing customers satisfaction along with excitement on the water in a clean and healthy environment.”To play our part as Suzuki marine distributor in in Nigeria, BEL has organised the Seventh Edition of the Beach Clean UP Campaign at Inagbe Resorts and Leisure Island in Lagos.

“In the past few years, we have carried out this campaign in various fishing communities in Lagos State. In 2017, the campaign was taken to Epe beach as usual for the riverine populace.

“This Clean up exercise is carried out by the staff of BEL in conjunction with fishing communities, the fisheries department of Lagos State Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Environment and the general public around the riverine area where people enjoy boating and fishing exercises, for the propagation of better a sanitation society in order to ensure a healthier environment.” He submitted.

Also speaking at the event, Chief Ismaila Musa, Baale of Okun Glass, Inagbe, told DailyBells Nigeria that they would be glad if Boulos could bring back the event next year.

“We would be glad if they (Suzuki) can come here again next year to organise this type of sensitisation. Interestingly, Suzuki outboard engine happens to be the first engine we used in this environment. I can testify that it is a very highly quality engine.

Speaking on purchasing the engine, he said while there have been individuals who could afford to buy the engine, others can purchase them through cooperatives.

On the clean up exercise, he noted that though the management of the inagbe resort have staff that normally clean the shores of the beach, with the sensitization, members of the village would henceforth join in cleaning the beach as they have been told about the benefits of a clean fishing environment.

The Suzuki beach clean-up is a world event, undertaken in every country where Suzuki has a manufacturing factory and distributors.

Boulos Enterprises Limited (BEL) was incorporated in 1964 by the Boulos brothers Anthony and Gabriel Boulos.

The main focus of their business initially, was trading and incorporation of general merchandise including some brands of motorcycles from Western Europe.

After a few years, they concentrated on the importation of the “Suzuki” brand of motorcycles and outboard motors from Japan and since then it remained a leading motorcycle and outboard motors distribution and assembly company in Nigeria.

The continued growth in Suzuki motorcycle business stimulated the company to establish the first assembly plant in the country at Oregun, Ikeja Nigeria in 1969 existing till date to assembly motorcycles from Completely Knocked Down (CKD) to Fully built up ( FBU) by Nigerian staff.

It is worthy to note this was implemented at the initiative of the company as all other competitors in the country were still importing fully built up motorcycles.

The ban of fully built motorcycles gave the company the impetus to embark on a manufacturing/assembly plant. Considering the bright future of automobile business in Nigeria and the level of technology, the company embarked on the construction of a phased integrated motorcycles manufacturing complex located at its present 25-acre plot at Ogba Industrial Scheme Ikeja.

The present integrated plant has an installed capacity of 150,000 units for motorcycles assembling per annum on a single 8-hours shift per working day.

He promised plantation of 10 billion trees countrywide in next five years.

Prime Minister Imran Khan kick started his ‘Clean and Green Pakistan’ campaign while addressing a gathering. PM Imran Khan said his government has planted one billion trees in Khyber Pakhtonkhwa during his last tenure of government in the province. He further urges that “now we will [with the grace of God] plant at least 10 billion trees in Pakistan under the ‘Clean and Green Pakistan’ campaign.





He assured that Pakistan would serve as the best example for world being the ‘clean and green’ country after five years.

“We need to get out of this mindset that Pakistan will remain same as before,” he told the gathering. PM Imran Khan promised that Pakistan would look cleaner than Europe after targets of the campaign were achieved in five years.

Earlier speaking to the students after planting a sapling, PM Imran Khan said, Pakistan was among the worst affected countries of global warming. He said the global temperature was rising, hence plantation of trees was the need of the hour.

“More trees will ultimately increase underground water, which Pakistan needs the most,” he said.

The decision to launch a cleanliness drive across the country was taken during a meeting of the Council of Common Interests (CCI) presided over by the Prime Minister Imran Khan in September.

While announcing the campaign on October 8, PM Imran Khan said the cleanliness drive in the country had three aspects. First aspect of the drive was spreading awareness among people, especially children, about importance of sanitation and thus incorporate a lesson in this regard in school syllabus of grade-1 to 5.

Second aspect is to provide awareness about dumping sites. He added his government will overcome load-shedding by generating electricity from trash.

The Prime Minister Imran Khan said there will be contests regarding sanitation at tehsil level every two months and the official concerned would be rewarded or penalized on the basis of state of cleanliness in their areas.

Meanwhile, President Dr. Arif Alvi has also appealed to the nation to extend full cooperation in realizing the cherished goal of ‘Clean and Green Pakistan’ campaign.

He urged leaders of all political parties and chief ministers of all provinces to play an active role in the ‘Clean and Green Pakistan’ drive inaugurated by the prime minister. This campaign success can create a healthy and hygienic environment for the people, safe disposal of solid and liquid waste, sanitation and hygiene.

274,https://www.borgenmagazine.com/access-to-clean-water-in-kibera/,"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Borgen Project,Sustainable Solutions and Access to Clean Water in Kibera,"NAIROBI — Located in East Africa, Kenya is classified as a chronically water-scarce country. With a growing population of nearly 50 million people, the average water supply is approximately 690 m³ per capital per annum whereas the global benchmark is 1,000m³ per capital per annum. A division of Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, Kibera constitutes one of Africa’s largest urban slums. It is a place where the brunt of water scarcity is felt every day.

Clean Water in Kibera

Clean water in Kibera is not only scarce, but it is also costly, inconsistent and contaminated; since Kibera is classified as an informal settlement, public services aren’t provided on a compulsory basis. Access to electricity, sewage and waste collection are erratic (if present at all), and education and healthcare are luxuries for the gainfully employed. Water, one of the most precious and basic resources, is commodified by the government and private cartels. Kibera’s impoverished residents are charged more for water than wealthier surrounding neighborhoods. Moreover, if the population is able to even afford the inflated prices, there is no guarantee that the water is clean.

A majority of Kibera’s water pipes are plastic and run above the ground, making them susceptible to structural exploitation. Oftentimes, these pipes crack – either from accidental foot traffic or intentional tampering from a competing distributor – and sewage readily seeps in, tainting the water supply.

Health in Kibera

The contaminated water in Kibera directly correlates to the area’s alarming public health data. Approximately 80 percent of hospitalizations in Kenya are accredited to preventable diseases, with 50 percent of these illnesses due to water, sanitation and hygiene issues. Specifically, bloody diarrheal infection rates and infant mortality rates in Kibera are more than three times the average of Nairobi overall.

It is essential for local governance and pipe infrastructure to improve within the nation. Kennedy Odede, who was raised in Kibera, founded Shining Hope for Communities (Shofco) — a local nongovernmental organization (NGO) that catalyzes large-scale reformations in urban slums. Shofco has since introduced an aerial water network to Kibera, with a piping system that stems from a 100,000-litre water tower. The suspended nature of the network leaves it less vulnerable to vandalism and contamination. As the project expands and connects to more kiosks around the settlement, Shofco anticipates that 84,000 residents in Kibera will subsequently gain access to clean water.

Organizations Working Towards Sustainability

Majin a Ufanisi, a Kenyan NGO, pioneered the Water, Hygiene and Sanitation Enterprise Model (WASHEM) which is mandated to provide sustainable water solutions in Kibera. WASHEM gives youth and women the skills to enter formal, water-sanitation-related employment. In fact, more than 2,000 individuals have been served by their youth-led facilities. The organization also hosts interactive sessions with the Council of Governors and pursues county-level partnerships that promote improved water and sanitation conditions.

Work is being done outside the country as well. Stanford’s Designing Liberation Technologies course is taught every spring at the School of Engineering’s Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, in which students collaborate with NGOs and invent human-centered technological platforms.

M-Maji, which means “mobile water” in Swahili, was one of the first ideas produced by the course. M-Maji collects the daily coordinates of water vendors, so that individuals looking for clean water in Kibera can simply consult their mobile phone instead of wandering around. Coordinates include important information such as the cost and quality of water at a given spot. More than 70 percent of Kibera’s residents own a mobile phone, making M-Maji a viable option for water-seekers.

Creating Tangible Improvement

In a bid to represent all parts of the locale, many Kenyan politicians cite the provision of affordable and clean water in Kibera. However, governance has been shaky at best so the hope is that third-party and NGO advancements will hold them accountable to do better. Shofco officials share that they have been approached by local powers for this very reason.

“The politicians see that we have done what they were elected to do, and in such a short time. They have sent emissaries to us to try and find out whether we have any political ambitions,” says Albanous Gituru, the manager of Shofco’s Kibera program. “But the residents know and understand that we only have their interests at heart. We are not interested in politics.”

Such words paired with actions will enact the kind of sustainable change that Kenya needs. Now, only time will tell how governments, organizations and Kenyans will fare in improving access to water in Kiberia.

Water covers more than 70% of the Earth’s surface. It was with water that life on Earth started, so it is not surprising that all living things on our blue planet need water. Clean water is, in fact, many things: it is a vital need, a home, a local and global resource, a transport corridor and a climate regulator. And, over the last two centuries, it has become the end of the journey for many pollutants released to nature and a newly discovered mine rich in minerals to be exploited. To continue enjoying the benefits of clean water and healthy oceans and rivers, we need to fundamentally change the way we use and treat clean water.

Water is home to millions of species, ranging from the tiniest organisms measured in microns to blue whales up to 30 metres long and weighing up to 200 tonnes. Every year, new species are discovered in the depths of the oceans. The oceans and seas also play a key role in the global climate: they are the largest carbon sink and capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Ocean currents help warm and cool different regions, making them more inhabitable. Evaporation from warm seas can fall as rain or snow across the globe, sustaining life on land.

For us humans, clean water is not simply a vital need for our bodies, it is also a resource we benefit from every day. At home, we use it for cooking, cleaning, showering and flushing. Our food, clothes, mobile phones, cars and books all use water in their production. We use water to build our homes, schools and roads, and to heat buildings and cool power plants. With the electricity we generate from its movement, we light our cities and our homes. On a hot summer day, we dive into the sea or go for a stroll by a lake to cool off.

Water is also a means to connect and move people and goods. It offers a natural transport network around the globe, connecting not only coastal cities but also inland cities along navigable rivers, enabling global trade. Our t-shirts, coffee beans or laptops produced in the Americas, Africa or Asia might be transported to Europe by ships. In other words, water is present in every aspect of our lives.

Unfortunately, the way we use and treat this precious resource not only impacts our health, it also impacts all life that depends on water. Pollution, over-exploitation, physical alterations to water habitats and climate change continue to undermine the quality and the availability of water.

We change the nature of water

When we take water from its source and use it, we almost always alter various aspects of it. We straighten rivers, build canals to connect seas and rivers, and construct dams and levees to cater for our water use. Groundwater extracted from aquifers could be transported hundreds of kilometres to be delivered to our homes. Once used, it can be contaminated by chemical substances (e.g. phosphates used in cleaning products), plastic microbeads or cooking oil. Some of these pollutants and impurities can remain in the water even after undergoing advanced wastewater treatment processes. In the case of agriculture, water used for crops can contain residues of chemicals used in fertilisers and pesticides. After being used and sometimes treated, some of this altered water returns to a water body.

Even air-borne pollutants released by transport and industry can be deposited on rivers, lakes and seas and can impact water quality. Our water use can alter the temperature and salinity levels of oceans. The water used for cooling in the energy sector can be significantly warmer than the water. Similarly, desalination processes can release brine with high salt concentrations back to the marine environment. In the end, what we return to nature is often very different from what we extracted. Moreover, we do not always return it to where we extracted it.

Water quality matters

During the last four decades, Europe has made significant progress in regulating its water quality, treating its wastewater and protecting its marine and freshwater habitats and species. EU policies address a wide range of issues from drinking water, urban wastewater, protection of habitats, designating marine protected areas and bathing water quality to floods, single-use plastics, industrial emissions and restrictions on the use of hazardous chemicals. These specific pieces of EU legislation are strengthened by overarching programmes and legislation, such as the Seventh Environment Action Programme, the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.

And Europeans care about the quality of their water. It is no coincidence that the first ever EU citizens’ initiative, namely Right2water, which was supported by more than 1.8 million signatories, was on water. Awareness-raising schemes combined with water-efficient technologies and investments in leakage management have resulted in real water savings across Europe. The total amount of water abstracted in Europe has decreased by 19% since 1990. Today, more than 80% of the European population is connected to an urban wastewater treatment plant, which significantly reduces the amount of pollutants entering water bodies.

Our recent report on the state of water shows that about three-quarters of Europe’s groundwater bodies have good chemical status: they are clean.

Regular monitoring of bathing water quality showed that about 85% of the EU’s bathing sites monitored in 2017 were ‘excellent’. More than 10% of Europe’s seas have been designated as marine protected areas to help preserve marine species and habitats. These are all very encouraging improvements. Yet, despite the progress made, the ecological and chemical statuses of Europe’s surface waters continue to cause concern.

Of surface waters, only about 39% achieved the EU target of minimum ‘good’ or ‘high’ ecological status during the 2010-2015 monitoring period, while 38% achieved ‘good’ chemical status. Poor chemical status arises partly because pollutants (e.g. nitrates from agriculture) do not just disappear. Water absorbs and moves pollutants around and they end up accumulating in lakes and oceans. Many rivers have been physically altered or impacted by human activities, affecting fish migration upstream or sediment flow downstream.

Many marine fish stocks are over-exploited, threatening the survival of entire fish populations. Invasive alien species spread by ship transport or through canals, endangering local species. Marine litter, dominated by plastics, is found in all corners of the world from the Arctic to uninhabited islands in the Pacific. And, unfortunately, even if we stop new pollutants from entering water bodies, we face the legacy of all the pollutants released to water decades or, as in the case of mercury, centuries ago. And future generations will face the legacy of our releases.

Coping with scarcity and excess

Compared with many parts of the world, Europe has relatively abundant freshwater resources. However, these resources are not evenly distributed across the continent. In fact, according to our estimates, about one-third of the EU territory is exposed to water stress in which the demand exceeds the available supply for a certain period.

Climate change is projected to impact the availability of water in Europe, putting additional pressure on southern regions already facing water stress. Other parts of Europe are expected to face more frequent flooding events, while low-lying regions are at risk from storm surges and a rise in sea levels. Cities and regions are at the forefront of actions on the ground and are implementing measures, ranging from leakage reduction and water reuse to incorporating blue and green areas in urban areas, to minimise flooding risks and water damage.

Some key economic sectors, such as agriculture, use significant amounts of freshwater. In fact, during the spring and summer months, agricultural activities might be responsible for more than half of the water use in parts of southern Europe. Similarly, popular tourist destinations, including small islands in the Mediterranean, might need to provide water for thousands of visitors, putting considerable pressure on their already scarce water supplies.

A local and global resource

Mass tourism is not the only time local water resources come under extra pressure because of non-local users. Global trade enables consumers to use natural resources, including water, from all parts of the world. French wine exported to China also ‘exports’ the water used in growing the vines and making the wine. Likewise, goods imported into Europe also import ‘virtual water’.

In many ways, water is a local resource. Changes to water quantity or quality have direct impacts on the local environment and local population. But water as a whole is also a global body – a common good shared by everyone and all living things on our planet. Water moves across countries and connects continents physically and culturally. Because many large water bodies are connected, what can start as a local problem can become one of many contributors to a larger problem. Conversely, a global problem, such as plastics or higher water temperatures in the oceans, can have more severe impacts locally.

This local-to-global nature of water demands cooperation and governance structures that match the scale of the challenge at issue. It is not surprising that many EU policies on freshwater and the marine environment emphasise regional and global cooperation. The EU is an active player in governance structures, ranging from the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals to regional cooperation structures, such as the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River or the OSPAR Commission for the North-East Atlantic. In recent years, governance structures have rightly involved non-state actors, such as large fishing companies, to ensure the sustainable use of water resources.

Faced with growing demands from competing users, it is clear that the path to the sustainable use of water and its resources goes through efficiency, innovation, preventing waste (e.g. reducing leakage), reusing, recycling – all key components of a circular economy. In fact, when we save one resource, such as water, we save on all others.

Knowledge to help shape future policies

The European Environment Agency works with environmental information. A complex and inter-connected topic such as water requires different data streams, indepth and systemic analysis, and close collaboration with networks and institutions. The EEA brings together all this knowledge on Europe’s environment and informs policymakers and the public.

Over the last four decades, in line with EU legislation and reporting requirements, Member States have put in place extensive monitoring structures. Thanks to these efforts, our knowledge and understanding of the issues and trends relating to the environment, including water, are much more detailed and comprehensive. We can now have an integrated analysis of what drives change, what is changing and how. We can identify effective measures on the ground and build networks to share this information.

This knowledge will be instrumental in shaping future EU policies on water. Some key components of water legislation, including the Water Framework Directive and Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, are being evaluated and might be subsequently amended. Given the vital role of water in all aspects of our lives, a more integrated policy approach will help us protect and preserve what makes our planet unique: water.

It’s particularly difficult in Indigenous communities because they are small, remote and challenged by additional issues to secure essential power and water services.

Drinking water contamination can come from naturally occurring chemicals, such arsenic, cadmium, nitrates, uranium and barium. It can also come from microbes from sewage and animal wastes.

There are also chemicals in farming areas from pesticides, and from mining areas, and also in defence areas that have leached fire-fighting foam into the groundwater (“PFAS” chemicals).

In our research and conversations with residents and water operators in remote Indigenous communities, we have been told that their water is not safe to drink, and that they have no reasonable or practical alternatives and no help.

Hearing from the locals

One Indigenous custodian from Katherine, NT, told us that the levels of PFAS from fire-extinguisher foam were high in their soil and water. Worried locals stopped picking berries or fishing from the river. Despite their protests for action, they said they felt ignored.

Their fears were based on the 2017 testing of water bores around Katherine’s RAAF base with raised PFAS levels. Defence provided bottled water to 50 homes.

Over in the Kimberley, WA, an traditional owner said,

our water is contaminated with nitrates … They say the level is … too high for babies under three months and pregnant women … now the whole community (150 people) cart water from this one tap for drinking and cooking. … We feel fear and we don’t know how much damage is being done to us.

Data reflects the scope and seriousness of the problem. For example, a WA Auditor-General’s report in 2015 found that many communities had unsafe levels of the chemical contaminants nitrates and uranium in the two-year reporting period.

In Borroloola, NT, situated neat a zinc mine, the community were told by the mining company that the ground (bore) water on the McArthur River was contaminated with lead and manganese. Community representatives told us,

[We were told] we should not drink it, and then they said it was safe and that the high lead had come from our pipes and not the mine … a monitoring group said that our fish are toxic with lead from the mine, so we stopped fishing and started worrying … We can’t live with this contamination anymore. We need the water to be clean.

The McArthur River Mining Pty Ltd’s own Environmental Impact Statement reflects that values “exceed” the trigger value for further investigation in sulfate, zinc and lead. Recent statements in the media from the company indicate the levels are safe.

Safe water for all

Treating drinking water can be different and difficult in remote locations compared to cities.

There are different types of drinking water treatments depending on the type of water (freshwater vs saltwater), the cleanliness of the water (lots of sediment vs dissolved chemicals), and the cost of the treatment (remote communities often only use basic chlorine treatment as they are too small to justify the investment for reverse osmosis). Then there are extreme weather events, such as cyclones and flooding, and the “people factor”, including the skills of the water plant operators.

Only now are government agencies and water utilities starting to realise that there are no “one size fits all” or simple technological fixes for treating water in remote areas. Instead, they are beginning to seek water treatment technology specifically designed for these regions. Sometimes the simplest technologies are going to be longest-serving as they can be fixed, will not be damaged in cyclones, and can be operated by one person.

For example, Queensland Health ran a successful pilot project in the outer Torres Strait Islands to reduce microbial contamination of water. They focused on the “people factor” by building the skills of local staff. They addressed the “governance facto” by ensuring that all relevant government agencies collaborated. And they addressed the “technology factor” by upgrading the technology for water disinfection.

Chemicals in water can also be removed with simple technologies that are locally-appropriate. For instance, Indigenous teenager and Science Teachers’ Association WA’s Young Scientist of the Year Uriah Daisybell, from the Christian Aboriginal Parent-directed School in Coolgardie, WA invented a water treatment system by burning shells and combining with magnets to create a charcoal filter. Testing of the filtered water found that heavy metals were reduced to safe levels.

Australia is a vast country, with naturally-occurring chemicals in water and high risk of man-made contamination. Innovation and attention is required to achieve the United Nations’ Resolution to provide safe, clean, accessible and affordable drinking water and sanitation for all – especially in our remote communities.

It is learned that the team came to Miri over the past few days and met up with the natives and held meetings with social rights organisations.

Non-governmental body Save Sarawak Rivers were one of those that the UN team met.

Its chairman Peter Kallang confirmed that the UN team was in Miri visiting various places where the residents had no clean water supply.

The team members visited several settlements in Bakun, Bakong and Lapok.

These settlements had no piped water supply even though there are sources of treated water from treatment plants built by the government.

“The UN team is compiling reports about these social woes pertaining to water supplies,” he said.

Peter said the UN team may give details of their visit to local reporters before they leave the country.

He said matters pertaining to clean water supply are basic human rights everyone is entitled to.

“We in Sarawak still face plenty of issues with regards to treated water.

There are still rural and semi-urban settlements where folks have to rely on rivers and ponds for their daily water source.

“During times of drought, the situation gets worse,” he said.

In July this year, more than a thousand people in the interior Marudi district in northern Sarawak were hit by a water crisis due to acute shortage of clean water.

These rural folks living in Puyut, Lubok Nibong, Rumah Entawal, Rumah Philip, Rumah Merikan and along Sungai Sebatang settlements saw their water tanks dried up from the drought.

Sahabat Alam Malaysia officer for Marudi, Jok Jau Evong said for months these villages had no more clean water for cooking, drinking or bathing.

These places have no piped-water and the folks there depend on rainwater but due to a drought, they have to resort to using murky pond and stream water for daily use.

The Sahabat Alam Malaysia (SAM) office in Marudi received an SOS for help from the desperate residents in July.

SAM headquarters in Penang and the Marudi branch deployed officials to check the situation in places hit by the water crisis.

SAM president S.M.Mohamed Idris later said the situation was distressing.

“After receiving appeals for help from the affected villagers, we sent in a team of officials to check.

“We found more than a thousand folks from these villagers living in distressing conditions.

“They were using murky and polluted water from stagnant ponds and streams because they had no clean rainwater due to the hot spell. These villagers have no piped water.

“The government has not connected them to the water treatment plant.

“Their only source of clean water is from the mountain watershed and from the rain but these sources dried up during the drought.

“These residents are resorting to travelling long distances to Marudi town to buy mineral water for drinking and cooking.

“That is very costly. These rural folks have no stable income since most are subsistence farmers.

“The water from the murky pond and streams are not safe for human consumption,” he said.

Idris said the murky waters in the streams are caused by erosion from land and plantation development projects.

SAM called on the state authorities to swiftly look into the plights of these folks.","Its chairman Peter Kallang confirmed that the UN team was in Miri visiting various places where the residents had no clean water supply.

Following the quake, which claimed an estimated 300,000 lives according to the Haitian government, the infant mortality rate as a direct result of contaminated water has risen and the outbreak of cholera is an ongoing issue.

The CWH Foundation of Canada, better known as Clean Water for Haiti, has been on the front lines since 2001 to install bio-sand filters — an affordable point-of-use filtration system that removes cholera-causing bacteria — and improve locals’ access to clean drinking water.

“Every year in developing countries an estimated 3 million people die prematurely from water-related diseases. The largest proportion of these deaths are among infants and young children, followed by women, from poor rural families who lack access to safe water and improved sanitation,” a UN World Water Development Report reads.

“Access to safe water and adequate sanitation services has proved to be one of the most efficient ways of improving human health.”

Leslie Rolling, born and raised in Armstrong, and her husband Chris Rolling lead Clean Water for Haiti as administrative director and executive director respectively.

“Everybody knows the water is really bad there,” Leslie Rolling said. “In order to see change in Haiti, it has to be a long-term process.”

Rolling has lived in Haiti full-time for 13 years. It all started when she met Chris in 2003.

“He really needed someone to come on staff and do administrative work,” she said.

Now, the couple has raised their family in Haiti and has helped the organization install more than 30,000 bio-sand filters and trained more than 250 filter technicians. However, it wasn’t always easy, Rolling said.

“It was really hard (in the beginning.) Haiti is a very tight-knit community and people didn’t know us,” Rolling said and added that they had originally relied on cold calls to sell the filters.

Now, Clean Water for Haiti employs locals to promote the filters to families in the area.

“It just kind of rippled. We developed this whole model of using community promoters,” she said. “It just fell into place.”

Designed by Dr. David Manz at the University of Calgary in the 1980s, a bio-sand filter is a water filtration system developed from the slow sand filter technology. The cost of a filter is about $100. However, Clean Water for Haiti subsidizes the cost and locals are able to purchase a filter for about $5. Local technicians are also trained to install and maintain the filters.

“We can build it in-country, which means we are supporting the local economy,” Rolling said.

To maintain a constant presence in Haiti, Rolling said the organization balances output and funding to work consistently and be able to assist those in need. Funding primarily comes through third party donors and Rotary International clubs, including a new partnership with Kalamalka Rotary, she said.

“We’ve been working to get more grant funding,” Rolling said. “We’re trying to reach out and some more of that.”

Currently, Clean Water for Haiti has a growing goal of 400 filter installations per month. In July, 430 filters were installed across the country. The organization also tracks usage of the filter at several intervals.

“We keep all that information so we can see how many filters are being used,” she said.

After one year, 95 per cent of filters are still utilized. And, five years after they first began tracking the information, Rolling said 75 per cent of filters are still in use.

“We’re always looking at how we can do what we do better,” Rolling said.

Because for Rolling and Clean Water for Haiti, the hope is to eventually see everyone in the country have access to safe drinking water.

“That change has to happen.”

When Alex Rodriguez learned of the death of a man from his hometown in Canovanas, Puerto Rico, he didn’t see another tally in Hurricane Maria’s human toll. He saw himself.

“I knew where he came from,” Rodriguez said. “He was 27 years old when [he] died, the same age as me when Maria struck.”

The man from Canovanas began exhibiting signs of the leptospirosis after washing clothes in a nearby river. Leptospirosis, a bacteria that can penetrate the skin and spreads through water, can turn deadly if left untreated or treated too late. The man from Canovanas received treatment but not soon enough. He died from the infection.

When Hurricane Maria cut off communities from their water sources, residents collected river water to meet basic needs.

This struck Rodriguez, a doctoral candidate in environmental chemistry at the University of Puerto Rico and an advocate for clean water access.

“Water has always been priority number one for me. It’s a vital source of life,” he said.

Por Los Nuestros

After learning of the man’s tragic death in a local newspaper, Rodriguez picked up the phone at 5 a.m. with an idea. He called a friend of a friend, Jay Fonseca, who works as a journalist and radio host and was starting a group called Por Los Nuestros to help Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.

“We’re going to do solar laundries,” he told Fonseca.

If people could have laundromats powered by solar power, which could also power the pumps for underground wells in many rural communities, they wouldn’t need to wash clothes in the rivers.

“I said, if you want help, I’m in,” Rodriguez recalled.

Por Los Nuestros immediately went to work. Rodriguez and Fonseca went on the radio and within 15 minutes, three companies had volunteered to donate materials. Sonnen donated solar energy batteries, Whirlpool donated washing machines and P&G donated detergent.

The group launched the first solar laundry in Caguas, where one of the island’s fatal cases of leptospirosis had occurred, and continued installing the laundries in communities throughout Puerto Rico.

Almost 12 percent of the island is disconnected from Puerto Rico’s central water utility, the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority, or PRASA. These communities often rely on wells that depend on electric pumps and are vulnerable to power outages.

If power goes out, water becomes unavailable.

After Hurricane Maria, Por Los Nuestros used funding from Direct Relief to energize three non-PRASA systems in Orocovis, providing a permanent clean water system to approximately 1,500 people.

This model is being replicated in non-PRASA communities throughout Puerto Rico, including in the 2,200-person town of Yabucoa, where a power system was completed this week.

It’s Personal

After Hurricane Maria struck, the first thing Rodriguez tried to do was communicate with his family.

Rodriguez’s wife, who works at the Veteran’s Affairs hospital, was on lockdown. Nearly a week past before they could talk with each other. Rodriguez’s father, who lives on a ranch in Rio Grande, was unreachable for days.

His sister, a neurologist in Chicago, specializes in pediatric epilepsy, and immediately began working to get medicines to the island.

“Wherever we can help, we help. That’s how we were raised,” Rodriguez said.

For the next seven months, while working with Por Los Nuestros to get clean water to people, Rodriguez lacked power in his own home, except for a small generator that powered two small fans and his refrigerator.

What Hurricane Maria Exposed

Three weeks after Maria, Rodriguez went to deliver water in Orocovis, a community in central Puerto Rico that was badly impacted by the storm.

Going from house to house, Rodriguez saw that residents had a supply of single use bottles, but no water supply to provide water for daily life.

He met a 93-year-old woman, who reminded him of his own grandmother. “I thought, I have to help,” he said. “They don’t need a bottle of water, they just need water.”

Rodriguez said that the storm pulled back the curtain on the reality of poverty on the island.

When the storm ripped away the island’s green canopy, people could clearly see the homes underneath, many which were poorly built and couldn’t stand up to the mighty winds that swept through.

More than a year later, housing still remains an issue. Rodriguez said in his own neighborhood, 20 percent of homes are abandoned.

Looking to the Future

As he prepares this doctoral thesis, Rodriguez acknowledged that in academia the tangible impacts of research can sometimes take years to materialize, but that hasn’t been his experience with Por Los Nuestros.

“We built it. We did it,” he said.

Editor’s Note: Since Hurricane Maria made landfall, Direct Relief, with support from AbbVie, has supported 78 community health centers and hospitals with 534 emergency shipments of requested medication and supplies totaling more than $70.2 million (wholesale) and 9.7 million defined daily doses. In addition to providing medical material assistance, Direct Relief has worked with community-based groups in Puerto Rico to invest more than $12 million in initiatives to bolster health services and local infrastructure. Projects have included an island-wide vaccination campaign, the installation 791 kilowatts of solar energy and 2 megawatts of battery backup at 14 health centers and non-PRASA communities, a telemedicine initiative to extend health services to rural areas, and equipping Puerto Rico’s medical reserve corps, among others.","Alex Rodriguez and the group, Por Los Nuestros, are working to bring clean water to communities in Puerto Rico.

That no fewer than 46 million Nigerians use the open fields, bushes and bodies of water as convenience is bad enough. What is worse is that even in supposedly modern cities like the federal capital territory, Abuja, it is now becoming increasingly common to see people defecating in the open. That reality was underscored recently by President Muhammadu Buhari while declaring a state of emergency on water supply, sanitation and hygiene in the country. “Access to piped water services which was 32 per cent in 1990 has declined to 7 per cent in 2015; access to improved sanitation has also decreased from 38 per cent in 1990 to 29 per cent in 2015. Our country now ranks number two in the global rating on open defecation as about 25 per cent of our population are practicing open defecation,” the president said.

However, it is our hope that this is not another cynical measure to create an impression of doing something while the problem persists. We recall that in January 2011, former President Goodluck Jonathan launched a similar water road map by announcing some “quick measures to accelerate water coverage”. He also released intervention funds for some projects: drilling of motorised borehole in each of the 109 senatorial districts of the country, rehabilitation of 1000 hand pump boreholes in 18 states and installation of some special treatment plants, and completing all abandoned water projects. Sadly, there were no results to justify the expenditure.

Given acute water scarcity, it is therefore no surprise that sanitation is a major challenge in the country. The evidence is everywhere. The country is one huge field, where people defecate, without shame, and without putting into consideration the impact of their action on the health of others. In many rural communities, people still build houses without provision for toilets, or as the case may be, latrines where waste can be emptied without others coming in contact with it. In the urban centres, the issue is pervasive.

In many of our so-called modern cities, many people use the outdoors as bathrooms and toilets. Many walkways and nearby bushes reek of urine and decaying faecal matters. Some of university communities also spread intense odour as many students, in the absence of clean toilets in the hostels, use any available space as convenience. And experts have consistently warned that when large numbers of people are defecating outdoors, it’s extremely difficult to avoid ingesting human waste, either because it’s entered the food or water supplies or because it has been spread by flies and dust.

In a recent report entitled “High and Dry: Climate Change, Water and the Economy”, the World Bank said: “Water scarcity, exacerbated by climate change, could cost some regions up to six per cent of their GDP, spur migration and spark conflict.” The report claimed that climate-driven water scarcity could hit economic growth by up to six per cent in some regions and that the combined effects of growing populations, rising incomes and expanding cities would see demand for water rising exponentially, “while supply becomes more erratic and uncertain.”

What makes the report even more compelling for the Nigerian authorities is that it contains a serious warning that acute water shortage could deepen the clash between farmers and herdsmen in Nigeria. “Food price spikes caused by droughts can inflame latent conflicts and drive migration. Where economic growth is impacted by rainfall, episodes of droughts and floods have generated waves of migration and spikes in violence within countries,” it said.

We therefore agree with President Buhari that the declaration of emergency on water and sanitation has become imperative to reduce the high-prevalence of water-borne diseases in different parts of the country, which has caused preventable deaths. But it should not end there.

Giving thanks, of course, but also giving through Random Acts of Kindness (RAKs) and supporting local and global giving initiatives. In the beginning of November the Company hosted a customer appreciation & ribbon cutting event at its new office headquarters. The event expressed thanks to customers, business partners, and Law Enforcement officials for their support over the years. The evening also kicked off L-Tron’s current giving initiative, the Clean Water Project. Through the Thanksgiving holiday week (week of giving 2018), L-Tron decided to tie Thanksgiving, World Kindness Day, Black Friday (renamed “RAK Friday” at L-Tron), Cyber Monday, and Giving Tuesday to its corporate giving initiatives.

To date, L-Tron has raised over $3,000 for World Concern, an international non-profit organization that provides sustainable clean water sources for the most impoverished communities in the world by digging and repairing wells and constructing rainwater collection systems. The organization educates about the importance of sanitation and installs latrines to protect water sources and prevent the spread of disease. Currently, the countries involved are Chad, Haiti, Kenya, Laos, Myanmar, Somalia, and Sri Lanka.

Company CEO, RAD DeRose and COO, Gayle DeRose first learned about World Concern in 2017, when their son, Rob, traveled to Chad, Africa with a World Concern team.

Gayle DeRose says, “Clean water, something we easily take for granted, is not available for 2 billion people in this world, our world. How is that even possible?!” She continues, “The true stories Rob shared captured our hearts. We want to support this cause in any and every way possible.”

Instead of pushing Black Friday purchases, L-Tron is encouraging giving from Thanksgiving through Giving Tuesday, to support World Concern’s Project Clean Water. On Black Friday & Cyber Monday, 100% of all Magnetic Mount purchases,valued at $29.95, will be donated back to World Concern. L-Tron is also encouraging users to share their Random Acts of Kindness on #RAKFriday. Not interested in the promotion, but want to give anyway? Donations can be made at https://www.l-tron.com/week-of-giving

L-Tron would like to thank their business partner, Honeywell Solutions, as well as the other businesses and individuals that have generously contributed to this campaign so far.

Coca-Cola in its latest initiative seeks to provide clean water access to over 750,000 people through its latest ‘PAANI’ scheme. As a multimillion transnational brand, Coca-Cola, among other companies of its stature, is expected to work within countries where it operates under an environmentally sustainable template.

Earlier Coca-Cola Pakistan set out to achieve its ‘Replenish’ goal, becoming the first private company of its kind to create an initiative that returns water back to the communities from where it extracts it. Coca-Cola seeks to achieve that by providing water access for productive use and conservation activities with a goal of returning 100% of the water it used in global sales volume by 2020.

The Coca-Cola support system helps fund community-oriented water projects globally but especially in regions that have critical water problems. Most of its earlier work has taken place in Africa where communities in the midst of a humanitarian crisis are most in need of support.

According to a study conducted by the WWF there has been a 10% to 15% decrease recorded in disease outbreaks within beneficiary communities.

Access to clean drinking water is not just a local issue either. With global resources dwindling at an unprecedented pace, the need for a sustainable and synchronized plan, most specifically from corporations, to cater to consumer needs is drier than ever before. The onus of responsibility lies with multi-national entities because eventually, large manufacturing plants are the top consumers of water in any given region, yet it is human consumption that takes higher priority.

CCI Pakistan, which also happens to be the Coca-Cola Company’s 6th largest bottler, has partnered with the World Wide Fund among other organizations to launch a corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative called “PAANI”. The scheme will be focusing on installing water filtration plants in severely under-hydrated areas with an aim to obtain their inhabitants with access to clean drinking water for their daily use.

Back in 2014 Coca-Cola set up its first filtration plant at Malir Karachi and after 4 years WWF alongside CCI and Coca-Cola have jointly installed over 24 filtration plants across the country. Each plant has a daily working capacity of 2,000 liters of clean drinkable water produced per hour, serving an average community of 20,000 people.

Coca-Cola in its latest initiative seeks to provide clean water access to over 750,000 people through its latest ‘PAANI’ scheme.

Coca-Cola ensured that the plants are running on cutting edge purification technologies such as reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration, both of which produce potable-grade water. According to a study conducted by the WWF there has been a 10% to 15% decrease recorded in disease outbreaks within beneficiary communities.

According to the UNICEF, water sanitation, hygiene, and treatment of water-borne diseases cost the economy around Rs300 million per day. To add on top of it the macroeconomic losses incurred by disease and death, would make the overall loss massive when quantified. The main issue lies with children who are not only the most at risk from poor water availability and hygiene but also contribute to the future livelihood of the affected communities.

The UN Commission on Sustainable Development mentioned that in Pakistan alone, 200,000 children die annually from water-borne bacteria. Despite the problem of access to clean water is becoming global in magnitude countries like Pakistan, which is the sixth largest country in the world, is at the forefront of this problem. Earlier Coca-Cola also won the most prestigious award for promotional content within Pakistan that highlights social values and collective effort by communities as each individual contributes to a “bottle for change”.","News Desk |Coca-Cola in its latest initiative seeks to provide clean water access to over 750,000 people through its latest ‘PAANI’ scheme.

Water projects are already underway in the communities of Sagamu, Akure, Ondo, Ibadan and Ogidi. All are home to Salesian programs that provide education and help to meet the basic needs of poor youth and their families.

The project has consisted of a survey within each community, the drilling of borewells and the constructing of areas for water tanks. A finished well in each community will consist of water tanks and plumbing and electrical work.

UN-Water estimates that worldwide 2.1 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water services and by 2050, the world’s population will have grown by an estimated 2 billion people pushing global water demand up to 30 percent higher than today. UN-Water also indicates that around 1.9 billion people live in potentially severely water-scarce areas. By 2050, this could increase to around 3 billion people.

For those who have no access to clean water, water-related disease is common with more than 840,000 people dying each year from water-related diseases. Women and children often bear the primary responsibility for water collection in the majority of households and globally, spend 140 million hours a day collecting water. Children in these communities are forced to walk for hours to collect drinking water—water that often proves contaminated and seriously sickens those who consume it. Many others are unable to attend school regularly because they must spend time searching for distant wells.

“Having access to clean water is essential for the health and safety of those we serve around the globe,” says Father Mark Hyde, director of Salesian Missions, the U.S. development arm of the Salesians of Don Bosco. “Improving water and sanitation facilities brings a sense of dignity for the children we serve and ensures that teachers and students are working and learning in an environment that promotes proper hygiene and has safe drinking water. This reduces the number of waterborne illnesses that can affect those in our schools, keeping them away from important study time.”

According to UNICEF, Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country and the ninth most populous country in the world. With an estimated population of 150 million, one in every five Africans is a Nigerian. The country has been undergoing explosive population growth and has one of the highest growth and fertility rates in the world. By UN estimates, Nigeria will be one of the countries responsible for most of the world’s total population increase by 2050.

While Nigeria has the second strongest economy in Africa, it also has extreme rates of poverty with 100 million people living on less than $1 a day. About 64 percent of households in Nigeria consider themselves to be poor while 32 percent of households say their economic situation had worsened over a period of one year, according to UNICEF. Poverty still remains one of the most critical challenges facing the country and population growth rates have meant a steady increase in the number of people living in conditions of poverty.

Because she spends more time outdoors than most people, Lexi DuPont is on the front lines of the climate change battle. Like most professional athletes, DuPont is so aware of the environment because it is her playground. It’s her church, her school, and her home away from home. She’s on a mission to educate the next generation about just how important it is to take care of our world.

DuPont created a web series called Water Worshippers to document that mission. For her final episode, she traveled to Nicaragua with The Latitude Project to a small village just outside of San Juan Del Sur. The goal of the trip was an important one: to bring clean water to a village that desperately needed it.

“I feel like I am truly living and I truly have purpose when I am able to contribute towards the bigger picture,” she explained to WarrenMiller.com. “Helping people and the planet is one of the greatest gifts I can give. I work hard to bring awareness to some larger issues like climate change, water conservation, and various human rights issues through lifestyle choices, and public speaking.”

The Latitude Project is an organization that works a little differently than most. It’s a very simple difference, but it’s a huge one: they ask. Instead of going somewhere and simply installing or building something they think the people need, they ask the people living there what they need most. “We offer people the opportunity to be the agents of their own change by initiating health, education, and sanitation projects that are locally supported and sustained, because we have a deep-seated belief that grassroots organizations – when founded on the right principles – can create a ripple effect of compassion, change, and freedom,” wrote the founders, Jennifer and Alanna Tynan. After the community has spoken, Latitude makes it possible and gets the whole community involved.

“Without those baseline needs covered—clean water, food, shelter—you can’t prosper,” DuPont said. “You can’t grow as an individual. So being able to provide clean water for this village… there’s no greater satisfaction in this world.”

Now is the time of year when giving thanks and giving back holds even more meaning. than usual. Latitude does it all year around. For $30, you can bring clean water to a family in need.

Dozens of South Philly residents rallied at Bryant Baptist Church in Point Breeze this week for the kickoff meeting of Councilman Kenyatta Johnson’s new Clean and Green Advisory Board.

Focusing on the second councilmanic district, Johnson recently created the coalition, which also hosted an inaugural meeting in Southwest Philly the week prior, in response to significant volumes of concerns expressed by his constituents regarding sanitation and greenery in South Philly.

“This is an opportunity for me to come together with members of the community and come up with a community-driven process to come up with strategies and solutions to address the issue of clean and green neighborhoods,” Johnson said. “And, so, this is the opportunity to get some recommendations on how we can best address the issues.”

For the councilman, the catalyst behind this team, which will meet on a quarterly basis, sparked in early August when neighbors gathered on 21st and Reed streets for Johnson’s “On Your Block” Quality of Life meeting, where recurring concerns surfaced surrounding litter, parking, wildlife and the excessive amount of illegal dumping in local lots and alleyways.

Ideally, this first meeting was intended for residents to recognize immediate issues and foster possible fixes that Johnson can later institute either through short-term tasks, such as calling city agencies, as well as long-term goals, including drafting legislation.

“(Tonight’s meeting) is basically to organize the community and try to get everybody on board with what we’re trying to do to keep the areas clean, clean water, the natural greenery of the city, etc,” said resident and block captain Lorraine J. Yarborough. “So, you have to clean up first before you can beautify what’s going on in the city.”

Ranging from raccoon sightings to recycling bins, residents broke into three groups, sharing their recent encounters regarding the lack of urban cleanliness throughout the second district.

While several concepts came up in conversations, the bulk of discussions boiled down to the illegal and often virulent deposits of trash in empty lots, alleyways and the streets.

This comprised a spectrum of insalubrious activity, including dumping used mattresses without covers, unswept dog waste, unswept leaves, overgrown trees and weeds, runoff debris from from trash trucks, overflowing garbage bags plopped at public trash cans, food intentionally left out as animal feed and the improper delivery of fliers, leaflets and newspapers.

“Everything is extremely nice in the touristy areas,” said South Philly resident Melanie Weiser. “But, once you get out of the touristy areas, there’s no attention to detail.”

The vast majority of meeting attendees attribute these ongoing concerns, which some say exacerbated in light of recent mass development in the region, to the lack of accountability held against not only wrongdoing neighbors but city departments in general.

For instance, Johnson explained that, currently, there is no designated city department to clear and clean alleyways, as, according to city policy, homeowners technically possess the plots behind their houses up to the adjacent properties.

“Obviously, the city agencies have a responsibility, and we’re going to make sure they’re held accountable in addressing the issues and concerns regarding clean and green neighborhoods,” he said. “But, also, as a public servant and a legislator, I’ve learned that some of the best ideas come from the people.”

Throughout the evening, “the people” brainstormed several solutions, which, at their essences, entailed accountability, enforcement and education.

Among the suggestions were stricter crackdown on fines, the implementation of plastic bag taxes, mandatory street sweepings, lids on recycling bins, additional lighting at known illegal dump sites, laws against soliciting leaflets, a city-run program to provide trash cans for residents and the installation of more street signage, including signs in more than one language to cater to immigrant populations.

“I think everybody has ideas. A lot of them are based upon best practices from other cities and what has worked in other cities,” said Stephanie Hasson, secretary of the West Passyunk Neighbors Association and committeeperson of the first division of the 48th Ward. “So, I think it’s great that we have a diverse group of people here from Philadelphia and also transplants from outside of Philadelphia, because we need to have that knowledge bank of what works elsewhere.”

Attendees also encouraged Johnson to consider using some avenue to simply communicate the “do’s and don’ts” of dumping to South Philly residents — whether it’d be through fliers, a televised PSA or crowdsourcing technology like Philacycle.

Johnson says at the next meeting, which has yet to be scheduled, he intends to invite city agents and other social organizations that specifically deal with cleaning and greening and neighborhoods.

“If you make something available for everyone to get involved, you will, number one, incentivize them to do something,” Jim Blanchet, committeeperson of the second division of the 36th Ward, told the crowd. “And, number two, you will snap them out of apathy and they’ll be available to engage in other programs. … You can’t get people to address all of our big problems until you engage them to start to be a part of the conversation.”","During the kickoff Clean and Green Advisory Board meeting, South Philly residents voiced concerns to Councilman Kenyatta Johnson regarding illegal dumping, litter and other sanitation issues throughout the second councilmanic district.

(File photo) Over 1.1 million sanitation workers keep Indian cities clean. (File photo)

Written by Shashi Shikha

Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) has become a ‘jan andolan’ (people’s movement). The mission, unlike any other government scheme, has no budgetary constraints and tries to converge with a number of other programs such as Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna (PMAY), SMART Cities Mission (SCM), Namami Gange and National Urban Livelihoods Mission (NULM). Its effectiveness has been further strengthened through ‘Swachh Survekshan’, which has encouraged cities, panchayats and states to vie for the no. 1 position in cleanlines

In the history of India, no other programme has seen such strong political will and people’s engagement. But the programme has also been heavily criticised for its focus on building toilets. The sustainability of its infrastructural outcomes post-2019 (when the programme is slated to end) is being questioned.

The levying of 2 per cent cess when the programme was launched created popular notions that tax paying citizens are responsible for cleaning our cities. But who really shoulders this responsibility of the public cleaning of India’s roads, garbage dumps and toilets? They are the sanitation workers. Their contribution and significance in keeping India’s cities clean seems to have been lost in the SBM narrative around ‘toilets’, ‘ODF’, ‘plastics’ and ‘nila-hara dustbins’.

Over 1.1 million sanitation workers keep Indian cities clean. They are primarily engaged in sewer cleaning, septic tank cleaning, railway cleaning, and community/public toilet cleaning. More than 500,000 of these urban sanitation workers are women who are mostly engaged in cleaning of toilets, drains, and streets. The newspapers and media highlight the miserable occupational and life conditions of manual scavengers. The plight of those engaged in manual scavenging surfaces in the news only in the extreme circumstance of their death, creating momentary fury among the middle classes. The working conditions of all other categories of sanitation workers such as septic tank cleaners, drain cleaners, toilet cleaners and street sweepers are no better and remain least discussed.

[ie_backquote quote=”The roads of the cities are the workplaces of these women. A formal complaint redressal mechanism, as per the Prevention of Sexual Harassment Act, is absent from the municipal workspace. Women sanitation workers too have their own #MeToo stories.” large=”true”]

Imagine leaving for your workplace every day with the uncertainty of losing your job. The experience of working as contractual labour reiterates fear, threat and insufficiency. The current municipal contractual employment system does not have enabling terms and conditions. Municipalities must design enabling contracts with outsourced vendors, ensuring provisions for leaves (including maternity leave), fair wages beyond the minimum wage, and regular payment of wages on time.

Despite the formulation of laws such as PEMSA (Prevention and Elimination of Manual Scavenging Act), Prevention of Atrocities Act, commissions such as National Safai Karmchari Commission (NSKM), and schemes available through National Safai Karmchari Development and Finance Corporation (NSKFDC) and SC/ST Development Corporation (SDC) at national level and Maha Dalit Vikas Missions at state level, access to ameliorating schemes is a huge difficulty. This is because most sanitation workers are unaware of their rights under these schemes; even when they are aware, they do not know the processes to avail benefits. Further, because most sanitation workers are urban poor and reside in informal settlements, they do not have adequate documents such as residence proof, birth certificates and identity cards making it next to impossible for them to apply for these schemes.

A recent research study by PRIA (Participatory Research in Asia) on women sanitation workers in Muzaffarpur, a city in Bihar, found they experience untouchability, are unable to find employment outside sanitation work, and their children, despite gaining basic level education, are unable to find any other form of employment. The vulnerabilities of caste, class and gender restrict the life choices these women can make. When a woman sanitation worker says that she doesn’t hate picking up garbage but expects that people will treat her respectfully for her work, it brings out an alternative narrative of the ways in which we perceive sanitation work. When a woman who sweeps the roads inside the colonies of the city suggests that each one us is responsible for the waste we generate and we can’t blame the municipality for a city’s unclean status, it further dents the gaze through which we have long been looking at public waste. Women sanitation workers, the research found, have limited access to first aid kits, drinking water and toilets. How uncomfortable would you be, if you could not use a clean toilet when you are menstruating?

The roads of the cities are the workplaces of these women. A formal complaint redressal mechanism, as per the Prevention of Sexual Harassment Act, is absent from the municipal workspace. Women sanitation workers too have their own #MeToo stories.

Trade unions, usually dominated by men and in many cases upper caste men, never allow women’s experiences to gain centre stage in state negotiations. Fair and independent workers unions should be encouraged to promote ‘substantive rights’ with respect to wages, hours of work, and working conditions. Recognition of women’s multiple burden of work will also go a long way in creating a supportive work environment for women sanitation workers.

Finally, socio-economic deprivation of sanitation workers is not just about caste and wages. There is a history of suppression and violence against them in socio-economic-cultural spheres. Hence, sanitation needs to be relooked in conjunction with sanitation workers. There is a need to change the approaches to policies which largely address only the economic aspect of deprivation to also consider the dynamics of social systems such as caste and gender. Equally, it is essential to change the perspective of how we look at waste, who we think is responsible to clean up the waste that we produce, and how we look at the workers who are entrusted to clean public and personal waste.

Swachh Bharat Mission Urban (SBM-U) promised not only to make India clean but also to improve the lives and work conditions of sanitation workers. In changing the realities of sanitation workers, can we change the sanitation outcomes of our cities?

Researchers at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU), Israel, have killed two birds with one stone by developing a solution that turns human excrement into hydrochar, a readily-available fuel.

Dirty waste to clean fuel

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 2.3 billion people still lack basic sanitation service. Of these, approximately 892 million people defecate in the open. Defecating outdoors bears a significant risk of contamination to the fresh water supply and is associated with the death of 700,000 children each year who contact diseases like diarrhea.

Exposure to germs not only puts children at risk of developing diseases but, over the long term, can also cause changes in the tissues of their intestines that prevent the absorption and use of nutrients in food — even when the child does not seem sick. A report authored by the World Bank found a link between open defecation and poor cognition among children. As such, open defecation threatens the human capital of developing countries.

“Human excreta are considered hazardous due to their potential to transmit disease,” said lead-author Prof. Amit Gross.”While it is rich in organic matter nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, human waste also contains micro pollutants from pharmaceuticals, which can lead to environmental problems if not disposed or reused properly.”

BGU researchers sought to address this major world health issue by utilizing a process called hydrothermal carbonization (HTC). Inside a system that resembles a pressure cooker, the team heated raw solid human waste to three temperatures (180, 210, and 240° C) and reaction times (30, 60, and 120 minutes), which dehydrated the excrement, producing a solid known as hydrochar and a nutrient-rich liquid. Previously, the BGU research team had worked on poultry excrement.

Hydrochar is very similar to biochar, with some notable differences. While both are stable, carbon-rich solid by-products, the two chars have significantly different physiochemical properties that affect their potential applications. These include but is not limited to carbon sequestration, soil amelioration, bioenergy production, and wastewater pollution remediation. While biochar is the result of slow-pyrolysis (essentially burning without a flame), hydrochar is produced with hot compressed water instead of drying. Another advantage is that HTC yields higher amounts of char and uses lower amounts of energy than pyrolysis.

Hydrochar can be used as coal, for household heating and cooking, replacing wood. Used this way, hydrochar lessens the carbon footprint of communities by preventing deforestation, soil erosion, and greenhouse gas pollution. Due to the high temperatures involved in HTC process, the resulting hydrochar is sterilized and safe to handle. The aqueous byproduct can be employed as fertilizer, the authors reported in the Journal of Cleaner Production.

It remains to be seen how this technology can be brought to scale to those who need it the most. In the meantime, with World Toilet Day just around the corner (November 19), it’s good to take a moment to appreciate the invention that saved the most lives in history: the flushing toilet.","Millions of people living in the developing world face a double challenge: sanitation and energy generation.

The last deadly flood in the area, from June 18 to 19, 2018, killed 6 people and caused heavy material damage. According to UN-habitat figures, of the 8,000 people threatened by the floods in Attécoubé, six die each year.

It is therefore to overcome such misfortunes that the joint initiative of the staff association of the African Development Bank in Ivory Coast and the Lion’s Club Strelitzia is being implemented. The two parties take the opportunity of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Day to launch a major clean-up campaign in the municipality of Attécoubé. This includes clearing the gutters of these garbage dumps, which prevent the circulation of water, thus creating floods.

The “Nettoyons Atécoubé” (in English, “Let’s clean up Atécoubé”) citizen clean-up day perfectly matches the AfDB’s environmental investment approach in Ivory Coast, with a portfolio of 23 operations amounting to €896 million. On November 7, 2018, the country received a €42.3 million AfDB loan for the installation of mini solar grids in 424 northern rural areas. In addition to benefiting from low-carbon, environmentally friendly electricity, the entire population living in these localities will benefit from the indirect spin-offs of the project, in particular by improving the quality of basic public social services in these localities (education, training, health, hygiene and sanitation, drinking water). The same applies to small businesses, shops, workshops and processing units (particularly grain mills).

The Lion’s Club, for its part, is the largest service club organisation in the world, with 1.4 million members in approximately 46,000 clubs around the world. Lions help communities after natural disasters by providing immediate needs such as food, water, clothing and medical supplies. They are involved in long-term reconstruction work. The organisation has already provided more than $700 million in grants to help fund humanitarian projects around the world.

Residents on a string of coral-fringed islands off Jakarta's coast are battling a tidal wave of trash, with more than 40 tons of rubbish collected daily over the past week, an official said.

Indonesian authorities have deployed an army of staff and a fleet of boats to help clear rubbish-infested shorelines and surrounding waters, underscoring the Southeast Asian archipelago's mammoth marine waste problem.

It is the world's second biggest contributor to marine debris after China, producing about 1.29 million metric tons annually.

This week's clean-up operation is centred on an area known as the Thousand Islands, a popular day trip from the traffic-clogged capital.

Residents of one island have reported dead turtles in the area, although Yusen Hardiman, head of the region's environment department, said it was not yet clear if it was a result of ingesting rubbish.

A sperm whale was found dead last week in a marine park off Sulawesi island with 115 plastic cups and 25 plastic bags in its stomach.

Indonesia's marine waste problem has become so bad that officials last year declared a ""garbage emergency"" after a stretch of coast in Bali was swamped with rubbish.

Some 264 sanitation officers are involved in the ongoing clean-up of the Thousand Islands, while 13 boats regularly patrol trash-choked areas of the archipelago with another 10 set to be added to the fleet next year.

Most of the rubbish clogging the chain of islands is from elsewhere, flushed into the ocean by bulging rivers or swirling currents during the monsoon season, Hardiman said in a statement late Thursday.

Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands, has pledged to reduce marine plastic waste by 70 percent by 2025.

But poor waste-processing infrastructure and low awareness among its 260 million inhabitants prove major obstacles.

Letting food cool too long before putting it in the refrigerator

According to foodsafety.gov, illness-causing bacteria can start to grow in perishable foods within two hours -- one hour if the room temperature is above 90 degrees -- if not refrigerated.

""Time plus warmer temperatures equals growth of bacteria,"" Shelley Feist, former executive director of the nonprofit Partnership for Food Safety Education, told AARP.

If putting a large pot of hot food in the fridge bothers you, Feist said, then put it in smaller containers. ""That helps cool it more quickly,"" she told AARP.

3. Not taking apart your blender to clean it

A simple Google search will return pages and pages of ways to quickly clean your blender without taking it apart. Your appliance will look clean, but unless you remove the bottom to properly clean the rubber gasket, you are flirting with bacteria.

A 2013 germ study by NSF International, formerly known as the National Sanitation Foundation, found salmonella, E. coli, yeast and mold on the blender’s rubber gasket. NSF International ranked the rubber gasket as the third-germiest item in a kitchen.

To be safe, always take your blender apart and thoroughly wash the blades and rubber gasket.

4. Thawing frozen meat or poultry

You bought a frozen turkey, which is fine. How do you go about thawing it safely?

Not, as some believe, by running it under hot water, and definitely not on the counter.

The three safest ways to thaw meat and poultry are in the refrigerator, in cold water and in the microwave.

But even thawing in the fridge can cause problems if you don’t play it safe. Always thaw raw meat or poultry on a plate, to keep any juices contained, and on the bottom shelf, to prevent any spillage from contaminating other food.

5. Not cleaning your knife block

You wash your knives after every use, but then you put them back in a dirty knife block. Today.com reported that Allen Rathey, principal of the Healthy Facilities Institute, said those openings can become a breeding ground for bacteria.

Your knife block should be cleaned at least once a month. First, shake out any crumbs. Then submerge the block in warm, sudsy water. Use a pipe cleaner or baby bottle brush to clean the knife slots. To dry it, turn the block upside down and let it dry thoroughly. If you reinsert the knives before the block is dry, you can trap water and promote bacterial growth.","Your appliance will look clean, but unless you remove the bottom to properly clean the rubber gasket, you are flirting with bacteria.

Source: dailyguideafrica.com

Minister of Sanitation and Water Resources, Cecilia Abena Dapaah, has given a one-week ultimatum to management of Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL) to clean the Weija Dam, which has virtually been inundated by garbage.



The minister made the call on Tuesday when she toured the dam which supplies about 60 million gallons of water daily to Accra.



The outspoken minister was unhappy with the level sanitation at the dam which was constructed in 1978.



Ms Dapaah said, “I am sorry, station manager, you have failed; the place is dirty.”



Under the leadership of the Station Manager, Augustine Atigbire, rubber bags, old metals, wood and other unwanted materials have completely taken over the dam.



Ms Dapaah also realized that writings on the signage, which are supposed to warn visitors, are not visible, with no effort being made by the company to address the anomaly to ensure safety.



The minister pointed out that it was unacceptable for GWCL to be producing water for the general public from a dirty environment.



That, she said, was because water can impact the health of individuals and ought to be handled with care.



According to her, “Good water is life. When the water is not properly treated and you drink it you know the consequence.”



She warned that actions that cause water-borne diseases should not be encouraged, saying “littering is forbidden. Untidiness is forbidden.”



During a press briefing at the dam before heading to the Kpone Water Treatment Plant, she told journalists that “all I want to know is that we are safe with the water that the Ghana Water Company produces.”



Challenges



Managing Director of GWCL, Dr Clifford Briamah, pointed out the challenges faced by personnel at the Weija Dam and the likely threat to water distribution in Accra.



He said out of a total of 12 filters required for the proper functioning of the water treatment plant at Weija, only eight are operational, adding that four broke down about five years ago.



He said $30 million was needed to address the situation, saying “if care is not taken and one of the remaining eight filters breaks down water supply would be reduced by 30 percent.”

Bath's proposed clean air zone will hit the poorest city residents hardest, according to a petition signed by more than 2,300 people.

In the document Michael Stiff, 42, says the proposal is ""really just a tax on the poor and vulnerable dressed up as [a] pollution concern"".

Bath and North East Somerset Council last month outlined its plans to charge £9 for non-compliant cars, taxis and vans and £100 for buses, coaches and HGVs.

It says the scheme is not designed to make money - but to improve air quality by making people change their behaviour.

Mr Stiff, who lives in Larkhall and runs Admiral Tree Services, said the fees will ""really put pressure on those already struggling"".

He claimed: ""The council stands to raise at least £12 million per year, which is really what this is all about.

""The rich, who can afford new or electric cars will not be charged,"" he said in the petition titled Bath Clean Air Zone scam.

""The area is huge and virtually impossible to avoid without creating gridlock on rat runs and smaller residential roads.

""The traffic will be pushed out to already crippled roads, raising pollution around schools and residential areas.

The interactive map below shows the extent of Bath’s proposed clean air zone:

""It will also cripple businesses in the centre that already have to pay criminal amounts of business rates.

""There are other ways to lower pollution, this is not the answer.""

The councillor behind the project, Bob Goodman, has said grants could be made available to help people with less means convert their vehicles to make them emissions-compliant.

This is the first official statement the Bath Labour group has made about the issue:

B&NES Council hit back against Mr Stiff's claims, saying the intention of the clean air zone is to cut harmful gas emissions as quickly as possible.

In August 2017, Bath was named among the 29 most polluted places in the country.

The authority said: ""The council has been told by the government to reduce harmful levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in Bath to within EU and National limits (40 ug/m3) ‘in the shortest possible time’ and by 2021 at the latest.

""High levels of NO2 are widely recognised to be harmful to health – particularly the health of elderly people, children and those already in poor health. In areas of Bath, levels of NO2 can reach over 60 ug/m3 which warrants concern.

""The proposed scheme is not designed to raise money and any revenue raised from charges would first go towards a zone’s on-going operating costs.

""Any surplus revenue would have to be re-invested in projects that encourage cleaner transport and travel in and around Bath.

""It cannot be spent on anything else.""

How to have your say

A consultation is ongoing and the public can have their say on the plans until November 25.

""No decision has been made and we are encouraging everyone to have their say by taking part in a questionnaire and attending drop-in events,"" the council said.

Details can be found at www.bathnes.gov.uk/breathe or at your local B&NES library.

Express News Service

CHENNAI: On August 12, 2018, 51-year-old UAE expat Sangeetha Sridhar set out from Mumbai in a modified Tata Hexa SUV to travel across 310 cities in India to spread the message of cleanliness and carry out ‘surprise’ spot checks, and audit flagship government projects like Swachh Bharat.

Seventy-odd days later, the Coimbatorian has covered over 100 cities and 20,000 km as part of the ‘Clean India trail’. “This trail is an experiential audit of only those public toilets that come in my journey,” says Sangeetha.

With over 75 swachh public toilet audits done, she says that her findings have surprised her. “Due to the Swachh Bharath activism, there are enough number of toilets if you are on the state and national highways. The toilets are of different models and sizes, including compost toilets in a few remote places. Due to the restrained conditions of sustainability and water supply, there are only a few type of toilets which will work in terms of cleanliness,” she explains.

The western toilet model incorporated in few public toilets, she says, does not work. She also points that using Indian toilets most times during her journey is the reason she hasn’t caught any infections. “While the number of toilets has increased, the government should focus on maintaining them,” she shares.

The findings will be handed to the Ministry of Tourism, the Swachh Bharat Mission and the United Nations Sustainable Development Board.

The Clean India Trail was ideated about two years ago and is a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi. “I wanted to travel the country like how Gandhi would have. So from travelling green, being minimalist and sustainable, I planned it all out,” says Sangeetha who embodies the Gandhian principles.

From fashioning a sink made of a water can inside her mini-home, wearing khadi saris and locally made clothes, and reducing the carbon footprint by consciously generating minimal waste, surviving on locally available food, nuts and fruits, she has been doing it all with great panache.

She mostly sleeps in her car and says that her journey has been great so far. “In terms of safety, there is always a fear. So far, the terrains I have travelled to, people were willing to take custody and keep referring contacts. Ensuring my safety in their state seems to be a self-attained mandate. I keep getting calls asking about my whereabouts. This has been a great surprise,” she shares.

Auditing toilets is a task and Sangeetha found it difficult to get used to the smell and sights. “I couldn’t eat for almost three hours after visiting public toilets. Those experiences linger on. But, I had a task on hand and I saw past challenges,” she says.

She drives about 310 km a day, and meets crusaders of the Swachh Bharath campaign, women and children to talk about cleanliness and sanitation. “I met award-winning Swachh Bharat campaigners, sanitation workers and public toilet managers of different levels. We have discussed lack of resources, and I have also requested the caretakers, mostly men, to inspect public toilets that women use so that they can get a better idea about what our needs are. I have also come across some extremely well-maintained public toilets in the country. I have even bathed in a few,” she says.

Her vision is to have an India where women’s safety and cleanliness is a norm and not a cause we are working towards. “Gandhi said that India will be free when a woman feels safe walking in the streets at night. My vision is similar...it is also interspersed with creating an impact on public healthcare by improving sanitation,” she adds.

CE curated a few questions from city-based solo women travellers on sanitation, safety, and paid toilets. Sangeetha says, “When you are solo women travellers, people raise their eyebrows. But when they learn what you have been doing, they start respecting you. More women should start travelling alone. This is a display of empowerment, our skill set and our freedom to journey alone.”

On concerns about lack of clean public toilets and neglected cubicles, she says, “Yes, a cycle of proper cleaning is required in bus stops and other stations. But, if you come across a toilet that isn’t satisfactory, take pictures, share it online, tweet to specific teams and the government,” she adds.","Seventy-odd days later, the Coimbatorian has covered over 100 cities and 20,000 km as part of the ‘Clean India trail’.
“This trail is an experiential audit of only those public toilets that come in my journey,” says Sangeetha.
With over 75 swachh public toilet audits done, she says that her findings have surprised her.
The Clean India Trail was ideated about two years ago and is a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi.
I have also come across some extremely well-maintained public toilets in the country."

SIGN UP Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice

More than 5,000 people have signed a petition against Bath clean air zone plans and have called on the council to ""stop this madness.""

Michael Stiff's document continues to gain signatures after it was launched in early November.

He has expanded on his views in a wide-ranging interview with Bath Live.

The 42-year-old, who runs a tree surgery business on the top of Lansdown Road, said: ""When I saw the details of it I was absolutely shocked.

""I've been operating in Bath for about 20 years. To go down to my customers in the centre, it would cost me £100 a day.""

B&NES Council attracted more than 7,000 responses from residents - one of the highest numbers for any new policy - about the plan.

Many people are supportive, saying drivers must be prepared to take a financial hit for the good of everyone's health. In August 2017, Bath was named among the 29 most polluted places in the country.

But Mr Stiff is concerned about the effect it will have on independent businesses, like his Admiral Tree Surgery.

His ""normal sized tipper lorry"" will be classed as a heavy goods vehicle under the proposal and a trip into the zone will cost £100.

He said: ""It's absolutely disgusting.

""For your average guy to go into the centre to pay £9 in a car before they have even paid parking, is pretty disgusting.

""One of my worries is it's going to have such a detrimental effect on the independent shops which are already struggling.

""You're going to see a lot of shops that fold.""

He added: ""We've got a crazy amount of rat runs so these are going to be compounded.

""It's going to be just absolute pandemonium driving in and around Bath.

""The size of the zone [means] it's going to be hard to avoid.""

The interactive map below shows the extent of Bath’s proposed clean air zone:

He said a new, emissions-compliant version of his tipper lorry costs £40,000. He said: ""That's going to be an awful lot of debt.""

Mr Stiff suggested there was a lack of joined-up thinking among city leaders, evidenced by approval being granted for a new hotel with nearly 200 beds at a Bath College site, which falls within the clean air zone boundaries.

""They pass those projects in the centre which are obviously going to bring more traffic, but at the time of passing there's not much talk about pollution,"" he said.

""Another point is the effect it's going to have on tourism.

""Bath is a tourist city. Think of the poor tourists. It's not a very good welcome to Bath (having to pay a non-compliant vehicle charge).""

In response to the petition titled Bath Clean Air Zone scam, B&NES Council said the aim of the clean air zone is to cut harmful gas emissions as quickly as possible and rebuffed his claims that it is ""all about money"".

The authority said: ""The council has been told by the government to reduce harmful levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in Bath to within EU and National limits (40 ug/m3) ‘in the shortest possible time’ and by 2021 at the latest.

""High levels of NO2 are widely recognised to be harmful to health – particularly the health of elderly people, children and those already in poor health. In areas of Bath, levels of NO2 can reach over 60 ug/m3 which warrants concern.

""The proposed scheme is not designed to raise money and any revenue raised from charges would first go towards a zone’s on-going operating costs.

""Any surplus revenue would have to be re-invested in projects that encourage cleaner transport and travel in and around Bath.

""It cannot be spent on anything else.""

What's the alternative?

Asked what he sees as the solution to Bath's air quality woes, Mr Stiff said: ""There's nothing that's easy.

""It always seems to be the stick with B&NES - they will hit you with a fine.

""We see the ebbs and flows of the traffic. When the school holidays happen it's a dream to move around Bath.

""There's barely any traffic and I think more [emphasis] should be placed on how to get children to school ... and put the onus on some of the schools and also the private schools.

""By introducing this clean air zone what you're really effectively doing is you're pushing all the traffic from the centre and you're going to push it out into the residential areas.

""If it was really about pollution this wouldn't be an answer. You're literally moving it around.""

He added: ""It might take them a year or two to happen for the installation or infrastructure and after that they will be quids in and it's going to be the poor people in Bath to pay for this.

""We're all struggling. Working our hearts out and it's alright for a chief executive.

""But what about the majority of the people? It's going to decimate so many businesses in the centre.""

The long-term Larkhall resident said Bath is a ""stunningly beautiful place to live"".

""I love Bath and for me and my business there's plenty of work,"" he said.

""I do understand that we need to address traffic but I don't feel that the style where you punish people is the answer.

""They can't afford this.""

(Express Photo/Abhinav Saha) The boy cleaning the toilet at Thyagaraj Stadium. (Express Photo/Abhinav Saha)

Inside the building at Delhi’s Thyagaraj Stadium, a group of children played football with cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar as part of UNICEF’s World Children’s Day celebrations. Outside, the 13-year-old boy sat alone, wearing an orange vest, tired after spending the day cleaning the men’s washroom in the building, and loading and unloading water canisters during the event.

Feeling left out from all the excitement inside, the boy said: “Mujhe accha nahin lag raha hai (I’m not feeling very good).” All that he knows, he said, is that his mother sent him to work here for the day. “I have been at the venue since 8 am, and will be here till 5 pm. I will get Rs 350 for this work. This is the first time I am working, I go to school usually,” he said, adding that he stayed near the stadium with his parents, elder sister and two younger brothers. “My father works in the pantry of an office and my mother works as domestic help,” he said.

UNICEF “works in 190 countries and territories to save children’s lives, to defend their rights, and to help them fulfil their potential, from early childhood through adolescence”. And apart from Tendulkar, who is the UN body’s goodwill ambassador, Tuesday’s event was attended by Dr Yasmin Ali Haque, UNICEF India representative, and Hrushikesh Senapati, director, National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT).

All of them participated in a panel discussion around the theme of ‘Schools as a supportive environment for children’. Attended by around 800 children, the discussion was followed by a game of Unified Football — mixed teams of children with physical and intellectual disabilities, and those without — with Tendulkar.

The sanitation and cleaning work at Thyagaraj Stadium, which is run by the Delhi government, is outsourced to ACME Excellent Management. When contacted by The Indian Express, an ACME representative said that housekeeping staff at the UN event were not hired by them. “The staff hired through ACME perform regular cleaning work at the stadium. When private events take place, the event organisers bring their own housekeeping staff,” the representative said.

According to an official from the Delhi government’s Directorate of Education, which also holds charge of sports, all additional staff are hired by the organisers for private events. “The stadium only has enough staff for basic requirements. We do not have the capacity to deal with the additional load of events. All additional requirements of security, sanitation and crowd-management staff is arranged for by private event organisers. Even if the Directorate holds an event, we deploy additional staff, albeit through the stadium caretaking. But it is very clear that we do not have any child working on the premises,” the official said.

A UNICEF spokesperson told The Indian Express that the organisation follows a zero tolerance policy with regard to issues such as these and that this matter requires enquiry. “We follow a strong due diligence process with all our partners and suppliers. Our event organiser Indebo has made it very clear that the boy had not been hired through them… we will be writing a letter to Thyagraj Stadium authorities expressing our discomfort that something like this happened, and will also investigate whether this lapse was by the stadium or our supplier,” the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson also pointed out that multiple events are held at the stadium, indicating that the boy could have been hired for another event. However, the directorate official said that while a school zonal tournament had been held during the day, no additional staff was deployed for that event.

For the 13-year-old boy, meanwhile, it was a day to remember. “Tomorrow, I will be back in school,” he said.","The boy cleaning the toilet at Thyagaraj Stadium.

On World Toilet Day , Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari and the three mayors of the municipal corporations on Monday unveiled a mechanical solution for cleaning sewer lines procured by Sulabh International, a social service organisation.What simply appears to be modified pick-up truck mounted with a host of equipment may finally prove to be a life-saving device. KamAvida, a Pune-based company, has developed this “jetting-cumrodding-cum-mechanical manhole desilting machine.Anupam Sukhija, a representative of the firm, said, “Each unit is capable of executing diverse functions, including jetting through a high-pressure pump, desilting using the hydraulicsoperated grabber (a handlike attachment) and rodding using a detachable mini-machine that runs on electric power.” The rodding unit is a replacement for bamboo sticks used by manual scavengers to churn and push sewage.Usually, large sewer machines cannot be taken into the small lanes in unauthorised colonies and urban villages forcing the ground staff to enter the death lines. “We have kept the width of the vehicle at only six feet. In narrower lanes, the detachable rodding unit that needs only two feet space can be used,” Sukhija said.Each unit houses a water tank for jetting and a sludge compartment to collect the silt, which is usually left along the sewer during manual cleaning and transported later.The sewer cleaner costs Rs 43 lakh and is manned by four people, including the driver, operator and helpers. “The company will provide three-day training to the workers,” an official said. The developers expect that it will create a new business model that will help bring manual scavengers out of this vicious death cycle. Sulabh said that in the past three years alone, over 1,300 people have died due to manual scavenging.Sulabh founder Dr Bindeshwar Pathak said this machine will ensure that no safai karamchari will need to enter sewers risking their life and dignity and violating the Manual Scavenging Act.The three mayors have agreed to procure a few units. Tiwari said that no one should think about jurisdiction on a matter like deaths in sewers. “I have asked the corporations to procure the machines and provide them to the sanitation staff,” he added.DJB’s plan to procure 200 such machines has met with procedural delays. The agency, which maintains the extensive sewerage network in the city, had planned to launch the first batch on Gandhi Jayanti, but not a single unit has been procured till date. DJP vicechairman Dinesh Mohaniya said that work orders have been issued and the units are currently being manufactured. “While 80 machines will be put into operation in December, the rest will be procured in phases,” he added.","NEW DELHI: Even though many guidelines, laws and reform measures are in place to end deaths due to manual scavenging, they have met with limited success.

(Photo by Pavan Khengre) During the drive on Monday. (Photo by Pavan Khengre)

‘It’s my first day in Pune, wasn’t aware of the ‘no spitting’ rule,” said an IT employee hailing from Delhi.

“Wasn’t chewing anything. I was talking and suddenly something flew in my mouth,” claimed an autorickshaw driver.

“Wow! Criminals are getting away with murders and I have to pay a fine for spitting,” wondered an unemployed youngster.

These and many such excuses were offered by road users who were caught red-handed while spitting on roads by civic officials on Monday when teams from the sanitation department of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) spread across 16 major squares in the city as part of a drive to stop spitting in public places.

But none of the excuses could save these offenders from the punishment: a Rs 150 cash penalty and cleaning the spittle off the road amid public glare. Each of the 270 offenders who were caught by civic officials within two hours — 12 noon to 2 pm when the drive was held in the city — were handed a mop and a bucket of water which they had to use to clean up the road they had dirtied.

Starting from just one ward office in Bibvewadi, the PMC had kicked off the drive on October 31 to implement the Maharashtra government’s order dated September 7, 2018, which delegated the rights to municipal bodies to impose a ‘spot fine’ on individuals or organisations who do not comply with the provisions of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. As per the rules, while civic bodies are responsible for maintaining the areas under their jurisdiction, the citizens are also expected to fully co-operate by not littering public places.

On the first day of the drive, sanitary staffers attached to Bibvewadi Ward Office of the PMC caught 23 offenders, of which 19 were made to clean up the mess. “The idea of making the offender clean the spittle came to us after we came across offenders who refused to pay the Rs 150 fine amount. Some said they won’t pay, some said they don’t have money to pay the fine. So we decided that as a settlement, we would ask them to at least clean up their dirt. Later, seeing the psychological impact this had on the offenders, our seniors directed us and sanitary officers in other wards to compulsorily make every violator who is caught to mop the spot in addition to the cash penalty,” said Vikram Kathawate, Deputy Sanitary Inspector, Bibvewadi ward.

From November 2, the drive was extended to four other wards and till November 11, a total of 160 offenders were penalised. From Monday, the drive was spread across the city under all 15 ward offices of the PMC. “On Monday, we caught 270 violators on just one day. We wish to keep up the momentum by carrying out the drive in more areas… The government has set a fine of Rs 150 for spitting in public places, throwing garbage on roads (Rs 180), open defecation (Rs 500) and littering (Rs 200).","Criminals are getting away with murders and I have to pay a fine for spitting,” wondered an unemployed youngster.

The exercise which started at about 6:00 am, was fully participated by the Municipal Chief Executive, Mr Michael Mensah, some local Zoomlion officials, staff and others from Accra.

Also in attendance were some leaders of the Pentecost Church within the area, church members, particularly the youths, residents as well as market men and women.

Areas cleaned

The exercise took place at the main business centre, new market, Zongo, Walantu and the roads leading to Bojuase, Accra, Winneba, Nyannyano, CP and Obuom.

Choked gutters and drainage channels in all the aforementioned areas were properly desilted while Zoomlion trucks collected all the garbage and filths away, a situation that changed the atmosphere in the town.

MCE’s appreciation

The Chief Executive of the Ewutu Senya East Municipal Assembly, Mr Michael Mensah expressed deepest appreciation to the Church of Pentecost for their enviable initiative that would help to improve sanitation.

Speaking to the Chronicle, he said “It has never happened before that a church will dedicate part of it financial resources and time to impact positively on society within which they operate”.

Due to the densely populated nature of Kasoa coupled with the brisk daily business activities in the town, generation of solid waste on day-to-day bases, has become inevitable.

Waste management

In view of this, the MCE, Mr Mensah told this reporter that the Assembly has made the proper management of waste a topmost priority, and has therefore put in place measures to control the situation.

He said, “Our target has always been about how we can manage the generated refuse. Measures such as provision of adequate number of bins and containers for proper disposal have been put in place”,

Mr Mensah continued that “Frequent and proper emptying of the containers and technologically managing the final disposal site to recycle the generated waste are some of the measures the Assembly has adopted to deal with the situation”.

Participants

About 1500 participants, majority of whom came from the Church of Pentecost, took part in the clean-up exercise while the church gave dust bins to the Assembly.

During the exercise, shops were kept closed until 10:00 am while hawkers and other businesses done on the pavement were warded off.

Purpose of the exercise

The clean-up exercise formed part of the Church of Pentecost’s nationwide year-long sanitation campaign dubbed “Environmental Care Campaign”.

It aimed at supplementing the desire of the government to improve cleanness in the country and create awareness of sound, land, water and air pollutions.

It was a collaboration of the Church of Pentecost, Zoomlion Ghana ltd, and the government of Ghana.","The Ewutu Senya East Municipal Assembly, Zoomlion and the Church of Pentecost on Saturday, held a massive clean-up exercise at Kasoa to rid the busy market centre of filth.

By Ikechukwu Nnochiri

ABUJA – A coalition of Civil Society Organizations, CSOs, on Thursday, expressed concern over delay in the execution of the proposed clean-up of oil spillage in Ogoniland, despite the availability of $177million that International Oil Corporations, IOCs, released for the exercise.

The group, led by the Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, CISLAC, urged the Federal Government to speed up the procurement process of selecting contractors and deploying them to engage in the clean-up process.

In an address he presented at the 2nd Annual National Summit on the Niger Delta Clean-up, held in Abuja, the Executive Director of CISLAC, Mallam Auwal Musa, noted that field observation and scientific investigations the United Nations Environment Project, UNEP, conducted since 2011, revealed that oil contamination in Ogoniland was widespread and severely impacted many components of the environment.

He said: “The Niger Delta region occupies a central place in the political economy of Nigeria. The region remains the mainstay of the Nigerian economy. But unfortunately, as a result of oil exploration and exploitation, the Niger Delta’s physical, political, social and moral environment has been completely destroyed.

“The livelihood of the people have been destroyed and the region is in economic crisis with high levels of insecurity, cult activities, brigandage, kidnapping and unwarranted killings.

“Over the years, the response of government to the crisis in the Niger Delta characterized by legal response, military response, project response and agency response have failed to arrest the underdevelopment and environmental degradation of the region.

“We have consistently argued that any approach for the development of the Niger Delta must focus on three issues: Human Development, Justice and Equity.

“For us, the entry point is environmental governance in the Niger Delta. It is only through environmental governance that laws, policies and procedures will be implemented to achieve a healthy and sustainable environment in the Niger Delta.

“It is through good environmental governance that the key stakeholders (government, oil companies, local communities and citizen groups) will be able to perform their roles to ensure a healthy and sustainable environment. It is through good environmental governance that we will be able to eliminate conflict and environment entrepreneurs who feed on the crisis in the Niger Delta.

“The Ogoni clean-up exercise provides an opportunity to establish the basis for good environmental governance in the Niger Delta”.

He said the UNEP report had emphasized that the environmental restoration of Ogoniland could take 25 to 30 years.

“The clean up of Ogoniland is envisaged to be a combination of approaches ranging from active intervention for cleaning the top soil and replanting mangrove to passive monitoring of natural regeneration.

“The report proposes emergency measures including provision of drinking water, public awareness campaign and signs warning citizens of contaminated sites. The report recommends that steps must be taken to stop ongoing contamination and end illegal oil related activities.

“The Report proposed clean-up of surface water, restoration of swamplands, setting up of Integrated Contaminated Soil Management Centre and Centre of Excellence for Environmental Restoration, treatment of contaminated sediments, decontamination of ground water and mangrove restoration, in addition, the Report recommended comprehensive medical examination of citizens by physicians and a focused medical study”.

Similarly, the Executive Director of the African Centre for Leadership, Strategy & Development (Centre LSD), Mr Monday Osasah, said the theme of the summit “Environment, Wellness and the Community”, was timeous in view of environmental realities of the people of the Niger Delta that elicited the UNEP report.

“While we appreciate the Federal Government for its political will and commitment to clean up the Niger Delta, and the setting up of HYPREP as a body and a project to oversee the clean up process, we believe the gamut of processes from the emergency measures to the clean-up are all targeted at ensuring environmental and community wellness, the reason government has to make good its promise by adopting an aggressive approach towards the emergency measures and the cleanup of Ogoni land and the Niger Delta.

“Truth must be told that the postponement of the clean up commencement date and non-completion of the emergency measure does not portend good for the people of the Niger Delta and the country at large particularly with the availability of the sum of US$180 million in the project account.

“Cleaning the Niger Delta is social justice, and having achieved relative calm so far, we believe that further tampering with citizens expectation by the lull and constant postponement of the clean up might be problematic”, he added.

They launched the report at the 12th session of the Committee of Director-Generals of the National Statistics Office, which took place in Khartoum, Sudan.

On SDG 6, the report finds that access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation has improved in Africa but remains very low by global standards, despite the fact that Africa, excluding North Africa, receives the largest amount of official development assistance (ODA) for water supply and sanitation. In addition, there are wide disparities between and within countries, with higher access in North Africa compared to the rest of the continent. The proportion of people with safely managed sources of drinking water varies from 100% in Mauritius to 19% in Eritrea. Further, 43% of Africa’s rural population has access to basic drinking water services compared to 82% of the urban population. The report identifies several emerging challenges that threaten progress on SDG 6, including climate change, droughts, floods and water management.

On SDG 7, the report finds access to electricity has increased from 39.7% in 2008 to 45.9% in 2014 in Africa. Despite this progress, access to electricity is “much lower than the global average” and rural-urban disparities are “particularly stark,” with an average electrification rate of 70% among the urban population compared to 17% in rural areas. Hydropower generation accounts for slightly over 60% of Africa’s electricity supply but other renewable energy sources, particularly solar, remain “largely untapped.” Africa’s efficiency in energy use has improved but biomass reliance remains a challenge, with approximately 780 million people cooking with solid biomass.

On SDG 11, the report states that Africa is the fastest urbanizing region in the world, with the urban population predicted to increase from 40% today to 51.5% by 2040. The report reflects that much of the continent’s urbanization is “unplanned…and poorly managed,” and is characterized by severe service and infrastructure deficits and social and spatial segregation as well as the world’s highest proportion of slum dwellers. In addition, the report finds that Africa’s cities have made limited progress on air pollution and solid waste collection, loss and damage from disasters, access to public transport and urban sprawl, constraining the region’s efforts to achieve inclusive growth.

On SDG 12, the report finds that Africa, excluding North Africa, wastes more than 30% of its annual food production as a result of poor post-harvest handling, with most losses occurring at the level of production. Africa’s domestic material consumption remains low.

On SDG 15, Africa’s rate of forest cover loss is “much higher” than the global average. In contrast to this regional trend, Ghana and the Gambia have increased their forest cover as a percentage of their land area. Like other regions of the world, the report observes Africa faces the risk of extinction of major animal species. On a positive note, Africa outperforms most world regions in the conservation and sustainable use of its mountain resources.

The report also reflects on SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals), emphasizing that the development of science, technology and innovation (STI) are key for achieving the SDGs and Agenda 2063. The report finds that Africa’s STI infrastructure, as measured by internet access and access to electricity, “is improving but relatively weak” and characterized by low investments in research and development and fragmented innovation systems. The report recognizes the investments made by Kenya, Morocco, South Africa and Tunisia on research and development and strategies to strengthen their innovation systems. The report also underscores the need for strengthening inter-sectoral planning and collaboration to ensure coherent, effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063.

The report recommends that policymakers, inter alia: prioritize investments in water and sanitation to improve access, enhance health outcomes and leverage populations’ productive capacities; improve rural access to energy to address rural-urban disparities; improve access to energy-efficient cooking stoves to enhance energy efficiency, reduce pollution and improve health outcomes; and provide incentives to drive investments in renewable energy. The report also calls for strengthening capacities for urban planning and management to drive inclusive and sustainable economic prosperity and integrating urbanization in national development planning.

Participants discussed the report’s findings at the 13th African Economic Conference (AEC), hosted by the UNECA, AfDB and UNDP in Kigali, Rwanda, from 3-5 December 2018. Adam Elhiraika, UNECA, called for investing in data and analysis on urban trends and impacts of environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainable development, among other recommendations. Chidozie Emenuga, AfDB, said the potential of Africa’s rapidly growing cities and urban settlements “has not been fully tapped.” He urged providing incentives to investments in sanitation, renewable energy and access to electricity.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Andrew Robertson is flying to Honduras today. Lou Harrington flew to Peru on Saturday.

Robertson, a civil engineer, will be checking in on a project under way to provide safe drinking water to 1,800 residents in three villages in southwest Honduras.

“In the dry season, December to April, these people have to walk two hours to and two hours from the river to get water,” Robertson said. “In the wet season, May to November, they walk 30 minutes to puddles.”

................................................................

Harrington, a landscape architect with extensive experience in international development, is attempting to lay the groundwork for establishing waste-treatment plants in Peru’s Urubamba Valley, the Sacred Valley of the Incas in the Andes. It’s an ongoing effort, thwarted in the past by changes in the country’s political leadership.

Robertson, 46, and Harrington, 58, both Albuquerque residents and both fluent in Spanish, are volunteers with Water Engineers for the Americas (WEFTA), a nonprofit founded in 2002 by a group of engineers and professionals at Souder, Miller and Associates (SMA), an engineering firm with headquarters in Santa Fe. WEFTA’s mission is to work with communities throughout Latin America to make safe drinking water and proper sanitation available.

“In developing countries, water can mean the difference between life and death,” said Peter Fant of Santa Fe, CEO of SMA, a founder of WEFTA and president of the WEFTA board. “Forty percent of hospitals in developing countries lack access to water and sanitation. Lack of water can become the barrier that keeps girls out of school because women and young girls are responsible for fetching and hauling water.”

The heart to help

WEFTA evolved out of Waterlines, another Santa Fe nonprofit started in 1986 to provide basic water systems, latrines and hygiene education in developing countries.

Harrington said WEFTA was started to tackle water and sanitation projects that required a technical expertise beyond that available at Waterlines, projects such as the Honduran waterline Robertson is inspecting this week.

Robertson said that project, about 50 percent completed, is one of the most complicated he has confronted in his career. It includes 14 miles of high-pressure transmission pipeline that goes downhill, across a canyon and then up a thousand feet, all through mountainous, jungle terrain.

“We welcome these more complex projects,” Harrington said. “We are lucky at Souder, Miller because we have access to so many civil engineers.”

Harrington, who worked six years for Habitat for Humanity in Peru, Colombia and Mexico, and Robertson are both SMA employees. The company uses its WEFTA connection as a recruiting tool and Robertson, who did volunteer work with the Save the Children organization in Honduras after Hurricane Mitch hit that country in 1998, said that sold him on the firm.

But WEFTA volunteers don’t just come from SMA. They come from everywhere there are people who have the heart to help others.

“People who are in the water industry are inclined this way,” Fant said. “If you want to make money, you don’t get into building water systems. ”

Now, more than 50 volunteers work on WEFTA projects in Bolivia, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama and Peru.

They include:

⋄ John Lincoln, 70, of Boise, Idaho, a retired civil engineer and WEFTA board treasurer, who has provided technical advice for WEFTA projects in Bolivia, El Salvador and Peru.

⋄ Scott Rogers, 61, of Bountiful, Utah, WEFTA board vice president and president of a Utah civil engineering firm, who has worked with WEFTA projects in Bolivia and Peru.

⋄ Blanca Surgeon, 54, WEFTA board secretary, who is from Honduras but lives in Santa Fe and works for a nonprofit that provides technical assistance, training and funding to rural communities in New Mexico. She has assisted in WEFTA projects in Honduras, Guatemala and Bolivia.

Rogers said he was attracted to WEFTA because it is a relatively small organization.

“There are many organizations that do what we do – Engineers Without Borders, Water for People – but they are so big,” he said. “For me, the hands-on approach is better. Scope out a project, do it, keep track of it. You’ve got to have someone on the ground coordinating the project, seeing that it continues. Stay small and responsive and reactive.”

Shovel power

WEFTA gets its funding from foundations, non-governmental organizations, companies and individuals. It supports its volunteers with air fare, expenses related to the WEFTA project, and the cost of visas and vaccinations, etc. But the volunteers donate their time.

The communities aided by the project kick in as much monetary support as they can afford, up to 40 percent to 60 percent of the cost, and most of the labor. Robertson talks about a column of 100 people with shovels, spaced 30 feet apart, digging trenches for pipelines in Honduras.

“They’ll dig a trench up to 3,000 feet long in a day with shovels,” he said. “Here (in the states), contractors will get 600 feet in a day using power equipment.”

Robertson will spend a week in Honduras and Harrington a week in Peru.

“Nothing ever goes as fast or as efficient as you think it will,” Robertson said. “The problem with building an infrastructure is there is no infrastructure. It’s not like they have everything except water.”

But the rewards are worth the frustrations along the way.

“Working with WEFTA is the most satisfying thing I have done professionally,” board treasurer Lincoln said. “You are helping people who have never had clean, running water, and they are so appreciative.”

308,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/frontline-climate-change-why-clean-water-decent-toilets-and-good-hygiene-are-essential,"Thu, 06 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",ReliefWeb,"On the frontline of climate change: Why clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene are essential for communities affected by climate change - World","Every day, an additional 110,000 people are forced into water scarcity: WaterAid

A new ranking by WaterAid of developing countries shows where millions of people are already losing their right to water, increasing their vulnerability to the impact of climate change.

Sudan, Niger and Pakistan are the top 3 countries with the most threatened water supply, based on new analysis of Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative measures of access to water, climate patterns and water usage rates.

UN Water has estimated that 3.6 billion people lived in water-scarce areas in 2016, a number expected to increase to around 5 billion by 2050[i]. This is the equivalent of an additional 110,000 people a day, or at least one more person added to those living in water-scarcity every second, leaving entire communities unable to find clean water to drink or wash themselves and exposing them to fatal diseases such as cholera.

By 2040, 600 million of those living with water scarcity will be children. This is nearly twice the population of the United States.

Richer nations, which have done most to cause the carbon emissions leading to these disastrous events, have pledged $100 billion a year for poorer nations to deal with the consequences, but are failing to deliver. Contributions to climate finance are falling short and are used mostly to mitigate carbon emissions, rather than adaptation, in which water, sanitation and hygiene services are essential. In 2016, only $23bn was spent on adaptation globally, just 6% of total climate spending.

WaterAid Chief Executive Tim Wainwright said: ""The world's poorest countries will be most impacted by climate change, while they have done the least to cause carbon emissions. Helping those countries to adapt to these challenges has been neglected, putting millions of people's lives at risk."" ""Access to clean drinking water and a safe place to relieve yourself are top priorities following natural disasters. By providing water and sanitation systems that can better withstand the impacts of floods, droughts and heavy storms, and by having response plans for communities on the front line of climate change, they get a fairer chance at a healthier, longer life. This requires drastic action, including financial commitments, from those countries that contributed most to climate change.""

Increasing unpredictability of droughts and floods together with sea level rises are among the clearest signs of the impact of climate change. This affects the poor and most marginalised most, especially those without reliable access to water, sanitation and hygiene. The resulting threats include fatal diseases, undernutrition, stunting, and economic and educational losses.

In Niger, which ranks second in vulnerability of its water supply, about 64 percent of the rural population does not have access to clean water close to home, and 11,500 children die of diarrhoea each year.

In Bangladesh, a country prone to flooding, less than half the population have access to a decent toilet. If toilets are not made to withstand high waters, faeces will spread and increase the risk of disease significantly.

At this year's Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, WaterAid is calling on:

Governments, donors, financial institutions and the private sector

to recognise that water, sanitation and hygiene are essential elements in climate change adaptation. Communities that do not have sustainable water supplies and sanitation cannot recover quickly from natural disasters, and will face even greater hardships.

to provide funding beyond regular foreign aid, without removing funding from existing foreign aid budgets. Existing overseas development aid is not enough, and additional funding needs to be made available by wealthy industrialised nations that created this crisis.

Developed countries to keep their promises on climate finance and ensure that investment is used for adaptation. In 2016, only 6% of total climate spending was spent on helping countries adapt. And on international organisations and climate funds to support developing countries to complete a National Adaptation Plan, allowing countries to lay out their priorities, so the necessary resources can be allocated to meet those needs.

My name is Agilinko Rosina. I am a form two student of Siniensi Junior High School and I would like to talk about Clean Water and Sanitation. What is clean water?

Clean water is when water does not contain any germs or dirt. To begin with, many people across the country do not have access to clean water, they either drink from wells, rivers, lakes, and other unclean sources. They use the water from these same sources for cooking. Once this water is contaminated, they can easily contract diseases and sometimes die or put pressure on our hospitals or clinics.

Furthermore, sanitation is very bad in the Builsa land. People throw rubbish anywhere and the gutters are full of rubbish and stagnant water, which helps mosquitoes to breed. These mosquitoes bite us and infect us with malaria which affect our work and studies. We spend money on hospital bills, which could have been used for something else.

In addition to that, poor sanitation affects us a lot, lack of dustbins in our markets, schools, and on our streets cause people to dispose rubbish anywhere, our animals take in these rubbers and die which is a financial loss to we ourselves. We all know that it is our livestock which we sell to get money for our basic needs in order to reduce poverty.

Also, the lack of toilet facilities and urinals in our communities and public places make people to defecate in the open, and in water bodies like rivers and dams which pollutes the water. Flies sit on the faeces, pick up the germs and come into contact with our food, contaminate it and bring about diseases like cholera and diarrhoea when we eat it.

To solve all these problems, we must first know that water is life and we cannot live without water. Therefore, the government and the District Assemblies should provide us with boreholes and pipe borne water. In Siniensi for in stance we do not have portable water. Efforts should be made to provide us with pipe borne water.

More toilet facilities and dustbins should be provided in our schools, markets, clinics and in individual with the help of our district assemblies. It is surprising that Siniensi J.H.S do not even have a toilet facility, so how do we practice what our teachers teach us?

We should always clean around our houses, wash our cloths and utensils thoroughly, wash our hands with soap under running water before eating, after visiting the toilet and after returning from funeral houses where we may have shaken hands with others.

We must also practice personal hygiene like brushing our teeth twice daily, shaving our pubic hair, bathing with soap and water, avoid sharing personal items like toothbrushes, sponges, blades and shaving sticks, braziers and under wares and many others.

We should eat warm food, heat our leftover food before eating, boil our water to kill germs before drinking and report to the nearest health facility for regular check up or when we suspect any signs of sickness.

In conclusion, I advise you all to co-operate with me, practice hygienic measures so that we can live healthy and work together for the development of our beloved country Ghana. My name is Agilinko Rosina and thank you very much for listening.

This article is written by Agilinko Rosina, a member of the Debate and Leadership Team of Siniensi J.H.S. Rosina is currently in final year, i.e J.H.S 3. This article was written and presented to her collegue students at her school, Siniensi J.H.S on 26th July, 2018 when she was in form two (2).

Touched and worried about the attitude of citizens towards sanitation, steeped in unhygeinic practices as well as the lack of access to portable water in her community and amongst other places she visited in the country or sees and hears from the news bulletins, which lead to deaths and diseases, she is thoughful and wonders what happens to the future should this continues. As a dream to for citizens of any background to have access to portable water and to practice hygeinic measures, she writes the following article.

311,https://communitynews.org/2018/12/20/hopewell-pastor-will-run-marathon-to-help-clean-water-crew/,"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Community News Service,Hopewell pastor will run marathon to help ‘Clean Water Crew’,"As reported in the Express last April, the Clean Water Crew youth group at Calvary Baptist Church in Hopewell is raising $12,000 to support a clean water and sanitation project for a hill tribe village in northern Thailand managed by the Integrated Tribal Development Program, a nongovernmental organization in Chiang Mai dedicated to providing and improving village drinking water, irrigation and sanitation systems.

Setting a fiscal target of $12,000 wasn’t the only goal. The small youth group also wants to raise awareness about the current global water crisis. So they made a rule: no one can contribute more than $12 to their project, so that the six members of the Clean Water Crew can be sure of reaching at least 1,000 people.

Through December, the Clean Water Crew had reached about a quarter of their goal. But when Calvary Baptist Church pastor Dennis O’Neill noticed that crew members’ were starting to hit a bit of a wall — 1,000 people and $12,000 is a tall order after all — he took matters into his own hands. Or, you could say, his feet: O’Neill, 61, pledged to enter the Philadelphia Marathon, scheduled for November 2019, with the aim of raising more awareness for the Clean Water Crew and thus finding enough sponsors to fulfill the crew’s goal.

O’Neill is no runner. He ran his first 5K last year helping to raise funds for an organization that supports families with kids who need transplants. “So doing a marathon seems a daunting task right now, but I’m determined to do it because I think the global water crisis is something that needs to be addressed,” he says.

O’Neill says the kids chose their focus after he did an exercise with them in which he asked them what they would do if they could do anything to change the world. on dollars and they could use it to change the world? The most passionate answer was I want to give peopel clean water.

With a year to train, O’Neill is running 5K’s twice a week with increasingly long runs on weekends—fairly typical regimen for a prospective marathon runner. “I’m hoping to avoid injuries and just finish next November,” he says. “It is very hard to raise $12,000 [when] allowing each person to give no more than $12,” O’Neill says. “Probably as hard as running a marathon for the first time at 61.”

O’Neill says the crew chose the project in Thailand because they have been assured that all the money raised will go directly to the project, in which a water piping system will be constructed to carry water several miles from its source to the village. The $12,000 is to be spent entirely on supplies; villagers will do all the labor.

“These people use the water for everything—drinking, cooking, watering crops. They also use it for their latrine, so it’s often a problem with disease.”

O’Neill joined Calvary Baptist Church 12 years ago. He was supposed to be there for six months, but he says, “I fell in love with the folks and they asked me to stay, which was great.” He grew up in Philadelphia, where he attended seminary.

“Every 90 seconds around the world, another kid dies from a water related disease,” O’Neill says. “That haunts me. I feel like I need to do something.”","So they made a rule: no one can contribute more than $12 to their project, so that the six members of the Clean Water Crew can be sure of reaching at least 1,000 people.

Suddenly, the sound of gunshots pierced the air. Teachers yelled to the students to run and hide. ""We were running where we could not hear the gunfire,"" he recalls. The year was 1985 and rebels from southern Sudan were waging a war for independence against the government in the north.

Dut escaped that day with others who fled into the bush. The group walked for months, sometimes going days without food or water, before reaching the Itang Refugee Camp in western Ethiopia. Dut, a member of the Dinka tribe, was one of approximately 20,000 child refugees displaced during the second Sudanese civil war. Children like Dut who became separated from their families while fleeing the conflict, most of them between the ages of 7 and 17, became known as the Lost Boys of Sudan.

When a community has a stable source of safe drinking water, girls who once spent their days collecting water have time to go to school. ""Nowadays to see girls go to school is a wonderful thing,"" says Water for South Sudan founder Salva Dut. © Water for South Sudan

Dut was one of approximately 20,000 child refugees displaced by war who became known as the Lost Boys of Sudan

Six years later, Dut and others were once again uprooted as Ethiopia became embroiled in a civil war of its own. Dut led a group of 1,500 boys on an even more difficult journey, running more often than walking to evade the violence that surrounded them. By the time the group arrived at the Kakuma Refugee Camp in northern Kenya, 18 months had passed and nearly 500 boys had been lost to hunger, thirst, disease and military attacks.

Dut stayed in Kakuma until 1996, when he received sponsorship to live in the United States with a family in Rochester, New York. It was 11 years since the day the soldiers came, and he still did not know if his family was dead or alive.

Dut's father's illness led to family reunification and the founding of Water for South Sudan

In 2002, Dut finally received news about his family. A fellow refugee informed him that his father was alive — but seriously ill with guinea-worm disease, a rare and painful waterborne illness. The elder Dut was being treated in a UNICEF-supported clinic, which he reached after walking 300 miles.

Dut traveled back to Sudan for a joyous family reunion. “It was a wonderful moment. It was emotional for both of us to see each other again,” he recalled. “I took the water and put it on my head, as a sign of welcome back for someone who was lost.”

No longer lost, and with a new determination to help those like his father who had fallen ill because of unsafe drinking water, Dut returned to the United States. In 2003, he founded Water for South Sudan (WSS), a nonprofit organization that aims to provide access to clean, safe water and improve hygiene and sanitation practices in areas of great need.

In 2005, borehole drilling work began, with the first well installed in Dut's father’s old village. Since then, 349 wells have been drilled. More than 300,000 people now benefit from the clean water provided by the wells.

South Sudan declared independence in 2011, and Dut is committed to helping the young country grow. ""How long does it take to start a country?"" he asks. ""How long does it take to raise a child? To make your enemy a friend? We will plant the seed and keep going. Everything must be sustainable.""

A stable water source builds community

Before the wells, “these nomadic people would move away when the dry season came to go and look for water,"" he says. ""Now they were getting stable in one place. You see them building nice houses, you see the market is coming in. A clinic is coming in. The school is getting built.""

""Other agencies come. UNICEF has been doing great work in South Sudan providing schools for these new stable communities. And to see the young girls not have to walk miles and miles collecting the water and to have the opportunity to go to school because the well is close by has touched my heart so much.""

Violent conflict, access to resources and displacement are interconnected

Recognizing and addressing the interconnection between conflict and access to resources is crucial in ensuring sustainable development initiatives and peace-building. In 2014, WSS launched the United Peace and Development Project in partnership with Aqua Africa, installing 19 wells and 1 water storage system with an emphasis on collaboration between the Dinka and Nuer groups, which have been in conflict for many years. It is hoped that such initiatives will eventually foster sustained cooperation and that children and their families will not be uprooted and separated by violence.

With so many people throughout the world today forced to flee their homes because of conflict and lack of resources, a focus on programs that will reduce displacement is vital. “My dream was to go home,” Salva mused as he spoke about his time in the refugee camps. “Every person living in a refugee camp, their dream is to go home.”

Only 50 percent of the population in South Sudan has access to safe water. To date, Water for South Sudan has received support and contributions from all 50 states in the U.S. and 50 countries. To learn more about the organization and how you can help, visit www.waterforsouthsudan.org.

The National Rural Drinking Water Programme has failed. And it is indeed a matter of great disillusionment for a nation whose population suffers every single day to have access to clean and non-polluted water.

Editorial Staff

The National Rural Drinking Water Programme is scheme that has been sponsored by the Centre to ensure that every person living in rural India has access to clean and portable drinking water. This also implies that every household will have access to water that can be used in cooking and for several other domestic needs. The scheme was launched under the Bharat Nirman Project by the UPA Government.

The supply was thought to be a remarkable move in ensuring that all rural households had access to clean and pure drinking water through pumps and piped water supply. Despite the apparent importance of the scheme and the reality that had it been implemented properly, it would have brought a great deal of difference in the lives of the rural population-in reality the picture looks paradoxical.

More than 163 million Indians do not have access to safe drinking water, about 78 % of 1.7 million rural Indian habitations have access to the minimum required quantity of water. It is also ironic that despite having spent more than Rs 89,956 Crore on the project so far, the government has failed to reap the benefits of the project.

The audit report produced by the government that was produced in August,2018 said that the policy even failed to provide two buckets of safe drinking water per person per day which was half of the complete target that was set. The report said that the project had failed to deliver because of poor execution and poor management.

Government of India, launched the National Rural Drinking Water Programme, with an aim and objective to provide every rural person with adequate safe water for drinking, cooking and other basic domestic needs on a sustainable basis, with a minimum water quality standard, conveniently accessible all the time.

The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation gave emphasis on piped water supply in rural habitation and for that the ministry proposed to have stand posts or household connection to ensure safe drinking water is accessible to all. The Government of India provides financial and technical assistance to States under the National Drinking Water Programme, as the states government is vested with the power to plan, approve and implement drinking water supply schemes. The Ministry of Drinking water and sanitation has targeted to achieve its target by 2022.

An evaluation done by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, reported that the government has failed to meet its short term target even. Despite spending 90% of Rs 89,956 crore budgets over five years to 2017, the programme has “failed” to achieve its goals. Most of the failure of state agencies to meet their targets is due to structural dis functioning, as most of the design and structures of the plan were designed by the authorities without consulting with the local communities which led to failure of the structure involved. People lack ownership and hence maintenance became an issue of sheer neglect. A report by the World Bank stated that people treat water as a right to be provided free-of-cost by the government, making systems financially unsustainable. And in recent times rural households have started to demand high level of water as opposed to the 1990s data, when village tube well, well, water pumps fulfilled their needs.

As per the report provided by Water Aid India, the water scarcity in India is set to worsen as the overall population is expected to increase to 1.6 billion by year 2050.

Water tables, the level below which the ground is saturated with water, are falling in most parts of India. Minerals like fluoride, arsenic, mercury and uranium are present in groundwater. This is when groundwater contributes to 80 per cent of India’s drinking water and nearly two-third of irrigation needs.

As per the report submitted by the committee on restructuring the Central Water Commission (CWC) and the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) 2016, if the current pattern continues about half of the demand for water will be unmet by 2030. More than 60 per cent of India’s districts face groundwater over-exploitation and serious quality issues.

Most of the drinking water which is consumed in the rural parts of India, is groundwater precisely and according to a 2012 United Nations Educational Study, India is the world’s largest consumer of groundwater, with an extraction rate of 251 cubic kilometer annually.

A study conducted by World Bank in 2015 shows that nearly 28.1% of deaths in India took place due to communicable diseases, linked to unsafe drinking water consumption and lack of hygiene practices. More than 11.5 million people in India are at a high-risk of bone crippling diseases like fluorosis. A study done by Ministry of health and family welfare identified 19 states that were severely affected by high fluoride content in drinking water and at least 10 states suffering from arsenic contamination causing Arsenicosis – a disease affecting the lungs, skin, kidneys and liver due to arsenic poison.

Overall, water crisis is felt equally in both urban and rural parts India, with ground water reaching its saturation points and other natural resources either being polluted or channelized by the state for dams and reservoirs. It has become increasingly difficult to meet the water demands of the country’s growing population. Water crisis is not an issue for which only the state is responsible, it is a collective civic duty to be mindful about water use and wastage, without collective cooperation of the state and the people there can be no way forward in finding a solution to this ever growing problem.","WATERThe National Rural Drinking Water Programme has failed.

ICRC staff and volunteers of the Sudanese Red Crescent Society (SRCS) who had been trained to carry out these tasks undertook the repairs in Mukjar town, Brindisi and surrounding villages.

One of the people who can now obtain water by using these hand pumps in Mukjar and surrounding areas is Sheikh Mohammed Abdeljabar. Sheikh Abdeljabar was displaced from his home in Zoowa in 2007. He fled to Mukjar to avoid the fighting that was happening at that time. Though he is now relatively safe in this new place of residence, he has found it difficult to cope with the lack of water close to his vicinity.

Sheikh Abdeljabar's situation has been made more challenging because he is a person with a physical disability and he found it impossible to undertake the 4-hour journey to and from the Wadi (a valley) where some water was available. The Sheikh said he often spent up to a week without water.

""My neighbour, he has a donkey and so he was always able to go and fetch water from there. He was always gracious enough to give me one jerry can of water per week,"" said Abdeljabar.

While his neighbour deserves commendation for this kind gesture, Abdeljabar needs a lot more than this quantity of water to meet his weekly needs.

After an assessment was conducted, the ICRC-SRCS team repaired all the faulty hand pumps that were scheduled for fixing in Mukjar. One of the repaired hand pumps is located 50 meters from Abdeljabar's residence.

""I am glad that the ICRC repaired the hand pump closest to my house,"" he said with a smile on his face.","One of the people who can now obtain water by using these hand pumps in Mukjar and surrounding areas is Sheikh Mohammed Abdeljabar.

Today it’s around two US cents. Computer processing power has also increased exponentially: it doubles every two years. This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to technological progress in the 21st century.

There have also been tremendous advances in communication technology; robotics; nanotechnology; genetics and artificial intelligence, among other things. This merging of digital, physical and biological worlds has come to be known as the “fourth industrial revolution”.

So far, relatively little attention has been paid to the overwhelming potential of the fourth industrial revolution to catalyze much needed transitions to a more sustainable society – particularly in the developing world.

The value of green technologies to African cities is they are largely decentralized or semi-decentralized.

This is slowly starting to shift. The World Economic Forum recently published a set of briefs as part of its “Shaping the Future of Environment and Natural Resource Security System Initiative”. These documents have begun to address some key questions around the potential role of the fourth industrial revolution in supporting a sustainable development agenda.

There are many compelling reasons for combining the offerings of the fourth industrial revolution with new green technologies, infrastructures and systems to tackle the developing world’s challenges. Multiple benefits can be realized through introducing these offerings in new, innovative ways that are customized for local contexts.

These green technologies can generate employment, ease pressure on infrastructure in rapidly growing cities and lower energy costs, especially for poorer households.

Chance for change

Unplanned slums and informal settlements present systemic problems in most developing world cities. This is particularly the case in both large, established and smaller, emerging African cities. Municipalities are under strain. They simply don’t have enough bulk infrastructure—water, sanitation, electricity and waste management facilities—to cater for growing populations.

The value of green technologies and systems is that they are largely decentralized or semi-decentralized. Examples include solar panels, energy saving devices, and small-scale wind and hydro energy technologies. These don’t require major infrastructure investment. And their decentralized nature enables them to keep up with cities as they change.

The introduction of green technology solutions and systems can also bring down household costs. Between 50% and 70% of poor African households’ budgets are spent on food, water, energy and transport. This makes them vulnerable to external shocks such as sharp rises in the costs of electricity, oil and petroleum, food and water.

These factors are also interlinked: for example, if oil prices rise, so do the costs of transport and food. That places extra pressure on already struggling households.

Green technologies can buffer poor households from these shocks by decoupling them from their dependence on local grids and provincial, national or global supply systems.

That’s at a household level. Then there’s the bigger picture. Absorbing green and sustainable technologies can help seed small to medium enterprises on a large scale and increase their investment appeal.

This, in turn, can drive economic growth and get cash circulating at the levels where it’s most needed.

Introducing new technologies to a city is a great job creator. People are needed to install solar panels, solar water heaters, biogas digesters, energy savings devices; or to set up urban agriculture and permaculture operations. There are already examples of this in several African cities.

Unlocking opportunities

And, perhaps the biggest boon of them all: the fourth industrial revolution presents a massive opportunity to leapfrog African countries’ productive economies into a wholly new space.

Economic diversification and development on the continent could benefit considerably from harnessing the opportunities emerging in the green technology and fourth industrial revolution spaces. This will shift them onto a significantly new economic growth and developmental trajectory. It will also go a long way towards ensuring that as emerging economies develop, they will do so in a manner that doesn’t exacerbate climate change and environmental degradation.

A number of African countries are already positioning themselves to harness this opportunity. Both Rwanda and Ethiopia, for example, have placed green economic development and sustainability at the heart of their national economic development strategies and plans. More recently, Kenya has committed to actualizing a 100% transition to green energy by 2020.

Other African countries would do well to follow these nations’ examples. The fourth industrial revolution is here. Combining it with green technology is a way for the continent to benefit at all levels.

Last week's U.K.-based news story about bacteria-ridden kiosk screens at eight U.K. McDonald's locations has raised substantial concerns across both the restaurant and kiosk industries just months after QSR giant, McDonald's introduced the self-ordering stations. Sister website, Kiosk Marketplace, spoke to players in the industry that provides the self-service ordering units to foodservice and found that the news was prompting players across the kiosk industry to look into current and best practices when it comes to ongoing restaurant kiosk sanitation .practices.

In the U.S., the refreshment services company, Bernick's, operates more than 70 micro-market kiosks in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota. Bernick's Director of Vending Reed Stevens said the news about the micro-organisms —like listeria and staphylococcus —found on those London-area McDonald's kiosk screens is creating a stir across his business.

""This report is something that's going to open eyes for a number of people,"" Stevens told Kiosk Marketplace.

In fact, after seeing the report, Stevens decided to have his company's service representatives clean self-checkout kiosks with disinfectants every time they visit a location. The service representatives had been cleaning the kiosks, he said, but were not using a disinfectant. While Bernick's has been operating micro market kiosks for several years, Stevens said he was not made aware of any need to apply a disinfectant.

""There are all these kiosks that people touch all the time. The awareness around (what) the sanitation looks like is really important."" -Crystal Swanson, CSA Service Solutions

Chuck Lewis, vice president of Palmer Digital Group, has been active with different manufacturers deploying self-order kiosks and menu boards for restaurants for several years, but he was not previously aware of bacteria concerns. He pointed out that self-order kiosks are new to QSRs, and the bacteria is an issue that needs to be addressed. He believes daily cleaning should be a sufficient solution.

Sanitation practices already exist for health care kiosks, and they are being applied to some foodservice kiosks, said Crystyl Swanson, vice president of sales and marketing at CSA Service Solutions, which provides preventative maintenance services for kiosks. Swanson said federal regulations specify cleanliness guidelines for hospital kiosks, such as check-in kiosks.

CSA Service Solutions does not have any QSR clients at the present time, Swanson said, but the company does clean Reis & Irvy's self-serve frozen yogurt and ice cream kiosks on a nationwide basis. The kiosks have order touchscreens.

""It's extremely important to have some type of preventative maintenance procedures in place,"" Swanson said, especially for food distribution.

Swanson said sanitation is a critical issue for all types of customer-facing kiosks, not just health care and foodservice. ""There are all these kiosks that people touch all the time,"" Swanson said. ""The awareness around (what) the sanitation looks like is really important.""

NSF International, an independent organization that tests, audits, certifies, trains and consults for the food, water, health science, sustainability and consumer product sectors, does not currently have any sanitation standards for customer-facing kiosks in a foodservice environment, according to Audra Bildeaux, the organization's senior business development manager for food.

Bildeaux told Kiosk Marketplace there is a standard for cleaners for consumer devices such as smartphones and tablets, but not kiosks. The organization's standards are voluntary.

In a presentation at this year's National Restaurant Show, Bildeaux said new sanitation standards will be needed to protect the safety of consumers and foodservice employees as new types of equipment are introduced to the foodservice environment.

Hazel Crest, Illinois-based Advocate South Surburban Hospital maintains a website that said that infectious disease specialist, Dr. Brian Yu stated that the risk of catching an illness from fecal matter from the ""everyday"" environment is low. He said the best defense is for people to practice proper hygiene.

One study found one in six cell phones are contaminated with fecal matter, while other research has noted similar issues with baby toys and cribs, computer keyboards, toothbrushes and a large number of other everyday items.

Who doesn’t want to live in a clean and a healthy environment as seen in the pictures on the left? Nature made everything for us, clean and green. It is up to us to preserve nature or nature takes everything from us. We all Ghanaians need to be responsible to improve sanitation in our surroundings. Gone too soon and what a shock that we normally write on obituary cards can be reduced if we take action to sanitise our environment.

One of the UN’s Sustainable Development Themes is Healthy Environment, Healthy People. The UN’s agenda 2030 on Sustainable Development (2016), states that a “healthy environment is integral to the full enjoyment of basic human rights, including the rights to life, health, food, water and sanitation, and quality of life.” When we continue to litter our gutters and open spaces with garbage we create breeding environments for mosquitoes and pathogens to infect our lives with diseases. The cost burden on both the government and ourselves to find a good healthcare to remedy our illnesses is beyond comprehension.

Then, what is the point of the National Sanitation Day if we clean and refill? On every National Sanitation Day, we do our best to clean the gutters to open up the sewage systems. The following day, we fill up the gutters with trash again. We are not getting anywhere. We need civil responsibilities. There must be a stringent law to punish people who are caught littering around.

We can make Ghana clean and green by

limiting the use of plastics and using paper bags instead

prohibiting littering and punishing offenders

implementing effective waste collection and management schemes

growing green grasses and trees; grasses can reduce erosion.

making ourselves responsible citizens

Impacts

Reduction in the rate of epidemics

Increased life span, safe life

Reduction of medical burden on the government

Reduction in disaster cost (cost savings from NADMO)

Access to healthy foods, clean water, clean air

Increase in development and foreign investments

Increase in tourist attraction

Serene environment to feel/ connect to nature

Relief and good thinking

According to researchers at the University of Minnesota's Earl E. Bakken Center for Spirituality & Healing, your personal environment impacts your wellbeing as follows:

Influence your mood

Impact your behavior and motivation to act

Facilitate or discourage interactions

Create or reduce stress

Yes! You feel happy when you enter the botanical gardens or when you visit the Kakum National Park. Studies have also shown that children who live in less stressful communities do well at school. Also, nobody wants to have a long chat with a friend near a littered and a smelling gutter. Everybody would want to add to the waste when there is already a heap of waste. Make Ghana Clean and green! The cleaner our environment and the longer our trees, the longer we live.

But the notion of being ""clean"" can be unrelated to health and lead to over-bathing.

Some animals, like Capuchin monkeys, dirty themselves on purpose as a form of protection.

If you've ever had a pet, you've likely put some effort into keeping your furry, feathered, or scaly friend clean. Some animals make that easy by preening, licking, and grooming themselves. But others seem not to care about getting dirty as they splash in puddles and investigate smelly garbage bags.

All animals have it in their best interest to maintain a healthy level of hygiene, though. James Hare, a biological sciences professor at the University of Manitoba, told INSIDER that animals will do whatever they can to accomplish this, at least to the level they desire.

""The fact of the matter is that those animals that can reach their bodies and appendages self-groom,"" he said. ""Virtually any animal that can, does.""

Here's how different types of creatures keep a healthy level of cleanliness.

Many species have evolved to have specialized anatomy and behaviors to maintain their hygiene

Forager bees use all their limbs to clean their body of accumulated pollen. Shutterstock

All cats, big and small, have scratchy tongues covered in tiny, hook-like hollow spines. These structures work to deliver feline saliva deep into cats' fur, ensuring their coat stays clean and their bodies stay cool. That's vital for a busy cat hunting antelope on the savannah or chasing ladybugs in your apartment.

Even honeybees have a grooming routine.

Guillermo Amador, a researcher in physical intelligence at the Max Planck Institute, told INSIDER that the bees ""actually groom while they fly.""

Grooming in the air, he explained, allows the forager bees to use all their limbs to clean accumulated pollen off of their bodies. As part of his PhD work at Georgia Tech, Amador observed this hovering hygiene strategy.

""We tethered them to a string to watch them groom in the air,"" he said. ""They all used the same routine to groom themselves, and it didn't change depending on how dirty they were.""

Amador has continued to study the fluid mechanics of how organisms keep their bodies clean of accumulated particles. He has even investigated the optimal eyelash length across all mammals: about 1/3 the width of the eye.

He pointed out that dogs also take advantage of specialized anatomy and behavior to keep clean. The familiar ""wet dog shake,"" although it might work at the expense of your home's cleanliness, is one of those hygienic behaviors.

""Since the skin is loose, it can travel more than their bodies, providing higher acceleration,"" Amador said. This allows a dog to shake off 70% of the water in their fur in mere seconds.

Certain animals 'dirty' themselves as a protection strategy

Some species get dirty (as humans might think of it) in order to camouflage themselves for better protection or access to prey.

The green lacewing, an insect that preys on aphids, offers a good example of this, according to a Bug of the Week article by Michael Raupp, an entomology professor at the University of Maryland.

Aphids have developed a symbiotic relationship with ants to protect them from predators: aphids provide ants with honeydew as a food source, and the ants defend aphids against the lacewing larvae. But the lacewings developed a sinister, deceptive strategy. They cover their own bodies in aphid carcasses and bits of other organic material like lichen and plants so the ants can't recognize them. Then they're free to eat the aphids.

""Green lacewings larvae act like wolves in sheep's clothing, making their way into an ant colony,"" Hare told INSIDER.

Capuchin monkeys are also known to anoint themselves in strong-smelling substances, including limes and onions, along with ants and millipedes. This helps keep skin parasites at bay and highlights hard-to-reach areas for others to groom.

Animal grooming also fulfills important social functions for species that live in groups. ""The grooming of others is an integral part of society,"" Hare told INSIDER. ""It reinforces social bonds and expresses a position in a dominance hierarchy.""

The human notion of being clean, however, is a modern concept

It's possible to bathe too frequently and rid your skin of moisture. Anna Omelchenko/Shutterstock

Hygiene is very important for health and disease control — according to a 2010 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine, a ""lack of sanitation contributes to about 10% of the global disease burden.""

But it's also possible to bathe too frequently or spend too much time in the shower, which can strip our skin of its necessary, healthy moisture and oil.

Over-cleaning can also be a result of poor mental health. In times of stress, humans and animals can take grooming to harmfully obsessive lengths.

""External stress can lead to more grooming in populations,"" Hare said.

In some cases, that can lead to self-inflicted alopecia, or hair loss.

Excessive grooming can lead to hair loss in humans. The Sun Photo/Shutterstock

Unfortunately, this is common among rodents living in a lab environment.

320,https://www.createdigital.org.au/tunnelling-effort-clean-polluted-rivers/,"Wed, 26 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",create digital,Inside the mammoth tunnelling effort to clean one of the world’s most polluted rivers,"An ambitious engineering project in Argentina hopes to clean up the 64 km Riachuelo, which exposes more than 4 million people to toxic pollutants.

Argentina’s Riachuelo is a notoriously toxic river that snakes around the southern edge of Buenos Aires, its inky green surface a stark reminder of the environmental hazards swirling within its depths.

Long a dumping ground for industrial waste and sewage, it ranks with the Ganges in India and the Pripyat, near Chernobyl in Ukraine, among the most polluted waterways in the world.

While official promises to clean up the river have come to little in recent decades, action is finally underway thanks to a Supreme Court ruling, a significant cash injection from the World Bank and some innovative engineering.

The 64-kilometre river and its surrounding area, known as the Matanza-Riachuelo Basin, is home to more than 4 million people who face serious health risks as a result of exposure to its pollutants.

Argentina’s Environmental and Natural Resources Foundation estimates that 35 per cent of these people do not have access to drinking water and 55 per cent lack sewers. Approximately 15,000 industries dispose of waste into the river, contaminating it with arsenic, cadmium, chromium, hydrocarbons, sulphides, zinc and lead.

A recent study by the Authority of Matanza-Riachuelo Basin (ACUMAR), the public body established to oversee the US$1.2-billion clean-up, revealed that 17 per cent of children in Villa 26, which lies on the river’s edge, showed an excessive level of lead in their blood.

Cleaning up the river

In 2008, Argentina’s Supreme Court approved the historic Mendoza ruling, which demanded that action be taken against the stream of pollutants flooding into the Riachuelo. The current sanitation scheme, which is the first part of a program for the sustainable development of the Matanza-Riachuelo Basin, consists of three foundational works.

The first, known as the Riachuelo Left Bank Collector, is a network of inland tunnels designed to intercept both industrial and civil discharged water and divert it towards a pre-treatment plant, which is the second key element of the scheme.

Once it reaches the plant, the liquid will undergo a ‘coarse’ separation process designed to retain only the largest solid particles from the incoming wastewater flow. This phase will be supplemented by the sedimentation process in the plant basin.

The third work in progress is a US$450-million hydraulic tunnel, which will serve as an outlet for the treated water. It is currently being excavated by a consortium led by the Italian civil engineering company Salini Impregilo and, at its expected completion in 2021, it will rank among the longest subfluvial tunnels in the world, spanning 12 kilometres and dug to a depth of 40 metres in the bed of the Rio de la Plata, where the waters of the Matanza-Riachuelo Basin empty.

Digging deep Digging deep

Mirko Martini, Chief Engineer with Salini Impregilo, said few tunnels have been excavated under conditions like those at the Riachuelo River.

“Everything is a challenge,” he said.

“You have to remember that we are under a river with a lot of pressure and we’re excavating through sub-ground.”

Martini’s team is excavating approximately 560 metres of soil per month, and the volume is determined by factors such as ground conditions and the fact that there is only one tunnel access point.

“If something goes wrong, we need to sort it out inside the tunnel itself,” he said.

“There is no chance to do it from the surface. The more you move into the tunnel, the more complicated it becomes to transport the soil out of the chamber for final disposal.”

The soil is being moved to a landfill area onsite, and, because it is being excavated with a biodegradable foaming agent, Martini says there is potential for recycling.

“In the old days, you always had serious environmental issues when you excavated material,” he said.

“All of a sudden nobody wanted to take it, because basically you had a product that was a chemical aggregate. However, in this case we are using a product that is 100 per cent biodegradable, which allows us to be certain, within a safe margin, that it is clean.”

The tunnel has an internal diameter of around four metres and is being dug using a double-shielded tunnel boring machine. As internal water pressure is higher than that of the exterior, it is lined with a complex joint and segment arrangement to provide adequate strength.

“Most tunnels using segmental lining are designed to work in compression,” explained Martini.

“When you’ve got tension, the design is quite peculiar, and we spent quite a lot of time designing the connection between segments and rings. It was a key part of our tunnel design.”

A return shaft built into the bed of the river will deliver treated water into a diffuser system, which will consist of 31 vertical steel risers, each about 44 metres apart. The top of each riser will be fitted with a diffusion rosette of six ports, which will channel the main flow into a series of sub-flows to enhance the dispersal of treated water into the river.

Martini said the riser system took more than two years to design.

“The technology is similar to pipe-jacking technology,” he said.

“The difference is that we are jacking vertically from the bottom up. We complete a push of 1.8 metres, and then the next pipe comes and is connected to the pipe that is already jacked against the ground.

“Once the first pipe reaches the riverbed, the entire pipeline is almost complete. There will be only one piece missing — the riser head, which is basically the main diffuser. At this stage, I’ll need a team of divers to install it.”

One day at a time

Upon completion, the system will transport and treat sewage at a rate of 27 cubic metres per second, improving sanitary conditions along the banks of the river and providing a long-term and sustainable solution for safe disposal of wastewater from Buenos Aires.

The broader Matanza-Riachuelo Basin Sustainable Development Project includes a reduction of industrial discharges through the provision of industrial conversion grants to small and medium enterprises. ACUMAR will also promote improved decision-making for environmentally sustainable land use and will pilot urban drainage and land-use investments in the Matanza-Riachuelo Basin.

For Martini and his team, however, the current focus remains on the laborious task of tunnel excavation. Tunnelling works began last year and have now reached the 25 per cent mark.

“One day last week, we excavated … roughly 45 metres. A few days later, we excavated only eight metres because the ground changed. Every day on site, we say, ‘you never know what’s going to happen today’,” he said.

“The ground conditions and the operating conditions of the machine that we face every day are surprising. The reality is we are glad of every metre we excavate.”

It was great to witness and participate in President Emmerson D. Mnangagwa’s inaugural launch of National Clean Up Day campaign last Wednesday under the theme “Zero tolerance to litter: my environment, my pride”.

The UN in Zimbabwe takes great pride in partnering with all actors to make sure that Zimbabwe has a clean environment.

I was particularly pleased to see the involvement of the private sector as a crucial partner in this endeavour because these efforts need all hands-on deck.

There are several compelling reasons that require us to prepare – with a sense of urgency – to adapt to climate change to preserve the progress we have made thus far and achieve a sustainable environment, consistently clean water, and good hygiene and sanitation for sound human development.

Chief among the many reasons is, firstly, the fact that the impacts of global warming are likely to be felt earlier than expected.

Emerging and developing countries such as Zimbabwe will be hit earliest and hardest by climate change, even though they have contributed little to causing the problem.

Secondly, it has been reported that agricultural production, including access to food is projected to be severely compromised by climate variability and change.

According to some estimates yields from rain-fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50 percent by 2020.

The good news is that an effective remedy to climate change is surprisingly affordable if evidence-based action is taken sooner rather than later. One of the effective remedies is to keep our environment clean and green.

While developed countries will have to take the lead and bear most of the cost in funding both remediation and adaptation, developing countries will need to play a significant role in limiting global warming to safeguard their own future by building resiliency to climate change, and particularly recycling of waste by introducing smart waste management systems.

Deliberate and evidence-based policy adaptations can help make the livelihood assets of the poor more resilient to environmental stresses; implementing early warning systems to anticipate environmental emergencies and to prevent disasters; and establishing micro insurance schemes or social protection provisions for farmers.

Availability of timely information about the environmental stresses and remedies to government, media and public can generate discourse and allow for an informed action to mitigate and reduce the risk of natural disasters.

Given the urgency to address the effects of climate change, we need to accelerate the speed and scale of our response and this clean-up initiative led by the Government will be instrumental in the effort to combat climate change in Zimbabwe by adopting reduce, reuse and recycle mechanism to waste management.

In addition, the initiative will also create the basis to foster collaboration and partnerships to build resilience and empower the people of Zimbabwe, particularly communities in poor hygiene and sanitations areas.

The launch of Zimbabwe’s National Clean-Up Initiative coincided with the UN Secretary-General’s meeting in Katowice, Poland to chart the way forward for climate action as part of the preparations for the COP24, the culmination of which will be the UN Climate Change Summit in New York happening next year.

The Summit will focus on driving action in six areas: transition to renewable energy; funding of climate action and carbon pricing; reducing emissions from industry; using nature as a solution; sustainable cities and local action; and climate change resilience.

All the areas augur well with this clean-up campaign which strives not only promote hygiene, sanitation and healthy lifestyles, but also ensures environmental sustainability.

In promoting zero tolerance to litter, it is prudent for Zimbabwe to focus particularly on the plastic menace.

Plastics are the most common element of solid waste produced in Zimbabwe and indeed across the world.

Plastic takes a long time to break down so the plastic we throw out today is going to be around for many generations.

The problem is that plastic does not disappear rather it breaks into small pieces also known as micro plastics.

Every single piece of plastic that has ever been produced still exists today.

In addition, other issues remain with our waterways that suffer from both solid and liquid waste from various industries and residential areas.

We have also seen the health hazard that unmanaged waste presents – namely the cholera and typhoid outbreaks that are clear testimonies of today.

The UN in Zimbabwe is cognisant of the fact that sustainable waste management is closely associated with the numerous development goals identified under the Sustainable Development Goals including healthy lives, sustainable cities, industrial development, poverty reduction, food and resource security, consumption and production, decent work, green jobs and climate change.

The UN will join and support Zimbabwe in all its endeavours for a cleaner and safer environment.

As such, we will commit to support the Government’s clean-up campaign by doing the following:

l Supporting continued dialogue with the private sector for more sustained waste management and clean up results;

l Designing development programmes that aim to sustain a green economy through supporting green enterprises and jobs;

l Working closely with the local authorities to enhance their capacity to deliver on their mandate in maintaining clean spaces;

l Broadening the scope of water and sanitation programming to include managing the contamination risks posed by improperly managing waste; and

l Encouraging UN staff to act as ambassadors of this campaign wherever they work and live in Zimbabwe.

I would like to congratulate the President and his Government, one again, for launching this much-needed initiative and would like to encourage everyone to seize this opportunity to make a positive impact and take significant steps toward keeping Zimbabwe healthy and clean.

My Environment, My Pride is truly a winning mantra.

Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr walks up the stairs from her office in Freetown, Sierra Leone, to her car when she notices that the sky has darkened and is starting to open up.

Tiny drops of rain fall. Within seconds they've become large and squishy, splashing against the concrete – and she has forgotten her rain boots. Her hot pink slingbacks won't make it through a downpour.

Aki-Sawyerr, who was elected mayor of Freetown in May and is the city's first female mayor in nearly 40 years, asks her driver to take a detour on the way to an outdoor meeting with market women. She is hoping to find a street vendor selling rubber sandals. As the car weaves through sheets of rain, she spots overflowing gutters and makes frantic calls to members of her team back in the office.

""Have you seen this spot?"" she asks. ""We're near Victoria Park. Everything is flooding. Have we noted this?""

Aki-Sawyerr, 50, is obsessed with garbage, rain and the intersection of the two in Freetown. The city is the capital of Sierra Leone, a small West African country that is ranked 184 out of 189 on the U.N.'s Human Development Index, meaning it has some of the worst health, economic and social indicators of any country in the world.

Freetown is beautiful — and chaotic. Its inhabitants are slammed between rolling green hills and the Atlantic Ocean. During the country's nearly decade-long civil war, which ran from 1991 to 2002, people from Sierra Leone's hinterlands fled to the seaside capital for shelter and services. In the war's aftermath, the migration continued, as people looked for jobs in a perpetually weak economy. As Freetown has grown, it has increasingly been characterized by densely packed neighborhoods composed of tiny tin-roofed homes that sit in precarious places, such as on the sides of Freetown's hills or along the ocean.

The country's six-month-long rainy season, mixed with a barely functioning waste collection system and overcrowded streets, annually creates disasters of differing magnitudes. The city, home to 1.5 million of the country's 7.5 million people, made headlines in August 2017 when a landslide killed more than 1,000 people. Flash floods regularly close shops; vehicles get stuck navigating the city's washed-out and potholed streets; and trash gets flushed from cluttered roadside gutters into people's homes. One poor seaside settlement, Kroo Bay, has flooded every year since 2008. Cholera is an annual threat, especially in poor neighborhoods that are most likely to be overcrowded and least likely to have any sanitation system to speak of.

The August 2017 landslide was a wake-up call for the country. It was attributed to not only torrential rains but a mix of overcrowding, poor public infrastructure, little oversight of rapid new construction in environmentally sensitive areas, and deforestation. After the disaster, the government realized that not only human lives were at stake. Even big donors like the International Monetary Fund saw Sierra Leone's fragile environment as a potential damper on the country's already anemic economy.

Aki-Sawyerr says she made the decision to run for mayor after overseeing Operation Clean Freetown, a government effort that was part of a large post-Ebola recovery program that started in 2016. The project aimed to ""[reduce] the risk of epidemics by improving solid waste management in the city.""

""I came face to face with how bad things were"" in Freetown, Aki-Sawyerr explains over a late breakfast of boiled cassava root after returning to her office from her meeting. ""I decided I had to run.""

She expanded this work as mayor. Her first task in office was to identify the locations with the most egregiously clogged gutters that were missed in Operation Clean Freetown and have them cleared. Plastic, dead animals, medical waste and food were removed so water could flow.

But clearing up gutters was just a first step. Aki-Sawyerr aims to build a functioning waste collection system, rather than having the majority of Freetown's residents simply dispose of waste wherever they can — on the side of the road or in piles around their neighborhoods. She also aims to increase access to toilets, an ambitious goal given that only 13 percent of Sierra Leoneans have access to clean, safe facilities, according to the World Health Organization.

And she wants to promote tourism. ""We live in one of the most beautiful cities in the world,"" she says from her office, which looks out over the Atlantic Ocean and sits in a historic 19th century building in the middle of the city's aging downtown. ""People should be coming here, not trying to leave.""

She has other goals, too, ranging from increasing access to education to licensing street vendors so that they trade in official markets and not on the city's crowded alleyways.

""For decades, there had been no structure, no focused thinking of a strategy for the city,"" she says. ""But the way my brain works is with plans. I need to know where I'm going. I have to have a to-do list.""

Aki-Sawyerr is familiar with Freetown's dysfunction, having grown up in the thick of it. She was born just after Sierra Leone gained independence from the British and a year after Siaka Stevens became prime minister. His nearly 20-year rule would become known for corruption and mismanagement, gutting the country's public institutions and ultimately plunging the country into war.

After graduating from the country's top university, Fourah Bay College, in 1988, Aki-Sawyerr moved to England on a Commonwealth Scholarship to study at the London School of Economics. She then worked as an accountant, met her husband and had two children. Aki-Sawyerr always made regular trips to Sierra Leone to visit her parents and siblings and started going home more frequently during the Ebola outbreak.

Using the business know-how she gained in the U.K.'s private sector, she took a leadership position with the National Ebola Response Center in January 2015, overseeing the country's response and facilitating coordination between the government, donors and dozens of NGOs.

She left as the outbreak waned but again returned to Sierra Leone in January 2016, just after the epidemic ended, to supervise implementation of the country's post-Ebola recovery. She gained a reputation for requiring detailed weekly progress updates. She also helped manage relationships with government donors, using her skills as an accountant to track finances and project needs.

And now she has Freetown in its entirety to oversee. Aki-Sawyerr says she conducted the Freetown cleanup within weeks of taking office in part ""to demonstrate that something can happen. We need to get people believing in the city.""

The city was essentially broke when Aki-Sawyerr took office in May, a result of tax codes that hadn't been updated for decades and poor tax collection efforts. The annual budget of Freetown has been about $4 million. With little revenue coming in, after salaries for the city's employees are paid, there's not much left for anything else.

Aki-Sawyerr is aiming to find ways to boost coffers. She not only hopes to update tax codes but wants to introduce new revenue generation schemes, such as parking fees. She has also instituted mobile payment for local taxes and is soliciting money from private companies for specific projects.

She can't determine how money is spent, though — that's up to the Freetown City Council, an elected body that oversees the city's day-to-day finances and functioning.

She hopes that input from Freetown's citizens will guide the council's decision-making process. In the months after her election, she has hosted 48 town hall meetings and considered data collected from 310 community needs assessments about the priorities of Freetown citizens. ""I learned during Ebola that 'community sensitization' doesn't mean telling the community what to do but really listening to their concerns."" And there is a lot to consider: complaints about all levels of public services, from lack of markets to traffic problems to limited recreational facilities.

She has set up working groups to take action on the complaints. ""You need a process for everything,"" Aki-Sawyerr explains.

Aki-Sawyerr's no-nonsense, results-driven approach makes her stand out. And some Freetown City Council members have turned up their noses at the team she has brought in: well-dressed young people who type on Excel spreadsheets, talk through ideas with the help of brightly colored sticky notes posted on whiteboards and answer a slew of text and WhatsApp messages and phone calls in a bustling corner of her mayoral suite.

The staffers are a mix of Sierra Leoneans and expats. Some are from the African diaspora and, like Aki-Sawyerr herself, had once sought more competitive private sector jobs in the U.K. Some team members have been hired directly by Aki-Sawyerr; some are volunteering for the new mayor. And some are supported by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, which is known for helping to staff high-level government offices but made an exception for Aki-Sawyerr.

""Whilst we typically work at the presidential level it was a unique opportunity to dive into local government when Yvonne was elected,"" says Emily Stanger Sfeile, the Sierra Leone country head for the institute.

Aki-Sawyerr knows that she is perceived as different and is sensitive to what her years in the U.K. can signify in a country with a recent colonial past and limited travel opportunities for the vast majority of its citizens. She says she has been made fun of for speaking ""the Queen's English"" and called ""an outsider.""

She was also physically attacked weeks after taking office, although the reasons are not clear. There had been some violence prior to the election, with politicians targeted.

But she isn't apologetic. At a meeting with other local officials — mainly men in sleek suits — she lets her colleagues know she won't be pushed around. When a high-level minister notes that a new budget from the government should be out by Friday, Aki-Sawyerr responds, ""then we'll expect the money by Monday."" Everyone laughs. She doesn't.

And so far, she does seem to be popular. Paul Conteh, a lecturer at Fourah Bay College, says that Aki-Sawyerr isn't ""showing loyalty so much to her political party, but rather to Freetown. As a result, people respect her.""

On the way to her early morning meeting, she was peppered with exuberant shouts of ""Mayor! Mayor!"" as she trekked through soggy city streets. A young man standing under an awning whispered to his friend: ""You know who that is?! That's Ms. Aki-Sawyerr!""

323,https://india.mongabay.com/2018/12/pollution-board-tells-states-to-clean-ganga-for-ardh-kumbh/,"Wed, 26 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Mongabay-India,Pollution board tells states to clean Ganga for Ardh Kumbh,"In advance of the large-scale Ardh Kumbh festival in Prayagraj (Allahabad), India’s top pollution watchdog has directed the pollution controlling authorities of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand to ensure there is no discharge of effluents in river Ganga and pilgrims coming to Prayagraj for Ardh Kumbh festival get clean water for bathing. Kumbh is a major celebration of Hindus and is visited by millions from around the world.

The order is significant for political reasons because cleaning of river Ganga was a major promise of Narendra Modi before he became prime minister. However, there has been no significant improvement in water quality, making the Ganga pollution a hot topic in the run up to the 2019 elections.

Activists believe the order is nothing but an admission of failure of authorities in the cleaning of Ganga river.

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has asked Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh (UP) state governments to ensure a pollution-free Ganga for bathing during the upcoming Ardh Kumbh festival in UP’s Allahabad (recently renamed officially as Prayagraj). The issue of cleaning up the Ganga river is a hot topic ahead of the 2019 elections for the Parliament of India.

Ardh Kumbh is a six-yearly ritual as part of the bigger Kumbh festival, one of the largest religious pilgrimages for the followers of Hinduism, attracting millions of visitors from across India and the world. In 2017, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) inscribed Kumbh on the “Representative list of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity”. During the festival, visitors take a dip in the sacred Ganga which is believed to free one from the cycle of birth and death. The location of Kumbh spans over four places in India – Prayagraj, Haridwar, Ujjain and Nasik.

The CPCB letter to the two states noted that “Ardh-Kumbh is scheduled to be held at Prayagraj during January 2019 to February 2019” and it is an important “six-yearly ritual held on the bank of river Ganga in Prayagraj which involves a holy dip (bathing) into river Ganga”.

CPCB observed that the discharge of “partially treated/untreated effluent of the industries is a major source of pollution in Ganga and impacts the colour of the river beside increasing its pollution load thereby making the water unfit for bathing on the holy occasion.”

In Prayagraj, the Ardh Kumbh celebrations are scheduled to start on January 15, 2019 and expected to end in the first week of March 2019 after approximately 55 days.

The orders of the CPCB, which is India’s top pollution watchdog, were sent to the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) and the Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board (UEPPCB) in November 2018.

Ganga water unfit for bathing or drinking, shows data

The cleaning of river Ganga, considered holy by millions of Indians, was one of the key promises of Prime Minister Narendra Modi before assuming power in May 2014. But progress has been slow on this front and according to the CPCB’s own data, the water at Prayagraj is currently unfit for bathing or drinking. The data on the suitability of Ganga’s water is displayed on the CPCB website in accordance with an order by the National Green Tribunal.

The CPCB directed the UPPCB and UEPPCB under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 to address the pollution problem with a series of “corrective measures” and “further direct the concerned authorities/industries for ensuring pollution free condition in river Ganga at Prayagraj during Ardh Kumbh”.

“There will be no discharge of effluent in river Ganga and its tributaries from grossly polluting units (distillery, sugar, pulp and paper, textile) during the Kumbh,” said the CPCB order to the state pollution control boards. It directed the UPPCB to inspect these grossly polluting industries on a weekly basis to ensure there is no discharge of effluent.

The CPCB has also asked the UPPCB to monitor water quality of the river Ganga on daily basis, monitor drains twice in a week and monitor discharge from Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) on a weekly basis and upload the data on the web. Similar directions were issued to the UEPPCB.

UEPPCB and UPPCB “shall enforce regulatory measures for control of pollution so that bathing water quality is maintained during Kumbh”, the CPCB order said.

Ganga cleaning to be a major issue in 2019 elections

The pollution watchdog’s order to ensure clean bathing water during Kumbh is politically important as the festival is just ahead of the country’s general elections that are scheduled to take place in the first half of 2019.

Soon after coming to power in May 2014, PM Modi led National Democratic Alliance (government) launched the “Namami Gange” programme at a cost of Rs. 200 billion (Rs. 20,000 crore) for conservation and rejuvenation of Ganga over five years. The much-debated issue is expected to be a hot topic in the run upto 2019 elections, with political parties ready to highlight that over the past four years Ganga cleaning has not seen any action.

On December 20, Satya Pal Singh, Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, told the Parliament that “under the Namami Gange Programme, an amount of Rs. 4,994.10 crore (Rs. 49.94 billion) has been spent by the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) out of the total release of Rs. 6,131.22 crore (Rs. 61.31 billion) from the financial years (2014-15 to November 30, 2018).”

Under the Namami Gange Programme, a series of short-term, medium-term and long-term activities are being carried out like development of ghats, river surface cleaning activities upgradation of existing Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) and Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP), creation of new STPs & ETPs, focus on rural sanitation and maintenance of ecological & geological integrity of river.

“The central government approved the Namami Gange programme in May 2015 as a five-year program till 2020. However, efforts are being made to achieve substantial progress by March 2019,” said Singh.

Varanasi based environmentalist and Gandhian Jagriti Rahi of the Saajha Sanskriti Manch said river Ganga is nothing but a commodity for the government.

“They (government) have nothing to do with the environment and ecology of Ganga. Will Ganga just be revived for Kumbh and then left to die afterwards?” questioned Rahi.

Last year, in an order related to cleaning of the Ganga river, the NGT had noted that even after spending of billions of rupees the status of the Ganga has not improved in terms of quality or otherwise and it continues to be a serious environmental issue.

Hemant Dhyani, an environmentalist who has been working for cleaning and protection of river Ganga, criticised the central government for failing to clean it.

“The strict CPCB directions, which are telling the state governments to ensure that polluted water does not flow in Ganga, clearly shows that the quality of Ganga’s water is not satisfactory at all. That is why CPCB had to issue such directions to stop industrial effluents from flowing into the river. It just means that they want to manage it just during Kumbh and then can be allowed to continue, as usual, after it,” said Dhyani.

About half of the people in Africa have access to electricity, but the remaining half i.e, about 580 million Africans, still rely on inefficient and expensive energy sources. What’s even worrying is the large gaps and inequalities among income groups, varying across geographical locations, with more people in urban areas having access to electricity compared to those in rural areas.

The average urban electrification rates in Central, East, Southern and West Africa was about 71 per cent compared with the rural electrification rates of about 22 per cent in 2016, reveals the Africa Sustainable Development Report 2018. While 32 per cent of urban population in Africa, excluding North Africa, has access to cleaner fuels for cooking, around 90 per cent of the rural population cooks with charcoal.

This biennial report was released at the 2018 African Economic Conference (AEC) recently at Kigali, Rwanda. North Africa is the sub-region with the largest access to electricity (in absolute terms and by proportion)–around 297 million people (99 per cent of the population) have access. However, access rates decrease rapidly in the rest of Africa, where the majority of Africa’s population lives — 56 per cent and 48 per cent in West and Southern Africa respectively; 37 per cent in East Africa; and only 20 per cent in Central Africa—the lowest rate of access to electricity globally according to International Energy Agency.

Limited social and human development

Lack of access to electricity will affect education, which is critical to overall social and economic growth, shows the report. It says that in Africa (excluding North Africa), only 35 per cent of schools have access to electricity. This translates to 90 million children attending school without electricity. Lack of sufficient electricity limits utilisation of lifesaving equipment and services by African hospitals, thus putting several human lives at risk. In fact, high maternal mortality rates are common as a result of poor electrification, especially in rural areas.

The use of traditional biomass for cooking, lighting and heating has a negative influence on the health and quality of life for many Africans. Only around 25 per cent of the African population has access to clean cooking solutions and the rural-urban gap continues to exist. While 32 per cent of urban population in Africa, excluding North Africa, has access to cleaner fuels for cooking; around 90 per cent of the rural population cooks with charcoal. Approximately 600,000 Africans, mostly women and children, die every year from inhaling toxic fumes due to the use of wood or feedstock.

The absolute number of people without access to energy-efficient cooking stoves continues to rise in Africa, with around 780 million people cooking with solid biomass. Limited, unreliable and costly power supply is a major barrier to continued economic progress. According to a recent study, a 10 per cent increase in generation capacity leads to 0.07 per cent increase in GDP and 0.4 per cent increase in employment. Electrification was also found to be associated with higher household incomes.

The challenge

Population growth in Africa has outpaced growth in electricity generation and distribution efforts. Access to electricity in absolute terms is outpacing population growth across the world but Africa (excluding North Africa), where incremental (absolute) population surpassed incremental access only by 4 million people annually.

In fact, more people live without electricity today compared to 25 years ago. There has been an increase of 138 million people with no access to electricity in just a quarter of a century. In 1990, approximately 445 million people in Africa (around 69 per cent of the population) had no access to electricity compared with 583 million people (47 per cent) in 2016.

So, despite widespread progress, the global population living without electricity will become increasingly concentrated in this region, projects the report citing the International Energy Agency.

The cost of electricity in Africa is very high, in part due to reliance on thermal generation using heavy fuel oil and diesel fuel. The high cost is also attributed to higher generation and distribution inefficiencies and losses. Many African countries recorded losses of over US$0.25 per kWh sold—as well as high connection fees and tariffs, says the report (citing World Bank).

Access for all

African nations have recognised the importance of affordable and reliable energy for the future of Africa — 34 countries have mentioned energy access as a key enabler for development in their climate action plans. The average annual investment required to achieve universal access by 2025, is between US$ 65 billion and US$ 90 billion.

A key energy investment initiative like the New Deal on Energy for Africa, developed by the African Development Bank Group (AfDB), aims to achieve universal access by 2025 by mobiliSing up to US$50 billion of additional funding in the sector.

Improving rural access to modern energy is essential while addressing the rural-urban disparities. Hence, the report asks the African governments, supported by partners, to provide incentives to drive investments in renewable energy. The role of governments is critical for growth of the off-grid sector, says the report, calling upon each country to develop tailored policies and technologies.

It also advocates promoting access to clean cooking solutions, including establishing cooking stoves standards, as well as wood/charcoal sector regulations. Thus, calling for urgent measures to increase production and expand access to electricity across Africa, the report demands for a sustained political commitment to the national electrification programmes for expanding access to electricity and ensuring “electricity access for all”.","While 32 per cent of urban population in Africa, excluding North Africa, has access to cleaner fuels for cooking, around 90 per cent of the rural population cooks with charcoal.

Turns out cleaning your oven isn’t just for overzealous mums and Kim and Aggie – left dirty, your oven could pose some serious health risks.

If your oven is coated with grease and grime, it can interfere with the natural travel of hot air around the interior, meaning that food may not be cooked as it should be.

Think about it: A filthy oven is not a healthy oven, and it’s tough for your oven to do its job as normal if it’s coated in grease and dirt.

If your oven isn’t working properly, you may not be properly cooking your food, even if you’re sticking to temperature guidelines and cooking times.

And, as you well know, eating undercooked food can put you at risk of food poisoning and infections such as e. coli.

Ralitsa Prodanova, of UK household sanitation firm Fantastic Services, says: ‘Grease and grime will alter the efficiency of an oven.

‘And when there’s too much grime, your food will not cook properly in the allotted time.

‘That puts you and your loved ones at risk of potentially-deadly bacteria, like salmonella and E.coli, particularly if you’re reheating festive leftovers.

‘It can turn a family dinner into a nightmare.’

Ralitsa adds that small amounts of grease can lead to smoke in your oven, which can affect the taste of your food.

‘If your oven’s slightly smokey when you turn it on, that’s a sign it’s dirty,’ she notes.

‘The smoke itself can be bad for you if breathed in – and clearly extremely dirty ovens are also a fire hazard because old food spillages can set it alight.

‘Continuous burning of oven dirt and grime also creates carbon-based fumes which alter the flavour of baked food.

‘Any food or grease that has been burnt on the inside of the oven continuers to burn whenever it’s switched on.’

Dirty cookers could also release pollutants into the home, throwing carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and sulphur dioxide into the air you breathe. That’s not good.

The British Lung Foundation warns that dirty cookers can release two kinds of pollutants in the home; microscopic particles of dust and dirt, and gases like carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide.

That all sounds pretty scary. So what can you do, beyond adopting a raw diet?

It’s simple: Give your oven a proper clean. You don’t need to pay for a cleaner or buy anything fancy, just standard kitchen cleaning products will do the trick.

‘All you need is some baking soda, vinegar, water, rubber gloves, spray bottle and cloths,’ advises Ralitsa.

‘To get started remove oven racks. These racks can be washed in the sink using regular soap and water. They come up cleaner if left to soak for some time.

‘Make a paste with soda and water, mix it together until it becomes spreadable. You’re going to coat the whole oven with this so ensure you make plenty.

‘Spread the paste all throughout the interior of the oven but steer clear of the heating elements. Give the greasy spots a good going over.

‘You will see it start to turn brown as it comes into contact with the grease, this means the paste is lifting the dirt.

‘The next step is a waiting game. Let the paste stay on overnight, giving it 12 hours at least to work its magic.

‘The following day wipe off the paste using a damp cloth. For any stubborn areas you can use a spatula to loosen the grime. Don’t use a solid utensil like a knife, this will scratch your oven.

‘Next put some white vinegar in a spray bottle and spray the oven interior. The vinegar will cause any lingering baking soda to loosen and foam up. Use a clean wipe to give the oven a once over. Put the racks back in and let the oven dry.

‘You can speed up oven drying time by turning it on to a low setting for a few minutes.’

If you can’t be bothered with mixing your own products and giving your oven a proper scrub, you’ll find plenty of cleaning products specifically designed for cleaning caked on grime in your local supermarket. Easy.

Once you’ve done one big clean, you can keep your oven in good condition by giving it a wipe down after each use, thus swiping away any grime and preventing it from building up.

It’s an extra step in the existing faff of cooking and cleaning, but if you’re bothered about your health or the time you need to keep cookies in the oven, it’s worth doing.

326,https://douglascountyherald.com/2018/12/city-of-ava-receives-clean-audit-for-year-ending-june-30-2018/,"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Douglas County Herald,"City of Ava Receives Clean Audit for Year Ending June 30, 2018","The City of Ava was awarded a clean audit by KPM CPAs and Advisors of Springfield, Mo., Tuesday evening during the city council meeting. Jennifer Schatzer, CPA Audit Manager with KPM, presented the audit information, noting the city’s business-type activities and major funds for the year ending June 30, 2018, were in compliance with current government auditing standards. However, in the report, Schatzer advised the firm had identified a certain deficiency in internal control over financial reporting which was deemed a material weakness. Schatzer recommended city officials periodically conduct a review of internal control operations as a safeguard over city assets. To strengthen their position, she suggested the city consider conducting regular review of all procedures, such as cash management, computer information systems, mail distribution, purchasing procedures and more.

Schatzer announced the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) has issued new pronouncements that will likely affect the City in future years. GASB Statement No. 83 now establishes criteria for the accounting and financial reporting of asset retirement obligations (ARO). An ARO is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible fixed asset, such as the disposal, sale or decommissioning of electric poles, sewage treatment plants, or fuel storage tanks.

In referring to the implementation of GASB Statement No. 87, Schatzer called it the ‘big one’ for the City as this new rule puts all leases, including operating leases, on the balance sheet for accounting purposes. GASB No. 87 establishes a single model for lease accounting, and requires that every item is accounted for.

According to the report, GASB No. 83 becomes effective December 31, 2019, and No. 87 on December 31, 2020. The auditing firm encouraged the city to begin compliance with both rules prior to the established deadline dates.

During the year, the audit noted the City transferred $650,568 from the electric fund and $103,400 from the water sewer fund, with both amounts transferred into the general fund for use. Schatzer noted the electric fund transfer was a large amount that has decreased the unrestricted cash to zero, taking away the City’s ability to make similar transfers next year. The accounting firm did recommend the City consider decreasing transfer amounts to the general fund, or spend time to re-evaluate electrical and sewer rates and reassess whether or not the current rate structure is sufficient to replenish funds and ensure self-sufficiency. She also recommended the City take a guarded approach to expenditures next year.

Treasurer Peggy Porter advised the city has not transferred monies from the electrical fund since July 2018. She said she is presently reviewing utility rates and other options, which may be options for relief. Porter said she is also looking at different methods for sharing the financial responsibility between all three enterprise funds, which would entail using the combined water and sewer fund, the electric fund and the sanitation fund as transfer sources.

Schatzer advised she was not concerned about the issue as the City of Ava has always been diligent about implementing pro-active measures to correct problems or issues.

The report noted several material misstatements were detected during the audit, but the missteps were quickly corrected by management. Schatzer advised the misstatements were trivial and basically occurred because the process was unfamiliar, and the issue will get better as familiarity and time allows.

Schatzer acknowledged decreases in the water/sewer and sanitation fund expense category, noting sound decreases in both funds which was good.

The financial statements and audit report may be viewed at City Hall.

Councilmen revised two ordinances Tuesday evening by voting to adopt Ordinance No. 1042 which expands the unlawful use of weapons as defined in the weapons section in the city code book. The new ordinance makes it unlawful to shoot or discharge the following within the city limits of the city: BB gun, paintball or air gun that shoots pebbles, bullets, slug, arrow, or any other hard substance by means of a sling, crossbow, rubber band or bow. The ordinance also states it is unlawful to use any weapon that can shoot a projectile, by means of air, spring or hand.

Council adopted Ordinance No. 1043, which changes the financial processes for handling municipal court fees, fines and costs. According to Mayor David Norman, the change in procedure is being mandated by state statute, and the city must comply with the new law. Under the new rules, the municipal court records will be kept and recorded online by the municipal court clerk, and the State of Missouri will monitor account activity. The municipal court bank account must now be separate from all other city accounts, and only the municipal court clerk will have access for writing checks and overseeing use of court funds. Councilmen voted 4-0 to adopt the new rules and procedures.

Mayor Norman reported remodeling upgrades to the Ava Fire Station were completed this week. He noted several more improvements are scheduled for the building, with new flooring planned for installation sometime this winter, and painting of the building exterior to the south, this coming summer.

Norman advised the city is working toward installing wayfaring signs near the highway intersections on the edges or entry to town. The signs will be used to direct travelers to specific areas, such as the Ava Cemetery, downtown business district, school, etc. Norman said the signs are 24×36-inches or 36×48-inches, and cost approximately $160 each. He said the present plan calls for six signs, but before proceeding, the City must fill out the proper documentation and present the forms to the regional MoDOT official in Willow Springs, who will then apply for the signage through the Jefferson City office. MoDOT will also determine where the signs will be allowed.

Tom Roberts, chair of the University of Missouri Extension Office for Douglas County, and Randy Wiedmeier, County Engagement Specialist in Agriculture, asked council and the Mayor to consider contributing $5,000 in support of hiring an ag specialist for the Douglas County Extension office. Wiedmeier said the state is willing to cover $10,000 of the $20,000 salary expense, and they are asking the County for the remaining $5,000 in January. The position would be a full-time position with a state benefit package, and even though the job will be located in the Extension Office, the employee will be employed by the State of Missouri not the University of Missouri.

Wiedmeier said similar positions have been established in Houston, Texas County, and most recently, in Gainesville, Ozark County. He noted the ag educator in Texas County has already started initiating programs, and is experiencing a successful response from community members.

Council took the proposal under advisement.

During closed session, council voted on a real estate contract finding, and a litigation issue.

Councilmen present were Keith Jones, Stan Lovan, Burrely Loftin and Noel Dye.

Meeting video may be viewed on the Douglas County Herald website.

Council will reconvene on Tuesday, Jan. 8, 5:00 p.m., as City Hall will be closed Dec. 24-25 for the Christmas holiday.","The City of Ava was awarded a clean audit by KPM CPAs and Advisors of Springfield, Mo., Tuesday evening during the city council meeting.

And if they don’t, and they repeatedly put non-recyclables in the bins, their bin could be left at the curb and picked up by the trash truck.

Linda Jones of Waste Connection told the Board of Aldermen on Tuesday that, even with China tightening its regulations on the recyclables it will buy, the company will continue to honor its contract to provide single-stream recycling to residents. But she asked city officials to continue educating residents on what should and should not be placed in their recycling bins.

Food waste and water should not be dumped in recyclable bins, Jones stressed. Pizza left in the delivery box and water left in water bottles spell trouble when put in a recyclable bin. “You smash that with the compaction, it goes ‘poof’ everywhere, and it contaminates your daily load,” she said.

Cardboard is the second most profitable item in single-stream recycling but water ruins it, Jones said. “You pour water on cardboard, and it turns to oatmeal,” she said.","ROCK HILL • Rock Hill’s waste hauler is asking residents to clean up their act — in their recyclable bins.

ONCE more, allow me to appreciate the relaunch of ‘Make Zambia clean, green and healthy’ campaign aimed at improving lives through environmental health friendly approaches embedded in preventive medicine.

Nevertheless, little has been done to identify its efficiency. There is little engagement with Zambia Institute of Environmental Health (ZIEH), board full of health inspectors both from local authorities and the Ministry of Health. These professionals are not even engaged fully in the Ministry of Water Development Sanitation and Environmental Protection.

These are the people trained to look into issues of water, hygiene and sanitation. But the truth of the matter is that they are not fully engaged for professional advice.

One of the reason why, at times, we have failed in exercises such as prohibition of public smoking.

If accurate professionals are consulted by now, Government have known that only few public service workers in various districts turn up to work on the last Saturday of the month due to various reasons ranging from distance, transport, and spiritual engagements, while others have no time to bond with their families during the week, hence weekend is their chance.

Such brutal truth may not have been revealed to the President because most people pretend to be hardworking when in reality, vital programmes are shrinking in their hands. But because I foresee and value the positive impact of the exercise, which includes elimination of communicable infections such as cholera, I have taken this stance.

To avoid monkey tricks, before people leave their offices on Friday, let them clean like the way it used to be at first. I am sure everything has a start. Please, engagement of right skills for the right programme is key to sustainability.

JAGATSINGHPUR: The job of cleaning toilets may be looked down upon by many, but not by this 73-year-old man. Sunakar Sahoo of Manijanga in Tirtol takes pride in cleaning toilets in rural areas. And he renders his services free of cost.

The administration has set a target to declare all eight blocks of the district open defection free (ODF) by October 2, 2019 by constructing 2,70,251 toilets in 1,219 villages under 198 panchayats.However, little thought has been given to cleaning the toilets. Non-availability of toilet cleaners and lack of funds to disinfect the latrines have become common issues in rural areas. This is where Sunakar steps in.

Sunakar was working in a pump house of Public Health Engineering Organisation (PHEO). After his retirement in 2005, he decided to embark on a cleaning drive in rural areas and offer his services to poverty-stricken people free of cost.

“Though lakhs of toilets have been constructed in the villages, no steps have been taken to clean them. As toilet cleaners are not available, the overflowing latrines pollute water bodies, including open wells and ponds,” said Sunakar.

He uses a motor pump, pipe, drum, trolley and other instruments besides hiring two daily wagers to clean the toilets. “Initially, my intention was to provide free services to all categories of people. However, since there was a dramatic rise in the number of toilets in rural areas after Swachh Bharat Mission was launched, I decided to help only the poor,” said Sunakar.

Sunakar charges a nominal fee to pay the daily wagers who assist him in his job, but only if the person can afford to pay. Niranajan Sethy of Rahama said it is difficult to clean the toilets as disinfectants are not easily available in rural areas. “Moreover, it is not possible on our part to spend `3,000 to `4,000 and hire machines to clean toilets. But Sunakar does the job by taking a small amount to pay the labourers,” he added.

Another widow of Pankpal said, “Being poor, I had no money to clean the toilet. But Sahoo did the job free of cost last year.”Manijanga sarpanch Mamata Sahoo said Sunakar’s dedication towards cleaning toilets to keep the villages clean and pollution-free is praiseworthy.

Sunakar has been felicitated by various organisations, including Sanket ITI, Chelitola Cultural Parishad and Tirtol Kartikeswer Puja Committee for his efforts to improve rural sanitation in the area.","Amarnath Parida ByExpress News ServiceJAGATSINGHPUR: The job of cleaning toilets may be looked down upon by many, but not by this 73-year-old man.

The Hartbeespoort community has come together in an effort to clean up the famous Hartebeespoort Dam.

Over the years it's been plagued by the growth of hyacinth - the most invasive and rapidly proliferating aquatic weed in the world.

To date, hundreds of hyacinth have been removed successfully through the Harties Foundation.

Azania Mosaka spoke to founding director Rudy Joles and Petrus Venter, North West Deputy Regional Director for Integrated Water Resource Management at the Department of Sanitation.

We have gone over and asked the town as a collective to help with public funding. R 1.7 million has been raised, at this stage we are still about R 600 000 in the red. Rudy Joles, founding director of the Harties Foundation

The good part is we have reduced the 45% coverage down to less than 7%. Rudy Joles, founding director of the Harties Foundation

We never going to get rid of hyacinth and the project plan in place is that we need to contain 3 to 5% hyacinth on the dam continuously. The hyacinth contribute to the quality of the water. Rudy Joles, founding director of the Harties Foundation

It was the most high-profile parade of personages our country could put together, the President being accompanied by Vice-Presidents Constantino Chiwenga and Kembo Mohadi, First Lady Cde Auxilia Mnangagwa, Defence and War Veterans Minister, Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri and several Cabinet Ministers.

At the event, the President also declared the first Friday of each calendar month as National Environment Cleaning Day.

This is part of the Government’s practical steps to ensure the country has sustainable environmental management and waste disposal systems.

The President signed a declaration to that end as well.

The national environmental cleaning across the country will be carried out between 8am and 10am. The theme of yesterday’s event was “Zero Tolerance to Litter: My Environment my Pride.”

What we have seen before yesterday’s huge event are companies, church organisations or individuals working with the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) and local authorities to conduct ad hoc clean-up campaigns in small, selected parts of the country.

While their activities are commendable, we also recognise that the organisations tended to undertake them primarily to advance their public relations objectives with making cities and towns clean being secondary.

There is no denying that our country has become dirtier, a state of affairs that emerged around the early 2000s when the economic challenges set in.

The dirt is most evident in urban areas where local authorities, hit by dwindling revenues as ratepayers default and rising cost of service delivery, are failing to collect refuse or maintain their sewer lines as regularly as they should.

Mounds of garbage can be seen everywhere in Harare, Bulawayo, Gweru, Masvingo, Mutare and other urban areas.

Sewer lines in these places have become old, thus cannot handle the high volumes of effluent that is being discharged by rising urban populations.

They burst quite often, spewing raw sewage into streets; in some cases, back into homes. Financially hamstrung local authorities struggle to repair them or to build new ones.

This has been one big trigger for frequent outbreaks of diseases such as cholera and typhoid that have killed and sickened tens of thousands over the past few years.

Many industries, also facing challenges in the prolonged economic depression, are failing to treat their waste and dispose of it properly.

As a result, they are discharging it untreated into rivers and open lands.

A few have been charged and fined substantial sums of money by EMA.

While urban areas are the major culprits, inadequacies in sanitation are there in rural areas too.

Because of lack of resources to build toilets many people in the countryside practise open defecation.

Unicef reported in September 2015 that 40 percent of the rural folk in the country are still using the bush as toilets.

This is a big health hazard because when the rains fall, they wash some of the human waste into rivers and wells whose water the people consume.

But what we saw yesterday, the declaration of every Friday of every month as the National Environment Cleaning Day by the President should renew our people’s quest for a cleaner and healthier environment.

“Let us be united,” said President Mnangagwa.

“Let us love peace. Let us love harmony. Let us work together. Let us clean our nation, clean our environment together. Let us be together in broad daylight, at night, during challenges and let us be together. The world we live in is deteriorating rapidly due to the dire consequences of climate change which manifest as floods, heat waves, diseases, water and air pollution, land degradation and desertification among other challenges.

“These developments require us to take bold and decisive action with regards to the management of our environment of ensuring a clean environment. We need to keep our villages, towns and cities clean and hygienic, both for this generation and generations to come. We must therefore be re-oriented to practise good environmental and waste management through increased advocacy, education, training and awareness. We must do this from a place of pride, not just a necessity.

“Furthermore, it is important to be alive to the need for the sound management of chemical waste, solid waste as well as electronic and plastic waste, for the protection of human health, flora and fauna.”

We have heard stories about how smart and well-organised Rwanda is; how its capital, Kigali is held as Africa’s cleanest city. President Paul Kagame leads his nation on Umuganda Day to clean up the Great Lakes country. The community clean-up is held on the last Saturday of every month. On that day shops are closed, Rwanda’s well paved roads are empty of vehicles as every able-bodied person joins their communities to spruce up their environment.

The Rwandan example in which their President leads the clean-up programme once every month, is one that our country, led by our own President, must follow for our country must not be as filthy as it has become.

With the first citizen leading the campaign, we are hopeful that more of our people would be persuaded to be involved in smartening our environment.

This obviously entails cleaning up our physical environment, making sure that our water sources are clean and ensuring that our ablution facilities are in “tip-top” condition.

However, we need not forget the condition of our homes and our persons as well. Many homes and office blocks in our country need fresh coats of paint, inside and outside.

We must wash our clothes and bathe regularly. These pose financial implications on councils, companies, families and individuals but we must know that dirt can actually kill us.","At the event, the President also declared the first Friday of each calendar month as National Environment Cleaning Day.

That was unprecedented in Africa. However, the opposition then boycotted the rerun elections.

Most observers considered Kenya’s presidential elections in August 2017 fair. Uhuru Kenyatta was officially reported to have won 54 % of the votes. In view of opposition grumbling, however, he suggested that Raila Odinga, the main opposition candidate, go to court. Odinga kept stating that this was not an option, though international observers and church leaders urged him to either concede or turn to the judges.

Shortly before the final deadline, Odinga and his lawyers indeed appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing they had sufficient evidence of malpractice. The case was accepted, the Supreme Court heard both sides and finally decided in favour of the opposition. Due to many “illegalities and irregularities”, it declared the election null and void and ordered a fresh one to be held within 60 days.

At first, Kenyatta said that he accepted the decision, though he did not agree with it. In campaign mode, he later turned against the judges, calling them “crooks” and promising to “fix” something he considered “broken” in the judiciary. The fight for a fair and transparent election system was evidently not over.

The opposition raised a set of demands it wanted the electoral commission to fulfil, including the dismissal of some officials and measures to enhance transparency. It spoke of an “irreducible minimum”, and threatened to stay away from the rerun election, which was scheduled for 26 October. The electoral commission half-heartedly accepted some of the proposals, but made it clear that it considered the election’s credibility a matter of perceptions, rather than substance. The government, in turn, insisted that there was no time for major reforms. Its strategy was to press ahead with the elections fast.

The president’s party has a majority in the parliament. It changed the electoral law, deleting and watering down clauses that had led to the election annulment. Legal disputes erupted immediately. On 24 October, activists appealed to the Supreme Court, asking it to decide whether the election could take place as planned on 26 October at all. The government then declared 25 October to be a public holiday, but Chief Justice David Maraga announced the Supreme Court would sit nonetheless.

That evening, the car of Philomena Mbete Mwilu, the deputy chief justice, was shot at. The driver was injured; she remained physically unharmed herself. However, she did not show up in court the next day. Another judge was abroad for medical treatment, and yet another one missed an airplane to Nairobi. Two other judges did not appear, but did not offer excuses. Apart from Maraga, only one other Supreme Court justice was present. According to its quorum, the Supreme Court needs a minimum of five judges to take decisions. The meeting had to be aborted, and the elections took place as scheduled.

Odinga boycotted the event, so Kenyatta now won 98 % of the votes. Turnout, however, dropped from 79 % in August to a mere 38 % in October. In 25 constituencies, which are opposition strongholds, no vote was cast.

Protests erupted, but the security forces managed to suppress them, while the Kenyatta government agitated against the opposition and harassed some of its leaders and financiers. Some were charged with treason. One lawyer, who has the dual citizenship of Canada and Kenya, was arrested and forced to leave the country after he had dared to swear in Odinga as the “people’s president” during a protest rally in January.

Things have since calmed down, especially after Kenyatta and Odinga held a surprise meeting in March 2018. They shook hands and declared a ceasefire. Doubts linger on about the legitimacy of Kenyatta’s presidency, but it has not been questioned in court. The judges have, however, reversed most of the election law amendments which the parliament passed shortly before the rerun election. The fight for a fair and transparent election system is still not over.

TechInAfrica – The Founder of Waste Energy Youth Enterprise Clean Energy Company Ltd, Brian Kakembo Galabuzi uses agricultural materials and organic waste to make carbonized fuel briquettes. In fact, in Africa, more than 640 million people are underserved to electricity and depends so much on dirty sources of energy for cooking, lighting, and heating.

As it is safe to use agricultural waste materials and organic waste, several entrepreneurs use them to create a business that promotes a green economy. Those entrepreneurs were included in the winners of the 2018 Greenpreneurs Program, a program created and designed by the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) to support green growth startups.

The program helps young entrepreneurs to take their business ideas into real actions where the solutions are impactful to several major sectors, including energy sustainability; water and sanitation; landscapes sustainability (forestry and agriculture); and green city development.

The CEO of Waste Energy Youth Enterprise Clean Energy Company Ltd, Brian Kakembo Galabuzi, commented on the selection of his company along with the 10 other finalists. “It was very amazing to be selected among the 10 finalists out of over 345 applicants from around the world,” he said.

His company, Waste Energy Youth Enterprise Clean Energy Company Ltd, uses agricultural waste materials and organic waste to make carbonized fuel briquettes. With 80% of solid organic waste in Uganda, the company is able to run an eco-friendly business, producing cheaper and cleaner cooking charcoal briquettes.

Galabuzi said that GGGI helps him to address grassroots challenges he experienced while running his company. The greatest challenges he faced was lack of finance and experience which caused trial and errors.

“In the beginning, our targets were not that high so it was easy to achieve them, but through the ‘Greenprenuers’ programme we have learned to set bold targets and stand by them until we can achieve them,” he said. He continued, “It offers the right skills and knowledge through its 10-week web-based programme, and which is accompanied by an opportunity to win seed funding at the end of the programme.”

Moreover, Galabuzi also said that the program helped him in his business, especially managing his business better, “GGGI has also provided the seed funding through the ‘Greenprenuers’ programme, which has availed us finances to test out our business plan in a field seen as high risk by financing institutions in Uganda.

Through the program, the startups did not only receive a funding but also free consultations and mentoring by global successful experts.","ShareTechInAfrica – The Founder of Waste Energy Youth Enterprise Clean Energy Company Ltd, Brian Kakembo Galabuzi uses agricultural materials and organic waste to make carbonized fuel briquettes.
