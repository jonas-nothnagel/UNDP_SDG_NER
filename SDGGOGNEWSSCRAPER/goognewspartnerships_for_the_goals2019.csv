Leaders made commitments and announcements related to climate change, oceans, the digital divide, sanitation, and gender equality, among others.

WEF 48 convened in Davos, Switzerland, from 23-26 January 2018, and included participation from over 340 public figures, including more than 70 heads of state and government and 45 heads of international organizations. The Forum convened under the theme, ‘Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World,’ with the aim of rededicating “leaders from all walks of life” to improve the state of the world through co-design, co-creation, and collaboration.

WEF featured over 400 sessions that contributed to the meeting’s six agendas: the global agenda related to its 14 System Initiatives and efforts to advance major multilateral processes, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); the geopolitical agenda; the economic agenda, which focused on delivering sustainable and inclusive economic development; the regional and national agenda; the industry and business agenda, in preparation for scientific, technological and policy transformations and the Fourth Industrial Revolution; and the future agenda, which focused on sharing ideas, innovations, and discoveries to reshape global systems.

WEF focused on driving positive change through 14 System Initiatives meant to shape the future of: consumption; the digital economy; economic progress; education gender and work; energy; natural resource security; financial systems; food security and agriculture; health care; information and entertainment; trade and investment; infrastructure and development; and mobility shaping the future of production.

For the first time, WEF featured an all-female panel of seven co-chairs. Norway’s Prime Minister Erna Solberg called for action on gender equality and corruption and illegal financial flows. Chetna Sinha, Founder and Chair of the Mann Deshi Foundation, urged financial access for everyone and announced a Rupee 100 million alternative investment fund to encourage more women entrepreneurs. On human rights and related to gender, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein underscored the role of the private sector in ending discrimination and ensuring equal opportunities for lesbian, gay, bi, trans and intersex (LGBTI) people in the workplace and beyond.

Leaders also highlighted challenges posed by climate change. In his speech, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi described climate change as one of the three greatest threats to “the survival of human civilization.” He called for “resources to help developing countries adopt appropriate technology” to reduce carbon emissions. France’s President, Emmanuel Macron, announced that France would close all its coal-fired power stations by 2021 and make climate action one of five pillars in an economic reform plan. Liu He, an official of the Government of China, identified pollution reduction as one of three critical challenges for his country. Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also discussed climate action, while Thomas Buberl, head of global insurance company AXA, said the corporation will stop insuring coal projects and plans to divest from coal.

On oceans, the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Ocean, Peter Thomson, and Isabella Lövin, Sweden’s Deputy Prime Minister, launched the ‘Friends of Ocean Action’ partnership with US$4.5 million in funding from the Benioff Ocean Initiative. The global partnership to save the oceans will bring together 40 ocean leaders and activists to leverage their collective networks and accelerate action towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goal on Oceans (SDG 14).

On tackling pollution and waste, leaders from Alphabet, The Coca-Cola Company, Royal Philips, Unilever and others will partner with the governments of China, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Rwanda and international organizations to form the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE). PACE aims to go beyond the 9% of waste that is currently cycled back into the economy by tackling plastics pollution and electronic waste. Chile is partnering with TriCiclos and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to implement a national plan to move towards a circular economy, making it the second country in the world to implement such a plan.

The UN Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development announced its intention to connect the world’s 3.8 billion people without internet access by 2025. The Commission set seven targets that focus on expanding broadband infrastructure, internet access and use in support of achieving the SDGs. Targets to “connect the other half” include: ensuring that 60% of the world’s youth and adult population achieve a minimum level of proficiency in sustainable digital skills; reducing by 50% the number of unconnected micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises; and ensuring the affordability of entry-level broadband services in developing countries, at less than 2% of monthly gross national income per capita (GNI). The WEF addressed a number of other related topics during its sessions, including on big data and artificial intelligence.

Organizations announced many other technology-related initiatives. They included: the WEF initiative, the IT industry Skills Initiative, aiming to reach one million IT workers by 2021; Peru plans to launch an ‘Internet for All’ programme in 2018; the Craig Newmark Foundation in collaboration with WEF will collaborate to bring together internet platform giants with multi-stakeholder leaders, as part of efforts to tackle fake news; the Government of Canada and WEF launched a ‘Known Traveller digital Identity’ prototype to test emerging technologies, with the aim of facilitating more secure and seamless air travel; and WEF launched the Global Centre for Cybersecurity, a multi-stakeholder platform that aims to create a safe operating environment for new technologies like the artificial intelligence, the internet of things, drones and autonomous vehicles.

On sanitation, the Toilet Board Coalition (TBC) highlighted the opportunity of the ‘Sanitation Economy,’ the future marketplace of tackling the global sanitation crisis through innovative toilet design, smart digital technologies, and the circular economy. During a WEF roundtable discussion, CEOs expressed support for a new Action Agenda for the Sanitation Economy. Unilever CEO Paul Polman said the TBC’s work on the Sanitation Economy “highlights the immense business opportunities of providing universal access to safe sanitation,” stressing that SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) should be a key part of companies’ growth strategies.

In addition, the WEF’s Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution added new network centers in India, Japan and the United Arab Emirates and several countries and companies joined as partners. Denmark became the first European country to partner with WEF and will collaborate with WEF on green growth, trade and education, gender, and work.

On poverty and inequality, Oxfam’s Executive Director, Winnie Byanyima said that a future without global extreme poverty “is possible if we redesign our economy to truly reward hard work, rather than wealth.”

Additional announcements made at WEF addressed, inter alia, issues related to genomics, decent work, rule of law, education, and food security. On education, Canada will double its commitment to the Global Partnership for Education Fund, providing an extra CAD$180 million between 2018 and 2020. The Earth Bio-Genome Project and the Earth Bank of Codes will sequence the DNA of all life on earth, with the aim of averting extinction and tackling habitat loss and bio-piracy. On poverty eradication, the WEF initiative, the Closing the Skills Gap, aims to deliver new skills to 10 million workers by 2020; WEF launched the ‘UpLink’ initiative to connect start-ups with investors, universities, governments and others; and Common Goal launched a program that aims to break the cycle of poverty by encouraging footballers to pledge one percent of their salaries to charities that use football as a tool for social change. Finally, on food security, the WEF initiative, Meat: The Future, will identify ways to transform the future of meat and protein production to deliver safe, affordable and sustainable protein. On rule of law, Thomson Reuters, Europol and WEF are partnering to tackle human trafficking and money laundering, including by promoting more effective information-sharing and improving compliance.

Many publications addressed topics related to the WEF 48 theme. The Business and Sustainable Development Commission’s Blended Finance Taskforce released a consultation paper titled, ‘Better Finance, Better World,’ to develop actionable recommendations on the 2030 agenda. The annual ‘Inclusive Development Index’ (IDI) assesses the economic performance of 103 countries on 11 dimensions of economic progress that go beyond gross domestic product (GDP). The report examines living standards and how nations “future-proof” their economies. The ‘Global Risks Report’ finds that environmental risks are among the most dangerous facing the world. The publication, ‘Harnessing the Fourth Industrial Revolution for Life on Land’ highlights how human activity has placed increasing stress on the earth’s natural systems. ‘Innovation with a Purpose: The role of technology innovation in accelerating food systems transformation’ identifies emerging technologies that can drive the sustainability, inclusivity, efficiency, and health impacts of food systems to achieve the SDGs. The report, ‘Towards a Reskilling Revolution’ underscores the importance of life-long learning. Other WEF reports address recycling, the global gender gap, the impact of migration on cities, and data on migration, among other topics.

Photo by: Pixabay

By 2050, the world’s population is expected to rise to over 9 billion, with 2 billion people above the age of 60. Governments have agreed on a very ambitious set of Sustainable Development Goals to address the challenges inherent in population growth of this magnitude.

Recent estimates by the World Health Organization published in The Lancet state that reaching SDG 3 — which addresses healthy lives and well-being — would require new investments increasing over time from an initial $134 billion annually to $371 billion by 2030 in order to address the health challenges for 67 low- and middle-income countries.

To put this number in perspective: About the magnitude of this amount, the total global development aid across all sectors reached an all-time peak of $142.6 billion in 2016, an increase of 8.9 percent from 2015 after adjusting for exchange rates and inflation.

Practical steps to make PPPs work for Africa health systems African health ministers met with the private sector in Dakar for the 2017 Africa Health Business Symposium to discuss how to lay the groundwork for successful public-private partnerships in the health sector.

It is clear that no single government, civil society, or the private sector can foot this bill. New mindsets, technologies, models for collaboration, financing, and delivery approaches are needed to ensure all people receive the care that they need. The good news is that we have already seen a few projects successfully tackling challenges of similar magnitude.

We immunized 640 million children and prevented more than 9 million deaths in the process in the past 17 years. How?

By 2000, global efforts for vaccinations had begun to plateau. To address that, a new business model was introduced in order to accelerate the access to lifesaving vaccines in the countries that need them the most. This was the birth of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance which took place at the World Economic Forum Annual meeting in Davos in 2000. Gavi’s model is to pool demand from the world’s poorest countries, sending a clear signal to manufacturers of a large and viable market for vaccines. Predictable, long-term donor support, together with country co-financing, provides security for countries to adopt vaccine programmes. It also makes it possible for manufacturers to make new investments in production capacity. As a country’s income grows, its co-financing payments gradually increase to reduce the donor reliance and sustainably cover the full cost of vaccines. Manufacturers are better able to plan their production and supply the right vaccines at more affordable prices.

We saved 22 million lives from the deadliest infectious diseases AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in just 15 years. How?

A new financing and partnership model was developed based on the principle that all those involved in the response to the diseases should be part of the decision-making process.

Governments, civil society, communities affected by the diseases, technical partners, the private sector, faith-based organizations, and other funders must partner in the response which must be implemented by the countries themselves. Country ownership means that people determine their own solutions to fighting these three diseases, and take full responsibility for them. Each country tailors its response to the political, cultural, and epidemiological context. Ongoing financing depends upon performance and proven results, carefully monitored and verified by external parties called Local Fund Agents. This is how the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria operates: It is a financing institution, providing support to countries without implementing programs on the ground. Its 10-year anniversary was celebrated at the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, when a new round of funding of $750 million was announced by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

We can avoid the annual global cost of a severe pandemic which could reach as high as $570 billion, or 0.7% of global income. How?

Ebola and now Zika demonstrate the persistent risks to countries which do not possess adequate capacities to prepare and respond to emerging pandemic threats. Ebola alone affected 28,639 people and caused 11,316 deaths, leading to a $2.2 billion in GDP lost in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, threatening not only macroeconomic stability but also food security, human capital development, and private sector growth. How can the world prepare for the next pandemic?

The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations is preparing us for that. CEPI wants to galvanize the development of new vaccines against diseases we know could cause the next devastating epidemic by creating an innovative partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil organizations to tackle the barriers to epidemic vaccine development, advancing safe, effective, and affordable vaccines to contain outbreaks at the earliest possible stage. The focus is on two main objectives: Advancing at least four vaccine candidates against two to three priority pathogens to proof-of-concept in five years, to enable clinical efficacy testing in the initial stages of a potential outbreak; and building technical and institutional platforms to accelerate research and development response to known or unknown pathogen emergencies. CEPI is also exploring how to support multivalent Ebola vaccine R&D and facilitate regulatory preparedness and stockpiling.

We can help emerging economies gain access to life-saving health care innovation. How?

Most of the innovative technologies and health care delivery approaches today are very expensive for emerging economies. For example, access to health care professionals: Nigeria has roughly 14 percent of the number of doctors per capita of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. To catch up, it would need approximately 12 times as many doctors by 2030, requiring — under current training models — about $51 billion or 10 times current annual Nigerian public health spending. Thus, new models and approaches have to be adopted.

One such approach is innovative financing provided through risk pooling, social impact bonds or equity investments, and deployed via health insurance, loans, extended payment terms or leasing structures such as managed equipment services, or MES. In Africa, the Kenyan government is providing citizens with access to improved medical services including the latest medical technologies, training and skills development across 98 Ministry of Health hospitals through an MES with GE Healthcare for over $450 million. This convenes implementation partners, lenders, risk insurers, and advisory services in a new approach for risk and reward sharing and credit underwriting, for a big ticket health care modernization.

Another approach is based on innovative delivery systems. In Andhra Pradesh, India, the Health Management and Research Institute developed a program for pregnant women in remote areas to consult obstetricians and gynaecologists in Hyderabad through an internet-based video system accompanied by community health workers. Initial results indicate that the system has helped raise the rate of safe hospital or clinic deliveries by 50 percent.

Building on the experiences with public-private partnerships, we might yet be able to find the billions our world’s global health goals require.

The district on Thursday announced an initiative to connect every district school with a faith-based community partner to help with academic support, student basic needs, and personal and career development, among other services.

The district is now trying to determine which schools have a defined partnership with a religious institution, but estimates that 25 to 30 percent of schools already do. Sharlonda Buckman, senior executive director of family and community engagement, said that the district hopes that, by the end of the year, every one of its 106 schools “has a religious partner working with them in tandem toward the goal of helping our children achieve.”

The program was announced at a press conference at the N’Namdi Center for Contemporary Art in Midtown, attended by educators, school board members, and invited guests.

“It doesn’t surprise me when I look around the room and see our religious leaders, because you guys, for a long time, have been investing in our children and our people, and it’s been an informal effort,” Buckman said. “You’ve worked with a number of our schools across the district, so today we recognize that we don’t need to do it informally anymore — we need to make this a formal part of how we move this district forward.”

The district is not unique in its approach: church-school partnerships are common across the country and in the state. The national partnering organization Kids Hope USA is based near Holland, Michigan. Supporters believe that stronger faith-school ties will not only improve local support for schools, but also help provide vital services for children and a more stable personal and family foundation upon which learning could take place.

District leaders “cannot lift our children up to their full potential by themselves,” Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said at the press conference. “We need help in that work.”

The district is looking to the faith-based partners to provide services such as tutoring, coaching, chaperoning; deliver before and after school support; donate uniforms and other goods; and highlight teachers at their institutions through announcements and bulletins.

R. Khari Brown, a professor of sociology at Wayne State, said the faith community is already deeply ingrained in Detroit in a variety of ways.

“There are a lot of community centers that closed down over the years in the city, and most churches in the city provide some sort of programming,” he said. “They provide backpacks and school supplies, so [the partnership] makes sense.”

Religion is also a large part of the culture of many African Americans, he said, and a significant force in a district where 81 percent of the students were black in 2016-2017.

“Most African Americans want their churches to be involved on the ills that disproportionately affect black people.” he said.

While other communities might balk at such intermingling of church and state, Brown said he believes that it is a “non issue” in this case because the religious institutions are not receiving money from the district.

The ACLU of Michigan said it had no comment at this time but that the organization hopes to “continue to learn more” about the district’s initiative.

Vitti said a more explicit district-faith community partnership could provide both protection and support for Detroit’s children.

“What I’m talking about is developing a stronger safety net to ensure that what students are not receiving in homes, what students are not receiving in school, can be addressed through the faith-based community,” Vitti said. “When we go back to when the city was at its peak, we worked together as a team to lift children up. When children fell through the cracks, there was a safety net to catch them and lift them back up. That happened through the school system, through the churches, the synagogues.”

Vitti said the initiative is part of his larger effort to align schools and the community more closely. Since starting in his position as superintendent in May of last year, he has been pressing programs like the parent academy.

The academy will provide parents with lessons on subjects like what to ask during parent-teacher conferences, how to create stronger readers, how to fill out FAFSA paperwork, and even how to print a resume. Vitti said most of all, it would empower parents to pursue educational goals for their children, even if they weren’t the best students themselves.

“Every parent knows education is important, but parents don’t know how to navigate the system often, and they feel hypocritical when they push their children when they know they didn’t do well in school,” he said.

Vitti said he envisions a time when faith-based institutions could house some of the parent services.

He said he also sees the faith community working side by side with the district’s 5,000 role models initiative. The program is recruiting volunteers to work with middle and high school African American and Hispanic students, and plans to have sponsors in each school to work with students daily, taking them on field trips and providing an open line of communication.","Each Detroit public school might soon have its own church, synagogue, mosque, temple, chapel, or parish as a partner.

by Lisa H. Schwartz

Jan. 5, 2018

For Clint Carroll, participatory research is relevant to both tribal communities and the university.

In a recent interview, Carroll, assistant professor of ethnic studies, with a concentration in Native American and indigenous studies, described his long-term commitment to working with his people, the Cherokee Nation. The discussion highlighted how obstacles have guided Carroll’s learning and the methodologies he uses for community-engaged scholarship.

In his research, Carroll has worked closely with the Cherokee Nation Medicine Keepers, a group of Cherokee elders working to preserve traditional ethnobotanical knowledge and to use this knowledge to affect environmental policy. His book, Roots of Our Renewal: Ethnobotany and Cherokee Environmental Governance (University of Minnesota Press, 2015), discusses the evolution of the Medicine Keepers.

In describing his research and facilitation of the Medicine Keepers, Carroll emphasized that knowledge cannot be separated from a people’s way of life and access to resources.

A five-year National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development award Carroll received in 2017 will extend this work, which is being documented in this blog. He also recently published a study in July 2017 on arsenic exposure in American Indian elders.

Carroll received his doctorate in environmental science, policy, and management from the University of California Berkeley and joined CU Boulder from the University of Minnesota in Fall 2015.

The importance of mentors, dialogic relationships with stakeholders, empowering leadership from within the community, and the dialectic of action and scholarly reflection are other keys to Carroll’s success as a community-engaged researcher.

This is part of the Office for Outreach and Engagement's Engaged Scholars Interview series, which is designed to bring the process of community-engaged scholarship to life through discussions with exemplary CU Boulder scholars.

Why do you do community-engaged work as part of your research, teaching or creative work?

Making scholarship relevant to my community: Networking, mentors, persistence, and knowledge gaps

When I was an undergraduate at the University of Arizona (UA), I participated in numerous faculty-led research projects through the Bureau of Applied Research in Anthropology. These community-centered environmental research projects inspired me to pursue similar work relevant to my community in Oklahoma. I grew up in Dallas, Texas, away from Cherokee communities in Oklahoma, which, of course, created both a physical and social distance between me and the tribe. But with the help of Cherokee/Creek Professor Tom Holm in the American Indian Studies Program at UA (still a valuable mentor to me today), I contacted Cherokee Nation policy analyst Dr. Richard Allen, who later became a valuable friend and mentor. Dr. Allen in turn connected me to others, including Nancy John, who directs the Cherokee Nation Office of Environmental Protection. I was very persistent in contacting folks, which I knew risked annoying them, but I think ultimately they were interested in what I could possibly bring to the table, given my tribal citizenship and my research experiences.

Nancy John really went out on a limb for me and brought me on as an “emergency hire” the summer after I graduated with my BA in anthropology and American Indian studies. As the Cherokee Nation’s equivalent of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), she explained that they knew a lot about air and water quality, but didn’t have much information on traditional knowledge. In other words, there was no central source for that information within the tribal offices. Nancy proposed that I put together a database of traditional ethnobotanical knowledge as it related to environmental impacts on culturally significant plants in order to raise awareness of the importance of this knowledge and to guide tribal policy.

Benefits and challenges of access to traditional community knowledge

At the time, a source that people were using for this information was a book published in the 1800s, written by Richard Foreman, a Cherokee physician. My job was to to go out and talk to contemporary Cherokees who were still using wild plants. That in itself was a daunting task because of the subject matter. When someone asks about plants, Cherokee people will first want to know if you are talking about crops that they grow in the garden or if are you talking about medicine. If you are talking about medicine, the access to that knowledge is tremendously restricted depending on who you are and why you are asking. So, this created a “roadblock” of sorts that could only be addressed through years of relationship-building.

Reflect on your particular experience and journey as a scholar. How has your experience shaped your beliefs and practices?

Designing of community-based projects through encountering obstacles

The ethnobotany project in the Office of Environmental Protection launched my work as a graduate student, and got me thinking about what it means to design a community-based project. The lessons I have learned have been through the process of encountering obstacles. I had to reflect on and figure out how to do the work ethically and responsibly with regard to community buy-in and support, and through tending to the relationships that I established--not only during that first summer, but through the course of my graduate education. Building relationships with individuals was a huge component of my graduate work.

The dialectic of community engaged work and scholarly reflection

After I spent the summer of 2004 working with the tribe in Oklahoma, I went to UC Berkeley for graduate school. Needless to say, Berkeley was a drastically different place compared to rural northeastern Oklahoma. But the time I spent during the academic year at Berkeley allowed me to reflect on my summer field work (which I continued for the subsequent two summers), and created an interesting dialectic that produced my dissertation, and later the book.

Facilitating community conversation and action: The birth of the Medicine Keepers

The Medicine Keepers came into being in October 2008, through a meeting with a group of elders that I convened as a result of the obstacles I had experienced during the summers I spent in Oklahoma. Everyone agreed that what I was doing was a good project, but no one was motivated to openly participate—there was still a very valid hesitancy to talk about this subject. During this time, I had started working for the tribe’s Natural Resources Department, under the supervision of Pat Gwin. He and I worked to convene a meeting with many of the individuals I had been talking to about the project. We thought that a conversation among themselves, not just with me, would be more productive to furthering the goals of the project. At that meeting, the elders talked about how their ethnobotanical knowledge was something that they had grown up with and was an important part of their way of life, but they were not seeing this knowledge being transferred to young people. They questioned themselves: “are we going to throw our hands up or are we going to work to get this knowledge to future generations?” That moment crystallized their goals and they decided, “we have to do something about this.” That is how the Medicine Keepers group was born, and they continue to meet about this goal today.

Knowledge situated in ways of life

Taking a giant step back and looking at this work from a historical perspective allowed me to see how Cherokee plant knowledge cannot be separated from the way of life that encompasses that knowledge, including the ability to access and manage natural resources. In the book, I describe the Medicine Keepers as a significant formation for revitalizing plant knowledge as well as guiding tribal environmental governance based on ancestral knowledge and values.

How do you integrate your community work into your research, teaching and creative work?

Continued dialogue with the Medicine Keepers

During the process of writing the dissertation, I continued to be in dialogue with the Medicine Keepers. It wasn’t like, “hey I got what I need and now I’m out!” I had flexibility because of fellowships and I would go back to Oklahoma to help convene and facilitate the Medicine Keepers’ group meetings. As a facilitator, I worked to keep momentum going for the group. I would share with the Medicine Keepers my ideas about what I thought was happening and how I was approaching the work—I would run it by them as a collective. This relationship has continued to the present.

Affecting policy change and perceptions with community-engaged research

In 2015, I partnered with the Medicine Keepers on another project that was designed to provide a platform for their collective voice on local environmental issues. We used Photovoice methodology, a participatory research approach that puts cameras into the hands of participants and seeks to gain their perspective. First, we convened the Medicine Keepers and the group decided on “land” and “health” as the two concepts for the project. They were tasked with taking photos of what those concepts meant to them, and then I interviewed them about their photos individually and as a group. After that, I put together a documentary with their still images and voiceovers, which they screened and then provided feedback and revisions. The final version of the video, titled “Cherokee Voices for the Land,” was shown during the Cherokee National Holiday, which draws thousands of people to Tahlequah, Oklahoma each year. Importantly, we didn’t just screen it, we also surveyed people before and after they saw the film so that we were able quantify changes in people’s values and knowledge of certain cultural concepts as a result of watching the video. The Medicine Keepers and I published an article of public scholarship in Langscape Magazine, and I co-authored an article manuscript with the academic mentors who helped me design the project, which we recently submitted to the journal EcoHealth. This work ultimately seeks to inform positive changes in tribal environmental policy. A lot of people have seen the video in tribal leadership, and I think it’s had a positive impact on the way the tribe is approaching land management.

NSF early career award: A community project for Native science

I recently received an NSF early career award for an integrated education and research project, in which I draw from current work in Indigenous studies on land-based education as a method for decolonization. Getting back to the idea of dialogue, before I wrote the proposal, I went to the Medicine Keepers and spoke with the group about the idea. I noted their previously-voiced aspirations for teaching their knowledge to younger generations, and shared that I had an opportunity to apply for a grant that would develop a combined research and education program. After presenting my ideas, they said “go for it.” The project is currently underway, and I’m excited to be continuing my work with them with the support of the NSF.

Learning about our connection to the land historically and in the present is one way to counteract colonial legacies. I didn't quite say the word “decolonization” in the NSF proposal [laughter], but the key was to emphasize how the project integrates Native ways of knowing and Western science and couches it in research experience for Native undergraduate and graduate students. Learning the Cherokee language will also be a central component of the project.

Navigating changing landscapes through dynamic practices

Our primary research question is: how are Cherokee people navigating a landscape of uncertainty characterized by checkerboarded property lines and confounded by climate change? Our methods and approach emphasize that environmental knowledge is a way of life, not something that is static—it’s based in practices, places, and relationships. We aim for our work to inform broader understandings of Indigenous adaptations to colonialism and climate change, as well as Cherokee Nation land conservation plans. We hope to facilitate strategies by which Cherokee communities can control their own areas, thereby maintaining or gaining access to resources and thus perpetuating practices that inform their way of life and contribute to landscape and community health.

What are some strategies you use, what have you learned about balancing the demands of community work and academia?

Medicine Keepers as leadership, Carroll as facilitator

The Medicine Keepers are partners in the entire NSF project. I don’t think this type of work could happen successfully without their partnership, what with the limitations of my own position. With a family and a full-time job, it’s more difficult to go and set up residence in Oklahoma compared to when I was a grad student.

So, the support and leadership from the Medicine Keepers, though their cultural knowledge and their embeddedness in local familial networks, will be central to the success of the project. Their guidance in determining the best approach to asking very sensitive research questions is key to the success of the project, which ranges from participatory mapping projects to plant gathering interviews. The five undergraduate student researchers that we will recruit for the land education program ideally will have an investment in the community, so that they will stick around and potentially assume positions of leadership. In addition to being the Principal Investigator of the grant, I will continue my role as facilitator and convener to the Medicine Keepers, emphasizing dialogue and fostering the elders’ leadership throughout the process.

How I integrate community-based work with teaching is a key factor in thinking about pedagogy and advising and how I will fold those lessons into the courses I teach. It is a challenge to make my work locally-significant in a realm that requires long-term relationships. How do I translate this work locally, here in Colorado? I have only been at CU for two years and I know I have to give it time, develop networks, and be persistent. But I’ve always wanted to do a “lab” with my Indigenous environmental issues course that entails hands-on experience with a local Native community-based project where we can put the lessons from class into practice.

In my department, we have the Comparative Ethnic Studies PhD program through which I am also training an Indigenous graduate student, who will be helping out with the NSF research component in the future.

What is your experience with / thoughts on / plan for tenure?

Although this doesn’t necessarily factor into tenure decisions, I go about this work acknowledging that in community-based work, we often do two times the amount of work as compared to social scientific work that does not employ participatory methodologies. But I also approach my work knowing its value in producing projects that actually have local relevance and that provide something tangible and meaningful for the communities with which I work. With that in mind, for example with the Photovoice project, we were able to produce something collectively that provided a platform to engage with tribal policy and had also had methods to quantify participants’ perceptions, leading to scholarly publications. From this work, we sought to produce a journal article manuscript as well as the Langscape article that, while it is more publically-accessible, is less heavily weighted within academia.

Furthermore, drawing from Beth Osnes’ interview, I agree with the idea that active critical reflection (theorizing) isn’t necessarily antithetical to the work that we do in academia. In Indigenous studies, this kind of engaged scholarship is a very positive thing. It contributes an Indigenous voice to literature on methodology, ethnography, environmental studies, anthropology, et cetera. Many of these areas haven’t had that voice in the past, and in fact have historically marginalized those voices, or presented them as the “other.”

In my field of Indigenous studies, especially as regards my training and influences from the University of Arizona, a key consideration for scholarship is that the community somehow be a part of the work. In fact, within our field, if a scholar does not articulate the relevance to the community, then the research can be viewed as suspect. So, I try to have a foot in both community-based scholarship and developing theory that centers Indigenous studies scholarship while drawing from other fields as well. I aim to build theoretical understandings and to build the field of Indigenous studies, while being in dialogue with anthropology and political ecology, both fields that informed my training.

Regarding this work (engaged scholarship), what kind of mentorship have you received and how do you mentor others? Any advice for others who are interested in this work?

Through a discussion with the Medicine Keepers in November, I learned that the word in Cherokee for “teach” more accurately describes the act of “showing.” So, to say “teach me” actually translates as “show me”--squeyohvga. There is a clear line between what the elders consider “pushy” or “bossy,” and leading by example. When I am working with elders who I see as mentors, they are showing me how to be a better Cherokee, to engage things that sometimes the university space is not conducive for thinking about or doing.

Recently, the Native Investigator Development Program, showed me how to craft research proposals and to learn about effective grant-writing skills. It was an invaluable program for me that I want to give credit to. The final deliverable was to write a grant proposal, and this incubated my successful NSF award, as well as helped to develop the PhotoVoice project. In the NSF project there will be five Cherokee undergraduate students funded to work with the Medicine Keepers. I will work with them as a mentor, together with the Medicine Keepers and our tribal biologist, Pat Gwin. Emphasizing the importance of learning multiple knowledge traditions, we will work to foster and grow a next generation of tribal environmental leaders— that is the grand goal of the project.

I have received a lot of amazing mentorship. I’d like to build upon that, but also develop my own unique approach to mentoring. At Berkeley, I had a great primary advisor and committee, but none of them were Native. Conversely, at the University of Arizona I had a lot of Native faculty mentors. So, I ask myself: how can I merge that experience with Berkeley while also taking my own approach? How can I incorporate the mentorship I receive from my community as well? How can I extend this to when I design a graduate seminar, so that I foster a different space for dialogue and discussion? These are the big questions that I have. I want to be critically engaged in the way that I go forward in my own mentoring styles. Perhaps in ten or twenty years I will know more, but it will always be an active process.","Native American and indigenous studies professor designs research relevant to tribal communities and the academyby Lisa H.

They sit on a rug in a semicircle as Vogel plays guitar and the kids clap and sing along.

Vogel transitions into having the kids doing an exercise that requires them to take small scarfs and make fish movements and sounds. She is teaching from the Orff in Your Community program, and it’s designed as a way for the kids to learn dexterity, focus, and social skills through music and movement, according to Alison Scott-Williams, vice president, arts education at NJPAC.



One can sense the level of training needed to teach the class as well as the care Vogel has put into it. It is part of NJPAC’s Arts Education program, and is being repeated in a variety of classes all over the city. NJPAC offers seven program pathways including jazz, hip-hop, modern and tap dance, poetry, devised theater, film, and musical theater.



“In offering programs in just those seven areas we have the goal of bringing students from observing and experiencing a performance in that area, to learning how to perform through our training programs, and then progressing to making and creating art, which expresses the student’s authentic voice,” said Scott-Williams.



NJPAC’s arts education program has accompanied the city’s resurgence. Right outside the Leaders for Life Center, signs of neighborhood revitalization are underway, including a new woman’s resource center, city commissioned murals and freshly paved roads. And, the aforementioned Orff in Your Community program is part of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka’s Centers of Hope initiative, which offers city residents a variety of services including art programs, job readiness training, financial literacy and athletics.



Scott-Williams has been at NJPAC for three years after a stint at The Juilliard School in Manhattan. She sees herself as both a steward and innovator for the program.



“I’m building upon what is here, and have created new partnerships in film, modern dance, tap dance and devised theatre, including two consecutive summers of [actor, dancer and choreographer] Savion Glover creating and devising a musical with 40 students.”



One of her big-picture goals is to develop a pipeline of students who are prepared to advance their arts education. In doing so, one area she felt needed to be addressed was getting children involved in music at an earlier age.



Scott-Williams partnered with the Newark School District in bringing a recorder program to the city’s third graders, and created a professional development program for teachers so they could teach recorder lessons. While the program started small, it has evolved into nearly all of Newark’s third-grade students playing the recorder and other school districts requesting the program, explained Scott-Williams.



Economic impact and development

NJPAC and the Greater Newark arts scene has had a large economic impact on both the city and state. According to the Arts & Economic Prosperity 5 study conducted by the nonprofit Americans for the Arts, “the nonprofit arts and culture sector is a $178.3 million industry in the City of Newark — one that supports 4,963 full-time equivalent jobs and generates $15.6 million in local and state government revenue.”



One unique economic project NJPAC has been involved in is the development of One Theater Square, a newly constructed residential high-rise that will be 22 stories and offer 245 apartments in downtown Newark when it’s completed next summer. It will be the city’s first new upscale residential high-rise in a half-century.



The development of One Theater Square is a public private partnership that includes NJPAC, developer Dranoff Properties, the city, state, Prudential Financial and Fifth Third Bank.



A few miles east of the Leaders for Arts center, NJPAC teaching artist and former arts education student Daryl Stewart is working with a class of seventh graders at the South Street School for the Musical Theater In-School Residency Program.



Working alongside musician Joe Lesky, on the keyboard, Stewart is preparing the class in a production of the musical Rent. The students chose the production based off a list the Stewart and the students’ teacher compiled. Stewart tried to find “a point of entrance that would make musical theater accessible to the students.”



One important goal, Scott-Williams noted, is to allow kids a measure of self-expression through their performances. That, she added, can serve as a counterbalance to what is going on at home or in the neighborhood, she said.



Some students have stayed involved in the program and excelled to the point of making the arts a career. Scott-Williams proudly points to a number of students who have gone onto successful careers. For example, she mentions musician Tyshawn Sorey, who was in NJPAC’s Well Fargo Jazz for Teens program and awarded a MacArthur Foundation “genius” grant.



Beyond the city limits

The children of Newark are not the only benefactors of the arts. NJPAC has the largest educational arts outreach program in the state, and provides children across New Jersey with the opportunity to learn and participate in all facets of performing arts and cultural programming. According to Scott-Williams, NJPAC’s Arts Education offerings reach almost 80,000 students and families each year, through live performances, in-school residency programs and training classes.



And NJPAC’s SchoolTime performance series, which introduces students and their families to performing arts on stage, features concerts, musicals and dance programs designed specifically for school-age youngsters. More than 24,000 children attend these programs every year; often, they are the students’ first exposure to live performance.



NJPAC continues to grow outside of the Newark area and is launching more programs statewide. Scott-Williams points to partnerships with the East Orange, Union City and Jersey City school districts as well its burgeoning relationship with Asbury Park. NJPAC is working with the town’s school district, and was instrumental in bringing famed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson to the Asbury Park Convention Center recently for a speaking engagement geared for families.



When asked about the most rewarding aspect of the job, Scott-Williams points out the murals with hip-hop images surrounding her in one of the rooms at NJPAC.



“For me it is seeing students’ self-expression grow,” she said. “The authentic voice and the confidence a student gains while learning how to create in our programs is a life-changing experience. For example, we have young men who began our programs practically silent, and who are now running for student council president, or using poetry and spoken word, to deliver platform speeches to their entire student bodies.”

What value does a top pharmaceutical contract manufacturer bring to its customers? There are many important ways that a contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) brings value to its pharmaceutical partners. Perhaps most important is being a driver in moving a product forward, not an anchor that weighs the process down or holds it back.The outsourcing partner must be able to get the product over the finish line—whether that’s clinical trial batches, development work, or commercial manufacture—in line with the sponsor’s expectations. You don’t ever want the CMC (chemistry, manufacturing, and controls) portion of your regulatory filing to hold up approval of the product. So a clean CMC from the work your CDMO provides is of tremendous value in getting patients the drugs they need on time, as well as contributing to the pharmaceutical company’s overall financial goals.CDMOs are entrusted with protecting their pharmaceutical partner’s brand reputations. That means CDMOs must have solid reputations themselves for consistently high-quality products and processes, great technology, and expertise. This is most reliably learned through word-of-mouth, and also the CDMO’s regulatory filings and products on the market. To have a reputable and industry-respected CDMO is of tremendous value. It also helps tremendously when regulators look at your filings; they want to know who’s manufacturing product and can be reassured by the manufacturer’s reputation.CDMOs add value when they have the resources needed by pharma, so pharma doesn’t have to invest its capital. Does the CDMO have the technologies and equipment necessary for the job? For example, biologics facilities are expensive to construct, so you can preserve your capital for clinical development and trials by outsourcing to a well-equipped, cost-efficient, biologics-capable CDMO.Similar to the more tangible technology and equipment lists, experience and expertise add value of a softer, but no less important, nature. It’s valuable when a CDMO can save you time, not to mention aggravation, because they have overcome challenges that are similar to one you may be having. Or when it contributes scientific, manufacturing, and business/operational expertise that keeps your project on track.Value is also derived when a CDMO can deliver what you need, and only what you need, when you need it. We have clients who just need us to manufacture clinical trial batches, but also those who aren’t ready for manufacturing and need development work. We also have clients who transition with us from clinical to commercial manufacturing. Meeting their exact need can be critical to helping clients keep their project budgets and regulatory timelines, on track.An essential value is the relationship between the CDMO and the pharmaceutical sponsor. How do you know you’re important to the CDMO? How are they are going to prioritize your needs? Certainly the contract between the two parties protects interests, but the relationship is the additive that makes the engagement work well. There is tremendous value when you have confidence in the organizational capabilities and commitment of your CDMO to have a “customer first” mentality. The old adage is certainly true, if you don’t take care of your customers, someone else will.Keith Kentala is vice president of commercial operations at AbbVie Contract Manufacturing .

Much of the conversation around digital transformation tends to focus on the big picture. We talk of preparing for the next disruption or opportunity. But scratch the surface, and transformation is clearly a course with many elements. It changes not just profits and processes, but people as well.

We recently partnered with the Institute for the Future (IFTF) to study the changing relationship between people and technology. Technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), robotics, IoT and cloud computing are already creating deeper connections between people and machines. This will only grow.

Organisations who recognise and embrace this have the chance to weather the disruption, while also emerging as the most influential player. We can’t think of transformation as one focused on technology. It needs to focus on the nexus of machines and people.

It’s hard for organisations to navigate through uncertainty, but the people part of the equation needs to be at the front of your mind. If your digital transformation strategy is strong, then both your business and your employees will be on the right path.

Any technological change brings a shift in jobs, we just have to look back in history to the jobs that no longer exist. But there’s an opportunity for the changes ahead to be a diversion, not a displacement of human capital.

It’s clear that machine learning and artificial intelligence will eventually do some tasks better than a human, especially in areas such as data processing and collection or highly predictable physical duties.

Manufacturing is an obvious example, but AI is also making inroads into the health, education and finance sectors where speed, cost-savings and accuracy can be harnessed to create personalised, customer-focused services.

We might have driverless cars but we will never have such a thing as a driverless business. There will always be things that only we humans can do. This will open up a wealth of opportunities for new jobs and new ways to approach tasks.

Digital transformation will help your business do things better and faster. For instance, in the near future, virtual reality will break out of its gaming niche and take root as a business application. This will not only change how we do everything from remote work, conference calls and training but create new opportunities we could barely imagine a few years ago.

Late last year, researchers at Stanford University in the US were working with the National Football League to use VR in diversity-training. Essentially, they put players in the shoes of victims of racist or sexist treatment. It’s not an application you’d necessarily think of immediately, but it highlights the sort possibilities that exist for people across any industry to do their job in a radically new way.

That’s why leaders from business, government and education need to think on the front foot, identifying new roles and upskilling people so they can realise the potential of the new operating environment.

Just as the fourth industrial revolution involves changing the technological aspects of your operation to become an unencumbered and agile business, bringing humans along for the ride requires a multi-pronged approach. As machines become more advanced and capable, the balance between how machines and humans will operate alongside one another - in all aspects of life - will need to be redressed.

Creating new business models is the most obvious step. With many aspects of our daily life unheard of a decade ago, it is no wonder many people are asking if there are any industries left to disrupt. Successful businesses change all aspects of business in line with need and possibility and if they don’t, they risk being replaced by new entrants to the market.

They also don’t consider it a destination, continuing to innovate. Netflix disrupted the video store with mail-order rentals but then transitioned to streaming once that became technically viable. Uber established the ride-sharing service model but continues to explore the possibilities as autonomous vehicles develop.

The other element is investing in talent. The future will see us more dependent on technology and to harness the full potential, we need to bring our strengths to the table. We need to direct the technology to create the visions we want. We also need to solve the problems that prevent machines from getting us where we want.

The saying that kids in school are being prepared for jobs that don’t exist yet is true. In fact, it’s probably fair to say that these children will be applying for jobs that don’t exist in industries yet to be dreamed of. And they will work in a way that would be unrecognisable to us today.

The Institute for the Future has predicted that it’s the set of attitudes often associated with entrepreneurialism - being vision, perseverance and creative problem-solving - that will be a critical mindset for all workers in the next decade.

A measured approach to balancing the big picture objectives of an organisation with an entrepreneur’s drive to design workarounds and circumvent constraints will be the factors that differentiate great employees for the future. In other words, it’s the skills that traditionally define entrepreneurs that will be fundamental for all workers.

While developing these skills doesn’t rest solely on the shoulders of business leaders, organisations will only get the talent they need if they are willing to nurture it.

It’s particularly relevant in IT where the opportunity exists to get systems, storage or ICT business analysts out of their silos and working across the entire business, providing space to innovate and get projects running faster. This will change the way technology is viewed inside the organisation, which is a crucial element of digital transformation.

One of the key lessons from the Institute for the Future’s study is the importance of getting the executive layer of your business excited about IT and building this workforce. Regardless of sector, every business will need to be a technology company, with software at its core.

Organisations will need to have the right technological skills and a technical workforce capable of making the most of human-machine partnerships. These technical platforms will make or break organisations by 2030.

We are in the process setting up the technological framework to create a whole new world of opportunities that will fundamentally reshape the way we live and work. Now’s the time to get people excited about the potential opportunities emerging technologies will unleash and your business can truly reap the benefits.","We recently partnered with the Institute for the Future (IFTF) to study the changing relationship between people and technology.

14,https://observer.ug/viewpoint/56556-fao-promotes-ppp-model-to-boost-commercial-forestry.html,"Sat, 06 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",The Observer,How FAO promotes partnerships to boost tree farming,"Forests are very important because they provide wood for construction, energy, food security, a natural habitat for animals, and help to reduce the effects of climate change. But between 1990 and 2015, Uganda lost an average of 90,000 hectares of forests annually, shrinking the forest cover from 24 to 10 per cent. However, according to the ministry of Water and Environment, only about 7,000 hectares of planted forests have been established yearly in the last 15 years.

This imbalance threatens Uganda’s ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially on sustainably managing forests to mitigate climate change, transformation of Uganda into a green and modern economy, and the contribution of forests to livelihoods of current generations and those is posterity.

I applaud the government of Uganda for supporting commercial forestry through innovative approaches, while at the same time creating jobs and increasing household incomes. One such approach is the Sawlog Production Grant Scheme (SPGS) Phase III Project implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations (FAO) on behalf of the government of Uganda with funding from the European Union (EU), for a period of five years, starting in 2016.

SPGS III seeks to encourage private sector investment in commercial timber plantations by providing grants and forestry technical advice to private sector investors involved in tree planting for production of timber and electricity transmission poles.

Through this model and recognizing favorable government policies such as Build Uganda, Buy Uganda that promotes local consumption of domestic products, FAO, supported by the UN Office for Project Service (UNOPS), offers the investor a conditional grant of about 30 per cent of the estimated total investment.

The retrospective disbursement is made after a field inspection confirms that the investor has carried out critical forest operations and has complied with the FAO/SPGS III recommended standards for quality forest plantations.

This model helps to guarantee that the investor will have sufficient funds to effectively establish and manage the forest plantations while also ensuring that the plantations benefit from the recommended silvicultural operations that will favour high quality timber and transmission poles. Neglecting some key operations results in poor forest plantations and, therefore, poor return on investment.

So far, 520 small, medium and large scale tree growers have been selected throughout Uganda.

These will receive grants to plant a combined area of about 23,000 hectares. Grant management is done by UNOPS, for transparency and efficiency of financial resources.

Another success factor in SPGS III Project is the voluntary certification of tree nurseries and forest plantation contractors as key service providers in commercial forestry. Certification is vital because many investors in commercial forestry in Uganda have limited skills in operations related to forest plantation establishment and maintenance.

FAO/SPGS III offers training and recommends acceptable standards to nursery operators and contractors, who thereafter receive one-year rating-based certification which empowers them to guarantee customer satisfaction.

Lists of certified nursery operators and contractors are shared with the investors to enable them identify where to buy good quality seedlings or access technical know-how for establishment and maintenance operations such as planting, weeding, pruning and thinning.

Currently, FAO has certified 66 tree nurseries and 40 contractors (pruning and thinning).

The demand for certification is a positive indicator of the relevance that private sector players attribute to providing quality planting material and forestry services to support a vibrant sector.

FAO/SPGS III project is supporting downstream processing – including plantation infrastructure, skills development, timber logging, access to finances, saw milling and timber market development along the commercial forestry value chain to help match Uganda’s wood processing capacity to the local demand for wood products.

The State of Uganda’s Forestry 2016 reports that the estimated sawn-wood market in Uganda is 369,000 cubic meters with an estimated value of Shs 101 billion. FAO forecasts consumption of industrial wood at 1.7 million cubic meters by 2030. As such, SPGS III will help to expand supply while ensuring high quality timber on the Uganda market.

Local communities and institutions that are highly dependent of wood for energy are also benefitting from the SPGS III project which targets establishment of 4,000 and 2,500 hectares by communities and institutions respectively, majorly for provision of wood fuel or bioenergy.

So far, FAO, through the SPGS III project, has distributed about two million seedlings to communities and institutions in the country. Grants are also provided to growers, up to a target of 5,000 hectares for pruning and thinning forest operations.

To promote ownership and sustainability of this unique approach, FAO is implementing the Project with support from private and public entities. These include Uganda Timber Growers’ Association (UTGA), Forestry Sector Support Department (FSSD) of the Ministry of Water and Environment, Nyabyeya Forestry College, Makerere University, National Forestry Resources Research Institute (NaFORRI) and the National Forestry Authority (NFA).

FAO has also trained 20 district forest officers and forest officers from NFA, in plantation establishment and in drafting Forest Investment Plans.

Finally, the SPGS III project is fast showing that a model of co-investment (public-private partnership) and retrospective payment of grants for commercial tree planting can greatly incentivize private sector players to invest in commercial forestry and contribute to a critical mass of high quality plantations.

The latter are envisaged to result in high quality forest products such as timber and create jobs along the commercial forestry continuum. But, efforts are required in downstream processing, research and development as well as policy formulation and implementation to propel the sector.

In that common case, sustainability partnerships can fill the void.

These partnerships involve two or more businesses teaming up with each other for mutual benefits related to sustainability goals. Sometimes, a corporate brand and a nonprofit from the same industry will pair up, but, otherwise, entities from multiple sectors get together and pool their resources.

The latter situation is called a cross-sector partnership. There have also been instances where multiple companies have gotten together and relied on crowdsourcing to pinpoint needs and figure out how to tackle them.

Benefits Beyond Sustainability

These collaborative efforts don’t only have sustainability-related advantages. For example, the companies involved can learn best practices from each other, highlight inefficiencies and improve them, discover shared skillsets and more.

Also, a recent survey from Ask Your Target Market surveyed 1,000 people and found 59 percent of them will pay more for products they consider to be environmentally friendly, and 70 percent generally try to buy sustainable products whenever possible. If companies can take visible steps toward sustainability with the help of a partner company, they’re serving the planet and boosting profits at the same time.

Furthermore, generation Z, the youngest generation of adult consumers marketers target, is projected to make up 40 percent of all buyers by 2020. Analysts say brands must be active on social media to make a positive impact on this age group.

It’s also important for brands to be transparent about the causes that matter to them. A promoted sustainability partnership could help companies market to people from generation Z with a strong sense of social consciousness.

Engaging in a Partnership With Suppliers

Sometimes, it might be fruitful for a brand to start a partnership with an entire group. Knorr, a German soup company owned by Unilever, did that by appealing to its global suppliers . Once one of its growers designated a monetary amount for sustainable agriculture projects, Knorr would contribute half the total amount on top of a matched amount by the grower.

This team effort makes it easier for farmers to experiment with Earth-friendly practices that might otherwise be unaffordable. Knorr also gives priority to projects that investigate certain pressing matters such as biodiversity projects, efforts to reduce water waste and the phasing out of pesticides.

By getting involved in the farmers’ projects, Knorr shows commitment to progress in an actionable way, and the growers get much-needed funds. Also, Knorr can differentiate its brand from others by promoting this initiative on its consumer-facing materials, such as product packaging.

Helping Employees Understand Why Sustainability Matters

Most business leaders know if their employees don’t care about sustainable practices, it’ll be difficult for the company itself to make a meaningful impact. Microsoft understands that fact well, and that’s one of the primary reasons the tech company teamed up with the Earthwatch Institute, a worldwide environmental charity.

Microsoft employees involved in a leadership training program in Reading, United Kingdom, went into the woods near their workplace, led by Earthwatch Institute representatives. They spent the day collecting data about climate change and how it affects forests. They wanted information that would help them create a team-wide action plan for environmental sustainability at Microsoft and understand why energy-reduction strategies are crucial.

A year before that happened, Microsoft assisted the Earthwatch Institute via a technology grant that allowed the charity to build a customized database and enhance its website user experience, among other things. This case study is a good example of how both the corporation and the nonprofit used their resources for the greater good and offered advantages that made projects possible.

Forming a Strategic Relationship That Puts Competitiveness Aside

Some brands are longtime rivals, but when there’s sustainability at stake, they might put animosity on the back burner and realize they’re both working toward similar goals, and there might be a nonprofit that could help. So, mega-retailers Target and Walmart — along with 16 other merchants — got together to figure out how to bring more sustainable personal care products to store shelves.

This partnership happened with help from Forum for the Future, a British charity focused on Earth-friendly practices. The retailers knew they wanted to make gains in the quest to bring a wider selection of sustainable beauty items to consumers, but couldn’t do that without help.

Together, the participants discovered the lack of a shared vision for sustainable merchandise in the personal-care sector. Furthermore, they are developing criteria all retailers can use to determine whether a product is sustainable or not.

Besides this pioneering group project, Target and Walmart also came together publicly in Chicago, Ill. The brands were co-hosts of the 2014 Beauty and Personal Care Product Sustainability Summit. Forum for the Future used its connections to help organize the event and gave stakeholders an opportunity to officially discuss their current practices, as well as the challenges faced.

Whether for-profit organizations and charities team up for one-off events or ongoing efforts, these case studies clarify why these joined resources can provide so much momentum for sustainability goals. Alternatively, they can give companies the necessary knowledge to emphasize Earth-friendly practices from the ground up.

16,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/small-states-emphasize-finance-partnerships/,"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Small States Emphasize Finance, Partnerships","7 December 2017: Small States face a “triple trap” of climate impacts, high fossil fuel prices and high levels of indebtedness, according to discussions at the Small States Forum. Forum Chair Keith Mitchell, Prime Minister of Grenada, released the summary of the 2017 Forum.

The annual high-level event took place on 14 October 2017, in Washington, DC, US, during the World Bank-International Monetary Fund (IMF) annual meetings. The Forum gathered heads of government, ministers and central bank governors from small States, as well as representatives of the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Commonwealth Secretariat, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the IMF. The 2017 edition of the Forum marked the first time that private sector institutions participated at a large scale, including Swiss Re, World Economic Forum, Bitt.com and the World Ocean Council.

The four main issues raised during the 2017 Small States Forum, according to the summary, are: vulnerability; International Development Association (IDA18) implementation; de-risking; and partnerships. The summary also highlights the importance of mobilizing public and private sector financing for renewable energy, for green and blue economies, and for technology. Also, according to the summary, Forum Members welcomed the ‘Roadmap for World Bank Group Engagement with Small States,’ which was prepared by the World Bank in May 2017.

On vulnerability, participants underlined that small States’ susceptibility to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, frames the challenge of quickly mobilizing and disbursing considerable financial resources to countries that may not have easy access to concessional development finance. The World Bank can mobilize finance quickly in the aftermath of an emergency and provide additional resources for countries that otherwise would not be eligible for it, including by using the IDA Crisis Response Window and creative price buy-downs using trust fund resources. However, the Members noted, some vulnerable small States, such as Nauru and Palau, are unable to access either IDA or the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) resources, as they neither qualify for the IDA small States exception nor meet the credit standard for IBRD. They called on the World Bank to explore financing solutions for such vulnerable small States that “fall through the cracks.”

On the IDA18 implementation, participants welcomed the “massive increase” in IDA resources available for eligible small States (US$1.9 billion, which is more than double the previous allocation), noting that for some countries, the IDA allocation has quadrupled. The Forum observed that the challenge is to now find transformative projects that can absorb and make the most of these extra resources. The summary explains the need to focus efforts on preparation, front-loading and fast-tracking (available) development financing, and using innovative financial instruments and creating new partnerships to mobilize additional public and private sector resources.

On de-risking, the Forum noted that as financial institutions seek to “de-risk,” they are causing the withdrawal of correspondent banking relationships in small States. Prime Minister Gaston Browne of Antigua and Barbuda proposed the establishment of a working group to address the development challenges of de-risking for small States.

Participants agreed that the Small States Forum should become a platform for creative financial innovation and both traditional and nontraditional partnerships.

On partnerships, participants agreed that the Small States Forum should become a platform for creative financial innovation and both traditional and non-traditional partnerships. Development partners agreed to continue working together to improve opportunities for small States to access development finance that reduces their vulnerability to shocks.

Several private sector innovative mechanisms were also discussed, including: a new form of blockchain technology that builds direct financial connections to manage remittances and address the challenge of de-risking and loss of correspondent banking relations; private insurance that acts as a financial shock absorber, providing fiscal space during natural disasters; and technology to ensure the traceability of tuna so that small States can significantly increase their revenue.

We know it might be hard to believe, but there was a time when playing two up top was the norm.

Modern football is so concerned with ‘tactical flexibility’ and the rise of a number ten playing alongside a lone striker has all but killed off the days of the duo.

Look around Europe and you’ll see trios, false nines and trequartistas, but truly great strike partnerships are at a premium. So let’s reminisce about a simpler time.

1 Ian Rush & Kenny Dalglish (Liverpool)

Often talked about as the best duo ever to strut their stuff in British football, and it’s not hard to see why. Dalglish brought guile, wit and touch while Rush’s fearsome pace and finishing ability were responsible for a mountain of goals in the ’80s.

2 Romario & Hristo Stoichkov (Barcelona)

He came, he saw, he conquered. Romario only spent two years in Barcelona, but his first was a whirlwind of unforgettable football. As with Dalglish and Rush, Stoichkov played in the pocket, netting 16 often eye-catching goals, while the explosive Romario top scored with 30 La Liga goals during the 1993/94 season.

3 Alan Shearer & Chris Sutton (Blackburn)

So good they had a natty nickname. SAS fired Blackburn to a first league title since 1914 during the 1994/95 season, scoring a combined 49 goals, although they never managed to replicate their form at international level.

4 Filippo Inzaghi & Alessandro Del Piero (Juventus)

Inzaghi and Del Piero being fed by Zinedine Zidane. It’s the stuff dreams are made of. Juve won the league and reached the final of the 1997/98 Champions League backed by 39 goals from the two Italians.

5 Marcelo Salas & Christian Vieri (Lazio)

The mercurial Salas and cricket loving Vieri only played together for one season but 1998/99 was a campaign to remember, with both netting 15 goals as Lazio finished 2nd, an agonising point behind Milan.

6 Andy Cole & Dwight Yorke (Man United)

What would this list be without goal king Cole and his best mate Yorke? As good a friends on the pitch as they were off it. Ironically the most iconic moment of the 1998/99 season, the Champions League win, happened with both off the field.

7 Vincenzo Montella & Marco Delvecchio (Roma)

Montella and Delvecchio, the Italian version of little ‘n’ large, struck gold during the 1999/2000 season scoring 19 and 11 goals respectively. However Roma, under the tutelage of Fabio Capello, could only finish 6th in Serie A.

8 Niall Quinn & Kevin Phillips (Sunderland)

Not all superheroes wear the replica shirts of European giants. Quinn and Phillips plundered 34 goals for humble Sunderland during the 1999/2000 season, with the latter winning the European Golden Shoe.

9 Andriy Shevchenko & Oliver Bierhoff (AC Milan)

It’s rare that you get a striker who can do everything. It’s even rarer that you get two of them playing for the same team. Sheva and Bierhoff were a threat from anywhere on the pitch during Milan’s 1999/00 campaign, scoring 35 goals between them.

10 Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink & Eidur Gudjohnsen (Chelsea)

Hasselbaink and Gudjohnsen, new arrivals from Atletico Madrid and Bolton respectively, gelled together straight away. Jimmy’s rocket powered left foot combined with Gudjohnsen’s subtle touch combined for 39 goals and helped the Dutchman win the 2000/01 Premier League Golden Boot.

11 Thierry Henry & Dennis Bergkamp (Arsenal)

If you could build an ideal strike force it look something like Henry and Bergkamp. The latter could put a ball anywhere he wanted with a waft of his magical right foot, while Henry’s sheer pace, control and athleticism was a defender’s nightmare.

12 Diego Tristan and Roy Makaay (Deportivo La Coruna)

The season after Depor shocked Spain by winning La Liga, Tristan and Makaay lined up together, scoring 37 goals as the club narrowly missed out on consecutive league titles.

13 Chris Sutton & Henrik Larsson (Celtic)

Larsson smashed 35 goals in just 37 games during the 2000/01 season, winning the Golden Boot, helped out by Sutton’s aerial ability. Those were the day, eh, Celtic fans.

14 David Trezeguet & Alessandro Del Piero (Juventus)

Another combination that worked off two very differing styles. But Trezeguet, who was joint top scorer in the 2001/02 Serie A season with 24 goals, was a lot more than just muscle, keeping a certain Marcelo Salas on the bench.

15 Ronaldo & Raul (Real Madrid)

Madrid won a treble of sorts in the 2002/03 season, picking up La Liga, the Inercontinental Cup and the Super Cup, with home grown Raul and €45million Brazilian Ronaldo combining for 39 league goals.

16 Hulk & Radamel Falcao (Porto)

Falcao’s inclusion might confuse some poorly informed Premier League fans. In 2011 he was near the peak of his powers alongside the powerful Hulk. The duo scored a mind boggling 74 goals in all competitions as Porto won a quadruple.

17 Alexis Sanchez & Antonio Di Natale (Udinese)

Di Natale has been at Udinese for 12 seasons, and a professional footballer for 20 years and counting, so when he names Sanchez as the best strike partner he’s ever had it’s a glowing endorsement. The pair helped Udinese to fourth place in Serie A, qualifying for the Champions League with a combined 40 goals.

And with good reason. In many ways, the sustainability movement exists today in response to the lack of collaboration in the past, especially on the part of businesses. Blindly following the credo (often attributed to Milton Friedman) that ""the business of business is business"" did immeasurable damage to whatever lay outside a company's immediate scope of concern.

This gave rise to the multiplicity of NGOs who stood up to defend and give voice to those under-represented elements, be they environmental, social or other. These have suffered as a result of what Kevin Rabinovitch, global VP of sustainability at Mars, referred to at GreenBiz 18 last week as ""failures of collective governance.""

We've seen all too clearly in the political sphere how tapping into frustration and identifying a common enemy effectively can build support for an individual or an organization. But any organization that draws it strength from anger will resist sitting down with an adversary to solve the complex problems behind the conflict.

Lowering voices

Politicians would do well to follow the example of so many businesses and NGOs at GreenBiz 18 in Phoenix, who have learned to move beyond this stalemate and sit down, roll up their sleeves and work together to address their issues.

Find what you agree on. Align where you can. Keith Kenny, vice president of sustainability at McDonald's, along with Tom Murray, vice president of EDF+Business, extolled the importance of customer demand for sustainability. Murray called this work with companies ""the third wave of the environmental movement.""

""Lower your voices,"" Kenny said. ""Find what you agree on. Align where you can.""

McDonald's announced its commitment to begin recycling ""guest packaging."" It has worked together with EDF for 25 years on this and other goals. Their partnership has brought and continues to bring McDonald's operations slowly around towards a circular economy model through reduction, reuse, recycling and composting. Together McDonald's and EDF have eliminated more than 300 million pounds of packaging and reduced restaurant waste by 30 percent, while saving the company some $6 million per year.

Another example of collaboration among participants at GreenBiz 18 is the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) working with Kroger to eliminate food waste or with Walmart in support of Project Gigaton, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions throughout the supply chain by 1 billion tons by 2030.

These are great examples of stakeholders from opposing positions coming together to confront a broad issue.

Pooling efforts

But other, equally important types of collaborations play a role. Some problems are too big for an individual company to tackle. This is where a group of companies within an industry or sector get together to pool their effort.

A good of example is in the renewable energy area, where many companies are committing to switching sources but require the cooperation of a complex utility industry in upheaval and need a clear signal. That's where groups such as Renewable Energy Buyers Association (REBA), the Climate Group's RE100 (part of the We Mean Business coalition) and the Rocky Mountain Institute's Business Renewables Center (BRC) take advantage of the considerable collective buying power of major companies to influence utilities on policies and pricing to make renewable purchasing more attractive and accessible. RE100 has 125 companies that have committed to 100-percent renewable power by 2020. BRC has set a target of 60GW by 2030, a goal shared with REBA.

Companies are joining forces to drive the penetration of renewables, making their case to regulators and legislators and by creating a market with their demand. Marty Spitzer, senior director, climate and renewable energy, World Wildlife Fund, spoke on a panel called ""Accessing Renewables for All Corporates: Going Beyond Your First PPA.""

""The change in the utility market happened because companies asked for it,"" he said.

There is tremendous power in setting a goal as an industry. According to Max Scher, sustainability manager at Salesforce, while tech giants such as Apple, Amazon and Google are the drivers with their massive server farm power purchases, smaller companies such as Salesforce benefit from the ease of access to renewables, both directly and through their suppliers.

Working on the ground

Ground is also being broken in operational collaboration. For example, GM has been working with utilities through the Clean Power Council to forge a path forward for electric vehicles. Besides simply buying power and providing specifications for charging stations, GM is providing utilities intimate access to every vehicle through its ONSTAR app, allowing them to interact with their electrical system when cars are connected to the grid through a charger. This bidirectional interaction, according to Britta Gross, GM's director of Advanced Vehicle Commercialization Strategy, essentially says, ""Do whatever you want with my car battery, as long as you have it charged up by 6 a.m."" This allows the utilities to potentially leverage thousands of batteries to help meet peak shaving or other short-term requirements.

Another form of collaboration comes in the form of mentoring. Companies that are sustainability veterans, such as Novozymes, help guide clients and suppliers along a more sustainable path. Others, such as Mars, Interface and JPMorgan, play similar roles. GM also has been mentoring others in the industry about how to achieve landfill-free factories, something it have been very successful with. Disney hopes to make its new sustainable packaging solution open-source to allow others to use and improve.

Collaborating with customers — by listening and co-creating both products and community initiatives, reflecting societal concerns — is yet another form of collaboration in what Suzanne Shelton of the Shelton Group called ""consumers and companies working together to forge the future.""

Going 'far and fast'

Next, a lot a good work is being done under the pre-competitive banner, which covers everything from basic research to setting industry standards. A saying goes, ""If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."" But what, asked Bryan Sheehan, U.S. director of Quantis, leading a session on pre-competitive consortiums, ""if you need to go far and fast?""

It works when there is a material relationship, and where core values and goals are shared. Sheehan maintains that you need to go together, citing the example of a group of racers breaking away from the pack in the Tour de France. In industry, Intel did this along with HP, Dell and other IT companies, to jointly develop a tool called PAIA (PDF) that quickly measures greenhouse gas emissions. There is tremendous power in setting a goal as an industry, said Fawn Berger, global program manager of Water Stewardship and Carbon Footprint at Intel.

Similarly, Mars worked with some of its competitors to develop a methodology for collecting data and computing impacts of agricultural suppliers high up in their value chain.

First, said Rabinovitch, ""we were never going to spend enough money on this to actually do a really good job figuring this out on our own."" Second, ""there's absolutely no reason for the way you calculate that to be proprietary."" So Mars joined forces with other leading food companies including Coca-Cola, Unilever and General Mills to develop the World Food Lifecycle Database, which, he said, probably wouldn't have happened at all without the collaboration.

The list could go on for a very long time. Andy Butler, associate director of supplier diversity, sustainability and innovation at P&G, and Tom Cleves, VP of global citizenship at International Paper, took the stage. An ""uncommon collaboration"" resulted in the formation of the Carolinas Working Forest Conservation Collaborative to increase the prevalence of sustainable forestry management practices. The secret? ""Willingness to be transparent,"" said Butler, also naming having the right agreements, the right people in the room and a level of trust.

To this Cleves added, ""It works when there is a material relationship, and where core values and goals are shared.""

Indeed, collaboration and sustainability are so intertwined, it's enough to make you wonder: If we humans could truly learn to work together in open collaboration, perhaps we might survive our own cleverness.","Collaboration runs through the sustainability movement like a sinew that not only holds it together, but also gives it its strength.

19,https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-02-07-what-every-city-can-learn-from-pittsburgh-s-pioneering-k-12-research-partnerships,"Wed, 07 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",EdSurge,What Every City Can Learn From Pittsburgh’s Pioneering K-12-Research Partnerships,"The greater Pittsburgh Region is bustling with innovation and houses big-name companies, such as Google, Uber, UPMC and PNC. It is no secret why Pittsburgh attracts such a variety of industry titans: Education. The region is home to world-class university research centers, the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University, which help cultivate a spirit of innovation.

Less well known outside of Pittsburgh is that many K-12 school districts in the region, including members of Digital Promise’s League of Innovative Schools (such as Avonworth, Baldwin-Whitehall, Elizabeth Forward, Fox Chapel, Montour and South Fayette) and districts active within the Remake Learning Network, place a heavy emphasis on partnerships between researchers and K-12 practitioners, yielding big gains for both districts and universities.

Take the South Fayette School District for example. There, administrators recently partnered with Carnegie Mellon to pioneer the development and pilot testing of the nation’s first coherent K-12 curriculum on computational thinking. Montour School District and Carnegie Mellon created research consortium with three other area districts called the LearnLab. The LearnLab brings together K-12 classroom teachers and university researchers for research collaborations, introducing evidence-based education technologies into the classroom.

Montour’s first-grade teachers are also working with a team of researchers from St. Vincent College's Fred Rogers Center for Early Learning and Children’s Media to study interactions between teachers and students through the use of technology.

Recently, a multi-disciplinary team from the University of Pittsburgh was awarded $300,000 from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to diversify access to urban universities for students in STEM fields. This two-year researcher-practitioner partnership aims to increase participation of underrepresented minority students in postsecondary STEM programs.

These researcher-practitioner partnerships do not happen by accident; nor are they sustained by luck. For each of these examples of successful researcher-practitioner collaborations, there are likely ten examples that did not work out very well. Why? Certainly not for lack of good intentions. The reality is that practitioners and researchers operate in very different worlds, often with different timelines, incentive structures, and lenses for looking at education and learning.

7 Keys to Building Researcher-Practitioner Partnerships

Although the greater Pittsburgh Region is unique because of its locally controlled school districts and excellent universities, the ingredients for successful researcher-practitioner partnerships can be found almost anywhere. Below, we cull several key principles for establishing and maintaining productive, mutually beneficial researcher-practitioner partnerships:

1. Identify joint work: Researchers and practitioners can and should have goals that are different. The trick in developing a successful partnership is to identify the space in which joint work contributes to the goals of both researchers and practitioners in meaningful ways.

2. Ensure there is a boundary spanner: The worlds of research and practice are very different on dimensions such as the pace of the work, the driving goals (producing knowledge versus serving students), the kinds of work prized by their respective institutions, norms for discourse and methodologies employed. A researcher-practitioner partnership can die an early death if differences are not adequately identified and negotiated. Some practitioners and researchers are able to span these differences based on their past experience in one another’s context but some are not. Look for partners with the capacity to serve this boundary spanning role for each endeavor.

3. Negotiate structural and cultural differences: It is important to identify and design for the differences that exist between researchers and practitioners in terms of work styles, incentive structures, motivating goals and communication routines. In addition, there is often an unstated perception that the university-based researchers are the “experts” and this can create a perceived power differential in the interactions between researchers and K-12 practitioners. Expertise in all forms (including, and especially, practice-based expertise) must be valued and validated within all interactions.

4. Identify project champions: For each partnership, there should be a champion within each organization who will drive momentum, liaise with key stakeholders within their organizations and persist in driving for the vision when challenges arise.

5. Align work with core values: Every successful organization has identified core values that focus effort and resource allocation. Make sure that each organization’s values align with the goals of the partnership. Critical to this is ensuring that the shared goal of improving conditions for children is represented in the work.

6. Obtain foundation support: Pittsburgh is fortunate to have a generous philanthropic community including the Grable Foundation, Heinz Endowments, Benedum Foundation and many others. A strong foundation partner will not only financially support the partnership, which is critical for launching the work and developing models for sustainability, but may also help set goals and measurable outcomes and help create a broader ecosystem in which the work can be nurtured.

7. Be flexible: It is often said that a successful marriage depends on give and take and trust. This also applies to researcher-practitioner partnerships. There will be hard times in the partnership; remember to address challenges directly, be flexible and trust each other.

Finally, take a play out of Pittsburgh’s Remake Learning Playbook. Created by the Sprout Fundthrough an open source digital platform and hardcopy book, the Playbook serves as a how-to-guide for replicating successful innovations including network support strategies and taking advantage of connected learning ppportunities with the goal of remaking learning in your city.","The LearnLab brings together K-12 classroom teachers and university researchers for research collaborations, introducing evidence-based education technologies into the classroom.

Rather than trying to shout above the noise, brands are realizing that they can partner with media outlets, social influencers and even other brands to amplify their voice and reach an even wider audience.

The tricky part, of course, is striking the right balance of promoting your brand and providing relevant, useful and genuine content that resonates with both parties' audiences. Going too far in either direction means consumers will either be turned off by the sales pitch or miss the point entirely.

Members of the Forbes Agency Council are well-versed in launching successful brand partnerships. Here is some of their best advice for navigating this popular marketing strategy.

1. Be Thought-Provoking

Advertising in the form of creative branded content is more engaging, memorable and thought-provoking than traditional display ads. In fact, studies show that more than 50% of Gen Z, millennials and Gen Xers enjoy custom content, and feel like brands put more effort into it. So, as long as topics fall in line with readers' interests, brand partnerships are a win-win. - Kelly Ann Collins, Collins & Company

2. Focus On Giving Great Advice

The best content marketing offers great advice to address goals, opportunities and challenges of prospective ideal clients. People don't care what brand name or logo is on the advice. They care about the quality of the advice. Great advice builds trust for whoever is associated with it. Focus less on branding and more on quality of counsel and trust will never be an issue. - Randy Shattuck, The Shattuck Group

3. Educate The Audience

If your brand takes on the role as an educator, people will come to you for advice. They will read your content, attend your speaking opportunities and seek you out when they have questions that need to be answered. They will not care if it is branded if it helps them. - Lisa Allocca, Red Javelin Communications

4. Be Able To Articulate The Audience Benefits

The big question to ask in any brand partnership is: How does it benefit my audience? Whether you’re providing education or an exclusive discount, the content needs to give value to the audience. As long as they get something out of it, it's a mutually beneficial situation. Besides, 71% of consumers are more likely to make a purchase based on a social media reference. - Solomon Thimothy, OneIMS

5. Stay Authentic

People want to engage with meaningful content, so as long as you approach branded content with authenticity and substance then you'll establish trust. We see this with influencer marketing all the time. Be transparent about your relationship with influencers and give them the keys to tell your brand's story versus trying to script everything. - Ashley Walters, Empower MediaMarketing

6. Produce Valuable Content For Humans

Branded content is all about value to the user. If you create great content worthy of reading, sharing and engaging with, users are not offended if it's put out by a brand — especially if the brand would also love for you to engage with them. It is all about quality of the content and experience. - Michael Mothner, Wpromote

7. Be Transparent, Meaningful And Trustworthy

Three principles that apply to both online dating and online content: First, be transparent. Second, be meaningful. Find the attributes you are both most passionate about and build from there, not from preconceived assumptions. Finally, be trustworthy. Don't use people's engagement to spam them or misuse their confidence. As long as there is a real value exchange, people will embrace you. - Benny Thomas, Barrie D'Rozario D'Lorenzo

8. Be Upfront About Your Connection

Be transparent about the partnership, and be genuine. Not only do overly pushy co-branded promotions seldom work, but they damage trust with the audience, which is tough to rebuild. Brand partnerships work best when there’s a clear reason why the two brands work together and the project feels more like a collaboration than a negotiation. - Jessica Gonzalez, InCharged

9. Look Into The Influencer's Most Popular Content Types

You should ask an influencer, ""What type of content makes your audience engage the most?"" to find out how good of a fit they will be for your brand. Influencers understand their audience and they will know what content receives the most comments, shares and overall engagement. If their most buzzworthy content is in alignment with what your company is doing, you know you have the right match. - Peter Boyd, PaperStreet Web Design

10. Be Clear With Potential Partners About Your Standards

It’s important to choose partners based on shared values, but it’s even more important that your audience knows what those shared values are. Make sure they’re front and center, and refer to them often, especially when sharing sponsored content. Reminding your audience that you’ve done the work of filtering brands that meet high standards will go a long way. - Sarah Mannone, Trekk

11. Make Sure Your End Goals Align

We like to ensure our partnerships are not purely for revenue gains but to build a memorable experience for our target audience that can translate into a long-term relationship. We partner with multiple SEO tools to craft custom content for our audience. We don't just offer a sales pitch, we offer an opportunity for our partners to engage with a niche industry of brand loyalists. - Loren Baker, Foundation Digital

12. Don't Force It

If you wouldn’t write about it for free, then it’s probably not a good fit for your audience. Examine your buyer personas to effectively market like-minded products/services to like-minded consumers. Avoid wasting time and resources trying to force the success of a partnership if the brand identities do not naturally align. - Benjamin Collins, Laughing Samurai","Members of the Forbes Agency Council are well-versed in launching successful brand partnerships.

Rainforest Trust’s new premier business sponsorship program allows corporations of all sizes to participate in the organization’s mission to purchase and protect threatened tropical habitats to save endangered wildlife through local partnerships and community engagement.

But protecting the rainforest has many other benefits as well. By supporting Rainforest Trust’s efforts to halt the deforestation of tropical forests, corporate partners help significantly reduce carbon emissions responsible for global climate change. Currently, deforestation accounts for up to 15 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions each year, which is nearly equivalent to the annual emissions from the world’s transportation sector. In addition, protecting rainforests supports local communities by providing fresh water and food, as well as other ecosystem services.

The Conservation Circle program offers corporations four levels of sponsorship: Patron, Director, President and Chairman. This provides organizations the opportunity to customize their sponsorship based on their business goals. All sponsorship levels give companies high brand visibility across multiple marketing vehicles, including social media promotion and the use of a Rainforest Trust media kit.

“The Conservation Circle is a great opportunity for corporations to make a real difference globally by helping us to save species, care for communities and protect our planet,” said Rainforest Trust CEO Dr. Paul Salaman.

“Our corporate partners, like Endangered Species Chocolate, play a key role in raising awareness about our mission and supporting our conservation programs across the planet.”

Endangered Species Chocolate became a supporter of Rainforest Trust in 2016, but formalized their participation in the Conservation Circle this year at the Chairman Circle level.

“Rainforests are integral to the survival of thousands of endangered species, and we are proud to support Rainforest Trust’s land conservation and sustainability efforts. While Endangered Species Chocolate works toward our goal of giving back $1 million to our partners annually, we’re proud to support organizations pursuing vital missions, including Rainforest Trust,” said Curt Vander Meer, CEO of Endangered Species Chocolate.","Rainforest Trust recently announced the launch of its new corporate partnership program, the Conservation Circle.

As director of the Partnerships, Engagement and Technology Department for the Idaho National Laboratory, she essentially runs everything that’s outward-facing – that is, dealing with the public – at the Idaho Falls nuclear energy facility.

Lientz manages a staff of 100, plus 350 interns, including 50 joint appointments who are shared and considered employees of INL as well as the university. That staff manages “everything you would think of that’s external,” she says, such as government affairs, education programs ranging from K-12 to universities, emergency communications, public affairs, technology deployment, and commercial deployment for the $1 billion, 4,200-employee operation.

INL is managed by Battelle Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that also manages several other national laboratories. “Its not-for-profit status means that when they make money, they roll it back as an investment,” Lientz explains. Logically, the investment Battelle picked for Idaho was science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) instruction, with an annual contribution of around $600,000. For her part, Lientz administers all the grant dollars.

Lientz was also instrumental in the creation of the STEM Action Center, which helps improve Idaho STEM education. “We’re partnered very intimately with them,” she says. “We’re aligned with their goals. We’re not conflicting in any way – we’re all walking down the same path.”

To help Idaho Falls residents understand their powerful neighbor, Lientz also helped come up with the Intermountain Energy Summit with the Idaho Falls Post Register. “It’s a collaboration with the local newspaper, which wanted to get more understanding from the general public and region about energy issues that cross borders,” she explains. Now an annual event, she uses her own personal network, as well as the lab’s network, to help bring attention to eastern Idaho about the role that the region plays in energy.

In previous positions, such as at CH2M Hill, Lientz worked in siting energy facilities of all kinds. Environmental assessment work is required before you site any energy facility, whether it’s a wind farm or a nuclear plan, she explains – which provided a great launch point for her current position. “As program manager of managing these major projects, you have to do a lot of other things,” such as government affairs, policy, industry relations, and working with academia. “It’s a really good match for what I’m doing now.”

When Lientz isn’t working, she enjoys taking advantage of the recreation that Idaho Falls offers, including rowing, rafting (she has her own cataraft), fly fishing, skiing, and golfing. “My dad ran fish hatcheries, so I was always exposed to the outdoors,” she explains.

She also serves as a board member for a wide variety of professional and regional

civic and nonprofit organizations, ranging from the Idaho Council of Industry and the Environment to the Idaho Falls symphony. Roger Plothow, Post Register editor and publisher recommended her highly for this award.

“She’s tireless in her support of charitable and cultural programs essential to maintaining the quality of life Idahoans cherish.”","As director of the Partnerships, Engagement and Technology Department for the Idaho National Laboratory, she essentially runs everything that’s outward-facing – that is, dealing with the public – at the Idaho Falls nuclear energy facility.

James also addressed his status as one of three finalists vying to be the new superintendent and CEO of Columbus City Schools. James has worked in the Akron schools for 26 years, 10 as superintendent. He said his decision to apply for the Columbus job was not a response to dissatisfaction with his position in Akron.

""This is about the opportunity to be challenged in a unique way, so I can grow and further develop my skills,"" he said. ""I love this community.""

The board plans to conduct a second round of interviews with each of the three candidates, followed by a series of public events aimed at giving students and staff a chance to meet them. No schedule has been set for the interviews, public meetings or a final announcement of who will lead the Columbus schools, said Columbus City Schools spokesman Scott Varner.

The theme of the James' address was ""Connecting the Community to the Classroom."" James acknowledged the many partnerships and collaborations underway through nonprofit, business, philanthropic, faith-based and government organizations, all aimed at strengthening education for Akron students.

Financially the district is currently solid, and declining enrollment has stabilized, he said.

""On average, additional revenue is needed every six years,"" he said. ""We are heading into our eighth year, and we have been able to actively manage our budget deficits and continue to push off the next levy request.""

James also addressed the issue of discipline in the schools in response to concerns by the teachers union over disciplining students who commit assault.



On Monday, hundreds of people protested at the Akron Board of Education meeting. James acknowledged he has not always seen eye to eye with the Akron Education Association.



Akron Public Schools rank eighth highest in the state in disciplining students, he said, and 114 students out of 21,000, or .054 percent, have been referred to the board of education for assaults this year.



""I know it can easy for some to criticize everything we do, but as superintendent, I must look at the big picture,"" James said. ""Yes, I acknowledge that some of our students have behavior problems, just as all school districts do. However we have increasingly provided more educational options that provide the supports that students need to learn how to change their behavior.""

Here are examples of partnerships from today's address:

United Way of Summit County Bold Goals by 2025

Akron Public Schools students are the focus of two of United Way's four Bold Goals. A plan was launched in August to work with partners such as Summit Education Initiative to have 65 percent of third-graders reading at or above grade level, and 90 percent high schoolers graduating in four years, with 60 percent college/career ready.

College & career academies

Akron has joined 30 other communities across the United States in transforming their high schools into college & career academies. Two academies, Health & Human Services and Global Business and Technology, rolled out last fall at North High School under a partnership with Akron Children's Hospital. A future academy at the merged Kenmore-Garfield Community Learning Center will offer a state-of-the-art manufacturing program and culinary arts, with more to follow.

Kent State University

A partnership with Kent State is expected to be announced soon that will create career pathways with such programs as visual and performing arts, interior design, fashion, film, visual design and architecture.

Stark State College Akron

Stark State created the Learn to Earn Program in which students can earn college credits while working toward their high school diplomas. They can apply the college credits to a Stark State certificate or associate degree to further your career.

The University of Akron

Akron Early College High School on the University of Akron campus offers high-schoolers the ability to earn their diploma and an associate's degree. The Innovation Generation Scholarship, in partnership with the university, helps students pay their tuition.

I-Promise School

Created through a partnership with Akron Public Schools, the LeBron James Family Foundation's I Promise School will open in the fall this year at 400 W. Market St. The school is for 3rd and 4th grade students who are at-risk in reading and need academic intervention and social/emotional support.

The superintendent closed with a call for continuing community support.

""Student success is accelerated when we connect the community to the classroom,"" he said. ""Our students need everyone in this room to rally behind their academic and social emotional development. I ask you to be ready to say 'yes' when we call to explore ways for you to support our children and families.""

The programs in which these bright young people are enrolled are different, but the purpose is the same: to enable them to earn college credits while in high school and to begin focusing on their future careers.

Pryor, 16, is enrolled in Early College High School at Midland College. The application and admission process for ECHS@MC is rigorous. Once students are enrolled, they have little time for extracurricular activities as they participate in an accelerated high school curriculum and also take college courses at MC. Most ECHS@MC students complete an associate degree by the time they earn a high school diploma. Thanks to funding from various Midland companies and philanthropic foundations such as Abell-Hanger and Scharbauer, ECHS@MC students do not have to pay for college tuition or books.

“We have a lot of homework, and the teachers really push us,” Pryor said. “However, it’s worth it. I’m getting an associate degree and the first two years of college absolutely free.”

Pryor said she first started hearing about ECHS@MC when she was at Abell Junior High School. She began to think about her future when she was in sixth grade. Then when she was in the eighth grade, she and her mother heard more about the opportunities provided by ECHS@MC, and Pryor decided to apply.

“It was a tough decision because it meant that I wouldn’t be with my friends whom I had known since kindergarten,” she said. “Now looking back, I’m glad I made the decision. ECHS has really helped me find myself and made me focus on my future. I’d like to eventually be an orthodontist. I know this will take many years of college, but I’ll already have two years completed by the time I finish high school. My first choice for undergraduate school after completing Midland College is TCU, but it’s expensive, and I’ll have to get a lot of scholarship funding to be able to go there. My second choice is Texas Tech.”

Rodriguez, 17, also wants to attend Texas Tech. He is ranked fourth in his class at Midland High School and is enrolled in the MC/MISD Health Sciences Career Academy, where he takes Principles of Health Science and Medical Terminology at the MC Advanced Technology Center. During his senior year, he will continue with Health Sciences Career Academy classes, and will be eligible to take the certified nurse aide exam.

“My plan is to attend Texas Tech and major in pre-med,” Rodriguez said. “Then, I’d also like to go to medical school at Texas Tech. I’ve known I’ve wanted to be a physician ever since I was 8 years old when my mom passed away due to medical malpractice.”

In addition to the Health Sciences Career Academy, Rodriguez, who has never gotten a grade below an “A” since he was in the sixth grade, is also enrolled in dual-credit courses at MHS. He is receiving both high school and college credit for pre-calculus, U.S. history and English. When he graduates from high school next May, he will be classified as a college sophomore.

Rodriguez is passionate about focusing on his future. In previous years, he played football, but dropped the sport so that he could concentrate on academics. In order to balance the long hours of study, he enjoys playing video games and is teaching himself German. About a year before his mother passed away, he moved in with his aunt and uncle, Bennie and David Ross, and continues to live with them.

Like Rodriguez, Pryor also has ways to relax from long hours of studying. She enjoys singing, dancing and vegetarian cooking. She sings in the choir at Hollowell United Methodist Church, where her great-uncle Wendell Smith is pastor. She lives with her mother, Tequilla Culberson, and older sister, Jasmine Pryor.

Both students said that the programs in which they are participating are doing more than just enabling them to earn college credits while still in high school.

“The teachers challenge me to always keep striving to do more,” Pryor said. “The Midland College teachers who teach college courses don’t treat me like a high school student. They expect me to do the same work that any other college student would do. When I leave Midland and transfer to a university, I’ll already know how to study and know what to expect in a college course. “

Rodriguez agreed and added, “The classes I’m taking through the Health Sciences Career Academy are helping me to gain a basic understanding of the medical field. I’m learning how to care for other people, and by the time I graduate, I’ll have a health certification and an employable skill in case I need to earn extra money while I’m in college.”

It will be several years before Pryor and Rodriguez are able to realize their career goals of becoming specialists in the medical field; however, thanks to programs such as Early College High School at Midland College, the MC/MISD Career Academies and dual-credit courses, both of these young people are able to focus on and strive for a dream that is well within the realm of possibilities.

bundesliga.com picks out the best superhero-sidekick combos of recent years...

1. Robbery (Bayern)

A wing partnership that is so good it even has its own nickname, the quite brilliant understanding between Ribery and Robben - aka Robbery - has defined one of the most successful eras in Bayern history. Both are the archetypal inverted wingers: Ribery, a right-footer who has spent the last decade dazzling on the Bayern left; and Robben, whose signature angled run and curled left-footed finish remains as feared by opposition defenders today as it was when he started out in football 18 years ago. They have shared countless highs - six Bundesliga titles and the redemptive 2012/13 UEFA Champions League final triumph over Borussia Dortmund in which Ribery set up Robben for the winner - and their fair share of lows - various injury setbacks and the Finale Dahoam Champions League final defeat to Chelsea in 2012. Yet here they are - 34 years young, conceivably as good as they ever were. If and when they do leave - both are out of contract in the summer - it would be fitting that they do so in tandem, their place in Bayern legend sealed for eternity.

2. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang & Henrikh Mkhitaryan (Borussia Dortmund)

A close personal friendship is also at the heart of the duo who were the main catalysts behind Borussia Dortmund's stunning 2015/16 season. Though they finished runners-up to Bayern in the league, Thomas Tuchel's men were the Bundesliga's top scorers, plundering a massive 82 goals that term. Aubameyang struck 25 with his Armenia international cohort hitting 11 and laying on a further 20. ""They are players who have played together, who know each other well and have had a successful period together,"" said the Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, who reunited 'Auba' and 'Miki' at the Emirates Stadium last month hoping for some Dortmund deja vu. ""We are an offensive team and that's why I hope they can recreate that perfect understanding they had at Dortmund.""

3. Timo Werner & Emil Forsberg (RB Leipzig)

RB Leipzig's debut Bundesliga season could hardly have gone better, and the 2016/17 runners-up owe a great debt for that to these two. Seven of Forsberg's league-high 19 laser-guided final balls provided Werner with the opportunity to score; the former Stuttgart striker eventually tallied 21 goals in his breakthrough season to finish as the division's leading German scorer and earn a call up from Joachim Löw. Werner set up four of Forsberg's eight league strikes last term, and while injury for the Sweden international has hindered their 2017/18 so far, they have a bright future.

""He will never shoot when he sees a man in a better position. I like those players, the sort who always think of the team. He is an outstanding player and therefore I hope that he will stay,"" Dost said of De Bruyne in summer 2015 with the Belgian wizard on the verge of joining Manchester City. It is hardly surprising the Dutch forward wanted De Bruyne to remain at Wolfsburg after the season they had just enjoyed together. Dost scored 16 times, five of which were teed up by De Bruyne, who broke the Bundesliga record with an astonishing 22 assists. Oh, and he scored ten goals himself too, playing the central role in Wolfsburg's runners-up finish in the league and DFB Cup final triumph… guess who became the fifth foreigner to be named Germany's Player of the Year that year?

Pranks and end product in equally massive amounts sums up the bond built between the two Bayern stars. Ribery befriended Alaba when the Austrian star — nine years his junior — was just 16 at Bayern's youth academy, and the pair's off-the-pitch rapport has translated into one of the Bundesliga's most potent partnerships on it. Indeed, their ability to read the other's game has been priceless in giving Bayern the sharpest of cutting edges down the left. ""I prefer playing with him, and he is glad when I am on the pitch as well. There is an understanding between us,"" said Ribery, who has featured in 103 Bundesliga games with his left-flank partner as the duo have played a fundamental role in five successive title wins.","Though they finished runners-up to Bayern in the league, Thomas Tuchel's men were the Bundesliga's top scorers, plundering a massive 82 goals that term.

(Photo by Michael Regan/Getty Images)

In football, strong, deep-rooted and innately understood partnerships make for prosperity. It has happened throughout history. And now Arsenal, in Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, have a great one.

If you were to peruse the footballing history books, trickle through the titles and the tribulations, the greats and the grotesque, you would find a similar pattern running through almost all of the landscape-changing teams: Partnerships.

The age-old ‘big-man-little-man’ striker pairing. The overlapping full-back marauding past a drifting, inside-cutting winger. The two centre-halves: one is a dominating ball-winner; the other is the calm, composed ball-player. Throughout footballing history, partnerships have made for prosperity.

And now, Arsenal, in Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, have two players who share that innate, seemingly telepathic understanding that all these great duos also possessed. Aubameyang even, in an interview with the Arsenal Weekly Podcast, revealed that he called Mkhitaryan before he decided to make the North London switch, admitting that the Armenian’s presence at the Emirates was a factor in convincing him to sign:

“It’s like [being reunited with] a brother, a good friend We played together in the past and I’m really happy to see him again. He called me a few times, he asked, ‘Will you come or not?’ I said, ‘First you have to tell me if you sign or not’. He told me all was done and of course, it was a big factor in coming here. We understand each other on and off the pitch, that’s why it’s easier on the pitch [The fans] have to be happy [to see us together], we will do our best of course, like we did in the past.”

Certainly, on the pitch, it was clear at Borussia Dortmund that the two enjoyed a special and unique connection that few other players could share. And again, it was present on Saturday in the 5-1 dismantling against Everton.

It took Arsenal just six minutes to break the deadlock. While it was Aaron Ramsey who scored that goal, it was a flicked, around-the-corner, first-time pass from Aubameyang, perfectly into the path of Mkhitaryan that instigated the sweeping, cutting move.

Similarly, for the fourth goal, it was Mkhitaryan who slipped into a pocket of space in between the Everton midfield and defence. As soon as he received the ball on the half-turn and looked to drive at the defence, Aubameyang was calculating the direction and timing of his run. Naturally, as soon as he made his dart off the shoulder of Michael Keane, Mkhitaryan found him with a beautifully slid through pass.

This is a partnership that Arsenal will have to rely upon for the remainder of this season and for seasons to come. While they have a long way to go to match some of the pantheonic partnerships of years gone by, it is still encouraging and exciting to see such two great players in the same team.","LONDON, ENGLAND - FEBRUARY 03: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang of Arsenal celebrates after scoring his sides fourth goal during the Premier League match between Arsenal and Everton at Emirates Stadium on February 3, 2018 in London, England.

Sometimes breaking up is so hard to do…..

It’s Valentine’s Day! But let’s not be to fast to celebrate. The day of love has fallen on a Champions League night this year. A romantic meal for two at a swanky restaurant or Real Madrid vs Paris Saint-Germain at the pub with your mates?

A decision that could make or break your relationship – with football. Who in their right mind misses Madrid vs PSG? Let’s face it, breaking up is never easy to do.

To celebrate Valentine’s Day (and football), TEAMtalk have teamed up with daily fantasy football game Oulala.com to reveal how many of last season’s most successful relationships in

the Premier League are still going strong and how many have suffered break-ups over the past 12 months.

The Tottenham love triangle

It’s a happy household at Tottenham; as the Christian Eriksen, Harry Kane and Son Heung-Min love triangle thrives a year on.

In 2016/17, Spurs boasted two of the top 10 partnerships in the Premier League, including the joint best. This season, Kane and Eriksen have combined twice, while the Dane has also assisted two of Son’s goals.

Llorente can’t get over his ex, Sigurdsson

Despite combining for six goals last season, Swansea City’s Fernando Llorente and Gylfi Sigurdsson’s went their separate ways last summer. The Spaniard joined Spurs, however with just one start in the Premier League for his new club, is still probably thinking about his ex.

Although it appears Sigurdsson has taken the break-up far better after his move to Everton. The Icelander has traded Llorente in for a younger model, scoring two goals from two assists by Dominic Calvert-Lewin.

Sanchez leaves, Ozil gets the house

It was a New Year and a new start for Alexis Sanchez. Last season, Mesut Ozil netted five goals from Sanchez assists. However with the relationship suffering financial issues, the Chilean left Arsenal for big spenders Manchester United in January.

Perfect partners at Man City

Marriage may be on the cards at Manchester City. Sergio Aguero has already bagged the same number of goals from Kevin De Bruyne assists (5) this season than he did last, with three months of the current campaign still to go. The pair seem inseparable at the moment.

Costa leaves Chelsea for his ex

There was no love lost at Chelsea after Diego Costa got back with his ex, Atletico Madrid, following a messy break-up with the Blues. Costa’s relationship with Cesc Fabregas was a

highlight of his turbulent time in London which saw the striker score four goals from four Fabregas assists in 2016/17.

Firmino and Salah enjoy fling behind Mane’s back

Although still together at Liverpool, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane’s relationship has hit the rocks following Mohamed Salah’s arrival last summer. Firmino assisted four of Mane’s goals last season, however has only combined with him once in 2017/18. Whereas Firmino’s wild fling with Salah has seen them provide each other three goals this campaign. Is a new love blossoming at Anfield?

Mass break-ups at Everton

Romelu Lukaku packed his bags and left Everton last summer, leaving Kevin Mirallas and Yannick Bolasie to pick up the pieces. The bond between the Belgian and his teammates saw Lukaku score eight goals from Mirallas and Bolasie assists. The break-up was too much for Mirallas who also disappeared, heading to Greece for six months. Singleton Bolasie still remains

at Goodison.

Rooney and Ibra show age is just a number

In 2016/17, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Wayne Rooney proved age is but a number when it comes to true love. Meeting at a combined age of 66, Rooney assisted four of Ibrahimovic’s goals last

season, however it wasn’t enough to keep the pair together at Manchester United.

Jose Mourinho intervened to break-up the happy couple, convincing Rooney he was better off with his ex, Everton.

Ukraine and world news,"Gurbuz Gonul, Acting Director of Country Support and Partnerships at IRENA","On February 24, 2018, Ukraine gained full membership of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), an organization that accumulates the best international experience and possesses a unique knowledge base on new technologies and trends in their introduction in the field of renewable energy. What prospects does this open to our state? Will it be possible to rely on significant loans to develop this promising area? What is the situation with the Chornobyl zone? Ukrinform spoke about these issues with Gurbuz Gonul, Acting Director of Country Support and Partnerships at IRENA.

Ukraine became a fully-fledged member of IRENA. Can you please tell if the organization often welcomes new members? In general, do you think that the popularity of IRENA in the world is growing with its ambitious plans to combat global climate change?

The Agency’s growth, since establishment, has been remarkable. With Ukraine now a member, our total membership is 155 countries (154 plus the European Union), with a further 25 states in accession, and we are expecting to welcome two further members in the next few months.

This growth is representative of the importance of renewable energy to the future of sustainable economic development around the world. It’s clear that we are living through a time of extraordinary change that is reshaping the way we think, live and work, and bringing new and transformative opportunities that will revitalize economies and lift people out of poverty. The pace of this change will only accelerate, as technology improves and the urgency to decarbonize the energy system in line with the Paris Agreement gathers momentum. Navigating such profound change requires careful planning and smart forward thinking policy-making, which is why countries are increasingly turning to organizations such as IRENA to help them chart a pathway to long-term prosperity.

According to the latest figures, only 1.5% of the general capacity of electric generation in Ukraine is produced from renewable energy sources. Besides, almost 1% comes from hydropower which is more of traditional generation in Ukraine. Therefore, what is the category in which IRENA can place Ukraine, if such a categorization in general exists among IRENA-members? What are the consequences?

Every member of IRENA is equal regardless of the size of their economy or of their progress in the field of renewable energy. The rights and benefits a member with an established and mature renewable energy industry has the same rights and level of involvement as a country with little or no existing renewables experience. In that respect, Ukraine is no different to any other member, and we welcome them to the Agency with great enthusiasm because the country has tremendous potential to deploy vast amounts of cost-effective renewable energy. In addition, please note that a core component of IRENA’s work is building tailored support programs with countries that address its specific needs and development goals.

When we talk about the realistic goals of Ukraine acquiring membership in IRENA, specialists from IRENA have already made some significant work when they wrote the REMAP 2030: Renewable Energy Prospects for Ukraine in 2015. Why were so many efforts made in the analysis of a country that is not even a member of IRENA?

The Agency has already enjoyed a promising level of engagement with Ukraine, even before it became a full member. Following the REmap, IRENA also included Ukraine in a report “Cost-competitive Renewable Power Generation: Potential across South East Europe”. In addition, in 2017, representatives from Ukraine participated in the workshop on renewable energy auctions organized jointly with the Energy Community Secretariat in Vienna, and in the wood energy statistics workshop in Budapest, in 2016.

IRENA does actively engage with a number of non-member nations from time to time and often at the request of current members – which is a demonstration of the Agency’s unique ability to serve as the principle platform for cooperation and dialogue on energy transformation.

A renewable energy roadmap in Ukraine at the time served as an important strategic assessment of the country’s ability to support a number of social and economic development pillars at a national level, whilst strengthening energy security and promoting energy independence.

In the context of Ukraine's joining the IRENA organization, people often talk about the access to the Abu Dhabi funds that finance ""green"" projects in member countries. But can we expect a big impact from the financial means amid absence of a coherent policy on supporting the projects of renewable energy sources at the national level? Or, are we too harsh and the ""green"" tariff that is currently working is already a sufficient condition for further development in the sector?

IRENA’s partnership with the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development is designed to address one of the primary barriers to renewable energy development currently – access to financing, which often stifles the growth of renewable energy in developing countries despite the vast resource endowment many of these countries enjoy. Ukraine included.

Connected to that is the importance of stable, predictable and enabling policy and regulatory frameworks, because they provide important investment certainty and promote capital flows. In Ukraine today, the high cost of capital is significantly and adversely impacting the competitiveness of renewable energy and is a consequence of the need to strengthen the framework of policy support. For instance, our analysis[1] shows that Ukraine has the cost-effective potential to deploy nearly 120 GW of wind power, despite the high cost of capital and it possesses further potential for up to 320 GW of wind and 70 GW of solar PV by 2030 if more stable frameworks are provided and borrowing costs come down. The tariff is a good start, however support measures such as well-designed PPAs, improved grid capacity and the establishment of a long-term stable framework, are equally important steps.

As far as we know, IRENA has two headquarters – one in the UAE and a technical one in Germany. Does the organization consider its expansion? What does Ukraine need to do in order to have an official representative office in Ukraine?

IRENA is headquartered in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, with offices in Bonn, Germany – the home of the Agency’s Innovation and Technology Centre, and New York. The agency conducts its operations with member countries through focal points, either within a Ministry – often the Ministry of Energy, or through an Embassy. IRENA has no plans to establish any further offices outside of this.

When we talk about switching problems to opportunities, the Ukrainian government does a lot (and talks a lot more) with regard to the use of significant potential in the area near the Chornobyl nuclear power plant as a site for development of solar energy. Do the IRENA's member countries have similar situations and how realistic it is to expect success from such an idea? Can experts from the organization analyze the advantages and disadvantages of such an experiment?

Ukraine’s plans to explore the potential of renewable energy on the Chornobyl site appear to make sense for a number of very practical reasons. Firstly, because the area around the site is unsuitable for almost anything else, so the land is inexpensive and utilizing it for renewable energy power generation is seen as a positive and productive use of the site. The land also has much of the grid infrastructure still in place, which would again support its suitability to further power generation. Finally, it would offer the country a chance to reframe its energy narrative, and chart a positive, practical and safe future for its power production and for that site, in particular. Japan has stated similar ambitions for its Fukushima site and plans are underway to upgrade its grid infrastructure in order to transform it into a pioneer for renewable energy.","Ukrinform spoke about these issues with Gurbuz Gonul, Acting Director of Country Support and Partnerships at IRENA.

The move, it says, will help the e-commerce entity become the single largest seller of mobile telephony devices in the country, a distinction now held by rival Flipkart.

Amit Sinha, chief operating officer of Paytm Mall, says brands have so far been unable to ignore e-commerce players but at the same time had to face the wrath of their offline channels as online ones engaged in deep discounting. With Paytm Mall, the offers you see online are the same ones you get offline, he assured.

“Brands like Samsung are very concerned about the discounting. They want to control the market operating price because at the end of the day, 80% of (their) sales happen through the offline channel. Brands were getting hammered by their offline partners, who were asking them to boycott online players,” said Sinha.

also partners with small offline retailers. It asks them to route purchases by customers through its platform; in return it will drive traffic from the web to their stores. The upside is that offline retailers will now be able to offer deals and discounts to compete with Flipkart and Amazon as burns cash to catch its rivals.

The targets are ambitious. Paytm Mall wants the gross merchandise value (GMV) of products sold on its platform to cross $10 billion next year, a claimed three-time jump from the $3 bn in GMV during the past year. All of these will be driven through offline retailers and Paytm Mall is taking the help of brands to sign these up.

“Our pitch to Samsung was that each of their shopkeepers will be on a single platform and will be able to keep their inventory, sell through that system and we will have the same offers that are available on the online platform. Today, Samsung invites us to all their dealer and retailer meets, to come and explain what we’re doing,” added Sinha.

Paytm Mall has so far signed up 25,000 authorised retailers for Samsung devices; the number is going up. Apart from Samsung being able to keep its offline retail community happy, it gives the company the ability to monitor unsold inventory like never before and micro-manage offers across its entire channel, rather than in a few stores.

Sinha says many retailers of electronics in smaller cities and towns won’t stock high-end SKUs (Stock Keeping Units, the retail term for a number assigned to a product by a retail store to identify it and to track all the inventory). Not because these don’t sell but because they don’t sell enough of these. With Paytm Mall directing traffic to these stores and being able to fulfill orders made at one store with the inventory stored at another, brands like Samsung can augment their earnings.

While Samsung is one of the biggest integrations of a brand with Paytm Mall, it isn’t the only one. Chinese computer and smartphone maker Lenovo is also working closely with it, a partnership which helped the latter to become the largest seller of laptops in India says Sinha.

Sinha says he is, for now, focusing on major e-commerce categories such as phones, electronics, personal computers, appliances and fashion, while not revealing many names.

“Most brands actually end up losing 30-60% of their sales after a person decides to buy a product because the right SKU is not available. It’s very pronounced for a fashion brand and less pronounced for an appliance brand. Through our single platform and large seller base, we can solve this issue. So, brands obviously see our value,” he adds.","With Paytm Mall, the offers you see online are the same ones you get offline, he assured.

All of these will be driven through offline retailers and Paytm Mall is taking the help of brands to sign these up.

Mats Palmberg, Vice President of Saab's International Partnerships, said the company was also bringing its global partners to India to expand on its product range.

On the Indian Air Force looking to procure over 100 single-engine fighters and the Navy seeking to induct 57 jets for its aircraft carriers, he said it would be beneficial for India if the two acquisitions were combined.

The government is set to start the process soon for procuring a fleet of single-engine fighters for the IAF and had last year invited proposals from global fighter jet manufacturers for 57 combat aircraft.

""We will cooperate with other in India,"" Palmberg told PTI in an interview. He, however, declined to reveal the names of the with whom Saab was looking for collaboration.

In September last year, Saab and the Adani Group had announced a collaboration in defence manufacturing entailing billions of dollars of investment and said the joint venture would produce Gripen military jets in India if it won the single-engine aircraft deal.

""We are looking at involving other parties, for example, into the Gripen project as well. But it is important to be in the complete ecosystem and you should not put everything into one basket,"" he said.

Palmberg said Saab was looking at producing a broad portfolio of products in India considering the favourable business climate and policy initiatives of the government to promote defence production in the country.

He indicated Saab's interests in producing radars, unmanned aerial vehicles and futuristic platforms for the Indian armed forces.

""We have to look broadly. We should use the existing network of in India in the best possible way. We are also bringing in our international partners,"" he said.

Palmberg said Saab's association with the Adani Group will continue even if the joint venture fails to bag the deal to produce the single-engine fighter jets for the Indian Air Force.

Tony Ogilvy, General Manager Aeronautics and Head of Sea Gripen at Saab, also said it would be beneficial for India if the requirement for IAF and the Navy was combined.

""It is definitely going to be beneficial and it will give Indian manufacturing opportunities that really are going to be invaluable,"" he said, adding if Saab wins the two projects, both the aircraft will be manufactured in India.

Saab has offered its Gripen E for the IAF and its Gripen M for the Navy.

Ogilvy said Gripen E has already been crafted for IAF but Gripen M needs to be furthered designed in keeping with Indian requirements.

Boeing has also offered its F/A-18 Hornet fighter jet to the Indian Navy.

Hard selling Gripen M for the Navy, Ogilvy said it will be much better for India than the F/A-18.

""It's a question of a longer term requirement. The F/18, I guess, will have some problem in operating from India's aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya,"" he claimed.

Ogilvy said Saab had responded to the Navy's Request for Proposal and was now awaiting a response.","He, however, declined to reveal the names of the with whom Saab was looking for collaboration.

Creative New Zealand will soon engage with Māori across the length and breadth of Aotearoa as a first step in developing a by Māori for Aotearoa Māori arts strategy.

Creative New Zealand will soon meet with Māori artists and organisations across the length and breadth of Aotearoa as a first step in developing a ‘By Māori, for Aotearoa’ Māori arts strategy.

Paula Cuff, Senior Manager Māori Strategy & Partnerships, says Creative New Zealand is focused on enhancing its support for Māori arts and working in collaboration with government and others to support, nurture and grow Māori arts.

“In developing a Ngā Toi Māori strategy that can best support our artists, it’s essential that we listen to the aspirations Māori have for Ngā Toi Māori, as well as the challenges faced by artists and arts organisations.”

The roadshow intends to further develop Creative New Zealand’s understanding of how the regional landscape for Māori arts and culture impacts social, cultural, economic, and environmental well-being.

“We know that it’s important to engage kanohi ki te kanohi (face-to-face), so we’re taking to the road and visiting artists in their own rohe,” says Paula.

The roadshow consists of 23 regional hui that are being held from Kaitaia in the north to Invercargill in the south. The team will also visit the Chatham Islands as part of their efforts to engage with as many artists and organisations as possible.

“We’re encouraging all Māori artists, arts organisations and iwi to come to the hui so they can share their views and whakaaro about what’s important for them. We’re also keen to hear from others who may have an interest in this space such as iwi entities, community groups and those who share similar goals and objectives.”","Paula Cuff, Senior Manager Maori Strategy & Partnerships, Creative NZ on PaakiwahaCreative New Zealand will soon engage with Māori across the length and breadth of Aotearoa as a first step in developing a by Māori for Aotearoa Māori arts strategy.

During the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 21) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Government of Québec announced a set of international climate cooperation measures to benefit Francophone countries that are the most vulnerable and most exposed to the impacts of climate change.

These three measures, totaling CAD 25.5 million, are directly financed via revenue generated by the Québec government’s carbon market. Under the Western Climate Initiative (WCI), Québec, California and Ontario hold joint auctions for greenhouse gas (GHG) allowances, making this cross-border market the second largest cap-and-trade carbon market in the world.

One of Québec’s international climate cooperation measures consists of a CAD 6 million contribution to the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF), operated by the Global Environment Facility (GEF). This action marks a first for a federated state. Additionally, together with our partners at the Francophonie Institute for Sustainable Development (IFDD) and the International Youth Offices of Québec (LOJIQ), we implemented the Initiative jeunesse de lutte contre les changements climatiques (Youth Climate Change Initiative), which seeks to strengthen the capacities of Francophone youth to help fight climate change through entrepreneurship and environmental education.

Furthermore, the International Climate Cooperation Program, which has a budget of CAD 18 million, was established to support the development of projects by Québec organizations that, in collaboration with one or more local organizations, aim to contribute to efforts to reduce GHG emissions or adapt to climate change in these countries, primarily through technology transfer and capacity building. This program also aims to support the implementation of the SDGs, specifically SDG 1 (no poverty), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and 13 (climate action).

As Chair of the International Climate Cooperation Program’s steering committee, I was asked to collaborate with representatives from civil society, the private sector, and the research community to ensure that this program is providing tangible assistance to our local partners. In this regard, the first call for projects, launched in November 2016 on the occasion of the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 22) in Marrakech, Morocco, was very well received, not only owing to the large number of organizations that submitted climate cooperation projects, but also with respect to the quality of the projects selected.

The International Climate Cooperation Program is currently supporting 14 projects resulting from the first call for applications, including the project led by Unisféra and its local partner, the Nubian Vault Association (Association la Voûte Nubienne, AVN), a West African organization that received the UNFCCC’s 2014 Momentum for Change Award.

While electricity production infrastructure in many African countries is already facing challenges to meet the current demand, the demand for energy will continue to increase due to the rise in average temperatures combined with economic and demographic growth.

Nubian vaults provide a response to the lack of solutions for housing that is adapted to climate change in Sub-Saharan Africa. Through this ancient construction technique, which originated in the upper Nile, low-carbon, modern, sturdy, comfortable and versatile buildings with vaulted roofs can be constructed at minimal cost using basic tools, local materials (mud bricks) and simple skills.

Under the project, 843 private and 57 community buildings will be constructed in Burkina Faso by 2020, which will reduce GHG emissions by 19,500 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) over the buildings’ lifecycle. The project also provides for training 720 masons and apprentices. As a result, 5,000 people will benefit from living in Nubian vaults or, in the case of community buildings, making regular use of them. Unlike traditional houses, Nubian vaults do not require using wood as a building material. Therefore, they help reduce deforestation in regions that already have few trees. Additionally, Nubian vaults do not use sheet metal roofing, which is expensive, polluting, and unsuited to the climate since it provides poor thermal comfort. By promoting sustainable housing, this project also contributes to the implementation of SDG 11 on inclusive, safe and resilient human settlements.

The Unisféra and AVN initiative aptly illustrates Québec’s climate cooperation approach in that it is an innovative partnership focusing on green technology that is adapted to local contexts. Its goal is to create long-term benefits for the project through its integration into relevant national policies and its appropriation by local populations and organizations.

In broader terms, Québec’s approach is just one example of the various innovative initiatives by federated states and regions around the world. Together, we have a concrete role to play in achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change, whether through GHG reduction and adaptation or financing the fight against climate change.

Many of them have ambitious targets for protecting forests, provided they receive sufficient support from the international community. Among the most important forest countries is Brazil, home to the vast expanses of the Amazon rainforest. Brazil had considerable success in reducing its deforestation rate while increasing agriculture production in the decade from 2004.

However, in the last few years, economic difficulties have started to reverse these efforts, so policies and resources (public and private, international and local) need to be more effectively aligned. At the same time, there is the potential in Brazil to leverage the country’s advanced legislative framework for the protection of tropical forests — the Forest Code — to help it deliver on its national climate goals. Stopping further advances in deforestation will require investments in forests themselves to increase their value.

In recent years, forest countries such as Brazil and international donor agencies have focused much effort on improving agricultural productivity to reduce the need for conversion of more forest land for agricultural purposes. However, stopping further advances in deforestation also will require investments in forests themselves to increase their value relative to other uses. And doing so at a large-scale means supporting ambitious policies in forest countries at national and jurisdictional levels, as well as on the ground. No one silver bullet can make this happen, but, as a new Forest Trends report discusses, a number of complementary approaches could be combined into a more integrated strategy for forest conservation.

""Toward a Financial Architecture to Protect Tropical Forests: The Case of Brazil"" discusses how public policy and public finance can form synergies with private sector finance and corporate sustainability commitments to achieve forest conservation, forest restoration and more productive agriculture and forestry sectors. The financial and policy architecture it proposes provides a pathway for how tropical forest countries such as Brazil can achieve the multi-billion dollar scale of investments necessary to meet their commitments under the Paris Agreement.

Building such a successful financing strategy for forest protection will require the construction and connection of three fundamental pieces of architecture, namely:

Enhancing the effectiveness of REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) approaches;

Supporting the implementation of domestic policies and legislation for forest protection; and

Harnessing private sector funding for forest protection from commodity buyers, agribusinesses and consumers.

1. Enhancing the effectiveness of REDD+

REDD+ results-based finance can play an important role in helping countries reach their ambitious climate goals. However, the successful implementation of REDD+ at the necessary scale will require tremendous investment — more than bilateral and multilateral public funding sources alone can offer. Private sector finance is therefore needed for REDD+ and sustainable forestry to reach its full potential.

Private sector demand for REDD+ credits could be harnessed with price floors for public REDD+ credits, providing forest country national or regional governments with the certainty of a minimum price, while also opening the possibility of attracting additional demand from the private sector.

Developing a way to leverage donor commitments for future performance-based REDD+ payments into current financing flows is also important for generating near-term action, for example through the use of enhanced bond structures explicitly linked to REDD+ results-based finance.

2. Supporting domestic policies and legislation for forest protection

National and regional public policy and regulation in forest countries are critical to catalyzing the necessary scale of pro-forest investments. Two approaches that could efficiently improve the linkage between REDD+ finance and forest protection measures on the ground by supporting implementation of Brazil’s powerful Forest Code legislation are:

Expanding the capacity of Brazil’s public banks to provide loans, at significantly lower rates of interest, for farmers to invest in reforestation to comply with the Forest Code; and

Allowing public and private actors to buy and retire the rights of private Brazilian landholders to trade their surplus acreage of protected forest as ""offsets"" to compensate for deforestation elsewhere in Brazil. Under the requirements of the country’s Forest Code, this trading is permitted as a tool for landowners to achieve the minimum required ""quota"" of forest protection, but purchasing and retiring these rights would reduce the ""supply"" available for trade, collectively leading to more forest protection/restoration than the minimum required by the Forest Code.

3) Harnessing private sector funding from commodity buyers, agribusinesses and consumers

Recent years have witnessed a groundswell of private sector commitments to reducing deforestation in agricultural commodity supply chains. However, these corporate commitments are not financing the actual transition to more sustainable production.

What is needed is a mechanism through which the relevant actors in the supply chains help fund payments for the public goods and services associated with forest conservation, thereby reducing the financial burden that currently rests on the shoulders of forest countries and international donors.

In addition to prioritizing commodity purchases from producers and regions that can demonstrate ""sustainability,"" agribusiness also could supplement donor funding for REDD+ and public expenditure in forest countries with commitments of capital that represent a very low percentage of the payments made for commodities. As a result, these investments would be directly linked to jurisdictional REDD+ achievements and would support implementation of the Forest Code.

In sum, the report lays out a path of strategically structured public policy and public investment that can leverage private investment more effectively toward shared goals of forest conservation and increased agricultural production. Given the fact that public sector budgets for forest protection are limited, these approaches can provide the incentives needed to generate REDD+ finance from private actors — together providing an architecture and a pathway forward for financing tropical forest protection.","Tropical forest countries are critical for reaching the climate goals under the Paris Agreement (PDF).

CAIRO - 23 March 2018: Following the economic downturn in the country, companies have recognized the importance of aligning long-term strategies with government policies and agendas to ensure sustainable success. Public and private partnerships (PPP) have become an important tool for the government to appropriately allocate risks and responsibilities associated with expanding the economy and stimulating job creation.



While the government utilizes the private sector to efficiently run public services, the private sector gains legal security for maximizing value for money for governments, which inspires confidence in the longevity of business operations. In light of this mutually beneficial alliance, these partnerships aim to help improve governmental challenges while simultaneously developing expertise in vital sectors such as infrastructure, communications and housing, among others.



At the forefront of the country’s development plans is Egypt’s Vision 2030 sustainability goals, directing the strategy of policy-making and private sector contributions. The economic, social and environmental dimensions define the outline of the sustainable growth the government aims to achieve, with high dependency on the private sector’s innovation. The economic pillar is set to increase the GDP growth rate per annum at 7 percent; through reduction of the unemployment rate and enhanced innovations in in the industrial sector. The environmental pillar aims to decrease pollution and water waste efficiency through regulation policies nationwide. A key objective set in the social justice pillar is achieving confidence in the government, set at 80 percent by 2030; through enhanced primary healthcare and education, reduction of poverty rates and boosting infrastructure.



In an effort to move toward the goals set under infrastructural development, the housing and transport ministries invited local and international companies last month to submit contractual offers to finance and maintain monorail projects from Giza to the New Administrative Capital, costing at least €1 billion and set for completion by 2020. This project aims to link central Cairo to the New Administrative Capital, allowing for more cohesive societal integration in the country to reach growth plans between 2020 and 2050, funded through international monetary organizations and government loans with high profit margins foreseen. With the completion of the project by 2020, experts have predicted that the monorail would transport 48,000 passengers per trip, and 250,000 passengers daily, keeping up with growth of the city. The World Bank had estimated in 2012 that the Middle East and North Africa region would need between $75 and $100 billion in investments per year over the next 20 years to meet its infrastructural development needs.



In the education sector, there are plans to develop and run 200 public-private partnership schools this month for the Ministry of Education’s PPP schools projects aimed at enhancing primary education across the country. The latest report issued by the General Authority for Educational Buildings (2017) confirmed that there are 2,370 districts in 17 governorates deprived of education, with Sohag at the top of the list with 351 districts short of schools. The numbers released by the Ministry of Education on the number of classes, schools and teachers across the country show evidence of high classes-to-students ratio difference between governmental and private schools. Government sector schools hold a ratio of one class per 62 students, and private sector entities hold a ratio of one class per 37 students, conveying a gap of quality educational services.



The reduction of the density rate of students in classes, especially in the primary stage, requires more than LE 15 billion worth of investments as Egypt’s Vision 2030 goals are set to position Egypt in the top 30 countries with primary education quality. The launch of the PPP educational project will ensure the government’s commitment to improve the current conditions, and achieve the set objectives for a more prosperous education system in the country.



Considering economic growth, several national projects are in progress to develop new infrastructure and housing projects, attracting international foreign direct investments in the country. The most prominent of these is the New Administrative Capital, which houses the main government departments, administrative and financial offices, and foreign embassies. To date, the project is hosting a number of public partnerships to develop 20 housing projects worth $15 billion for an occupancy of 5 million, and government administrative districts attracting $10 billion worth of investments.



A representation of this foreign investment is portrayed with the Chinese company China Fortune Land Development (CFLD) partnering with the Ministry of Housing and Investments, developing 60 square kilometers with investments worth $20 billion, for educational, health, commercial and entertainment projects. Local companies in various sectors are identifying similar opportunities to invest in these projects, with high foreseeable profit margins. Real estate companies like Misr Italia, Mid Town, Sodic, and Memaar El Morshedy have already announced development plans in the New Administrative Capital.



As companies continue to assess the opportunities of growth in alignment with government entities, businesses see the clear elevation in category competition, enhanced innovation with impact in specialized industries, and optimized consumer targeting creating unprecedented progress in the country. Positive market sentiment toward progressive projects has led to an immense growth in public-private partnerships, providing evidence that exclusive dependence on government alone cannot spur the economy.

39,https://www.masstransitmag.com/rail/article/12397125/strengthening-rail-through-public-private-partnerships-p3s,"Sat, 10 Mar 2018 08:00:00 GMT",MassTransitMag.com,Strengthening Rail Through Public Private Partnerships (P3's),"Public-private partnerships (P3’s) are an asset to public transportation agencies. One of the most beneficial aspects is the ability for agencies to shift certain financial and construction risks to private companies. P3’s have the ability to utilize funding and grants from both regional and local transportation authorities – the process of P3’s can provide a greater level of investment benefits. P3’s can also be utilized in a number of different applications; including design/build, implementation of passenger services and technologies.

A Department of Transportation spokesperson stated; “While public private partnerships may not work for every rail project, they can provide projects with increased flexibility and capital, accelerated project delivery and more access to innovation.”

When it comes to a successful rail P3 partnership, companies like Transit Wireless and Transdev stress the factor that their company is in it for the long-haul. Once Transit Wireless takes on a project the company works to form a tight partnership, from management to profitability.

Determining Different Rail Needs

“It starts with understanding the goals, roles and responsibilities of what the agency is looking for. What type of services do they need to support ridership? What type of services do they need to support public safety? What type of services do they need to support the business of running the transit authority? Be it operational, maintenance, internal communication or enterprise asset management — once we understand the goals, objectives and timing that they are looking to achieve, these services all get rolled into a license agreement,” Transit Wireless CEO Bill Bayne explained. “The license agreement really becomes the charter for the partnership between Transit Wireless and the agency.”

Scott Hagen, communications manager, Transdev said that the earlier that Transdev is able to begin forming that partnership, the better. ""Often what we’re responding to is a vision that they already have. The earlier that Transdev is involved in the process, the better the outcome is going to be. We can take that worldwide expertise and experience and recommendations and suggestions to work with each customer to help them understand that the decision they make early in the process effects.""

When it comes to rail projects, it’s clear that each one has hurdles that need to be overcome. Most systems also face different requirements; may it be the construction, city structure or just the span of the rail lines. The importance when selecting and forming a successful P3 relationship is a company that can understand and address those needs directly.

Transdev has been working with a number of different cities on streetcar lines — including the upcoming Milwaukee Streetcar. “There is this North American renaissance with streetcars and we’ve seen that (some agencies) think that streetcar operations are similar to bus operations. They’re two completely separate services, with two completely separate challenges and opportunities.""

Transit Wireless recently undertook a project within New York's subway lines. “The New York City transit environment versus another metro has completely different constraints on space, environmental concerns and access by the public,” said Bayne. “We work with the internal departments of the agencies to really define those design, mechanical and environmental constraints. That leads to a network architecture that A. meets all of those service requirements and B. is tailored and customized to fit that environment.”

When it comes to P3’s Transit Wireless takes both the financial and capital risk, allowing for the agency to stretch their budget further to address other areas of need. When it came to the New York subway, the Transit Wireless partnership also benefited its network partners – offering services from AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon.

Bringing Accessible Technologies to New York Riders

Offering increased accessibility to riders can often increase ridership on rail lines. Transit Wireless recently acquired a 27 year exclusive license to design, build, own, operate and develop business on a broadband wireless network on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s underground stations in New York City.

“There are 282 stations today, and we are required to build with what we call a neutral host network – it [a neutral host network] is a network that provisions all wireless spectrums used by the national carriers, a public safety spectrum and private Wi-Fi that is owned by the New York City Transit Authority for their internal communications. We essentially build a neutral host environment and deploy all services and then pursue partners to extend their services out to the public or to employees,” explained Bayne.

Bayne said that Transit Wireless takes on the financing risk, schedule risk, and the business development risk and once the system goes live Transit Wireless operates it.

“As we recover our investment we share net profits 50/50 with the transit authority. As we commission a station, on a station-by-station basis, we have commission services,” said Bayne. “We pay a minimum revenue per month to the transit authority. If for some reason we don’t develop any partnerships on the network, we still will have to pay the transit authority a minimum revenue payment across every station as services are provisioned.”

Bayne explained that both the agency and Transit Wireless work directly in a partnership for the length of the contract – benefiting each other.

Overcoming Challenges

When entering into P3 contracts, each rail situation raises different challenges.

“There’s always challenges with each new or existing service, but there are opportunities as well,” said Hagen. “One of the challenges is overcoming the perception that all we are capable of our operations. Our depths of knowledge around rail projects goes beyond rail operations.”

“Within the New York subway network, no two stations are alike,” explained Bayne. “We have a general architectural approach and we understand the service and quality requirements, but every single station requires a customized design to avoid existing infrastructure.”

The P3 partnership with MTA and Transit Wireless is beneficial for both the agency and the company.

“As we look across the transit industry, these are very complex and maintenance intensive businesses. New York is a 110-115 year–old system. It requires a huge amount of capital to maintain and a huge amount of capital to upgrade the services of running the transit authority. There are three main benefits of a P3 in these environments. First, our job is to be the experts in designing, deploying and managing a network. Second, by deploying a neutral host we spend an inordinate time out in the market place working with national wireless carriers or public agencies outside the transit authority>Third is that since they are very old and capital investment networks, we take risk off of budgets and tax payers; agencies can stretch their capital budgets to other projects,” added Bayne.

“Why would you learn how to ride a bike when you can hire a professional cyclist to ride a race for you? There are so many different aspects to running a rail operation; there are little details that aren't even considered when you're deciding to do it yourself or to hire an agency. We would highly recommend that agencies pursuing new rail project or looking to build new lines explore public private partnerships — there are many different aspects and challenges that they might not realize exist,"" explained Hagen. ""That’s why we’re there; to help them, consult and council them and make sure that they understand what they're asking for and what they want to achieve and we can achieve that together.”","Public-private partnerships (P3’s) are an asset to public transportation agencies.
Once Transit Wireless takes on a project the company works to form a tight partnership, from management to profitability.
Determining Different Rail Needs“It starts with understanding the goals, roles and responsibilities of what the agency is looking for.
Bayne said that Transit Wireless takes on the financing risk, schedule risk, and the business development risk and once the system goes live Transit Wireless operates it.
Our depths of knowledge around rail projects goes beyond rail operations.”“Within the New York subway network, no two stations are alike,” explained Bayne."

Last week, we posed this question to our audience: When do charitable partnerships cross the line?

The question came in light of a recent alliance between the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and Heineken. The beer giant is offering its communications and logistics expertise to help with the delivery of health-care supplies in markets where Heineken already has an extensive distribution system.

A coalition of global health organizations, many of whom focus on alcohol and drug abuse, are condemning the partnership. Health advocates say alcohol is a major risk factor for the spread of HIV and TB.

Dozens of readers shared their thoughts in our online form and Twitter.

Here's a roundup of responses, which have been edited for length and clarity.

The need is urgent enough.

""The need to eradicate HIV and malaria and TB is urgent enough to allow it. Heineken is there, so they might as well bring some good to the people in those areas."" -Laura Orimo

It's a great way to give back.

""Charitable partnerships are a great way for alcohol companies to give back to the countries and communities that buy their products. Alcoholic beverages are enjoyed by many in moderation. Buying locally sourced ingredients and giving to charities benefits people who are suffering around the world."" -Bailey Dangora, social studies teacher, New Hampshire

Let them help.

""If anyone is willing to help, I say let them. Heineken will sell beer in Africa regardless of their agreement with any charitable organizations. Allowing them to assist is a good thing."" -Gary Codding, Connecticut

Way over the line.

""Partnerships with companies producing hazardous products are inappropriate. They must be judged in terms of conflict of interest. Alcohol corporations rely on harmful use of alcohol for their sales and profits.

Alcohol is increasingly recognized as a threat to global health, with 3.3 million deaths every year. The harm it causes to people to other than the drinker (like traffic accidents or violence) is only just beginning to be counted. Stakes are high for alcohol corporations and this is why partnerships happen. Way over the line!"" - Sally Casswell, a health professor and alcohol researcher at Massey University, New Zealand

It's tricky.

""Partnerships between corporations and development institutions are always tricky. Sustainable development goals, like long-term well-being, are difficult to balance with companies that have short-term profit as a priority or sell consumer products with negative side effects, like sugar and alcohol."" - Tobias Denskus, founder of the global development blog Aidnography, Sweden

Stay away.

""For the Global Fund to end HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, alcohol use must decrease. The case of Heineken in Ivory Coast shows how the company is engaging in aggressive marketing practices, which in turn drives alcohol consumption and harm.

For the beer giant, this is a minor investment with a huge return. The partnership disguises Heineken's harmful impact on societies, provides branding opportunities and gives [the company] access to [global health] decision-makers.

These reasons make the partnership incompatible. The Global Fund should stay away from such companies."" - Maik Dünnbier, director of strategy and advocacy at IOGT International, a group that works for the prevention of alcohol and drug harm, Sweden

Thank you to everyone who shared their views on the topic.","Your Thoughts: When Do Charitable Partnerships Cross An Ethical Line?

41,https://www.raconteur.net/finance/open-banking/open-banking-struggle-behind-bank-fintech-partnerships/,"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Raconteur,Open banking: the struggle behind bank-fintech partnerships,"Conventional wisdom in the financial world is that large incumbent banks need to partner with smaller startup and scale-up companies for a mutually beneficial relationship that aims to foster innovation and ultimately improve services.

Recent regulatory mandates, based on the European Union’s second iteration of the Payments Services Directive as well as from the Competitions and Markets Authority (CMA) in the UK, have pushed traditional banks to open up their data and platforms, in the form of application programing interface (API) toolkits.

These APIs, mostly focused on retail current accounts, create an avenue for financial services startups to integrate their products with existing bank infrastructure more easily. The aim is to create a more competitive environment and hopefully offer increased options for consumers. All of this is known by the umbrella term “open banking”.

The CMA directive is aimed at the top nine banks in Britain and Northern Ireland, banks such as Barclays, RBS and Lloyds Banking Group. Despite not being governed by the CMA mandate, Starling Bank, a year-old mobile-only bank in the UK is taking an aggressive approach to open banking.

According to Megan Caywood, Starling’s chief platform officer: “Starling is taking that a step further with its API and marketplace. The API goes beyond the CMA requirements and looks to surface every Starling feature via the API, such as an API for savings goals even though that isn’t mandated, and enabling accessibility tools like webhooks to make integration easier.

“The Starling marketplace goes beyond simply enabling third parties to access bank data; it enables those parties to be visible and available to customers within the Starling Bank app – it integrates the partners’ APIs as well. That’s appealing to third parties as it gives them a new customer-acquisition channel and a way to make it easier for Starling customers to access their products.”

Last month, global professional services firm Capgemini launched its World FinTech Report, along with LinkedIn and in collaboration with Efma. The overarching theme was that global fintech – financial technology startups – and traditional financial institutions and banks need to partner and collaborate. While that goal sounds good on conference panels and in blog posts, the reality is much harder to actualise.

Nektarios Liolios, founder and chief executive of Startupbootcamp FinTech, an accelerator programme for global fintech startups funded by partner banks and financial services firms, sheds some light on the lofty goal of startup-bank partnerships.

Speaking as part of a transatlantic debate, hosted by Capgemini, in association with 11.FS Media, Mr Liolios says the problem lies in the chasm between an appetite for innovation and a capacity to achieve it on the part of traditional financial services firms. Conversations on how to bridge that chasm are not happening, he says.

“How do you measure success, how do you measure what works and what doesn’t work? How do you get the business excited enough to put money towards it when the innovation budget is actually shrinking?” Mr Liolios asks.

Startups are not standing out from the crowd

According to Carrie Osman, founder and chief executive at CRUXY & CO, a strategic UK consultancy, many banks are now overwhelmed by the possibilities opened up by the regulations fuelling open banking. “You would think, with these regulations coming out, it would make it easier for banks. What is happening is it has made the space more crowded,” she says. “Startups are not standing out from the crowd.”

However, startups need to focus on exactly what value they will bring to a large firm and how their offering will interact with vast, enterprise-wide technology “from day one”, Ms Osman adds.

Despite the hype and noise around bank-fintech collaboration, and past struggles to make these partnerships happen, there are bright spots appearing within the financial services sector. Late last year, HSBC and their subsidiary First Direct announced a partnership with London-based fintech startup Bud. Most recently, Barclays signed a banking deal with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and, as part of the deal, Coinbase now has an e-money licence and access to the Faster Payments Scheme.

Case Study 01

Starling and PensionBee

Starling Bank recently added PensionBee, a UK-based startup, on to its marketplace. Starling uses the PensionBee application programming interface, or API, to pull a pension balance into their app, when customers give permission to share that data. Existing PensionBee customers can see their real-time pension balance alongside their real-time current account balance. According to Clare Reilly, head of corporate development at PensionBee: “A pension is not an abstract pot of money, shrouded in complexity, which bears no relation to the rest of your financial universe. Your pension balance should be visible alongside all your other balances, current account, ISA, mortgage, credit card and savings.”

Case Study 02

Munich Re and Buzzvault

Munich Re’s Digital Partners business recently partnered with Buzzvault, a UK startup offering a home contents insurance product. The solution is a digital asset vault built on blockchain technology. “In theory, Munich Re could have built their own blockchain-based home contents insurance product,” says Andy Rear, managing director of Munich Re’s Digital Partners, “but the result would not be as good.” Working with Buzzvault “enables us to bring our insurance and data expertise to the market in a different way”. According to Becky Downing, chief executive of Buzzvault: “Collaboration has always been at the heart of successful innovation – think of Apple working with the likes of Verizon and Intel.”","These APIs, mostly focused on retail current accounts, create an avenue for financial services startups to integrate their products with existing bank infrastructure more easily.

By John Carlos Diaz, GeoSera Consulting

What is the cost of a failed partnership between a pharma company and its CROs? Is it financial? Research and development time?

Sadly, the cost of a failed partnership between a pharma company and a CRO is not just a monetary loss and lost R&D time; it also could lead to a trial with a negative outcome or a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA. Trials with negative outcomes or CRLs are crippling to companies of all sizes, but a CRL can cause people to lose jobs and can literally close the doors of a small pharma company, as a small company may not have a strong enough pipeline to keep it afloat.

How many clinical research colleagues have heard from pharma, CROs, service providers or research sites that they “want to be partners” with each other? I am going to guess that 99 to 100 percent of readers have heard this phrase in their careers. Now, more importantly, how many clinical research colleagues actually see this partnership occur during the conduct of a clinical trial? Many fewer, I am sure.

For the purposes of this article, I will ignore large pharma and large CRO partnerships, since most large pharma companies have preferred provider CROs with incredibly long contracts. Partnerships between large pharma and large CROs tend to be quite bureaucratic, with numerous KPIs, and have less focus on conducting clinical research in an efficient manner.

The following items must be approved by each department or organizational leader to create a quality partnership between pharma and CRO:

Agree on the experience levels on both the pharma and CRO teams. Focus on a few KPIs that are important. Trust the operational staff. Create short- and long-term timelines and milestones. Establish clear roles and responsibilities.

1. Agree on the experience levels on both the pharma and CRO teams

Having the proper team in place, in my opinion, is the most important part of conducting quality clinical research. Pharma companies must take proper care when interviewing the team of the CRO that has been selected. The CRO staff should be experienced in the therapeutic area to be studied, while also having the appropriate personnel to support the trial.

When a CRO is selected, the CRO’s team’s CVs are reviewed and approved by the pharma company. Now why does the CRO not have the same opportunity to review the sponsor’s CVs? How many of my CRO colleagues have had to “teach” parts of trial oversight and conduct to a junior person at the pharma company? CROs have numerous responsibilities that they are contracted to perform in generally very tight timelines. Taking time out of their day-to-day workload to explain the basics to an inexperienced pharma team can be detrimental to meeting those goals.

2. Focus on a few KPIs that are important.

Recruitment milestones are the most important milestone to pharma. The longer recruitment takes, the longer it will take for the drug to be approved and the longer it will take for that drug to generate profit for the company. Other milestones, like site activations, query resolution rate, monitoring frequency, and monitoring report finalization, are important as well; however, each pharma company has its own set of important KPIs that the CRO can agree upon.

3. Trust the operational staff.

The operational team supports the day-to-day work of clinical trials as their full-time responsibility, without being pulled in many directions like most executives. The executive teams of both the pharma and sponsor need to trust their operational staff to perform their responsibilities with minimal executive involvement. Granted, the operational staff needs to have the right tools to conduct their responsibilities, but micromanagement from the executive team does not lead to efficient conduct of a clinical trial. If the operational team is not trusted, they feel less empowered to use their experience to make proper and proactive decisions.

4. Create short- and long-term timelines and milestones.

The outsourced model of clinical research requires numerous service providers. Effective communication across all these service providers is not always easily achievable, but one way to keep all parties focused on the same goal is to set clear short-term and long-term timelines and milestones. Short-term goals help the team powering through the day-to-day work get a sense of achievement, because some of the milestones in clinical research are a long way off, such as last patient out (LPO). This LPO date could be years after the study team begins setting up the trial. Long-term goals are needed to keep the team focused on the bigger picture.

5. Establish clear roles and responsibilities .

Setting clear roles and responsibilities are essential to avoid inefficient, duplicative efforts by both the CRO and pharma company. The contract between the two parties can serve as the backbone for defining each party’s roles and responsibilities and help avoid conflict that could arise from duplicative effort. The roles and responsibilities can be detailed in the project plan, which will serve as the document to guide operational oversight of the trial. The responsibilities must be easily accessible -- not buried in an extensive plan that is not referenced frequently by either the CRO or pharma.

Conclusion

Forming quality partnerships between pharma’s and CROs is essential to executing clinical trials in an efficient manner. There must be a commitment from both the sponsor company and the CRO to form a partnership. By implementing agreements on experience levels of study team staff, focusing on important KPIs, trusting the operational team staff to perform their responsibilities, creating short- and long-term milestones, and setting clear roles and responsibilities, the parties can improve their chance of achieving a successful partnership.

Research partnerships between Australian universities and defence industries raise major ethical concerns, and may be at odds with the principles of academic freedom.

In its 2016 Defence White Paper, the Australian government committed to an 81% increase in the Defence budget over a decade. The paper also outlined plans to recruit 4400 new Australian Defence Force employees.

Read more: Defence white paper: an extra $29.9 billion spending over a decade

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also recently announced a $3.8 billion investment in the arms manufacturing industry. The hope is Australia will become one of the world’s top 10 weapons exporters.

The government has turned to higher education to help fulfil these goals. It needs graduates with the skills to grow and sustain the military and weapons industry, and academic research that contributes to the development of military technologies.

Intensifying ties between universities, the Department of Defence and weapons manufacturers make sense within the government’s wider militarisation efforts. But they may not be ethically justifiable.

Research partnerships

Last year, the University of Melbourne announced a research partnership with Lockheed Martin – the world’s largest weapons manufacturer – through the Defence Science Institute. They established a co-joint research centre adjacent to the University of Melbourne campus.

This is Lockheed Martin’s first research centre outside of the US. The centre will “will provide PhD scholarships and internships, while directly funding research projects and co-authoring applications in the future”. Only a fortnight ago, the University of Melbourne signed another similar agreement – this time with UK weapons manufacturer BAE Systems.

Victorian universities are not alone. Adelaide University, Flinders University and University of South Australia are all part of a research network funded by BAE Systems. According to a BAE Systems press release, this partnership involves “creation of new defence-focused courses and targeted research and development”.

There are 32 Australian universities participating in the Defence Science Partnerships program, so more research partnerships will likely emerge soon. In addition, last year Australia’s Department of Defence partnered with the US Department of Defence on the Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative. This program provides grant funding to Australian universities willing to produce research on “designated topics” with “potential for significant future defence capability”.

Ethical issues

These partnerships raise serious ethical concerns. In the past, Lockheed Martin has faced allegations of corruption for political lobbying in the US. In the 1970s, senior officers were found to have coordinated a “program of foreign bribery”. The company still sells its weapons to repressive regimes and governments accused of war crimes, such as Israel, and Saudi Arabia.

BAE Systems has faced allegations of bribery and fraud. Its third largest customer is Saudi Arabia (representing 21% of its sales), and its airplanes are used in Saudi Arabia’s current bombardment of Yemen. BAE Systems continue to sell to Saudi Arabia despite protest from non-government organisations, and research showing that one in three air raids have hit civilian sites in Yemen.

Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems are also major manufacturers of nuclear weapons, which are subject to categorical prohibition in the new UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. A growing number of financial institutions are divesting from companies that develop these weapons.

Read more: Australia must sign the prohibition on nuclear weapons: here's why

Research conducted by the World Peace Foundation and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute show bribery, fraud, sales to repressive regimes and poor environmental practices are endemic to the arms trade.

Universities have downplayed the nature of these companies and the purpose of their research and products. Promotional materials refer to “advanced technology companies” rather than weapons manufacturers. There is no mention of war and surveillance, only “cutting edge technology”.

Academic freedom could be at risk

Another significant ethical concern is military funded research will be expected to demonstrate military value.

In the US, universities are highly reliant on Pentagon funding, particularly for STEM disciplines. US academics have debated the ethics of military-funded research in many fields, most recently neuroscience.

Read more: Margaret Gardner: freezing university funding is out of step with the views of most Australians

The likelihood of academic research being directed towards military objectives is heightened if military funding begins to crowd out alternative sources. This is a possibility in Australia, given the defence budget increase and the wealth of overseas weapons manufacturers.

As Australian research councils struggle and universities face a funding freeze, academics with limited funding options may be driven to seek military funding. This could undermine their control over the direction and use of their research. Academics may be less inclined to speak out against military funding if their department, colleagues, or PhD students rely on it.","Research partnerships between Australian universities and defence industries raise major ethical concerns, and may be at odds with the principles of academic freedom.

Whereas in the past many CIOs functioned in an isolated information technology management role, today they have a much wider influence on the organization. They not only have to make sure vital IT systems keep running smoothly, but they also help the bank draw road maps for digital strategy and growth.

That expanded role is essential to usher in much-needed innovation, said Scott Case, the new CIO of the $206 billion-asset SunTrust Banks. He joined in January at a time when the bank and the industry are in the midst of a digital transformation.

Case replaces Anil Cheriyan, who retired after serving as the bank’s CIO since 2012. This is Case's second stint at the bank — and the stints were not far apart. Case had held senior technology positions at Bank of America before joining SunTrust in April 2015 as chief technology officer for its consumer segment. He left last October to become CIO of Ciox Health, a health care information management company, but SunTrust brought him back shortly afterward.

Case spoke recently with American Banker about his goals, the priorities for SunTrust’s IT infrastructure and the challenges ahead. What follows has been edited for length and clarity.

What are some of your initial goals?

SCOTT CASE: Being in the role for just over a month, some short-term goals included focusing on partnerships internally and aligning with the different lines of business and acting as a strategic partner with the other parts of the bank. It’s important to be aligned so we can maximize the investments we have made. We have a good trajectory on mobile and digital capabilities so it’s important to continue that trajectory.

Medium to long term, we are looking at our digital road map and how we can use digital to improve the client experience and driving financial confidence and well-being. One way we’re doing that is through our onUp movement, a website that is available to anyone, not just SunTrust clients, with tools on budgeting and education to help you assess your level of financial well-being.

We’ll also be looking at things like our further migration to cloud, API gateways, microservices and continuing to create a culture of innovation internally.

Does the CIO have a more collaborative role now than in years past?

The short answer is yes. I am very much collaborating with others at the executive table as well as the business leaders that have PNL accountability day to day. Delivering purpose to our customers in a digital world is paramount for the company. [We're] not just here to keep the lights on for important systems — though that is critical — but also advising and being a part of our strategy moving forward.

Application programming interfaces enabling the notion of open banking are a hot topic in the industry, How do you view this trend?

It all starts and ends with the purpose of improving the client experience and how we can enable that. I believe with the technology and digital ecosystem we live in today need to have those types of services to improve the connectivity of systems inside and outside of company. Over time how open and how aggressive we go in letting third party developers leverage our APIs is something we’ll have to determine. As the API economy evolves over time, the openness of some of these services to drive banking forward is something we will be doing more of. Right now, we are using APIs mostly to connect systems internally and with fintechs we have acquired or have partnerships with.

With partnerships between fintechs and banks becoming more common, do you see them as a viable way to bring new technology and ideas into the organization?

They’re fundamentally important to us going forward. Banks and fintechs need each other, quite honestly. We have been fairly active in this space, such as our investment in Greenlight Financial Technology last month. We also used our acquisition of Lightstream (known as FirstAgain when it was acquired by SunTrust) to create a digital lending platform; another good example is our partnership with nCino which is an integral part of our wholesale loan origination platform. Another category we are currently looking at is a mortgage offering, and we are talking to and working with some fintech companies to provide capabilities in that area. We’re always looking across a range of dimensions, whether it is an outright acquisition, investment or partnership.

What other technologies are top of mind?

Artificial intelligence and machine learning are big topics right now. We have been doing a lot of work to strengthen our data platforms internally, and AI and machine learning can play a key role when it comes to analyzing data and data management. So we’re certainly looking to evolve our capabilities there. It obviously also plays a role in consumer-facing services.

AI, machine learning and robotics in improving risk management and fulfilling know-your-customer requirements, leveraging those technologies further for effectively and efficiently improving internal processes, is also something on our road map.

What role does technology innovation play in improving the commercial-client experience?

It’s very important to us. Look at what we’re doing with a platform like nCino for our wholesale clients; it allows bankers to respond quicker to clients because everything is centralized and ultimately better serve clients from beginning to end. In treasury services, we also have our SunView portal, which gives them a dashboard view of accounts and reporting tools. Digital services for commercial clients are really important to us and it’s something we’re investing in.","That expanded role is essential to usher in much-needed innovation, said Scott Case, the new CIO of the $206 billion-asset SunTrust Banks.

Online lending marketplaces Rubique and Bankbazaar said their partnerships with credit information Experian and CIBIL, respectively, to offer free credit reports to customers, made their lending more efficient.

“Our credit report partnership with CIBIL, as well as our proprietary credit score which blends alternative and conventional data, has helped us move from a blended approval ratio of 40-45 percent a year ago to around 65 per cent approval ratio now, said Manav Jeet, managing director and chief executive, Rubique.

Bankbazaar’s year-old partnership with Experian increased the chances of approval of loan for its customers. “The credit report makes an individual aware of her own score and thus enables her to decide if it’s the appropriate time to apply for a financial product. If the person has a bad credit score, she can now choose to wait and improve her credit score before applying for a loan,” said Navin Chandani, chief business development officer, Bankbazaar. While both Rubique and Bankbazaaar do not lend on their own books, they saw a marked difference in loan approval ratio of their customers.

“These partnerships play a key role in bridging the demand-supply gap. As a result, it helps the lenders provide credit where it is due, while keeping the risk at minimum,” said Vaishali Kasture, managing director, Experian Credit Bureau.

Online payment service provider PayU, and Germany-based fintech company Kreditech recently partnered to provide instant loans for online purchases. “Customers can make a real-time decision as to whether they want to take a loan to buy a particular product and they would have customized loan options available to them, with rates based on their credit score,” said Shailaz Nag, Managing Director and Co-Founder, PayU India. While PayU is in charge of distribution and providing consumer spends data, Kreditech lends on its books and provides the credit score. PayU invested EUR 110 million in Kreditech and this was the first of many lending partnerships between the two, said Nag.

Private sector lender RBL Bank has partnered with alternate data company Credit Vidya on two accounts – verifying salaried customers data and providing alternate additional data of customers. “Our partnership with Credit Vidya is for providing us with alternate additional data like spending patterns, bank statements and more from the consumer’s phone with her consent,” said Harjeet Toor, Head – Retail, Inclusion and Rural Business, RBL Bank. While the bank is still testing the impact of its partnership for the credit model, it said that Credit Vidya’s technology provided a cheaper and faster way of verifying a customer’s place of employment.

“Our platform that onboards a customer can be integrated with the within 8 -12 weeks timeframe. The entire process is digitized to reduce the cost of operations and to bring speed and scale in the lending process”, said Rajiv Raj, Co-founder and director, CreditVidya.

“CreditVidya is able to provide alternate data using technology we have not developed so far. We can use this data to further refine our existing credit scoring model,” said RBL Bank’s Toor.

Both Experian and CreditVidya said that alternate data is most beneficial for assesement of new – to-credit customers for whom centralized or structured data is not available.

“This segment today uses mobile, internal and social media extensively and hence, leave their digital footprint. We can use this digital footprint to understand customer profile more in detail and thereby, provide them credit at early life-stage”, said Experian.

“CreditVidya works as credit enabler for leading lending institutions and looks at numerous data points on customers to assess customers’ risk, authenticate and check frauds. Here we check ability, intend and stability of the customers using alternative data,” said Raj.

“CIBIL score helps us understand a customer’s intention to pay as it tells if a person has defaulted on any loans before. Alternate data points like travel size, ecommerce shopping, other spends and telecom bills help to understand the consumer behavior and consistency in terms of payment and serves as a validation, said Rubique’s Jeet. While bank statements require consent from the customer, a lot of data like telecom bills and e-commerce can be pulled shopping from direct sources, he added.","If the person has a bad credit score, she can now choose to wait and improve her credit score before applying for a loan,” said Navin Chandani, chief business development officer, Bankbazaar.

With a large chunk of India’s total population, nearly 67% residing in rural villages of the country, which lack most basic amenities and infrastructure, the CSR agenda and task for nation building and development is mammoth.

Among the activities covered under the Schedule VII of Companies Act 2013, which may be included under the companies CSR policies, rural development projects are enlisted as one major area of CSR programs. Efforts for improving the lives of rural populace in terms of access to facilities like education, healthcare, sanitation, livelihoods, water availability, agricultural improvement etc. are some key focus areas that require attention of multi- stakeholders. The onus of scaling up the rural development interventions and initiatives at macro-level, lies with the state undoubtedly.

However, the role of corporates in fulfilling their social responsibilities in the vicinity of their operational plants and addressing to the needs of rural neighbouring communities is imminent, for being a good corporate citizen, and acting beyond compliance. The value addition in rural development can be enhanced by corporates through their resources and skills sharing, and employee volunteering in rural villages, through building partnerships with implementing agencies/NGOs working in rural space.

Working with rural communities and partnering with them requires both, an indepth understanding of the village-level issues and enabling solutions for the pertinent concerns, which can be facilitated through the rural NGOs having relevant community connect and related competencies and strengths. Such organizations act as a bridge between the communities and the stakeholders, helping the rural communities to empower themselves, through their capacity building and facilitating them to get access to government rural programs/benefits. Effective rural governance with active citizen participation is a vital tool in making the empowerment happen. Together with varied stakeholders – government, NGOs and corporates through PPP (public, private and people) partnerships, innovative, replicable and scalable models of CSR in rural development can be executed.

Through its work in rural development, since inception in 1999, S M Sehgal Foundation (SMSF), Gurugram, a public, charitable trust registered in India, has been aiming to strengthen community-led development initiatives to achieve positive social, economic, and environmental change across rural India. The Foundation envisions every person across rural India empowered to lead a more secure, prosperous and dignified life.

With support from donors and partners, SMSF has worked along with the communities in rural India to address the pressing challenges of water security, food security, and social justice. The core programs of the Foundation encompassing water management, agriculture development and good rural governance are spread in various villages of the six states where it is presently working in Haryana, Rajasthan, Bihar, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.

SMSF works with a range of multi-stakeholders – government, international organizations, NGOs and corporates leveraging partners’ strengths for support to specific thematic projects and programs. Several rural interventions have been done in many villages in the domains of integrated water management/rainwater harvesting, safe drinking water, sanitation and water for schools, improving agriculture productivity and livelihoods of small and marginal farmers, rural school renovations, community- led development for empowering rural citizens and strengthening village institutions, life skills/digital literacy, awareness programs through community radio broadcasts, etc., to name a few.

A commitment to rural development by empowering the rural masses, and led by its vision and mission, SMSF is poised to scale to new heights, working together with partners in progress of rural India, and joining hands with like-minded organizations having shared values and principles.

From SKNIS

Basseterre, St. Kitts – The relationship between the government of St. Kitts and Nevis and faith-based institutions has been strengthened over the past three years as part of the strategy to promote greater partnerships in national development.

“I do not believe that we only need the church when we have a crisis,” Senior Minister and Minister responsible for Ecclesiastical Affairs the Honourable Vance Amory said at a recent public forum. “I think we need the church and the association, cooperation and collaboration with the church to prevent crises.”

He described the church as a “living organ” that has a responsibility, in part, to encourage people to lead lives in harmony with others.

Strategies on ways the church can take action are often discussed at meetings of the Ecclesiastical Affairs Committee, which has representation from the government, Christian and Evangelical councils. Government’s role is more of a coordinating one, while the other members take the lead.

A school chaplaincy is one initiative that resulted from the committee. “We are formalizing the attachment of a spiritual leader to our schools,” Senior Minister Amory said. He referred to the growing list of complaints from adults that lament young people’s antisocial activities, absence from church functions and general lack of manners.

“We are therefore saying to our church leaders: Help us to help our children to help you,” he said. “Because if they help the children to become more spiritually attuned, then the churches will again be filled with people.”","St. Kitts government says it values partnerships with faith-based institutionsFrom SKNISBasseterre, St. Kitts – The relationship between the government of St. Kitts and Nevis and faith-based institutions has been strengthened over the past three years as part of the strategy to promote greater partnerships in national development.

(Photo courtesy of Pelican Media)

Advocates of “strategic philanthropy” argue that charitable foundations should set explicit goals and measure results against them. Advocates of an “emergent model” of philanthropy resist command-and-control governance structures in favor of flexibility.

We’ll never resolve the debate over how far foundations should go in influencing their grantees’ work—this tension is inherent to philanthropy. But perhaps we can all agree on the highly catalytic value of early, patient, and nimble investments, especially when it comes to public-private partnerships.

When donors seize an opportunity, stay engaged over many years, then pounce again to take advantage of the new opportunities their initial investment unleashes, they can achieve exponentially greater results than they would with a time-limited set of grants that assumes a certain cause-and-effect will happen. Early capital creates momentum and invariably stimulates other private and public funding. Patient capital gives grantees running room to be effective and experimental, and to adapt from lessons learned. And nimble capital provides flexibility to get things done in an ever-changing world, as donors and grantees exploit unanticipated opportunities.

We’re talking about savvy, instinct, grit, flexibility, and persistence. And we believe they matter in philanthropy for the same reasons they make sense in our own lives: Good things often take time. Life does not unfold in a linear or even logical way. Sometimes opportunity knocks only once.

What long-term investments can do

Back in 2001, Resources Legacy Fund (RLF), a California-based environmental nonprofit, joined forces with the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation—all private foundations based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Together, we worked closely with Senator Dianne Feinstein and the state of California to help acquire and catalyze the restoration of Bay Area commercial salt ponds—diked ponds used since Gold Rush days to evaporate and collect salt. Our chief goal was to reclaim for wildlife some of the roughly 187,000 acres of baylands that development had cut off from tides since the 1800s, and to make the beauty of the bay more accessible for hikers, birders, and all residents.

Initially, RLF used $20 million of foundation funds to help state and federal wildlife agencies acquire 16,500 acres from Cargill Inc., the company that owned the ponds. At the same time, the foundations invested $15 million to support both long-term restoration planning and initial environmental stewardship so that public agencies could manage the salt levels in the ponds for the benefit of wildlife.

Next, RLF identified, convened, and supported a team of wetlands, wildlife, and geomorphology experts to physically reconnect some ponds to the Bay and stabilize salt concentrations in other ponds to protect wildlife habitat. The state Coastal Conservancy meanwhile agreed to manage a long-term restoration planning process that was scientifically sound and publicly supported.

In the course of acquiring the lands and planning for restoration, some of the people involved started to ask: Would rising sea levels and other effects of climate change make restoration pointless? Geomorphologists, hydrologists, and others advised us that in fact, there was a way to create habitat that would endure even as sea levels rose, and the restored wetlands would act as a sponge to help buffer Bay Area cities—home to nearly eight million people and composing one of the most robust regional economies in the United States.

It also became clear that the cost to restore the salt pond habitat in a way that also helped protect nearby cities from floods and rising seas far exceeded any single existing source of funding. So the foundations and RLF, along with regional business, community, agency, and conservation leaders, worked to round up sources of state and local funding. These leaders ultimately helped create a nine-county San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority; worked to pass legislation to allow a single ballot measure to appear on all nine county ballots; and managed a targeted public education campaign, Our Bay on the Brink, to raise awareness of the flood threat.

In June 2016—15 years after we began work on this project—Bay Area voters passed Measure AA, a parcel tax to raise $500 million over 20 years. The funds will match state and federal funding to support wildlife and wetlands restoration, trails and recreational facilities, and flood protection for communities rimming the bay. The first wave of funding was approved this month. Though profound and unstoppable changes lie ahead, Bay Area residents now have the means to protect both cities and wetlands for the long term.

Stubborn but flexible philanthropy made this possible.

California offers other examples of the outsized payoff for philanthropic patience and collaboration in conservation. The state passed landmark legislation in 1999 to establish a network of marine-protected areas along the coast where sea life harvesting would be restricted. Though smart in its holistic approach, the complexity and contentiousness of the law stymied the state agencies charged with carrying it out. Years passed, with marine-protected areas created only near Southern California’s Channel Islands.

Several foundations—including the Packard and Moore foundations, as well as the Marisla Foundation, the Annenberg Foundation, and the Keith Campbell Foundation for the Environment—came together to support efforts to implement the legislation.

Working on behalf of the foundations and in formal agreement with the state, RLF helped develop a strategy to implement a statewide network of marine-protected areas. This involved creating stakeholder groups in four coastal regions; a “blue ribbon” task force of political, business, legal, and academic leaders; and regional science advisory teams. We developed a sophisticated online visualization tool to help scientists and stakeholders map, design, and evaluate protected areas.

In June 2012, after years of discussion, vetting, and hundreds of meetings, the California Fish and Game Commission approved the last protected areas within the network. Stretching from Oregon to Mexico, the network—the first of its kind for a state—covers almost 17 percent of state waters. Thanks again to patient donors, RLF continues to help support community stewardship and education, scientific monitoring, and enforcement. Other states and nations consider the network a model for marine conservation.

Model partnership

Patient philanthropists can also dramatically improve how government agencies serve the public. After a 2012 budget scandal shook public confidence in the management of the California state parks system, RLF worked with the California Natural Resources Agency and the Department of Parks and Recreation to create an independent, multi-year collaborative effort. Our goal: to develop an action agenda for a financially sustainable State Park system that met the needs of California’s growing and changing population. The S. D. Bechtel, Jr. Foundation and the Moore, Hewlett, Packard, and Marisla foundations funded the effort.

Governor Jerry Brown’s administration appointed a Parks Forward Commission, chartered with making recommendations for sweeping changes. Since then, department leadership has implemented the commission recommendations by working to transform operations, technology, budgeting, and hiring—all geared to improving the visitor experience and building a foundation of more-sustainable funding. Patient funders have stayed engaged and are helping create a new nonprofit organization to support State Parks.

The success of the California initiative caught the eye of Montana Governor Steve Bullock, who late last year assembled a Parks in Focus commission modeled after Parks Forward. Philanthropists again have stepped forward to support changes that will strengthen Montana state parks. Who knows where this journey will end, so long as funders stay engaged.

In our experience, philanthropists can play a pivotal role in private-public partnerships. They can marshal the forces that help political and government leaders acknowledge problems and find solutions. Sometimes that means paying to convene and support experts who can offer well-grounded advice. Sometimes it means supporting research, polling, or a public education campaign to create a common body of knowledge and consensus. Sometimes it means funding groups so they can participate in a public process and help shape policy. Sometimes getting results requires all of that and more. In any case, private-public partnerships work best when philanthropists step up early to focus public attention and attract other funders, invest for the long haul, respect government processes, and seize opportunities as they arise. Call it strategic, emergent, or something else entirely—the fact is, early, nimble, and patient capital delivers.","But perhaps we can all agree on the highly catalytic value of early, patient, and nimble investments, especially when it comes to public-private partnerships.

In this next phase of martech’s evolution, we’ll see a much-needed consolidation.

It’s already happening, not only through mergers and acquisitions, but also as brands begin to realize the massive value of martech-powered strategic partnerships and integrations.

The technology possibilities are exciting, but the human side of martech is the source of both the greatest challenges and the greatest opportunities. As the tech marches onward, becoming ever smarter through AI and the activation of more data than humans could possibly comprehend, people are still the glue in successful partnerships and integrations.

In a brave new world where technology can do just about anything, who is going to tell it what to do?

In this post, we’ll continue our exploration of what I like to call the Agile Marketer: who that is, what skills and tools they need to succeed, and how you can become one.

The agile marketing executive’s mindset & skill set

Over most of the 20th century, marketing and sales teams enjoyed defined, siloed roles. Sales was the point of customer contact, while creative, brand-driven advertising was the domain of the marketing team.

E-commerce came along to shake this up, and, near the turn of the century, sales executives suddenly found themselves having to lead some of those brand messaging initiatives. As the lines between sales and marketing have continued to blur, the pendulum has swung back toward marketing, where it’s been charged with leading the charge in meeting the ever-increasing needs of the constantly connected consumer.

Although some argue that martech should be a standalone department, it’s more likely today that marketing executives will find themselves leading increasingly interdisciplinary teams. The responsibilities of a modern-day marketing team might run the gamut from traditional marketing to digital, from martech to lead generation and loyalty functions and more.

It takes an agile marketer to manage a workforce that’s grown up in the digital age. To cater to customers who demand seamless, speedy interactions and transactions across platforms and devices. And to deeply understand the various personas and buyer types they’ll encounter through the company’s martech and across the online ecosystem.

Agile marketing requires a certain level of business and financial acumen, in addition to technical experience. This is where digital marketers tend to struggle and stop as they climb the ladder in technology-powered corporations today — in a classic example of the Peter Principle, the skills that propel you to the top won’t necessarily help once you get there. Although a solid foundation of technical and functional expertise is definitely needed to inform a CMO’s decisions, leadership skills and business prowess are far more important once you reach the C-suite.

You’ll need a solid business background in order to understand how the technology at your disposal can solve the problems your business and customers are facing. You’ll be expected to find balance between your inputs and outputs: to show exactly how your martech and talent drive a demonstrable contribution to your organization’s bottom line.

Inspiring marketing buy-in within teams & across the company

Don’t prioritize the machines and the martech over your human peers and talent, however. You’ll need to learn to unify your left-brain analytical prowess with right-brain communication skills, to bridge the gaps across teams and ensure the realization of martech’s full potential across your organization.

As CMO, you’ll need to establish and nurture relationships with the rest of the C-suite, the board, your own team and every team with whom yours will share tools and responsibilities. Failing to win this buy-in and build these relationships early on can leave a CMO crippled when they need support from stakeholders for their initiatives.

There are all kinds of personality types out there, many based on the works of psychologist Carl Jung. You might have taken the Myers-Briggs test at some point or studied the 16 personality types (perhaps you’re an INTP, The Thinker… or maybe you’re ENTP, The Visionary?). Personality types can be as simplistic or as complicated as you make them, but I prefer Deloitte’s Business Chemistry typing for navigating the C-suite:

One of the keys to agility in your role as a leader in this exciting, technology-charged marketing space is your understanding of the people around you. What are their needs and goals? As a leader, you’ll want to schedule dedicated listening opportunities with key stakeholders to get your relationship off on the right foot.

Use your knowledge of personality types to communicate more effectively with the very different stakeholders you’re going to need to connect with across the C-suite, departments and partner companies. Which brings us to…

Increasing agility with strategic partnerships & integrations

As a marketing executive, you’re constantly on the lookout for the most lucrative opportunities to engage and delight customers. You’re responsible for setting the course and steering the ship. And when you see opportunities to create more cost-effective, compelling campaigns through partnerships, you’re responsible for executing, as well.

There are a lot of different ways for your organization to capitalize on partnerships and integration opportunities. You might join forces in friendly co-marketing to expand each of your audiences, like GoPro and Red Bull. Both are established lifestyle brands, and each has value to bring to the project-based table.

For its part, GoPro outfitted adventurers and athletes with cameras and funding to capture races and extreme sporting events. Red Bull lent its experience running events on the ground and its marketing power to each event. The most memorable of these was undoubtedly the Stratos campaign, wherein a GoPro-equipped Felix Baumgartner leapt into space 24 miles above the earth. Incredibly, 8 million people tuned in to watch the livestream, and all of the solid brand messaging that went with it.

Co-marketing campaigns can offer substantial cost savings, as brands pool their resources and marketing talent. You’re able to share highly qualified audiences and wow customers and prospects with free giveaways and co-branded products.

You might explore joint customer partnerships, like BMW and Louis Vuitton. Who might be in the market for a $20,000 luggage set? Perhaps the same customer who appreciates the BMW i8’s sleek styling and $135,700-and-up price tag. These two brands recognized the opportunity in their similar buyer profiles; luxury, quality craftsmanship, decadence and travel were the common threads that bound their venture together.

For B2B businesses, complementary technology partnerships may be worth a look. Is there a problem you and a prospective partner could solve better together? Of course, the bigger the brands, the more opportunities there are within a strategic partnership. The marketing world has watched with interest as the Apple-SAP strategic partnership has come together.

As David Wither at Engadget explained, “For SAP, the world’s largest business applications creator, the partnership meant that they got to develop customized business applications for iOS devices, iPads and iPhones. For Apple, everyone’s favorite computer giant, it opened the doors to SAP’s vast worldwide sales force and customer base.”

The common core in a successful partnership, whatever the type of agreement, is that it benefits everyone involved, including (and especially) the customer. And of course, today’s agile marketer must also be prepared for that most impactful type of partnership: the merger, acquisition or IPO.

As martech continues to evolve, people will continue to be the glue that drives these powerful integrations and partnerships. The market will develop, converge, expand and contract only at the speed at which marketers can manage the tech at their disposal. Agile Marketers — those who seamlessly build and manage relationships from Baby Boomers and Generation X through to modern-day millennials — can help steer martech in a better direction.

WHO Global dialogue on financing for prevention and control of NCDs

Copenhagen, Denmark 9-11 April 2018

Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are responsible for 40 million deaths globally every year1. Tackling NCDs is a global priority, but despite this, investment is still lacking and action is needed to reach the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal target 3.4 of reducing premature deaths from NCDs by one third by 2030. In response, Denmark is co-hosting the WHO Global Dialogue in Copenhagen from 9 to 11 April 2018.

“The scale of the NCD crisis is immense, as is the need for accelerated and strengthened action across multiple sectors and stakeholders globally,” said Dr Svetlana Axelrod, WHO’s Assistant Director-General for NCDs and Mental Health. “Only by working together in new partnerships and investing the right levels of resources will we be able to protect people from NCDs and provide the care they need.”

“The scale of the NCD crisis is immense, as is the need for accelerated and strengthened action across multiple sectors and stakeholders globally” Dr Svetlana Axelrod

WHO’s Assistant Director-General for NCDs and Mental Health

At the Dialogue in Copenhagen, delegates from WHO Member States, development agencies, United Nations agencies and nongovernmental organizations, academia, philanthropic organizations and business associations will explore new ways to address the critical gap in financing for national NCD responses.

“Ultimately, it is governments’ responsibility to secure resources for health, but all stakeholders, including the private sector, can play a major role in moving the NCD agenda forward,” Dr Axelrod added.

NCDs are hindering economic development

Premature mortality from NCDs – such as cardiovascular disease leading to heart attacks and strokes, cancers, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases – constitutes a major global health and development challenge, as these diseases often kill people at a time when they are most productive in the workforce. While NCDs affect both rich and poor countries, their burden is rising disproportionately among lower-income countries, with an immense impact on economic growth.

“Business as usual will not work any longer regarding the NCDs. The global burden and challenge of NCDs is of such scale and magnitude that it requires thinking out of the box and new partnerships and financing mechanisms,” says Denmark’s Minister for Development Cooperation, Ulla Tørnæs.

“Partnerships hold the key to a healthier future and to the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals,” she adds. “We need to encourage innovative and bold partnerships between Member States and non-state actors. We are looking forward to exploring and showcasing solutions through multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder engagement and Denmark is happy to be leading this important discussion on how to close the financing gap.”

The Dialogue will focus on how international cooperation can mobilize domestic and external financing streams, as well as on aligning private sector financing in support of national responses to chronic diseases – with due respect to conflicts of interest.

Global partnerships for global solutions

The Global Dialogue will take stock of the progress made since 2011 in funding national NCD responses. It will also showcase examples of best practices on how to align public and private interests in order to accelerate action on NCD prevention and control. At a youth innovation lab at the Dialogue, 20 talented young people from 16 countries will work together to generate innovative ideas and solutions that can help close the financing gap for NCDs.

The Dialogue is the first global multistakeholder meeting to discuss the current NCD financing landscape and demonstrate the synergies between financing NCD responses and broader efforts to strengthen health systems for universal health coverage and health for all.

The WHO Global Dialogue is part of the informal process leading up to the United Nations General Assembly Third High-Level Meeting on the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases in September 2018. It is co-organized by the World Health Organization and the Government of Denmark and supported by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the World Diabetes Foundation, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, the World Economic Forum and the NCD Alliance.","Denmark hosts the WHO Global Dialogue on Partnerships for Sustainable Financing of Noncommunicable Disease Prevention and ControlWHO Global dialogue on financing for prevention and control of NCDsCopenhagen, Denmark 9-11 April 2018Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are responsible for 40 million deaths globally every year1.

In the mid-1990s, New York City was faced with the daunting prospect of investing $6 billion to construct a new water-treatment facility to meet United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Clean Water Act requirements.

On top of the initial construction costs, this project was going to cost the city an estimated $250 million annually in maintenance.

Rather than take on the considerable costs of treatment, New York City opted to dedicate around $1.5 billion to the protection of the lands within the watershed of its reservoir system. The idea was that these protected lands would provide ecological services that would filter water running into the system and maintain the high water quality, thus removing the need for future treatment.

20 years later, New York City has saved billions of dollars, conserved over 25,000 acres of land, and preserved the filtration waiver it receives from EPA’s Safe Drinking Water requirement to treat drinking water (Kenny, 2006).

Why Watershed Management Conserves Money

Most water systems in the United States are not able to obtain a water-treatment waiver from the EPA due to the existing conditions of their watersheds, but they could still benefit from cost savings associated with better watershed management.

Many water utilities are seeing increased costs associated with the treatment of drinking water and are looking for alternative strategies to avoid raising rates.

Practices like decreasing agricultural runoff, increasing watershed forest cover, and preventing increased impervious surfaces have the potential to deliver cost savings to utilities through avoided filtration and treatment costs.

Land-conservation organizations and water-utility companies are recognizing their shared interest in protecting watershed ecosystems.

In an increasing number of communities across the country, utilities are working with conservation groups to ensure the ecosystem services provided by healthy watersheds are protected and maintained.

This strategy doesn’t simply provide cost savings to water companies. It can also create a new source of funding and constituencies for land conservation.

How Source Water Protection Works

Investments in land conservation for source water protection vary across landscapes and regions. They also vary among conservation organizations and water providers.

Some water providers have a history of conserving land within their watersheds and choose to invest in conservation easements or outright purchases of lands in their watersheds.

Others may see the value of land conservation but may not want to be in the land-conservation business. They will, however, support landowners or invest in organizations that promote best management practices. Or they may work with conservation organizations to identify and complete projects.

Others may own land within their watersheds but do not have it permanently conserved. They may not know that the land is an asset with conservation value that can leverage funds to purchase or conserve additional lands.

Finally, there are others that have no experience with or interest in the role of land conservation as a strategy to manage water quality and supplies. This category is shrinking rapidly.

In each case, there are opportunities and value that partnerships with conservation organizations can provide. These can include initial information on the benefits of conserving and managing land as a strategy to protect water supplies. They can also include identifying projects, working with landowners, conducting transactions, and raising funds.

At the same time, water utilities often have valuable information about water-quality and land-use practices in their watersheds. They are also familiar with the priority lands they have identified for protection. They have financial data important to developing funding strategies. They also have the ability to fund conservation projects through rate structures.

How to Get Started

The first step is to identify the water utilities in your region and make a connection with one or more of their staff and/or board members. This gives nonprofits an opportunity to learn what water quality or supply issues utilities are facing. They can also assess what kinds of ecological investments would be most appropriate for the watersheds. In addition, they can explore the interest and willingness of the utilities to consider conservation investments.

It is important to note that water utilities may not be the only entities interested in this type of project. Other municipal entities such as sewage management departments may also provide partnership opportunities.

It is also a chance to provide information on the many resources available on the topic and examples of successful partnership projects. These conversations will help determine the utilities’ receptivity to the idea of investments in land conservation. They will also show the type of information the utilities may need to inform their decisions.

Some utilities may be assured simply by the outcomes of other projects in your region. Others may require significantly more analysis on priority lands, costs and benefits.

Organizations such as The Nature Conservancy and World Resources Institute can help model environmental outcomes if needed.

What Some Common Challenges Are

As with any new partnership, some of the initial challenges are related to the culture, language and priorities of the organizations involved with the partnership.

Land trusts and conservation organizations have very different capacities, experience and staffing from water utilities.

Taking the time to develop relationships between the organizations to develop a common language, identify shared interests, and design a common strategy will ensure a productive partnership.

Other challenges include the organizational capacity needed to identify and complete land conservation projects at a scale that can demonstrate positive outcomes for water quality and supplies.

This may include working with many landowners, packaging multiple transactions, and securing and leveraging various funds. For smaller land trusts, working at scale may require adding new capacity. Water utilities have significant infrastructure needs. They may see contributing to land conservation as a luxury they can’t afford.

Generally, challenges related to robust cost-benefit analysis have emerged because the science of watershed dynamics that affect performance, the analysis of what impacts individual land-conservation projects will have on water quality or supplies, and the data on benefits to water utilities due to avoided costs of treatment are not yet robust enough to make definitive cost-benefit analyses. This is particularly challenging if investment decisions require such an analysis.

Modeling programs are being developed to assist with this analysis. These include Natural Capital Project’s InVEST or the Chesapeake Conservancy’s Conservation Innovation Center’s High Resolution Data Programs (Chesapeake Conservancy, 2018; Natural Capital Project, 2018).

How Case Studies Demonstrate New Approaches

There are a growing number of new partnerships between water utilities and conservation organizations that illustrate a variety of financing strategies for investing in land conservation.

The two cases below represent a growing recognition of the value of multiple partners as well as innovative and complex financing strategies. While these cases are both located on the East Coast, there are watershed investment projects happening across the United States.

Portland Water District (PWD) in the city of Portland, Maine has received a filtration waiver from the EPA due to the water quality of its source water, Sebago Lake. Currently, 10 percent of the Sebago Lake watershed lands (24,000 acres) are protected.

PWD has developed a 20-year watershed investment plan. It has identified and designated priority lands for conservation. It has also partnered with local, regional and national conservation groups.

This partnership, called Sebago Clean Waters, aims to collaborate to conserve 25 percent of the lands within the watershed, more than double the amount currently conserved.

Sebago Clean Waters partners estimate it could cost an estimated $12-36 million to achieve 15-25 percent watershed protection.

For its land protection grants to land trusts, PWD has been contributing up to 25 percent of the cost of conservation acquisition or easements brought forward by the land trust partners.

To date, PWD has invested $500,000, which leveraged an additional $5 million in outside funding for land acquisition and conservation easements. They envision contributing as much as $6 million in support of the 20-year watershed investment plan (S. Meyer, personal communication, April 12, 2018.)

Manchester Water Works (MWW) in Manchester, N.H. has been working with the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests (SPNHF) to sell a conservation easement on 1,870 acres in the upper watershed of its water supply, Lake Massabesic.

The easement’s total cost was initially $2.3 million. MWW donated a portion of the value of the easement, bringing the total cost down to $1.9 million.

Over $1.6 million was raised through the state’s Land Conservation Investment Program (LCHIP) and the NH Department of Environmental Service’s Water Supply Land Protection Grant Program and the Aquatic Resources Mitigation Fund.

The remaining funds been raised by the SPNHF through private fundraising. The revenue raised through the sale of the easement will be used by the MWW to acquire other lands within the watershed identified as priority lands to protect the quality of the water supply (Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, 2017).

How Innovations Are Being Tested in the Field

There are some innovations in this field that are currently being tested and are worth noting.

State Revolving Funds and the Sponsorship Program: All states in the nation have Clean Water State A pool of loans made to individuals or small-businesses which self-funds via the proceeds received from loans within the portfolio. and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund programs. These combine federal grants with state contributions that offer loans and/or grants to support the construction and maintenance of “hard” infrastructure to comply with the goals of the federal Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. Hard infrastructure can include equipment such as water pipes, processing facilities, and treatment plants.

Most states have provisions for the use of either or both the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund for land-conservation projects, particularly those that relate to source-water protection.

More recently, however, some states, most notably Ohio and Iowa, have developed an additional program called a Sponsorship Program that pairs a land-conservation project or best management practice with a traditional “hard infrastructure” project. By lowering the interest rate for the State Revolving Fund loan, this generates funds that can be used as a grant for the land-conservation project.

DC Water Green Infrastructure Project: The impact investment advisory firm Quantified Ventures has partnered with the Washington, DC water utility to develop a “pay-for-success” environmental impact bond.

The returns for investors in the $25-million bond are tied to the performance of green infrastructure in preventing sewage overflow into the Chesapeake Bay.

Pay-for-success impact bonds may be replicable in the drinking-water-protection space.

Good advice. After all, cheeseburgers and pizza are loaded with calories, saturated fat, and sodium, and they are fueling America’s epidemics of obesity, heart disease, and hypertension. So why does the USDA undercut its own educational effort by overseeing Dairy Management Inc.’s (DMI\) funding of promotions with Pizza Hut, McDonald’s, and other fast-food outlets to push consumers to buy new, even cheesier versions of these same foods?

In February, DMI partnered with Pizza Hut to add 25 percent more cheese to the company’s pan pizza in 6,000 U.S. locations, hoping to unload 150 million pounds of milk annually. A month later, DMI announced that it had worked onsite at McDonald’s headquarters to create 30 percent larger cheddar cheese slices for McDonald’s Signature Crafted Recipes sandwiches and the Egg White Delight McMuffin served at 14,000 U.S. locations.

The USDA’s effort is based on the notion that dairy farmers cannot stand on their own two feet, don’t know how to diversify, and need Uncle Sam to step in. And it’s true that dairy

profits continue to decline

.

So DMI spends millions of dollars a year working with fast-food restaurants to push cheesy, high-fat products on the American public. You get fat, they make money.

DMI hasn’t always been so transparent. My organization, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, first exposed DMI’s activities in 2001. We learned through documents acquired through the Freedom of Information Act about a DMI meeting on Dec. 5, 2000, called the Cheese Forum.

A meeting presentation called Cheese Lovers and “Triggering the Crave” outlined how DMI planned to work with the fast-food industry to create new products to promote “cheese craving.” Another presentation actually said “Wendy’s and DMI share common goals: If you sell more cheeseburgers, then we sell more cheese!” The result was a contract with Wendy’s to market the Cheddar Lover’s Bacon Cheeseburger, which sold 2.25 million pounds of cheese, 380 tons of fat, and 1.2 tons of cholesterol.

And Wendy’s wasn’t alone. DMI worked with Burger King to introduce the Extreme Double Cheeseburger, which had two slices each of cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese plus cheese sauce, and with Pizza Hut to create the Insider Pizza, which had a pound of six different cheeses. Taco Bell and Subway also introduced new items.

There is no way to reconcile the USDA’s oversight of DMI with the Dietary Guidelines, which list pizza, burgers, and dairy as leading sources of saturated fat. A paragraph in the Dietary Guidelines even says it “includes recommendations on saturated fats because of the strong relationship of this nutrient to a health outcome (CVD risk).”

In fact, new research shows that just one high-fat meal containing dairy triggers bodily responses that may lead to heart disease.

The average American already eats 35 pounds of cheese per year — the most since the government started tracking cheese consumption in 1909. With DMI’s ongoing efforts to unload unwanted dairy products through new fast-food items, that number will only grow, keeping heart disease America’s deadliest threat.

By creating an ever-bigger market for unhealthful food products, DMI is unwittingly expanding the market for cholesterol-lowering drugs, insulin syringes, and antihypertensive medications, further inflating the medical costs that are already straining American citizens and American employers.

Enough is enough. As the USDA currently works to make the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans process more transparent, it is also time that that the USDA only promote foods that keep our families healthy.

While stressing that changing diets is one way to unlock a more sustainable food future, he asked the panel and delegates to reflect on how the food and feed industry could collaborate to help scale the best solutions for sustainable feed to meet ongoing demand for animal protein.

He pointed out that one of the barriers would seem to be low awareness of feed across the food industry: “It is difficult [for those outside of the industry] to make sense of the really technical aspects of feed. It is a really complex supply chain involving raw material providers, traders and compounders, etc.”​

Representing Waitrose on the panel was Jemima Jewell, sustainable sourcing manager at the leading UK retailer; Nicola Robinson, senior manager on the global sustainability team at McDonald's Corporation, also participated along with Sandra Vijn, director, sustainable food, at World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in the US.

The retailer perspective ​​

Jewell noted that while Waitrose is working in an extremely competitive retail environment, being an employee-owned company may give it a different perspective in relation to its responsibilities around the impact of its business both directly and down the supply chain, compared to other retailers exposed to short-term shareholder pressure.

She said, to a certain extent, because of that ownership model, Waitrose could afford to take the long-term view of many issues.

“The long term relationships we are able to form with our suppliers have also been absolutely integral to anything we have done on feed so far, and to anything we will be doing in the future.”​

Waitrose has been championing the use of homegrown protein alternatives in feed including new forage sources, as well as using European grown soy​​ in its pork supply chain.

The sustainability team at Waitrose works hand in hand with the supermarket’s agriculture focused experts. “For us it is really essential to look at how we balance the future supply and demand of protein in a way that is healthy, affordable, as well as positive for the environment and could ideally enhance animal welfare, which is core to what we do.” ​

Waitrose and McDonald's see partnerships with long-term suppliers as vital for driving transformational change in feed to fork supply chain

“You can look at the sustainability case, the business case, and you can look at the case that is being put to us by our customers and by other stakeholders, and, of course, those three are inextricably linked. ​

“There is a very strong sustainability case for action and we know that traditional sources of feed protein come with huge environmental and sustainability impacts, not least in terms of commodities like soy, including the driving of deforestation and conversion of other high conservation value land, and the commensurate impact on everything from biodiversity to climate change that comes with that. That is something we can’t and don’t want to ignore.”​

There is also a business case in looking at the security of the long-term supply of feed, in terms of building resilience in a volatile world and industry, she said.

“Our customers are very interested in where their food comes from and that discussion on food is extending into feed as well.”​

How to ensure the future sustainability of feed and livestock production as well as enhancing animal welfare are big challenges and not easy to address alone:

“In terms of our ambition, we want to work collaboratively.” ​

She said partnerships with its suppliers and with critical friends, including WWF and Compassion in World Farming, would help to generate a “shared understanding of where we want to go.”​

“We are part of the Protein Challenge 2040 and we have worked on the Feed Compass. We know we do not have all the answers. The sustainable feed of the future won’t be a once size fits all.”​

Companies in the feed and food value chain are trapped in a price discussion without fully understanding the value of the sustainability aspects of a feed raw material, according to some of the delegates attending the workshop. However, others in the audience queried which players in the feed to fork supply chain would take on the additional costs if environmental factors were integrated into feed formulation.

The food service company view​​

McDonald’s Robinson said with 36,000 restaurants globally in over 100 markets, the question immediately becomes “a very big one"" ​when it looks at its sustainability impact as a company.

It has been working on sustainability issues for well over a decade, she said. We already reported on how McDonald's is backing research into potential soy substitutes in chicken feed​​, something Robinson had presented on earlier in the conference proceedings.

She told the audience in attendance for the panel debate: “We see the responsibility and the opportunity a business of our size has to really drive transformational change, not just within our supply chain, but, actually, beyond. Some of the issues we are trying to tackle as a company, though, are certainly ones we can’t tackle by ourselves, big as we may be.” ​

The fact that its menu items are remarkably consistent around the world means McDonald's has a very small number of raw materials to deal with, relative to retailers, she said. However, it uses those raw materials in very large volumes, with beef and chicken, of course, the two sectors in which it is a major player, she added.

“Back in 2011, WWF did an independent analysis of our global supply chain and that helped us to identify six priority products that collectively carried the greatest sustainability impacts for our business, and in which we have the opportunity to drive transformational change. When we look at the environmental impact of two of those priority products – chicken and beef [we see that] feed [in those supply chains] has a major impact on the environment so that is a big reason why we look at feed sustainability.”​

She also mentioned that McDonald’s sees its customers becoming more sophisticated in their understanding of supply chains. “We want to assure our customers that we are taking a responsible approach.”​

Clearly defined tangible goals are critical for companies, she said, in terms of driving transformational change on feed. ​

“One of the things that has been really important in our journey on sustainable feed has been our long-term supplier relationships. These initiatives are not quick to implement, so having those long terms partnerships with our suppliers has been a key enabler for us to deliver against some of these big goals.”​

The NGO’s take on feed sustainability ​​

Vijn, representing the WWF, said the NGO’s interest in driving sustainable feed stems from its believe that one of the biggest threats to wild animals is commodity-linked deforestation.

“We are using natural resources at a faster pace than they can be replaced.”​

The NGO is very enthusiastic, she said, about some of the new protein feeds that are being actively researched or that are already coming onto the market.

When asked about the advice the WWF gives to retailing and food companies looking to start out on the road to sustainable feed, she said they need to know where their feed comes from, and to try and get on top of traceability and transparency in relation to feed sourcing.

The feed industry however, is fragmented, and it is not clear how the flows work globally, which adds to the challenge, said Vijn.

She said sustainable feed focused certification programs are good to an extent, but typically involve only the producers with more cash flow:

“But there is this 20% at the bottom that never moves - so how you bring everybody along in the supply chain?​

“We are taking a few steps back and trying to figure out what we can do to work with food companies, as well as governments and investment communities on bringing everybody along.”​

The NGO has been very active in the deforestation space, facilitating wide stakeholder collaboration and setting baselines.

“We also work with our aquaculture colleagues globally to bring together groups to identify what are the barriers to scale, how to deal with regulatory and investment issues. ​Those are things we are engaging companies on. We know you can’t do it alone and that you shouldn’t be doing it alone.​

“A lot of different companies are facing the same challenges so [we look to see] how can we bring them together and look for solutions.”​","While stressing that changing diets is one way to unlock a more sustainable food future, he asked the panel and delegates to reflect on how the food and feed industry could collaborate to help scale the best solutions for sustainable feed to meet ongoing demand for animal protein.

In the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC), the leaders of the two countries have married their respective countries’ “Act East” Policy and “Free and Open Indo Pacific” aspirations. The AAGC is envisioned to provide a renewed opportunity for partnership where both regions can complement each other’s development and growth. The AAGC will bring out the economic gains for Africa through its integration with India, South Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia and Oceania. It is also a roadmap for creating new channels for production of goods and services, and for connecting institutions and people in Asia and Africa.

Introduction

The relationship between Asia and Africa is old in history and contemporary in aspirations. Their common past struggles offer the two continents enormous scope for cooperation. This bond is apparent in their coming together on many occasions: bilaterally, subregionally, and as a global force as the “one voice” of the developing world.

The Asian economy, especially East Asian economy,[1] has proven resilient over the years, in turn helping push the global economy. Africa, meanwhile, is still on the growth path. Its young demography and economy require integration and expansion into Asia’s value chains of production. Together, Asia and Africa represent 70 percent of global population and 37 percent of global GDP.

Figure 1: Combined Strength of Asia and Africa

Source: World Bank, 2017.

The next decade will be an opportunity for both regions to realise their economic and social potential as well as deepen their capacities and institutional strengths. As developing regions, both continents are expected to promote strong, balanced, sustainable and inclusive growth at national and international levels, and to actively cooperate in narrowing existing development gaps and addressing common economic and social challenges. The Asia–Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC) is the chosen pathway to reach these goals.

AAGC: India and Japan Lead the Way

In the joint statement issued during the India–Japan Annual Summit of November 2016, the two prime ministers declared that the two countries would seek active participation from the international community in the Asia Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC) Programme. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his counterpart, Shinzo Abe, said in their statement that improved ties between Asia and Africa will bring about economic prosperity and encourage sustainable development. This will be done through the setting up of institutional and industrial corridors and networks for capacity enhancement, free and seamless movement of people, trade, investment, energy and partnership for infrastructure.

Officially named the “Asia–Africa Growth Corridor: Partnership for Sustainable and Innovative Development,” this megaregional growth programme will be built on a foundation that lies in the India–Japan bilateral cooperation framework. The Indian and Japanese governments have made a commitment to giving shape to the AAGC programme.

A vision document of the AAGC was presented in the Africa Development Bank (AfDB) Annual Meeting on 25 May 2017 in Ahmedabad.[2] The document predicts that in Africa’s integration with Asia, the regions of South Asia, West Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia and Oceania will play important roles. It proposes four major pillars to bring peoples, goods, services, capital and institutions closer together,[3] and help realise the objectives of the Asia–Africa partnership for sustainable and innovative development:

development and cooperation projects; quality infrastructure and institutional connectivity; enhancing capacities and skills; and people-to-people partnership.

These pillars will facilitate and enhance economic growth by linking economies in Asia and Africa, which in turn will lead to improvement in various arenas, including: a) institutional and human capacity; b) connections between institutions and people; c) the planning and execution of projects; d) trade facilitation; e) human resource development; f) technology improvement; and g) infrastructure (port, airport, industrial park, telecommunication, IT) of the two continents. The AAGC focuses on capacity-building and expanding the manufacturing base and trade between Africa and Asia. The idea is to transform the region into a growth corridor that will embed the development processes and value chains in Africa and Asia. It will enable the connected economies to further integrate and emerge as a globally competitive economic region. Moreover, the AAGC is aligned with Agenda 2030, wherein green projects are to receive priority funding and implementation.

What Asia can Offer Africa through the AAGC

The AAGC has a twofold purpose:

It brings the development experience of East Asia, Southeast Asia and South Asia closer to Africa and makes a case for greater economic connectivity and cooperation for development between the two megaregions. It presents a development paradigm for Africa in which Asia—specifically India and Japan—leads the regional and global initiatives for enhancing This offers the freedom to pursue development plans that are suitable for, and in sync with, the development priorities of countries in Africa, Asia and the Asia Pacific region.

The AAGC, therefore, is not merely a plan for the development and cooperation between Asia and Africa. It is also the underwriter of the freedom of movement of people, goods, services and capital in the geographical spread between the western edges of Africa and the eastern edges of Asia and Oceania. The AAGC is the first such attempt to prepare a growth plan that connects two continents, where the development strengths of Asia are shared and dovetailed with the development priorities of the countries/regions of Africa. Thus, the prosperity of the people of Africa and Asia is at the centre of all development plans and projects under its aegis.

Trade, Investment and Development Cooperation

The AAGC emphasises the importance of trade-, investment- and development-cooperation led growth in Africa, and between Asia and Africa. For trade- and investment-led growth, the AAGC can learn from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The industrialisation of this region and the accompanying prosperity of its people have helped improve its socioeconomic and human-development indicators. The value chains of production in East Asia are the most sophisticated in the world. Indeed, while the initial stages of development in this region were a result of official development assistance (ODA) received from developed countries such as Japan and the United States, the subsequent critical mass of growth was achieved through regular foreign direct investments (FDI), increased trade, and domestic consumption of goods and services.

ASEAN was introduced to FDI-led growth early on, although in the 1970s and 1980s, ODA and FDI levels were almost equal in this region. Early investment in connectivity, infrastructure and production networks created conditions for increased investments, leaving ODA-led growth behind.

Figure 2: ODA and FDI, and Corresponding GDP Growth in ASEAN*

Figure 3: ODA and FDI, and Corresponding GDP Growth in Africa

In the case of Africa, the ODA and FDI stand roughly at same level. Based on Africa’s needs, the AAGC will create infrastructure—both physical and institutional—and connectivity to enhance investment-led growth.

Trade and investment require support mechanisms of lowering of tariffs and improving trade facilitation measures, along with improved connectivity across the borders. These have helped the East Asian region create a dynamic growth model with sustainable results. An analogous growth of institutions and best practices, especially in less developed countries, has further contributed to sustainable growth in Southeast Asia. In addition to FDI, economic and technical cooperation among EAS countries continue to play important roles in regional growth.

The AAGC is expected to carry the Asian development experience and its production networks, and expand the existing connectivity and value chains between Africa and Asia. For this, Asia finds a natural partner in Africa, since there is already a historical and practical economic connection waiting to be deepened and expanded through new channels of investment and development cooperation. Old partnerships and new initiatives are brought together in the AAGC.

Africa, however, requires a measured combination of investments and development assistance. The AAGC’s current challenge is to expand and integrate the value chains of production in a two-way flow of goods and services. In this, balancing the ODA programmes with FDI initiatives will be important, as human resource and institutional and physical capacities must grow simultaneously.

The objective of the AAGC is to create conditions and capacities in the recipient country/region that will support direct investments for production of goods and services, and develop capacities for sustaining the growth results. The AAGC envisions sectoral programmes under its four pillars, which will create suitable conditions and capacities for growth in Africa in the respective focus areas. The natural diversity that exists in the region can be developed through investments in the traditional strengths of African economies. Green projects will be a priority in the AAGC.

A Steering Role for India and Japan

India has a long history of development cooperation and assistance with Africa. It has a leading role amongst development partners of Africa in capacity-building, infrastructure and the energy sector. It has competitive strength in providing affordable, appropriate and adaptable technology, and in project execution. At an institutional level, the India–Africa Forum Summit (held every three years) is the apex level of India’s engagement in growth and development programmes in Africa. India’s relations with Africa are not based only on business, but on a model of cooperation that is responsive to the needs of African countries. It is demand-driven and free of conditions.

Japan’s complementary role in Africa is in its strong Official Development Assistance (ODA) programme in the continent. Japan’s low cost of capital and high savings can fund development activities in Africa. Its expertise in designing, planning and hardware infrastructure is further supported by its capacity to transfer capabilities to manage supply chains in the manufacturing sector and infrastructure projects. The Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD) is held every four years. Assistance measures that leverage Japan’s strengths and experiences were identified at the Sixth Tokyo Conference on African Development (TICAD VI) in August 2016, under the following three pillars:

promoting structural economic transformation through diversification and industrialisation; promoting resilient health systems; and promoting social stability.

Africa has tremendous scope for growth, but the development priorities among countries, regions and subregions can vary. The cooperation, infrastructure and connectivity development programme under the AAGC will align and integrate these needs at the national, regional and subregional levels. Through the AAGC, India and Japan bring a shared repertoire of development cooperation strengths for Africa.

Aligning the AAGC with Africa’s Development Priorities

The four main components of the AAGC—development and cooperation projects, quality infrastructure and connectivity, capacity and skill enhancement, and people-to-people partnerships—are complementary. These components have four common dimensions:

They connect Africa with the strengths of India, Japan and the larger region of South Asia, Southwest and Southeast Asia, East Asia and Oceania. They are designed around the development priorities of countries and/or regions in Africa, particularly the Agenda 2030, African Union’s Agenda 2063, and its Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA). They put people at the core of connectivity and development and cater to their aspirations and needs. They create development programmes and projects based on equal partnership, mutual trust and cooperation.

On the ground, the AAGC is expected to be instrumental in creating new production channels, expanding and deepening existing value chains, ensuring economic and technical cooperation for enhancing capacities, facilitating a greater flow of peoples between the two continents, and achieving short-term and long-term sustainable growth. The AAGC will be developed through quality infrastructure and complemented by digital and regulatory connectivity. The most important aspects of the AAGC are its intentions to put people at the core of its planning and to create programmes and projects that are in sync with national and/or regional development priorities and plans.

Additionally, other multilateral and trilateral initiatives for Africa will seek linkages and partnerships between Asia and Africa in the AAGC and can develop their own complementarities for Africa.

Harnessing India’s Economic Dynamism with the AAGC

India has seen exponential growth in the past few decades and today it is a large market for, and provider of, goods and services. Two decades of liberalisation and economic engagements with other regions of the world have brought prosperity in many parts of the country. However, a vast portion of its economic dynamism remains untapped, both as a recipient and supplier of goods, services, FDI, technology and knowledge-intensive products and services, and human resource.

The country has been a key votary of regionally comprehensive economic development and cooperation strategy in South Asia, West Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia. Its trade and investment relations with all parts of Asia continue to grow. Moreover, India’s historical, cultural and economic ties with Africa are singular. They put India in a natural position to connect the two megaregions through trade, investment, infrastructure, institutions and people. As a common partner of Asian and African countries, India is positioned to play a crucial role in the AAGC. In doing this, India stands to improve its own integration into the global value chains of production.

AAGC Aligns Bilateral and Triangular Cooperation for Development

When PM Modi and PM Abe met for the annual Prime Ministerial Summit meeting in Tokyo on 11 November 2016, the two directed both countries to draw on the strength of their shared values, convergent interests, and complementary skills and resources, to promote economic and social development, capacity-building, connectivity, and infrastructure development in the Asia Pacific region. It was agreed that this initiative would combine human, financial and technological resources of the two countries to advance these objectives. This cooperation aims to strengthen a rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific and beyond, creating a prosperous region in the 21st century.

The AAGC is an outcome of this bilateral commitment to improve connectivity between and within Asia and Africa by realising a free and open Indo-Pacific region, factoring in India’s “Act East” policy and Japan’s “Expanded Partnership for Quality Infrastructure.” The AAGC is being developed in cooperation with the international community to promote development cooperation and industrial network in Asia and Africa. It sets a model for inter-regional growth, propelled by mutual trust and cooperation among partner countries. It is a new model of bilateral and triangular cooperation, where partners combine their strengths to advance regional and global growth. The AAGC may yet prove to be a growth and trust multiplier in Asia and Africa, and beyond.

Adams M.D., M.P.H., Surgeon General of the United States

Every American deserves to live a long, healthy life, but we are falling short of that goal.

Life expectancy in the U.S. has declined for the second year in a row.

This decline marks the first time in half a century that American longevity has declined.

This is a disturbing problem that faces us as we observe National Public Health Week, April 2-April 8.

Each year, the National Public Health Week, organized by the American Public Health Association, is a time to recognize the contributions of public health and highlight issues that are important to improving our nation’s health.

This week is an opportunity to raise awareness about public health and prevention.

My motto of “Better Health through Better Partnerships” is particularly well aligned with the theme for this year’s National Public Health Week—“Changing Our Future Together.”

When we are addressing issues that are important to improving our nation’s health, we cannot operate in silos.

Whether we are looking to improve our nation’s health outcomes, improve our national security, or enhance a community’s resilience, we need partnerships and collaboration.

We can only change our future together.

As public health professionals, we have a unique opportunity to leverage our influence and leadership to forge stronger partnerships that can more effectively promote public health and prevention.

I am committed to strengthening the connections among public health communities and forging new partnerships with non-traditional partners, including but not limited to the traditional business, law-enforcement, education and faith-based communities.

We cannot achieve our goals unless we are at the table together, sharing lessons learned and challenging each other to do more, to do better, and to do it together.

The power of working together was evident to me back in 2015, when I was the Indiana state health commissioner, and there was an HIV and Hepatitis C outbreak in Scott County.

When we found that more than 90 percent of the people diagnosed with HIV also tested positive for Hepatitis C, we initiated a multifaceted response: expanding free HIV and HCV testing, improving Medicaid registration, monitoring HIV care through the local health department, and starting Indiana’s first syringe exchange program.

We were only able to respond in this way and bring this outbreak under control by going out in the communities, really listening to individuals and local leaders, and building partnerships.

Because of them, we were able to put in place the right prevention, healthcare, and social services.

HIV, Hepatitis C, the opioids epidemic, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria are all national problems that pose threats to the health of our nation.

Thankfully, there are things that everyone can do.

If we continue to work together, listen to each other, and ensure that decisions are made with people’s health in mind, we can create a healthier nation.

In observance of National Public Health Week, let us recommit to partnering to create a healthier nation.

The Girls 20:20 campaign, launched last year, includes partners such as KKR, OVH, Goldman Sachs, Trainline and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, as well as several universities and other organisations that are providing access to mentors, spaces to run workshops and insight into the skills they need.

Since the social enterprise was launched, the number of courses it runs has increased from about 25 per semester to 51, a total that Code First: Girls CEO Amali de Alwis says could not have been achieved without partnerships and collaboration.

Eventually, De Alwis hopes the organisation can run 90 courses per semester across the UK, with “key partnerships” helping to scale the number of courses it can offer.

“When we come close to that target of 90 courses, we will be teaching, on average, somewhere between 5,000 and 6,000 young women to code for free each year,” says De Alwis.

There is a lack of women in the technology industry, with the number in technical roles in the UK hovering around 17%, and it has been said that tackling both the gender gap and the skills gap could help to solve both.

As part of the Girls 20:20 campaign, Code First: Girls has been aiming to raise between £500,000 and £1.5m to teach women to code for free, but as well as teaching the technical skills that employers need, De Alwis says it is important for partner firms to help women understand what is involved in a tech career.

“Our focus is very much to say it’s not just about becoming a developer, it’s about saying there are these opportunities in tech and digital available,” she says.

“If you’re someone who doesn’t have a background in tech, if you’ve never done coding before, it’s all a little bit ‘black box’. You’re not quite sure how it works, you’re not sure how your skills and your interest might align to that.

Travel comparison website Booking.com has partnered with two universities to offer grants to women looking to go into tech careers.

“For us, it’s really important to bring them to those organisations and bring them to those skills that show them this is what’s involved, these are the kinds of things you could be doing.”

This could be a role in UX/UI (user experience/user interface), digital marketing, communications or project management, roles that are often not associated with tech skills or coding.

But there is a misconception that all roles in technology are very technical, and many young girls say they don’t take science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) subjects because they think they are too hard.

As well as giving young women the skills needed to fill empty roles in the industry, the programme is also about making the industry “a little more approachable” by introducing young women to the types of role they could be doing and by giving them a sense of community by allowing them access to other women going through a similar experience, says DeAlwis.

Building a community of women in tech can make them more confident because they can see other people like them in the industry, helping to tackle stereotypes and give women more confidence in their skills and abilities.

“If you are isolated in your knowledge, it’s very hard to gauge how knowledgeable you are,” says De Alwis. “There are amazing communities and support structures and amazing women who work in tech. But it’s not everyone’s experience. If you don’t feel you belong there, it’s not a far stretch why people might feel they were outsiders in that and then question their own knowledge.”","In March 2018, digital rail platform Trainline announced it would join the firms supporting social enterprise Code First: Girls in its aim to teach 20,000 young women to code by 2020.

That changed with the oil price crash of 2014. Despite a recent rally in the energy sector, a deep disconnect has opened between the price of oil and the market valuation of MLPs.

MLP Basics

To review, midstream oil and gas companies generally function as toll collectors for transporting and storing hydrocarbons. Historically, midstream companies have been more insulated from the commodity price volatility that can impact the upstream and downstream sectors. As a result, many investors gravitated to the midstream companies for predictable income streams.

Many midstream providers structured themselves as MLPs, which provided tax benefits for investors.

The biggest advantage has always been that MLPs aren’t taxed at the corporate level. MLPs pass profits directly to unitholders in the form of quarterly distributions. This arrangement avoids the double taxation of corporate income and dividends affecting traditional corporations and their shareholders and should deliver more money to MLP unitholders over time.

But because of the depreciation allowance, 80 percent to 90 percent of the distribution is considered a “return of capital” and thus also not taxable when received. Instead, returns of capital reduce the cost basis of an investment in the MLP.

Investors Sour On MLPs

MLPs crashed along with the rest of the energy sector in 2014. However, in recent months most of the energy sector has rallied. The MLP sector, on the other hand, has continued to fall. Related: Saudi Arabia To Fund Giant Solar Project With Oil Riches

There are several reasons for the drop.

First, the tax reform bill that President Trump signed reduced some of the tax advantages an MLP held over a corporation.

Likewise, rising interest rates may make certain financial instruments slightly more attractive relative to MLPs.

Finally, two weeks ago a ruling by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to reverse a longstanding policy on tax costs for interstate pipelines really rattled investors.

Borrowing costs may increase a bit, and there will be increased competition for investor dollars, but tax reform and rising interest rates should have a minimal impact on the sector.

The FERC ruling could cause some MLPs to convert to corporations — a popular trend throughout the energy sector downturn. But many MLPs have already issued guidance that they will either be unaffected or minimally affected by this ruling.

A Widening Disconnect

How wide is the MLP disconnect? Consider that oil prices closed last week more than 30 percent higher than they were a year ago. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is hovering around $65/BBL and Brent is at nearly $70/BBL. Related: Higher Oil Prices Boost Saudi Credit Rating

The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE), which represents the largest energy companies in the S&P 500, is down by 3.6 percent over the past year. The XLE represents the stocks of large energy companies from different sub-sectors (e.g., integrated, oil production, equipment services). It is, therefore, a good benchmark for conservative energy investors.

The S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production SPDR ETF (XOP) is more representative of the smaller-cap drillers. Despite companies across the board posting much-improved year-over-year financials, the XOP has done a bit worse than the XLE, falling 6 percent in the past 12 months.

But the Alerian MLP Index (AMZ), which captures about 75 percent of the midstream sector’s market capitalization, has dropped by 20 percent since last August — a time that oil prices were still ~$45/BBL.

In my view, the steep sell-off in the sector is overdone. MLPs should see improving business conditions with the higher price of oil, so a 20 percent sell-off is unwarranted. This disconnect can’t last.

Schools, sporting clubs, arts groups and Indigenous projects from western NSW have the chance to share in $100,000 to help them kick their goals. Charles Sturt University (CSU) is stumping up cash as it continues its mission to “encourage and support our communities” beyond providing education. Its Community-University Partnerships (CUP) grants program provides funding of up to $20,000 across five different categories. The power of $1000 grants made last year was on display at the 2018 launch of the program at CSU’s Dubbo campus on Friday. Buninyong School As Community Centre local facilitator Lorna Brennan told guests the funding had been used to help migrant families, facilitating English language conversation classes for parents. “They’ve gone on and done loads of things, because it’s given them the confidence to go out into the community and ask questions and find out for themselves and how to engage with their children’s schools and things like that,” Ms Brennan said. The Early Intervention Support Class of Orana Heights Public School received $1000 last year to add sensory, gross motor and fine motor equipment to increase student participation. Further west, St John’s Parish School at Trangie added mathematical resources to classrooms thanks to CSU’s gift. “We thank Charles Sturt University for the generous grant that enabled our small rural school to be able to purchase up-to-date contemporary learning mathematical resources for our classrooms,” teacher Xanthie Kerin said. “With this grant we have been able to launch our little school into contemporary 21st learning, leading in world-class math practices.” In 2017, a Head of Campus small grant was awarded to Condobolin High School to install swing gates in the existing cattle yards to ensure safety for students and animals. “The purchase of the gate makes the yards safer the students to work in and increases their confidence in handling stock,” agriculture teacher Katrina Thomas said. CSU Dubbo head of campus Cathy Maginnis encouraged members of local communities to apply for the funding to support their activities. Ms Maginnis said the university was there for the public good. “...we really want to encourage and support our communities,” she said. “So we provide education but we want to give back to more than just education, so we really want to support and engage with our communities. “The CUP initiative is all about the university supporting groups and organisations in Dubbo and the surrounding region in achieving goals.” Online applications have opened for the 2018 CUP Rural and Regional Sports Development Program, with other programs to follow.

62,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-leaders-identify-gaps-and-best-practices-for-cross-sector-partnerships/,"Thu, 17 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Leaders Identify Gaps and Best Practices for Cross-sector Partnerships,"March 2018: The UN Global Compact and Accenture Strategy released the second edition of their ‘CEO Study,’ which examines businesses’ opportunities to engage with the SDGs, in particular the role of cross-sector partnerships. The report builds on the initial study of business executives, with interviews of leaders from 35 entities across the UN system.

Only 28% of UN respondents believe their organization or agency is doing enough to engage the private sector.

The report titled, ‘Special Edition: Transforming Partnerships for the SDGs,’ follows the findings of the 2016 CEO Study, in which 85% of the over 1,000 CEOs surveyed saw cross-sector partnerships as being critical to realizing the Goals. This second round of research confirms the sentiment within the UN, with 100% of leaders surveyed stating that greater collaboration across sectors is critical to SDG attainment, and 91% reporting growing interest from the private sector. However, the report also reveals a gap, as only 28% of respondents believe their respective organization or agency is doing enough to engage the private sector.

The gap stems from three main causes identified by the UN respondents: capability gaps, resource constraints and low risk appetite by the organization’s governing bodies. The report notes that these gaps, combined with low levels of trust and a perceived lack of partnership-building skills, leads to short-term, one-off engagements, primarily on pilot projects that are not taken to scale. UN leaders lament that resource constraints often necessitate a focus on securing philanthropic or in-kind donations rather than on substantive value proposition for the company involved.

According to the report, 97% of the surveyed participants felt that better engagement depends on better measurement and tracking of impacts. However, the authors note, only 10% of UN entities always define formal key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure progress and impacts.

Five case studies of partnerships illuminate best practices. The case studies outline the reasons for partnership and how the collaborations first began, what each partner saw in the other, the cross-sector challenges faced while maintaining the partnership, and the overall value added. On the UN side, partners include the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the UN Development Programme (UNDP).

Lessons from the case studies include the value of acknowledging trade-offs, and understanding how to navigate this in a strategic way to ensure that both partners benefit, by adding value that is greater than the sum of their parts. Aligning incentives is key to success, as common goals such as reducing child labor and increasing workplace safety (SDG targets 8.7 and 8.8, respectively) can help identify opportunities to collaborate. For example, the ILO’s partnership with Naledi3d, a virtual reality (VR) innovator, is reducing injuries in the forestry sector through the use of VR chainsaw training.

To scale up successes, the report provides an “IDEAS Roadmap” of actions for both business leaders and partnership practitioners. Five steps—identify, develop, engage, act and succeed—offer guidance on how transformative cross-sector partnerships can be fostered by individuals in both the business world and UN system.

The report also highlights the UN Global Compact’s UN-Business Action Hub, an online platform that allows users to browse cross-sector projects and seek new partners to scale up collaborations.

Whether it is a marriage, business venture or simple friendship, qualities like collaboration, mutual respect and trust are essential ingredients to lay a foundation for success. Despite the mass of tools at our disposal to stay connected, a partnership that is productive, beneficial and lasting requires more. Using the following four pillars in business partnerships, you can build this foundation, allowing the relationship skyscraper to take shape and grow.

Let It Take Shape Organically

A lot of times people come into organizations and immediately resort to being prescriptive. Their past experiences have influenced their opinions and they expect relationships to conform to these predetermined molds, but it’s important to keep in mind that every company has its own disposition and differentiators. Just like any other relationship, make the effort to stay open-minded and devote yourself to becoming familiar with your partner’s needs. This will help the relationship grow more effortlessly and fruitfully.

With this open mind, allow yourself an immersion period to learn your partner’s values and their goals. This will allow you to more thoughtfully process how the partnership can amplify different facets of your business. By paying attention to important cues during this period, you will see what’s important bubble up and gain insights on where to go. During this phase at WP Engine, we learned our partners wanted more education on WordPress and on our platform to help grow their business. As a result, we focused on creating world-class educational programs featuring videos, webinars and interactive content as a priority for our partners over other programmatic or unique incentive-based programs.

Let The Data Tell The Story

I am human, and because of that, I draw assumptions and conclusions based on prior experience and emotional cues. While that can lead to great instinctive business decisions, it can also presume answers, at times, that may not have a macro perspective. Knowing this, I became a data hound pretty early in my career. I began to realize the importance of understanding the story the data tells as much as understanding the data itself. It is always good to trust your gut instincts and common sense, but also trust what data is telling you -- it is pure, honest and provides a viewpoint void of emotion. If you have sufficient data, you won’t need to make risky decisions and it will help tell you where to focus your efforts.

At WP Engine we actively use data to help grow the use of open source technology within enterprise companies. Using data, we can identify agency and enterprise market segments that are forward thinking with their martech stack and what their adoption curve rate may be. Advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) will help further the use of data and will make a personalized and predictive approach even greater.

Don’t Hire An Infantry, Invest In Special Forces

When you implement marketing strategies that take place programmatically, you free up human resources for higher value partnerships. When building strategic partnerships, a common misconception is the need to bring in an infantry for multiple revenue channels. If you have a direct sales force, that can be complicated and can create channel conflict inside and outside your company.

A more efficient way is to hire special forces within the partner program. Make them the ones who enable your existing infantry to engage at the ground level while your special forces develop the program, complete any recon that is needed and make impactful, actionable but focused changes.

If you try to drive change using sheer force in numbers, you’re going to end up wasting time. If you hire people who are highly trained, experienced in their specific field and diplomatic, they're going to be able to make a much more meaningful impact.

Focus On Relationships That Mirror Your Core Values

The biggest way to derail a partnership is when your core values, as companies and as people, are misaligned. Even if, as with most partnerships, your mutual outcome is scalable growth and revenue, if your goals and objectives aren't aligned, you won’t reach the desired result. For example, when I approach successful partnerships I don’t view revenue as the goal, just the outcome. The goal should be more aligned with what the mutual benefit to end customers from the partnership is, which will lead to higher revenue, efficient use of resources and other intangible results.

Consider the following: If one company values leads with an average order size of $50,000 or more and another company is focused on purpose-driven engagement and the two companies can not align on those two goals, they’ll never be aligned as they go to market together. You first have to establish a mutual understanding by acknowledging how purpose-driven engagements generate leads and opportunities and how that will meet the needs of the average order size desired. If you don’t align yourselves based on information you’ve acquired in the initial phases, you’re not going to have successful relationships.

Successful partner programs are a game changer for organizations looking to scale and grow. Preparing the right foundation for success will help a company exponentially grow and bring more value to their customers. Using these four strategies lays the groundwork for that foundation and future success.","Using the following four pillars in business partnerships, you can build this foundation, allowing the relationship skyscraper to take shape and grow.

During the World Bank-IMF Spring Meetings, some civil society organizations called for the World Bank Group to stop supporting client countries with public-private partnerships. I would like to explain how we are involved in PPPs and why they can help countries make important advances toward the Sustainable Development Goals.

But first, some context: The World Bank Group — and our counterpart multilateral development banks — are fully committed to helping countries achieve the SDGs. The scale and ambition of these goals require new solutions, greater collaboration, and a global partnership that includes public authorities, civil society, communities, and the private sector — as a source of financing, innovation, and expertise.

Government budgets and aid alone cannot ensure that everyone gets access to sanitation, water, and electricity. To accomplish this, we must maximize finance for development from all possible sources, including the private sector, which can offer effective development solutions, not just financing.

While governments are in the driver’s seat in determining where they could use more assistance and how to go about it, we can help them build capacity to work with new partners and ensure that these efforts help their people most in need.

There are many ways that governments crowdsource ingenuity, management capacity, and financing from private firms, with PPPs being just one approach they can use. Fundamentally, PPPs represent a procurement technique that can be useful in some circumstances.

We think we can do more good by working with partners to ensure that well-designed PPPs help more people get better access to services.

In Senegal recently, a competitive auction under the group’s Scaling Solar program saw a winning bid of just 3.8 euro cents per kilowatt-hour. PPP will provide one of the cheapest sources of electricity in sub-Saharan Africa, showing how the energy price can be lowered significantly by taking a new approach. This is good for electricity consumers, good for the environment, and good for Senegal’s reputation as an investment destination. And it is an important step toward meeting the SDGs.

PPPs can involve the private sector in making public services more sustainable, as well as more efficient and cost-effective. In India’s Odisha state, an IFC-supported PPP has upgraded street lighting while cutting energy consumption by up to 80 percent, a win both for the environment and strapped municipal budgets. In the West Bank, an IFC-structured PPP has transformed how the government deals with solid waste — eliminating burning and dumping, closing 19 unsanitary landfills, and recovering materials for recycling. This project will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 13,000 tons by 2021 and provide 840,000 people with better services in a cleaner environment.

However, PPP procurement needs to be well-prepared and well-executed, and recent auditor reports from the European Commission and the United Kingdom have illustrated problems in some cases. For example, some lacked proper scrutiny about whether a PPP or public procurement was the better choice. There have been issues in structuring and managing some contracts.

For our part, the World Bank Group can distill valuable lessons and best practices quickly, then share this knowledge, enabling our clients to learn from each other. Working with development partners, we have also developed tools to help governments, citizens, CSOs, and investors make informed decisions about infrastructure programs in general, including PPPs.

Last week we issued the Procuring Infrastructure PPPs 2018 report, covering 135 countries. It acknowledges gaps between best practice and current reality. Take disclosure, for example, disclosing the infrastructure pipeline — the basis for choosing to use PPP procurement, the PPP contract, and contract performance — builds trust and accountability. Yet only 14 percent of countries disclose contract performance. The World Bank Group is helping change that: In just the past few months, we have worked with Ghana, Honduras, and Nigeria to build their PPP disclosure portals.

Another concern is the fiscal impact of PPPs, including contingent liabilities. To help on this front, we have worked with the International Monetary Fund to develop the PPP Fiscal Risk Assessment Model as an important decision-making tool.

Government capacity is also a key issue. Together with partners, we have developed a rigorous PPP certification course, which over 1,100 people have passed since its release 18 months ago. And we have collaborated on a project preparation platform, Source, to help collate information on over 180 potential infrastructure projects in 44 countries.

The World Bank Group promotes project standardization wherever feasible. This can make a big difference — simple checklists dramatically reduced mistakes in the airline industry from the 1980s onwards. There is scope to take a similar approach with infrastructure project preparation.

Much more can be done. Governance and capacity challenges affect all public services, whether delivered publicly or with private sector involvement. This is not about who provides a service, but who can best reach people with quality, affordable services. By working together — governments, citizens, the development community, CSOs, the private sector, and lenders — we can accelerate expansion and improvement in services. Again, here the aim is that countries achieve the SDGs for 2030. Time is short and the needs are great.

As Senegal’s solar plant comes online, a mother will switch on a light to help her daughter with homework — with a solar PPP providing the cheapest electricity in the country. These efforts have a real impact in improving lives.","The World Bank Group's Scaling Solar program in Senegal.

Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are a powerful organizing vehicle for taking on challenges and realizing opportunities — with the potential to transform cities, industries and societies toward smarter and more sustainable models.

PPPs are perhaps best known for facilitating formal collaborations to deliver hard infrastructure and development projects — think roads, bridges, bike trails and urban real estate developments.

Increasingly, ""PPP"" refers to both formal and informal collaborations between public and private players to develop all manner of local and regional ""infrastructure,"" including for energy procurement, communications, integrated mobility, economic development, greenspace maintenance, waste-reduction, citizen empowerment and more. In some cases, PPPs are set up as platforms to generate a series of such projects.

Joel Makower, Mark Mykleby, and Patrick Doherty in ""The New Grand Strategy"" aptly observed: ""Public-private partnerships, once considered a wonky novelty, are now becoming a necessity, both for governments and for private companies.""

The first decisions on your roadmap are: What is your project, who are the partners, what would each get out of it?

During the last century, the United States built its wealth supplying the acute demand for security across the globe in the form of conflict technologies and systems. Today’s opportunity is to build wealth by supplying the increasingly acute demand for a security more domestic in nature.

Research in ""The New Grand Strategy"" found three huge demand pools which give shape to this century’s demand: walkable communities, regenerative agriculture and resource productivity. Meeting these demands will require sustainability-driven designs, technologies and systems, with many realized only through public-private partnership.

Ultimately, quality of life is the core market driver at play here. Predicted Robert Sadow, co-founder and CEO of partner-centric Scoop Technologies — a company that brings commuters together in carpools by partnering with employers, municipalities and more — ""PPPs will be helpful in most areas that impact quality of life. So, it’s a good model for lots of types of businesses trying to address human problems.""

From formal to informal

Public-private partnerships range from very formally structured PPP platforms to informal collaborations where private companies address issues of public concern with or without contracted collaboration.

My colleague Paul Masson, a long-time practitioner of PPP design, outlined for me the broad range of public-private collaboration:

Operating partnerships: public and private players coordinate doing what they already do, with minimal special arrangement.

Advisory committees: policy partnerships that evolve the operational relationship between public and private players — for example, to integrate innovation into a regulated industry.

Project partnerships: specific and bounded efforts which involve a commitment to sharing responsibilities, rights, costs and benefits.

Strategic partnerships: often multi-project programs generating impacts over a long period of time.

The latter two partnership styles sometimes employ a membership model as an organizing structure where partners join a nonprofit organization, governance is handled through a board, and task forces are formed to conduct the work and make technical decisions.

Passionate players

At the GreenBiz 18 forum in Phoenix, a circle of passionate players gathered to help me launch this exploration into the state of the art of PPPs. They seek or operate public-private partnership for objectives ranging from: making commute carpooling work at scale (Scoop); to enhancing the sustainability partnership between cities and their small business communities (SuperGreen Solutions); to making movies ""without making a mess"" (Earth Angel). Others were facilitating circular resource exchanges (Eco-Efficiency Center) and seeking collaboration platforms to help evolve policy (Pepsico). I myself have been involved in PPPs ranging from functional sidewalk gardens organized by Friends of the Urban Forest (FUF); to the Cool Block citizen empowerment platform I helped create; to the global City Protocol Task Force I previously chaired.

Beyond our circle, participants at GreenBiz 18 were pursuing public-private projects far afield. For example, Sealed Air is working successfully with WWF and others across China’s changing poultry supply chain to address food waste and safety issues, with plans to engage the Chinese government.

In addition, many varied infrastructure-related PPPs are at play closer to home:

Partnership-generating platforms are popping up as well. These include Envision Charlotte’s public-private-plus collaborative in North Carolina’s largest city; Salt Lake City’s Envision Utah smart-growth coalition; Spokane, Washington’s smart-city technology proving ground Urbanova; and Kansas City, Missouri’s innovative KCMO Smart City platform.

How PPPs play in cities

Public-private partnerships have a big role to play in the realization of smart, sustainable cities.

""The nonprofit organization we formed helps facilitate the articulation of city goals, and the process of exploring how to get there,"" reported Amy Aussieker, executive director of Envision Charlotte, a highly successful PPP which began as a project and became strategic. ""Envision could have wrapped up after the success of its first project. But the platform was so successful that [the city and its partners] wanted more."" How are people using the PPP language in other cities? Its leaders were asked to help jumpstart public-private collaboration in other cities through an Envision America workshop. So, how are people using the PPP language in other cities? ""It’s all over the board,"" observed Aussieker. ""It applies to toll roads, but people use it to describe all kinds of things they are doing, though they are not all formal or contracted.""

Gordon Feller, co-founder and convener of Meeting of the Minds, an annual leadership summit on urban innovation in smart and sustainable cities, concurred. ""Some PPPs are governed by regulation in their country: an agency works with a private company to operate an asset, and there are financial and legal obligations attached to that."" But, he said, informal partnerships ""are increasingly being developed by innovators to respond to situations happening very locally."" In this category ""there is a wider variety of actors and arrangements."" Still, said Feller, ""We’re seeing principles of PPPs relevant in the informal settings as well.""

""The reason public-private collaboration is critical is that the smart city landscape is a multiplayer landscape. It’s not [simply] suppliers and customers. So, it is truly important to discover how they can work together,"" explained Sokwoo Rhee, leader of the Global City Teams Challenge at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). ""This topic is very timely. It needs to be discussed and improved.""

Preparing the play space

A successful PPP envisions an impactful and collaborative objective, defines a changed game with risks and rewards that will allow the vision to manifest, then plays the game fairly, well and together. This can be a great challenge — and a great opportunity.

The Urban Land Institute (ULI), long-time leaders in tracking the success of hard infrastructure and real estate PPPs, grounds the task with 10 core principles (PDF) to get public-private collaboration off to a sound start. It also offers definitions, tips, and more recently has described nine success practices through its Public/Private Partnership Council (PPPC). Meanwhile, community-based PPPs for green infrastructure projects are the expertise of the EPA, which offers this guide (PDF).

But are there playbooks for how to create PPPs for the wider range of objectives and ""infrastructures""? What about for creating and operating the partnership-generating platforms that are emerging in smart cities? Would having playbooks here be helpful? Or might they actually impede creative collaboration?

""Successful PPPs provide a framework that others can use without being bound to,"" reassured Meeting of the Mind’s Feller. Envision Charlotte’s Aussieker agreed: ""Shedding light makes it better.""

NIST’s Rhee underscored the point: ""It definitely won’t impede.""

There will be partner misalignments, each side trying to figure it out at the same time.

And what would a PPP playbook entail? ""What’s interesting is to have examples of structures and results,"" said Aussieker. Agreed Rhee: ""Having playbooks are helpful if based on real-world successes, which have worked in multiple cities, and they are happy. This is not easy.""

Where to begin? ""The first decisions on your roadmap are: What is your project, who are the partners, what would each get out of it?"" noted Aussieker. ""You’re always going to have these questions. But the answers change from phase to phase. How did you get all these partners together? How did you get them rowing in the same direction? This is an immensely interesting topic.""

Rob Sadow of Scoop underscored the challenges. ""There will be partner misalignments, each side trying to figure it out at the same time."" He emphasized a powerful heuristic, useful to weave through any playbook: ""Be patient. Keep an open mind and seek first to understand.""

In the coming months, we’ll learn from players who are partnering across sectors in creative ways — especially within cities. Along the way, playbooks may gather or emerge, illuminating the art and science of building public-private play spaces. The more businesses and their potential public partners understand PPPs, the better. For the challenges and opportunities ahead are vast and invigorating.","This article is the first in a series on the role of public-private partnerships in realizing smart, sustainable cities, systems and industries.

Rusty Frank, Secretary of the Air Force Public Affairs / Published May 29, 2018

WASHINGTON (AFNS) -- The Air Force educates and trains more than 11,800 international partner air force members each year. Historically, enlisted airmen have made up a relatively small subset of this total. But the U.S. Air Force believes there is an opportunity to apply the world-class skills and expertise of the enlisted corps far more effectively to international partnering efforts.



The International Enlisted Engagements Program seeks to do just that, while also supporting the Air Force’s priorities of strengthening international relationships and building global airpower capabilities, using enlisted engagement as a tool for achieving security cooperation objectives.



“One of the goals of this enlisted engagement is to assist our partner nations with enlisted development while also developing culturally competent Airmen within our own forces,” said Chief Master Sgt. of the Air Force Kaleth O. Wright. “It’s part of our talent management plan, helping to build a well-equipped, professional corps or international senior enlisted leaders who are able to lead their forces in the advancement of national and international strategic objectives and interests.”



U.S. Air Force senior noncommissioned officers are employed as strategists to develop requirements and implementation plans for engagement with specific partner forces. IEE program activities are designed to establish and promote mutual trust and respect among participants, and to facilitate information sharing among partner personnel.



Success factors include the degree of interoperability between U.S. and partner airmen as well as partner forces’ responsiveness and collaboration with the U.S. Air Force during future coalition operations.



“IEE provides a unique opportunity to foster the enlisted development of partner nation militaries,” said Senior Master Sgt. Jennifer Johnson, Air Force international enlisted engagements manager. “We are constantly learning of new opportunities for cooperating with partners and then evaluating those against U.S. and (Defense Department) priorities to determine what we should move out on.”



“There is no doubt that our enlisted force is the most professional and capable force in the world,” Wright said. “Sharing that with our partners while capitalizing on unique opportunities to foster the enlisted development of our Airmen and those of our partner nation militaries is vital to carrying out our national security strategy.”



There are three IEE positions Air Force-wide. However, Johnson said the service will add another by the end of 2018, and will look to continue adding positions where they can benefit the Major Command and Combatant Command Senior Enlisted Leaders. Since its inception in 2015, 11 SNCOs have participated in the IEE program.



“This job is challenging and incredibly fast-paced,” Johnson said. “But it’s also thrilling, because we’re enabling the Air Force to break new ground with so many international partners and enlisted Airmen are front and center.”

John McCain was serving up a heaping of the straight talk for which he’s become known: “The DoD’s relationship with Silicon Valley … will be one of these disgraceful chapters that will be written about. That’s where the innovators are, sir.”

Time will tell whether James “Hondo” Geurts takes McCain’s advice and heads out to Silicon Valley in his capacity as the new assistant secretary of the Navy for research, development, and acquisition. But make no mistake, time is of the essence.

The commanding technological lead the United States possessed over its adversaries during much of the 20th century has, by Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis’ own admission, eroded in every domain of warfare. Today, the United States struggles to keep pace with foes capable of rapid progress. If it does not triage the technological slippage and begin attracting new partnerships in the commercial sector, the highest-budgeted defense force in the world will be outmaneuvered by adversaries with fewer resources who leverage commercial research with speed and agility.

An innovative pivot inside the Pentagon would be best served by engaging startups early to shape the development of cutting-edge, and often dual-use, technologies. Past American defense success with commercial sector partnerships and recent Chinese successes with startup investments provide anecdotal evidence that defense partnerships are best formed directly. Moreover, a wide body of academic literature indicates that direct relationships between the Defense Department and the commercial industrial are critical to defense innovation.

To regain America’s technological superiority, the Defense Department should harness the power of U.S. startups by developing an understanding of the startup landscape and aligning defense incentives to help these companies achieve their goals. This will position the Pentagon to gain early access to game-changing technologies before its adversaries while positioning startups to gain access to the Defense Department’s unrivaled resources.

A Historical Advantage Lost

In the past, the Department of Defense was highly effective at sourcing innovation and innovative minds from the non-defense world. During World War II, when the U.S. government realized it needed an external innovation pipeline to secure force-multiplying capabilities, it did something unprecedented: It hired civilian scientists to work on defense-related problems. While the United States has contracted civilians since the Revolutionary War, the establishment of Vannevar Bush’s Office of Scientific Research and Development was the first formalized effort to inject civilian scientist technological know-how into the Defense Department. Bush’s office was responsible for nearly all wartime military R&D including starting the Manhattan Project, and effectively establishing electronic warfare. Civilian scientists were so successful in helping the government achieve its objectives that the Office of Scientific Research and Development became the National Science Foundation in 1950. Later, during the Cold War, the government once again sourced outside innovation by mobilizing commercial industry to develop satellites and precision-guided munitions enabling the United States to see and accurately hit targets beyond the horizon. This “deep strike” capability was insurmountable by other countries and renewed America’s strategy of deterrence against the numerically preponderant Soviet Union.

Today, the Defense Department undervalues the commercial sector. To illustrate, the Defense Department spent roughly $62 billion on defense R&D and $101 billion on procurements in 2015. In comparison, U.S. businesses spent $345 billion on commercial R&D in 2015, supplemented by the roughly $70 billion U.S. venture capitalists put up in funding. In the 21st century, American adversaries have made better use of the commercial sector than the United States resulting in parity and overmatch.

After witnessing the United States employ commercial technologies such as GPS, satellites, and precision-guidance components during the Cold War, China, Russia, and North Korea followed suit, enabling them to match America’s once-insurmountable “deep strike” capability. More recently, Russia employed commercial drones to great advantage against Ukraine while China uses commercial products for digital radio frequency memory jamming. Even non-state actors like ISIL use commercial off-the-shelf drones and encryption software to gain an asymmetric advantage against U.S. forces.

The savviest adversaries have gone beyond merely acquiring and deploying cutting-edge commercial technologies by investing in early-stage startups to shape the development of those products before they even make it to market. The Chinese government, for example, committed $150 billion dollars toward developing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. Consequently, China has become the world’s largest investor in AI, investing in Silicon Valley startups with the aim of using American commercial innovations to advance its own national security agenda.

Chinese companies bolster the government’s effort as Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and JD.com alone have invested $5.6 billion in 48 U.S. startups over the past two years. Some of the U.S. startups they invested in are Airbnb, Uber, and Lyft, as well as lesser known Magic Leap, a virtual reality startup, the mobile safety company TrustGo, and mapping company Atlas. Chinese investment in American startups working on defense-related technologies has sent the Trump Administration, Congress, and the Intelligence Community into a collective frenzy. Senator Mark Warner has been especially vocal about China’s use of the U.S. commercial sector to accelerate its technological progress, and the ramifications such engagement could have for American national security.

While China is busy influencing product development through early investments, the Defense Department remains focused on acquiring products. The Pentagon has established several organizations over the last decade to do just that including the Army’s Rapid Equipping Force and the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx). These organizations have made significant progress in expediting government acquisitions. Although a faster acquisitions process is necessary to meeting battlefield needs, these efforts are insufficient for renewing the department’s technological superiority because they emphasize commercial acquisition, while China has a head-start by shaping commercial technology.

The Defense Department needs a pivot on the magnitude of the OSRD during World War II. Understanding the startup landscape and aligning defense incentives to startup needs is critical to realizing the relatively untapped opportunity that startups represent to national security

In a previous War on the Rocks article, Joshua Israel made a compelling argument that the Department of Defense should forge relationships with startup accelerators to gain access to early-stage startup ideas and technologies. It’s true that such engagement can be fruitful, but accelerators are a relatively new phenomenon. There is little empirical analysis on the impacts accelerators have on the startups and the broader ecosystem. The scant research that does exist is mixed, arguing that accelerators can have both positive and negative impacts on startup growth.

Understanding the Startup Landscape

A startup, by definition, is “a human institution designed to create new products and services under conditions of extreme uncertainty.” “Uncertainty” is a critical word here that represents both risk and opportunity since startups are working on unproven products. A Defense Department that can dampen risk and intensify opportunity for startups working on defense-relevant products will gain access to technologies before its competitors. Although early investment is risky for the Defense Department to take on, small early investments may be less risky and costly than acquiring technologies through the lengthy acquisitions process that may render the capabilities obsolete by the time they are deployed.

With early access to paradigm-shifting technologies, the department will be better able to influence how the products are developed and ultimately employed for defense purposes. Done correctly, a startup-Defense Department partnership would be mutually beneficial. The Pentagon would capture more commercial innovation earlier than any other actor, which will allow it to renew its technological superiority. Meanwhile, startups would gain access to incentives they could find nowhere else. To facilitate this partnership, the Defense Department must understand the startup ecosystem and the resources startups need to form viable companies.

The simplest way for the Defense Department to understand the needs of startups is to understand the first four rounds of startup funding: Seed, Series A, Series B, and Series C. The earlier the round, the less mature the company, which translates to greater risk and opportunity for the Pentagon.

The Seed round is where startups have what they believe to be a good idea and little else. A Seed round startup strives to prove that its idea solves a problem customers are willing to pay for. This is called “product-solution fit.” Series A startups move beyond product-solution fit, seeking to demonstrate that their product’s value meets the needs of targeted customers, or “product-market fit.” Product-market fit is signaled through growth in the number of users a product has and the amount of revenue it generates. To succeed, Series A startups search for early customers (a.k.a. “early adopters”) who are willing to use early, often incomplete or faulty, versions of their product to gain the feedback needed to improve that product. Startups in the Series B round aim to do three things: 1) solidify product-market fit; 2) expand into new market segments; and 3) experiment with different revenue streams. Critical to accomplishing each of these three tasks is providing evidence, gained through test cases, that the product is effective. Startups then perfect their product and focus on large-scale growth to new markets in the Series C round.

Aligning Defense Incentives with Startup Needs

Funding round stages indicate which milestones startups are working to overcome and the resources needed to overcome them. The key to making the Defense Department valuable to startups is recognizing which stage companies are in and aligning defense incentives to helping startups overcome the obstacles they face during that stage. Recently, a Sand Hill Road venture capitalist told me that he advises his portfolio companies against going to the Defense Department because success is a “crapshoot” due to lengthy award schedules and an obscure process. However, the value that DIUx has added to early-stage startups (less than 5 percent of its award portfolio), like Saildrone, Joby Aviation, and SHIELD AI, suggests that an alignment of incentives with a startups lifecycle would be highly valuable for both defense and startups. A Defense Department that can help startups through the funding rounds will be viewed as a valuable partner, which in turn will incentivize startups to pursue the defense marketplace.

The Pentagon can use five important incentives to target technology startups at different stages of the funding process.

First, it can offer early-stage startups non-dilutive financial support, or support that doesn’t involve taking an equity stake in the company. In private funding, investors seek to minimize risk by investing in startups and taking equity. If the startup succeeds, so do the investors. As such, private investment comes with an ownership cost. A Defense Department investment is different in that it does not equate to “buying” a portion of the company. Success for defense is developing a quality product that solves warfighter needs, not generating revenue, so government funding does not dilute the startup’s equity. Non-dilutive defense investment is a huge deal for startups because it signals an increase in valuation without affecting ownership. Working with the department early could also drive down risk for startups as high governmental switching costs make it likely that the government would give repeat business to companies already initiated into its system.

Second, the Defense Department has unparalleled resources and qualifications that could accelerate a startup’s growth, especially in the Seed and Series A rounds. For example, the government has ranges where drones and counter-drone products can be tested safely, which are tough to come by in the commercial sector. The department also possesses unique resources such as massive datasets that could be used to train cybersecurity algorithms and vast mock networks in which they can be tested. In addition, the government can accelerate the 3- to 5-year patent application process to less than a year by labeling the patent application as being a national security priority. Possessing patents is valuable for attracting private funding.

Third, the Pentagon can serve as an early adopter and a test case to demonstrate the value of a startup’s product. This is valuable for Series A and B startups. The department’s large budget and mission focus make it less sensitive to early failures than commercial customers and private investors. Startups often have difficulty finding customers to test their product and provide meaningful feedback that is used to improve it. The military is well positioned to provide feedback at a scale much larger than the commercial sector, which can accelerate the time needed to produce a valuable product. Data from a Defense Department test case along with a partnership with the Pentagon will together amount to a government “seal of approval,” which dampens risk and signals viability and market demand to commercial investors like venture capitalists.

Fourth, working with the U.S. military can help truly innovative startups get a head start on future commercial markets before they emerge. The Defense Department often faces problems before they become commercial concerns. Cybersecurity, drones, and counter drones were all relevant to the defense sector before the commercial markets for them were established. For example, Boeing subsidiary Insitu helped the Defense Department tackle intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance challenges with its drone ScanEagle and now has a leg up in the commercial market monitoring wildfires to help firefighters. Similarly, SHIELD AI was only able to raise funding from venture capitalists after a 2016 DIUx award signaled that there was a potential market for autonomous drones capable of mapping the interior of structures.

Finally, the Department of Defense represents a huge and lucrative market which can be critical to later-stage startups, like those in Series C, looking for large-scale growth in new customer segments and markets. The department is the largest employer in the world and has a budget greater than the total revenue of all Fortune 50 companies combined. The defense marketplace will give startups more access to people with the authority to write large checks. An added benefit is that the Defense Department offers larger margins to suppliers than commercial enterprises do. Additionally, the Pentagon can serve as a stepping stone to the broader U.S. government, and allied countries, where budgets are even larger.

How Can the ‘Disgraceful Chapter’ Be Rewritten?

In a word: partnership. Startups and the Defense Department are both hell-bent on surviving. The Pentagon needs innovative technology to bolster national defense. Startups need to raise capital to develop a valuable product. Both can use each other’s needs and comparative advantages for mutual gain, which will tie startups’ progress — and therefore, their success — to Defense Department innovation. Framing the startup-defense relationship around a partnership forces the Pentagon to consider the value it can add to the commercial sector while also giving clear, revenue-driven motivation for engaging with the defense marketplace.

History has shown that the commercial sector is vital to defense innovation. This remains the case in the 21st century. Initiating commercial partnerships with startups is a good place for the Pentagon to start, especially since early-stage, capital-hungry startups are unlikely to experience the existential crises that hinder Silicon Valley partnerships with the major tech giants today (e.g. Google and Project Maven). The Pentagon should begin reaching out to defense-relevant startups and forming partnerships immediately. It has worked for China. It will work for the United States. Time is of the essence.

Moreover, a wide body of academic literature indicates that direct relationships between the Defense Department and the commercial industrial are critical to defense innovation.
To illustrate, the Defense Department spent roughly $62 billion on defense R&D and $101 billion on procurements in 2015.
The Defense Department needs a pivot on the magnitude of the OSRD during World War II.
A Defense Department investment is different in that it does not equate to “buying” a portion of the company."

16 May 2018

GENEVA, 16 May 2018—On the International Day against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia (IDAHOT), UNAIDS is calling for strengthened partnerships to support lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people and their families living with or affected by HIV or facing discrimination.

“Stigma, discrimination and social and physical violence against sexual and gender minorities prevent them from accessing health services,” said Michel Sidibé, Executive Director of UNAIDS. “Everyone has the right to health, no matter their gender or sexual orientation. For that, we need zero discrimination for everyone, everywhere.”

Gay men and other men who have sex with men and transgender women are among the populations most affected by HIV worldwide.

More than 40% of the 100 countries responding to UNAIDS criminalize same-sex relationships. Criminalizing people because of their gender or sexual orientation drives people underground and out of reach of essential health and social services, making them vulnerable to poor health and homelessness.

To end AIDS, it is essential to ensure that people can access HIV prevention technologies, including condoms and PrEP, and quality HIV treatment and care free from discrimination. UN Women, the United Nations Development Programme and UNAIDS are working with the Global Network of People Living with HIV to end all forms of HIV-related stigma and discrimination. The initiative will require rapid multisectoral support and civil society leadership and will contribute to achieving the time-bound commitments of United Nations Member States to end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.

Increasing political commitment and investments for the health and well-being of some of the most vulnerable people in society will help to ensure that no one is left behind.

IDAHOT, a worldwide celebration of sexual and gender diversity, is commemorated annually on 17 May. This year’s theme is alliances for solidarity to bring respect for LGBTI people and their families.

UNAIDS

The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) leads and inspires the world to achieve its shared vision of zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths. UNAIDS unites the efforts of 11 UN organizations—UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP, UNDP, UNFPA, UNODC, UN Women, ILO, UNESCO, WHO and the World Bank—and works closely with global and national partners towards ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030 as part of the Sustainable Development Goals.

69,https://www.skyword.com/contentstandard/how-lebron-james-uses-smart-business-partnerships-to-write-his-own-brand-story/,"Wed, 30 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Content Standard by Skyword,How LeBron James Uses Smart Business Partnerships to Write His Own Brand Story,"It’s easy to shrug off LeBron James’ business empire as a product of his on-the-court achievements. As the best player in the NBA and one of the great athletes the world has ever seen, it seems logical that he would wield enormous influence and a raft of business initiatives generated by his wealth and notoriety.

The reality is a little more complicated. While professional athletes have regular access to lucrative business opportunities, James’ empire goes beyond the traditional template of generating wealth through multi-year endorsement deals with major corporations. Credit the brand story James has carefully been crafting since he entered the NBA at just 18 years old: From the very start, the future Hall of Famer was working to build a singular brand as recognizable as any in the sports world, rivaling signature imprints like Michael Jordan’s “Air Jordan” line of shoes and apparel.

But in recent years, that personal brand has sought to expand beyond static deals that license images, names, and endorsements at a sky-high price. Those deals are still happening, but in a slightly different form: James’ longtime business partner, Maverick Carter, has noted that James and his business group approach such deals as “partnerships.”

“When we started to look at our endorsement deals as partnerships, that is when a lot of it started to click for me,” James told Carter back in 2015. The change in approach reflected a growing preference for business arrangements that made James more intimately involved in the success of certain projects, whether as an investor or in other roles. And it turned James from a corporate marketing vehicle into a business enterprise in his own right-one that, through shrewd decision-making and a savvy long-term strategy, has turned James’ brand story into one of the most valuable assets in sports.

How LeBron Takes the Long View of Brand-Building

Another way to separate business partnerships from endorsement deals is to examine how quickly they generate results. Endorsements are often a quick cash grab: Athletes and other celebrities can sign on the dotted line and start generating income for the length of that agreement. Partnerships, like the kind James prefers at this stage in his career-he’s currently at the end of his fifteenth NBA season-are a bit more complicated. There may be guaranteed money, but there are other business goals being sought, including goals that may be dependent on the success of that partnership.

This increased risk likely comes with increased potential earnings if the partnership proves successful, especially if James has a role as an executive or investor in addition to his public-facing role as a brand endorser.

Partnerships of this nature can be difficult to find, because there are many hurdles to clear. First, for someone like James, there needs to be a significant financial opportunity somewhere down the line. And because James is a brand himself-and each business partnership can affect that brand story in both good and bad ways-each deal entered into must be scrutinized closely.

A perfect example of James’ brand-building strategy is the choice he made between partnering with McDonald’s or Blaze Pizza. In 2010, James signed an endorsement deal with the McDonald’s brand, eventually earning around $4 million annually through the relationship. But in 2015, James declined an option to extend the deal, leaving up to $15 million on the table.

Instead, he took his endorsement influence and gave it to Blaze Pizza, a restaurant chain he had invested in back in 2012. At the time, Blaze Pizza’s earnings were a slim fraction of what McDonald’s offered and carried hardly any of the brand recognition offered by the golden arches. But the switch from a fast-food business to a pizza chain was a better fit for James’ personal brand. At the same time, it gave James a chance to play a more integral role in the success of one of his investments: With an ownership stake of more than 10 percent in Blaze Pizza, James had a chance to earn more from that partnership than what he could have made as a celebrity endorser with McDonald’s.

That earning potential isn’t guaranteed, although Blaze Pizza has been doing well on the business end of things: The company’s sales grew by 83 percent over the previous fiscal year, rising to $185 million. James used the business deal to improve the image of his personal brand while integrating himself deeper into better business opportunities.

And with every business deal he makes, James brings another critical asset to the table: The largest social following in the sports world.

Creating the Biggest Social Platform in Sports

Recent business deals have underscored James’ savvy when it comes to cashing in on emerging opportunities. He launched his own online media production company called Uninterrupted, and through that company teamed with Oculus to create virtual reality content just as the immersive technology was reaching the mainstream. James also has a TV production company producing game shows, sitcoms, documentaries, and other content at a time when original content is in higher demand than ever before.

When it comes to those business deals, James almost always seeks an ownership stake of some kind to increase the earning potential of his endorsement. And with his endorsements come a massive social media branding opportunity-one James has deftly used to serve business ends. According to Crain’s, as of last August James had 93.3 million followers combined across Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. That figure nearly triples the numbers of the second-biggest social following in US professional sports: Fellow NBA star Stephen Curry has 35.4 million followers combined.

That huge following is a boon for brands wanting to squeeze as much value from their endorsement deals as possible. But Crain’s notes that it isn’t necessarily the volume of followers that matters to James’ social influence: His social media engagement is off the charts. Over a one-year span, Crain’s found that James generated nearly 96 million video views and interactions through social media, an average of 116,551 interactions per post. Those numbers are a gold mine for underscoring the sheer reach and influence James has over his followers. No other sports figure can touch that sort of social ROI. And he’s been able to maintain this high social engagement through a mix of exclusive content-such as footage showing him working out, sharing his opinion on recent events, or practicing dunks in the gym-while also promoting the enterprises he’s currently engaged with.

Just got to Chicago and @BlazePizza sounds so amazing to me right now! May have to make a stop in there! ð ð – LeBron James (@KingJames) March 16, 2018

HAPPY #AirMaxDay!!! Which ones will I wear today ð¤ð¤·ð¾ââï¸ð – LeBron James (@KingJames) March 26, 2018



James also isn’t afraid to get political, especially when the subject matter aligns with issues important to him. The consistency of his brand, as well as the personal involvement in nearly everything he shares or discusses on his social accounts, lends a credibility and authenticity to what he does. James isn’t taking a cash-grab from a yogurt company to sell its products: If he’s telling you about something he wants you to check out, it’s because he has a personal stake in it.

Fans and consumers can appreciate that consistency and authenticity, even when they’re rooting for their home team and against James. By gravitating toward partnerships instead of flimsy endorsements, James has become a more trusted influencer, and the business relationships he’s chosen are more reflective of who he is as a person. This is great for his fans, great for his business investments, and great for his personal brand. James used this deeper engagement with businesses and his fan base to take control of his own brand story.

His decisions may not earn universal acclaim-we all remember that time he took his talents to South Beach-but whatever happens, good or bad, is on James’ shoulders.

70,https://www.devex.com/news/facebook-eyes-new-partnerships-to-better-understand-high-risk-areas-92721,"Wed, 09 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Devex,Facebook eyes new partnerships to better understand 'high-risk areas',"WASHINGTON — While Facebook’s growing network has helped “friends” in hard-to-reach places connect with each other, the tech giant has been slow to see the dangers the platform perpetuates in some parts of the world, one of its leaders said Tuesday.

What you need to know from F8: Connecting the unconnected and data for good Facebook is a frequent partner to NGOs working in global health, international development, and humanitarian response. This year's F8 conference had some higher stakes than the organization's annual event in years past, as the social media giant and the organizations it partners with navigate how to handle widespread criticism around privacy and security on the platform.

As Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg works to convince 2 billion users — and United States lawmakers — that the company can address issues related to privacy, disinformation, and hate speech, they also acknowledge they have struggled to understand how people in “high-risk areas” might use the far-reaching online platform “to create real risks of harm and violence,” said Joel Kaplan, Facebook’s vice president for U.S. public policy, at the PeaceTech Summit in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday.

Kaplan said that building more “context-specific” knowledge represents an opportunity for Facebook to partner with organizations with experience in places such as Myanmar or South Sudan where these kinds of abuses have occurred.

“Even as our platform has grown, we haven’t had people on the ground in some of the most high-risk areas,” Kaplan said.

“I think those are really valuable opportunities for collaboration for you all to help us understand not just what’s happening right now in high-risk countries, but what might happen, and how people might use our platform in a context-specific way to create real risks of harm and violence. Those are the opportunities that we have to really work together,” he told an audience of people working at the intersection of technology and peace building.

“What we’ve learned over the last couple of years … is that we haven’t spent enough time or invested enough in thinking about the ways in which our platform could be abused and the harms that could result from that.”

— Joel Kaplan, Facebook’s vice president for U.S. public policy

In Myanmar, where Facebook partnered with local telecommunications companies to provide free access to its services, as the number of users grew rapidly so did the amount of online hate speech, largely directed against the country’s Muslim minority. Reports emerged earlier this month that Facebook quietly pulled its “Free Basics” internet access program from the country last year. In India and Malaysia, Facebook has taken out full-page ads warning about misinformation, and in Kenya, reports have surfaced that Cambridge Analytica abused Facebook data to influence last year’s presidential election.

Kaplan said that part of the problem is that Facebook’s innovators have been more focused on creating new tools than they have been on imagining how those tools could be misused.

“The people who come to work at these companies, that’s not how they’re hardwired. That’s not what they want to think about. They want to think about building all these cool new tools,” he said, adding that as Facebook’s leadership has focused on mitigating risks, it has created a shift inside the company.

“What we’ve learned over the last couple of years … is that we haven’t spent enough time or invested enough in thinking about the ways in which our platform could be abused and the harms that could result from that. There’s an element of that that’s due to Silicon Valley idealism and optimism. Some of it is due to the fact that we just grew really fast, from Mark’s dorm room in 2004 to a service that connected 2 billion people,” Kaplan said.","What you need to know from F8: Connecting the unconnected and data for good Facebook is a frequent partner to NGOs working in global health, international development, and humanitarian response.

Being honest with yourself about your reasons and goals will help you make the right choice, says Graeme Sanford.

This article was sponsored by Sanford Partnership to outline and explore the effective management of global campaigns.

Marketers constantly need to rethink their relationships with advertising agencies and consultancies. They need to get the correct brand message and overall strategy out there.

There used to be a big difference between advertising agencies and the large consultancies but now the two groups are starting to look more like each other. Furthermore, big brands like CUB are bringing many capabilities in-house, leading to the emergence of in-house agencies as a resource to drive marketing decisions.

In-house capabilities

The new landscape is largely driven by marketers’ desire to enhance their range of expertise to assist in their ever-expanding responsibilities.

In the recent ‘Make your in-house agency your digital agency’ report, a Forrester analyst recommends CMOs bring the digital capabilities they require in-house for four reasons:

Advance digital maturity elevate customer experiences establish transparency and control practices, and detangle the multi-agency melee.

When it comes to creative agencies, however, it recommends leveraging external talent, saying “it’s not easy to replicate or maintain their storytelling expertise and detachment in-house.”

In other words, they bring perspective and creative talent goes stale in-house. “CMOs who attempt to bring brand and creative agencies’ responsibilities in-house deprive their talent of the inspiration that fuels creativity.”

New media, new digital and new data management are all adding to the pressure on CMOs to get results demanded by their various stakeholders. They are looking for something that is new, something that will give them a market advantage. They know their customers are changing, particularly in how they use technology and media, and the data it generates.

Convergence

Generally speaking, large consultancies have focused on improving their clients’ bottom line and have dictated changes to make that happen. Agencies, on the other hand, have traditionally focused on improving marketing and brand metrics such as awareness and brand preference.

Structures are changing, however, for both large consultancies and advertising agencies. Big multinational consultancies take on big global business problems and are gaining work by networking their existing relationships with the C-Suite. We’ve recently seen the likes of Deloitte, PwC and Accenture acquiring companies operating in the advertising space generally, with special attention given to the development of digital capabilities and full-service offerings for clients.

It’d be a mistake to assume, though, that all advertising agencies have been doing over the past decade is selling creative ideas. There are many agencies I know that also address their clients’ business problems, not just the creative development. Good creative agencies “act as a sounding board for their clients’ assumptions,” says the report. They cannot simply hand over a campaign and say ‘off you go’, they must collaborate to develop a rich understanding of the client’s business and their problems before addressing them and creating opportunities. This role of strategic planning within agencies is often to integrate the market and its competition and then develop a particular strategy which can help a client and add value to the business or solve business problems and inspire creative and media teams to produce effective campaigns, in many forms.

Traditional advertising agencies are growing their range of consultative services. M&C Saatchi and Ogilvy now have business consulting offerings. Also, the media proprietors are getting into the game of offering more services with News Corp now nominating itself as a marketing services company.

Consultancies, advertising agencies and media often take the path of buying a company or an individual star performer to expand their range of services. Sometimes it’s because they want that big client or to strengthen their personnel offering. It’s easy if you’ve got the cash resources, but integrating the cultures, personalities and ways of doing things is far more difficult. There’s nothing new about this.

When The Campaign Palace, acknowledged by many as the best creative agency, was bought by Patts, they tried to change its culture and MO – agency personnel left, clients left and ultimately the agency closed.

Where once the results and profits were recognised as the outcome of great creative work, results and profits became the number one goal at the expense of creativity and successful advertising and – ultimately – client business outcomes.

Big consultancies that have ploughed millions into their acquisitions of digital personnel or creative agencies will want their ROI, and quickly. Beware the costs. As well, there is the strategy that the more integrated services a company can offer and sell to their clients, the more difficult it becomes for clients to leave.

The blended model

For those looking to re-vamp their agency model, the Forrester report recommends a blend, curating an in-house agency culture with help from external agencies. Continue to leverage creative agencies for their fresh perspective.

“Creative talent thrives on having diverse brands to work on, collaboration with other creative thinkers, exposure to ideas and unconventional working environments.” On the digital side, this blended model “elevates everyone’s game” by focusing on:

integrating core competencies with internal and external specialists,

re-apportioning accountability, and

taking responsibility for your marketing technology.

So what’s the challenge for marketers choosing between consultancies, agencies, specialist creative, media shops or in-house models? As an ex-client I know marketers need to invest a lot of time in educating their new business partners. Assess your goals and develop a single-minded proposition. What are you trying to achieve? Why are you running the campaign in the first place? These days, a very tight strategic brief is something fantastic.

Be clear with yourself and agency partners. In the case of an advertising campaign, for example, everyone thinks they’re running advertising to sell stuff, but this is not necessarily the case. What you’re really trying to do is influence your buyer – and this doesn’t always mean the end customer. It could be department stores or supermarkets or car dealerships. As a marketer, make sure your retailers, whoever they may be, notices you’re doing a lot to help them sell product.

Finding and judging new agencies is time consuming. While the pitch may reveal a new thought or a creative idea – be it strategic, creative or media – will they offer better service or merely match the incumbent? Will they put their best people on your business? Will your business really matter to them and will they be cost efficient? Can they contribute more than you’re currently getting?

Be honest with yourself. Are you considering a consultancy because of the capabilities they offer? Or are you merely dissatisfied with existing agency partners? There’s a big difference there.

For more than three decades, the Rainforest Alliance has been a leader in the global effort to transform agricultural and forestry supply chains, motivated by the need to stop deforestation, conserve biodiversity, and create a more sustainable future. Now in its thirty-first year, the Rainforest Alliance is pleased to recognize and celebrate the partnerships that have made its legacy of past success possible: the farmers, forest communities, governments, scientists, fellow NGOs, and companies large and small. This year, the Rainforest Alliance also celebrates its recent international merger with UTZ, another global leader in sustainable agriculture, based in the Netherlands.

On May 9th, the Rainforest Alliance will honor these partnerships with a series of awards at its 31st Spring Gala at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.

“The kind of transformational, global work the Rainforest Alliance undertakes would not be possible without the partnerships we have established with forward-thinking, progressive companies,” said Han de Groot, CEO of the Rainforest Alliance. “The individuals, communities, and businesses we have highlighted are diving significant change for the related challenges of climate change, rural poverty, and biodiversity loss. Their work has resulted in real changes on the ground, and is helping to improve conditions for farmers and forest communities.”

During the day on May 9, honorees will join farming community leaders, business leaders, CEOs, and Rainforest Alliance experts at the annual Leadership Summit to discuss challenges and successes in implementing global sustainability and climate goals. Following the summit, participants will gather in the evening for an awards dinner, entertainment, and a silent auction.

Honorary co-chairs for the 2018 Annual Gala are Hilaria and Alec Baldwin. The gala is co-chaired by Rainforest Alliance board members Wendy Gordon and Larry Rockefeller; Maggie Lear and Daniel Katz; Peter Lehner and Fritz Beshar; Juan Esteban Orduz; and Kerri and Drew Smith. The gala is sponsored by Domtar, Nespresso, and Lavazza. Gala proceeds benefit the Rainforest Alliance’s comprehensive, international conservation initiatives.

2018 Community Leadership Award

The Cocoa Farmers of Juabeso-Bia in Ghana

Demonstrating the maxim that there is strength in numbers, the cocoa farmers of the Juabeso and Bia districts in Western Ghana have harnessed that strength by coming together to transform an entire landscape. The members of 34 communities, covering 29 thousand hectares, established a landscape management board to oversee the planning, implementation, and monitoring of sustainable practices on their cocoa farms, and the impacts have been nothing short of remarkable.

Elija Owusu-Cashierkrom, a village elder and cocoa farmer from the region, will accept the award on behalf of the cocoa producers. Elija began working with the Rainforest Alliance six years ago, and his farm has been certified since 2011. Since that time, he has become very conscious of environmental issues, implementing erosion-control measures on his own farm to protect streams, planting trees on fallow land and working actively to increase carbon stocks and build resiliency to climate change.

The Sustainable Standard-Setters

The Sustainable Standard-Setters award recognizes companies who have demonstrated an exceptional commitment to sustainability, improving livelihoods, and conserving forests all around the world.

The Original Bradford Soap Works Company, Inc.

Rhode Island-based Bradford Soap Works is one of the world’s oldest and largest specialty soap manufacturer, and one of the first companies to commit to using 100 percent traceable palm oil. Bradford was the first soap manufacturer to be Certified Organic and the first personal care products manufacturer to offer soap bases using palm oil from Rainforest Alliance Certified™ farms.

Colombian Coffee Growers Federation

Described as possibly the largest rural NGO in the world, the Colombian Coffee Growers Federation has been working since the 1920s to improve the quality of life for more than 540,000 coffee-growing families. As a staunch advocate for rural communities, sustainably grown coffee, and climate change adaptation, the Colombian Coffee Federation stands behind the sustainable agriculture methods of Rainforest Alliance certification. In fact, many of the farmers represented by the Colombian Coffee Growers Federation have achieved Rainforest Alliance certification for their farms.

Volcafe/Kyagalanyi Coffee Ltd.

Uganda’s coffee is grown by more than one million smallholder farmers and is often their most important source of income—but Ugandan coffee yields are among the lowest in the world. Kyagalanyi Coffee, part of the Volcafe group, has been working closely with our new colleagues from the UTZ certification program—and with the Rainforest Alliance—to address these issues through sustainable farming methods.

Kyagalanyi works with over 14,500 UTZ and/or RA certified households that produce Arabica coffee. The company has developed a strong farmer support program, which has increased coffee yields and income for these families by 35-45% in West Nile and 60-70% in Mt. Elgon. Key elements include a focus on continuous improvement and a range of innovative approaches to sustainably improve coffee production, work with youth, encourage joint decision making within households and promote the use of mobile money. Additionally, Kyagalanyi is a vocal leader in the effort to reduce child labor on coffee farms in West Nile. As part of the UTZ Sector Partnership program, Kyagalanyi and its partners are expanding this work to identify cost-efficient strategies to work towards the eradication of child labor in the coffee value chain.

Patagonia

For decades, Patagonia has been recognized as a leader in the outdoor apparel industry for its Earth-focused policies. Because of Patagonia’s deep commitment to sustainability—in sourcing, labor, and resource-use policies—it was no surprise when the company transitioned from neoprene, a petroleum-based insulation, to renewable Rainforest Alliance Certified natural rubber in its popular wetsuits. The new wetsuits outperform the neoprene-based ones, creating a win-win for the company and the environment. The Rainforest Alliance was proud to perform the due diligence to make sure the rubber in the wetsuits met all the sustainability criteria defined by the Forest Stewardship Council.

Sustainability Champion Award

The Thomson Reuters Foundation

The Thomson Reuters Foundation is the philanthropic arm of Thomson Reuters, the world’s biggest news and information provider. Their work in shining a light on underreported stories, such as modern slavery, women’s rights, and climate change and resilience is an important contribution to a fair and informed society.

The Sustainable Pathfinders Award recognizes companies for the work they are doing to advance sustainable practices across their industries. All meaningful change must begin with action, and we applaud those who are fighting strong headwinds to move in the right direction.

New Britain Palm Oil Ltd.

Irresponsible palm oil production is notoriously destructive to forests and the people who live in them. Sime Darby’s New Britain Palm Oil Ltd. in Papua New Guinea broke from the industry norm to improve livelihood opportunities in the region and restore degraded land. It has adopted a process to consult with indigenous peoples on the principle of free, prior, and informed consent—a right guaranteed by the United Nations that allows indigenous peoples to give or withhold consent to a project that may affect them or their territories. New Britain Palm Oil Ltd. has incorporated climate change adaptation and mitigation and measures to improve farmer livelihoods into its business plan, and the company is striving to meet the sustainability guidelines in every area where they work.

McDonald’s

McDonald’s is one of Forbes’ top ten most valuable global brands, serves 69 million customers a day, and has a global footprint that extends from beef, soy, and coffee to tea and packaging. Despite the complexities of such a massive supply chain, McDonald’s has made several meaningful sustainability commitments over the past few years. For example, McDonald’s has pledged to eliminate deforestation from its entire supply chain by 2030, from the fiber used in the paper and paperboard Happy Meal packaging to the palm oil used in its restaurants and as ingredients in foods like baked goods and sauces. McDonald’s has also pledged to serve 100 percent Rainforest Alliance Certified tea in its U.S. restaurants, and 100 percent sustainably sourced coffee globally both by 2020. In 2016, more than half of McDonald’s sustainably sourced coffee came from Rainforest Alliance Certified or UTZ Certified farms. The global restaurant chain was a founding board member of the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef, which is working with beef producers to proactively identify, share and scale the industry’s most sustainable practices McDonald’s is the first restaurant company to set an approved Science Based Target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. McDonald’s is truly changing the conversation on sustainability, using its reach to drive entire industries to change while working to continuously improve its own practices in alliance with multiple stakeholders.

Lifetime Achievement Award

A biologist and journalist by training, Chris Wille has spent decades leading the conservation and sustainability movement around the world, working for wildlife conservation agencies, the EPA, the National Wildlife Federation, and the National Audubon Society before helping to cofound the Rainforest Alliance more than 30 years ago. In 1990, Chris and his wife, Diane Jukofsky, moved to Costa Rica to establish the organization's first field programs, leading an unprecedented, multi-stakeholder process that brought together environmentalists, farmers, scientists, farm workers, business leaders, government officials, and others to develop the first standard for sustainable agriculture. Thanks to his passion, keen intelligence, and unwavering commitment, Chris has helped to transform the way that tropical commodities are grown and sold—reducing their environmental footprint, protecting wildlife and people, and safeguarding the livelihoods of some of our planet’s poorest communities.","This year, the Rainforest Alliance also celebrates its recent international merger with UTZ, another global leader in sustainable agriculture, based in the Netherlands.
On May 9th, the Rainforest Alliance will honor these partnerships with a series of awards at its 31st Spring Gala at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.
“The kind of transformational, global work the Rainforest Alliance undertakes would not be possible without the partnerships we have established with forward-thinking, progressive companies,” said Han de Groot, CEO of the Rainforest Alliance.
In fact, many of the farmers represented by the Colombian Coffee Growers Federation have achieved Rainforest Alliance certification for their farms.

Community involvement is a natural part of life for David Beyer.

Beyer saw the positive impact his parents had on the Iowa community where he grew up. He — and his six younger siblings — continue to carry on that tradition of engagement.

Beyer, president of Everett Community College, is this year’s recipient of the Henry M. Jackson award, which is given to someone who shows “exemplary service to the community and is committed to the business interests of the region,” according to Economic Alliance Snohomish County. The award will be presented at the EASC’s seventh annual and celebration May 17 at the Tulalip Resort Casino.

Beyer said he prefers to stay out of the spotlight and doesn’t necessarily seek recognition.

“I’d rather see other people get it and get the attention they deserve,” he said. “But I’m very appreciative. I’m a history major and I appreciate the history of Henry Jackson and what he did for this area and the things he stood for.

“I work with a talented group of people who make a lot of good things happen for the students here, but also for the people in this region.”

Beyer’s tenure at Everett Community College has been a period of tremendous growth. The school opened the Advanced Manufacturing Training and Education Center, a hub for workforce training and development, in 2014. Two years later, the college launched a manufacturing training program in Arlington.

Arlington Mayor Barb Tolbert noted in her nomination of Beyer that he has shown “responsiveness to our business community” by addressing the need for a skilled workforce.

Beyer said it’s easier for the college to adapt to the changing needs of the community when it partners with local businesses and organizations.

“It influences what we do and how we go about doing things,” he said. “Anybody who works here has some connection with the community, and they bring it back and it becomes part of the fabric of who we are and what we do.”

Beyer is also in the process of expanding the college’s health care programs and strengthening partnerships with local K-12 schools.

“We want to create pathways from their schools into our programs for the people who choose to come here,” he said. EvCC students then have a pathway to four-year institutions if they choose to continue their education.

Beyer has pushed for equity on campus and outreach to communities that the college may have previously overlooked. He created the position of chief diversity and equity officer to provide leadership on inclusion, part of the school’s goal of making a college education accessible to everyone in the community.

“It’s making sure that we all have an equitable place to start from so we can experience self-fulfillment and economic mobility,” he said. “Most people are striving … to improve their lives for themselves and their families.”

Beyer’s favorite time of the school year is graduation, when he gets to see an audience full of smiling people. He’s overseen numerous graduation ceremonies since he became a college president in 1994, and he always leaves them with a smile on his face.

Beyer said there are a lot of courageous people at Everett Community College who work hard to achieve their dreams. Implementation of the college’s strategic plan — developed with input from the community — would bring more of those hard-working people to campus.

“There are places that we need to be in the community, and we’re going to find ways to get there,” he said. “We have the partners and the talent here to make some good things happen for more individuals than what we have been doing.”","Beyer saw the positive impact his parents had on the Iowa community where he grew up.

Fort Walton Beach City Manager Michael Beedie led the workshop in which officials heard from city Police Chief Edward Ryan, Fire Chief Ken Perkins and Finance Director Brandy Ferris about the ways the city can improve on public safety and possibly partner with neighboring governments.

“Every time this conversation comes up, it turns into a pissing match between the jurisdictions,” Beedie said. “Fort Walton Beach is not trying to take over Cinco Bayou … Mary Esther. … It’s our due diligence; it’s our duty as public servants to look at every option on the table.

“We’re trying to help our neighbors out. ... If it’s decided by the other councils that (they’re) not interested, so be it. We’ll move on our merry way.”

The major topic of discussion was potential partnerships with Cinco Bayou, Mary Esther and Okaloosa County EMS to provide more efficient public safety services at a lower cost.

Police

According to Ryan, past issues include inadequate uniforms, problems with top-down communication, aging equipment and a lack of career development opportunities. Many of those issues have been addressed in recent years, Ryan said, with the exception of new laptops built to withstand the job, a completely new fleet of vehicles and sufficient personnel.

With the city’s Commerce and Technology Park and the possible annexation of the Sylvania Heights neighborhood, more resources will be needed, which will require more personnel. Those improvements can be phased in over 3-5 years, Ryan said.

Fire

Perkins presented issues his department faces, with the main problem being geography. Fort Walton Beach is split into northern and southern sections with Cinco Bayou, Ocean City and Wright in the middle. According to Perkins, that causes the department to treat the city as two separate districts.

Additionally, the Fire Department needs a new engine to replace the rescue truck that doesn’t have hoses or ladders.

For a house fire, four fire engines are needed with about 15 fire fighters. One Fort Walton Beach fire station only has 25 percent of those resources, which requires help from other departments.

“There’s always been the misconception ... that the city of Fort Walton Beach is providing more aid ... than other departments,” Perkins said. “The fact is, we are receiving a tremendous amount of help to cover our own (fires).”

A partnership with Mary Esther and Cinco Bayou would benefit everyone because they are right “out the back door,” Perkins said.

Another issue is the lack of a deputy fire chief position, which the city cut in 2011. Currently, those duties done by the chief, the battalion chiefs, other firefighters or are not getting done at all. Without that position, the department has suffered in emergency management operations, grant application and regular maintenance tests, Perkins said.

The Fire Department’s main goals are to partner with Mary Esther and Okaloosa County EMS, and to upgrade the rescue truck.

Funding

A partnership with Mary Esther for police and fire services would cost about $1.4 million for personnel, fire inspector and equipment, according to Ferris.

That includes a 25 percent share in which Fort Walton Beach would share a portion of the full cost. That would reduce the cost for Mary Esther to $946,446 and add $315,482 to the cost for Fort Walton Beach, Ferris said.

Partnering with Cinco Bayou for pubic safety services would reduce Cinco Bayou’s tax rate by 1.58 mills. The current millage rate of 2.58 is used in part to pay for services from the Ocean City-Wright Fire District and Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office.

“Due to the close proximity to the city, we feel that we could offer those services at 1 mill to the citizens or approximately $45,000 on a contract basis to the town of Cinco Bayou,” Ferris said.

Fort Walton Beach’s current millage rate is 5.7697. To fund the full public safety budget, the tax rate would be 8.9608 mills.

Funding options for improved public safety include raising the millage rate or using the half-cent sales tax — if it passes in the November referendum.

In the first fiscal year (2018-19), the cost for enhanced police services would be $270,573, which would be equivalent to 0.1288 millage increase. For enhanced fire services, the millage rate would increase by 0.8307 or the fire assessment fee would increase by $212.

Municipal input

Fort Walton Beach City Councilman David Schmidt said he was interested in finding other ways to fund essential services such as police and fire other than raising the taxes

All the participating officials said they were interested in continuing the discussion. No final decisions were made at this meeting.","FORT WALTON BEACH — Staffers and council members from Fort Walton Beach, Cinco Bayou and Mary Esther gathered Tuesday at the Fort Walton Beach Public Library to talk public safety.

By Pieter-Jan Dockx*

With its attack on Shia militias, the Islamic State (IS) has recently regained prominence in northern Iraq. However, the brief period between the declared victory over IS and its current re-emergence -roughly December 2017-February 2018 – saw the manifestation of a new insurgent group called the ‘White Banners’. Named after its white banner with a lion’s head in the centre, the group was mainly responsible for attacks in the Kirkuk area. While no apparent official statements were made by the group, there is ample evidence suggesting that the faction was an alliance between IS and Kurdish organisations, possibly the Kurdish Free Life Party (PJAK). Although PJAK fighters had covertly joined the Kurdish Peshmerga in the battle against IS, the Iraqi government’s takeover of territories contested by both Kurds and Arabs like Kirkuk in October 2017 facilitated a strategic alignment between the groups. This commentary investigates recent and past IS partnerships that have gone unreported in mainstream media. It concludes that IS only cooperates with other insurgent factions when it finds itself in a position of weakness. When in a position of strength, the group aims to monopolise the insurgency.

Cooperation first occurred after the US withdrawal from Iraq in 2011. At that time, IS’ predecessor, the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), started collaborating with the nationalist Ba’athist insurgents of the ‘Jaish Rijaal al-Tariqa al-Naqshabandiyya (JRTN)’. In late 2013, around the time of Sunni protests against their marginalisation by the government, IS – at this time known as ‘the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS)’ – expanded its collaboration with the JRTN.

In both instances, IS found itself in a position of relative weakness in Iraq and thus decided to form a partnership with the JRTN. In 2011, ISI faced extensive pressure from security forces and local tribal fighters. It also lacked the manpower to pose a real challenge to these state-backed fighters. The group’s ‘breaking the walls’ campaign, in which prisons were targeted to free its fighters and boost its ranks, only started later, in July 2012.

Further, although the 2013 anti-government protests formed the perfect opportunity for ISIS to instigate sectarian strife in Iraq, the group had largely allocated its resources in Syria where it intended to take advantage of the civil war. Therefore, the Salafists decided to team up with the JRTN, whose political front was leading several protests but lacked the required tactical expertise to challenge the government beyond peaceful protests. In January 2014, their combined efforts seized control of Fallujah for several days after which it was retaken by the security forces. Thus, even with pooled resources, ISIS’ partnership still proved weak vis-à-vis the Iraqi security forces.

On the contrary, when ISIS was able to attain a position of strength and become the dominant insurgent group in Iraq, it ended its partnerships and turned against its former allies. While the January battle for Fallujah was still very much a combined effort, the June 2014 takeover of Mosul was essentially spearheaded by ISIS. Having established full control over Raqqa, ISIS was able to allocate more resources to Iraq. Although the group still allowed the JRTN to exist in the fringes of the insurgency, it soon turned against its partners, which were subsequently removed from the newly-established ‘Caliphate’.

A similar conclusion can be drawn from the recent alliance between IS and the Kurdish group. Cooperation between both actors manifested itself after IS lost most of its territory in Iraq to the government. The ‘White Banner’ phenomenon even indicates that IS found itself in a more precarious position than at the time of its partnership with the JRTN. While in past alliances IS still operated under its own name and flag, during its recent cooperation with Kurdish fighters, it accepted the use of an alternative representation. As it is only in the Kurds’ interest to use different symbols, it can be assumed that the demand was made by the Kurdish factions and a weakened IS agreed.

The recent resurgence of IS activity in northern Iraq did not feature White Banner attacks, confirming the hypothesis that a strengthened IS is unlikely to cooperate with others. Two possible scenarios can be further hypothesised. One scenario suggests that IS was able to demand the usage of its own name and credentials in the attacks, meaning they now find themselves in a relatively stronger bargaining position vis-à-vis the Kurdish resistance group. Another scenario could be that in this moment of strength, the Salafists ended all cooperation with the Kurds and the White Banners were dissolved.

In both instances, the ideological difference between the groups is further evidence of the necessity of their cooperation. While IS is a Salafist organisation that even labelled al Qaeda as “the Jews of jihad,” the JRTN finds itself at the other end of the spectrum as a nationalist, Ba’athist, non-sectarian, pan-Arabist organisation. Similarly, PJAK is a leftist-nationalist organisation that does not espouse IS’ ideology. Thus, while cooperation with another Salafist group could possibly be explained by ideological motives, the ideological distance between IS, the JRTN, and the Kurdish faction supports the idea that the partnerships were borne out of material considerations.

To sum up, the recent partnership between IS and Kurdish nationalistsis not the first time the Salafist organisation has cooperated with other (non-Islamist) groups. These instances indicate that IS only participates in alliances when it finds itself in a position of weakness. Given a chance, IS will end its cooperation.

77,https://www.newtimes.co.rw/opinions/learning-liberias-educational-partnerships,"Tue, 15 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The New Times,Learning from Liberia’s educational partnerships,"MONROVIA – Around the world, some 263 million children remain out of school, and of those who do attend classes, 330 million are receiving substandard education. As a result, an estimated 617 million school-age children are unable to read at grade level.

The problem is a global one, but it is particularly acute in Sub-Saharan Africa, where 88% of young students– some 202 million boys and girls – are not achieving a sufficient level of reading proficiency. And it is also here where solutions are being tested.

African governments and international donors have long paid lip service to improving educational outcomes, especially in basic skills like reading, writing, and math. At a financing conference for the Global Partnership for Education in February, developing countries vowed to increase spending on education by $110 billion, and wealthy donors pledged an additional $2.3 billion to improve school systems in poor countries.

But as important as these commitments are, Africa’s education crisis will not be overcome by donations and pledges alone. A new approach is needed to strengthen struggling schools, train teachers, and ensure that every child can obtain the necessary skills to succeed. One pilot programme being tested in my country, Liberia, has shown considerable promise.

Because low-income countries rarely have enough money to implement needed education reforms, pooling public and private resources is an attractive alternative. Since 2016, Liberia’s education ministry has merged select public schools with various independent operators in an effort to increase educational quality in a tight budget environment. Early results are impressive.1

For example, at the free public schools currently managed by expert contractors participating in the program, learning outcomes improved by 60% in the first year. At the 25 schools operated by my employer, Bridge Partnership Schools for Liberia, average student test scores doubled in just nine months. Parents and pupils have embraced these reinvigorated schools, with many calling them the best they have ever experienced. As a result, the previous government expanded the program, and the current one is committed to continuing support.

One of the most powerful components of a Bridge Partnership School is the pedagogy. For every lesson in every subject across every grade, educators have access to detailed lesson plans developed by academics. These plans help teachers prepare and deliver instruction to maximise learning outcomes. By assisting in classroom planning, Bridge ensures a degree of standardisation across schools, and helps teachers focus more attention on individual students.

At first glance, Liberia’s school system might seem a poor fit for such an innovative experiment. Today, some 58% of Liberian children are out of school, the literacy rate is among the lowest in the world, and teachers are in short supply. Moreover, the current government budgets just $50 annually for each child attending elementary school. The average in the OECD in 2013 was $9,200.

But programmes like these are attractive for two reasons: they deepen a country’s access to educational expertise, and, more important, they open up new funding streams.

Developed countries have already recognised the value of strong public-private partnerships in education. Notably, the United Kingdom’s 2018 education policy encourages the expansion of such programs because they have been found to “improve access to education for poor and marginalized children.”

Not everyone will agree; partial partnerships with the private sector and NGOs in education generates considerable controversy, and there is little doubt that in Liberia, the Bridge model remains a work in progress. (A new impact analysis is due in the next academic year.)

But while costs were high, they are quickly falling. And continuous teacher training for those who are part of Bridge PSL is helping to increase the quality of instruction. As test results in Liberia demonstrate, children are learning more than ever. With the support of prominent global investors, our schools are achieving outcomes that were previously unthinkable.

From my perspective, the public-private partnership model has revolutionised education in Liberia, and I am confident that it can work in other parts of Africa, too. In countries where learning outcomes continue to lag, governments need collaborative solutions. And, as past failures have demonstrated, education systems in much of the Global South cannot succeed alone.

To achieve “education for all” by 2030, the target set by the UN Sustainable Development Goals, educators must embrace bold solutions like Bridge Partnership Schools. With millions of children still being denied the right to an education, the world can no longer afford the status quo.

RNC Chief of Police Joe Boland said the plan of action includes a number of goals in the areas of partnership and engagement, organizational development and crime reduction.

“Corporate Plan 2018 to 2021 is for everyone. It embodies the priorities of the RNC, as well as the people, communities and businesses we serve,” Boland said. “Throughout the planning phase we engaged our employees, community, stakeholders — all were a huge part of the development of this plan. Success of the RNC will depend on how connected we get, and how better we understand the community we police.”

The purpose of a corporate plan is to help focus efforts to guide police work, decision-making and allocation of resources, he said, adding that it also outlines the RNC’s core values which form the foundation on which officers perform work and conduct themselves.

Boland said one of the biggest challenges facing the RNC is dealing with mental health issues. He said police officers are regularly challenged to accurately recognize mental health issues and respond appropriately.

“Almost every situation we deal with in this community right now, mental health is at the forefront,” Boland said. “I think about our young officers who come to work every day and the complexities around mental health. Talk to Linda Ross and other people here that work for non-profits and a lot of the issues, if not a significant number of issues, are around mental health. And it’s trying to find our way through that.”

Boland noted the RNC and the province’s health department have already formed a Mental Health Mobile Crisis Response Team that has gone a long way to better dealing with challenging mental health calls.

The team includes a health-care professional and a plain-clothed police officer in an unmarked vehicle. The unit is better equipped to deal with the crisis and the family involved, he said.

“Last year, last April, there were 86 visits by the mobile mental health unit at that time. Today we’ve more than doubled those calls,” Boland said. “We are not having to go into people’s homes now and arrest people, and take them out in handcuffs, and search them and put them into the back of police cars, and showing up at hospitals treating people like criminals.

“Now we are going in, the interaction is done in the home, they can diagnosis them in the home, they can do referrals from within the home. We haven’t had that relationship between health and the police, and I’m talking about at the ground level. That relationship has improved immensely. I knew it would, I just didn’t think it would happen that quick.”

Linda Ross, president and CEO of the Provincial Advisory Council on the Status of Women, said community groups have long identified mental health as the single biggest issue in the frontline work they do.

“We realize that many of the people that we are seeing are really struggling, and they are struggling with mental health,” she said. “Some, in addition, have substance abuse issues, which ends up leading them to places where they come face to face with the criminal justice system.

“If their mental health and addiction issues were addressed, they wouldn’t end up in the criminal justice system. And the fact is that’s not where they belong, that’s not what is really needed in order to help them.”

Ross said the term “healthy communities” is something that is coming up more often.

“We are talking about healthy relationships and we want to see it across the age spectrum. We want to see it in our schools and in the House of Assembly,” she said.

“It’s about looking at how we relate to one another, how we support one another, how we work together in the best interest of the people of our province. It doesn’t mean we are always going to agree and everything is perfect, but it’s how we do it in a way that’s respectful and that we are always there for one another. So it was absolutely fantastic to hear it this morning. It didn’t come as a surprise to hear it, knowing the work that has been going on and knowing the relationship the RNC has with community partners.”

Boland said officers and employees of the RNC must be engaged, offered training opportunities and supported throughout their careers, both professionally and health-wise.

“We have the youngest police service in Canada, so it’s a great opportunity for me, as well, when you think of a police service that has over 400 (members) and 300 of those members have 13 years of experience or less,” he said. “It gives me a great opportunity to develop, mould, mentor, to make sure they get proper coaching and training to meet the demands. I see a significant opportunity for the RNC here to do the right things now, and this province will benefit hugely down the road.”

Lisa Browne, CEO of Stella’s Circle, said the RNC’s corporate plan is bold in terms of its approach to prevention and community policing.

“We often focus on policing in terms of arresting people or dealing with crimes after the fact, and this really takes a preventative, proactive approach and I think that’s impressive,” Browne said. “Everything from working with newcomers, highlighting seniors and crime prevention with that population group, people with mental illness and addictions issues. I thought it was very proactive in terms of that community policing approach, and essentially the message for me is that the RNC is saying that we are part of the solution, but there are many other groups who are part of the solution as well, and the importance of the collaboration of working together.”","Boland said one of the biggest challenges facing the RNC is dealing with mental health issues.
He said police officers are regularly challenged to accurately recognize mental health issues and respond appropriately.
“Almost every situation we deal with in this community right now, mental health is at the forefront,” Boland said.
“Last year, last April, there were 86 visits by the mobile mental health unit at that time.
“We realize that many of the people that we are seeing are really struggling, and they are struggling with mental health,” she said."

Public-private partnerships (PPPs) fall into four key types: operating partnerships; advisory committees; project partnerships; and strategic partnerships. Of these, the most potent and long-ranging partnerships are strategic. Although they may begin with a single project, they ultimately provide a platform capable of generating new projects with the potential to achieve far-reaching impacts over time.

This article describes the high-level shaping of strategic partnerships in cities — reviewing the organizing approaches of several successful strategic platforms, and pointing to the first key partners to turn to.

Organizing models for strategic partnership

Strategic approaches to PPP development typically require the creation of a partnership organization. The platform that results effectively can become a PPP-generating machine.



Envision Charlotte’s public-private-plus collaborative formed a nonprofit organization to anchor its efforts. ""We created a neutral platform to allow us to structure a win-win for everyone,"" executive director Amy Aussieker explained. It also offers protection. Since its founding in 2010, Charlotte has had six mayors, although this organization has persisted across mayors and even private-sector CEOs. ""Though this was not the reason for forming a nonprofit, in hindsight it was a benefit,"" she said.

Utilities are natural partners to cities.

The first-of-its-kind PPP platform for Smart City development, Envision Charlotte has become a model for others. Its first partners included local utility Duke Energy, technology company Cisco Systems and Charlotte Center City, a nonprofit that promotes the development of Charlotte’s urban core. In its mission to improve sustainability around energy, air, water and waste, it gathered additional partners, including local banks and other businesses, technology and services company Itron, engineering firm CH2M Hill, network provider Verizon, waste-management specialist Enevo and the University of North Carolina-Charlotte. Most recently, it created a citizen-focused ECO Network to extend its sustainability goals deeper into the community.

Indeed, citizen engagement is a secret sauce to help smart city evolution perform for all stakeholders.

An organizing approach developed by Envision Utah has been replicated by dozens of regions around the United States. Envision Utah is a nonprofit public-private partnership that engages community stakeholders from a statewide umbrella, whose goal is ""empowering people to create the communities they want."" It acts as a neutral facilitator, bringing together residents, elected officials, developers, conservationists, business leaders and other interested parties to make informed decisions about how Utah should grow.

This has resulted in a Quality Growth Strategy and a growth-planning toolkit designed for use by civic leaders, businesses and the public at large. These tools can be used to inform an implementation pathway for a range of multi-player partnerships.

More recently, the KCMO Smart City initiative in Kansas City, Missouri, is testing a novel model for organizing a PPP: to procure a private-sector partner to join them and lead the effort. After building out an initial smart-city platform along a free downtown streetcar line (via initial PPP activity involving Cisco, Sprint and Think Big Partners), it is fielding a Request for Proposals (RFP) to recruit a lead PPP partner to expand its Smart City program.

The prime partner is visualized as either a nonprofit consortium or a for-profit firm, which has demonstrated that it can build an extensive suite of capabilities and manage a partnership of public and private players, including community partners and stakeholders. This PPP-leading organization’s scope will include the creation of new business models that can sustain the smart-city projects and sustain the PPP.

Kansas City Chief Innovation Officer Bob Bennett explained: ""KCMO has assets in play that we are bringing to the table: fiber and pre-coordinated access to assets. We will collaboratively build out the array of initiatives so that the city improves the lives of its people and our partner succeeds.""

A city's first partners: utilities

Smart, sustainable cities depend on reliable and resilient energy systems. Jesse Berst, chairman of the Smart Cities Council, urges cities interested in starting a smart cities program to partner first with their local electric utility company. To that end, the council and the Edison Electric Institute formed a joint initiative, Electric Companies Advancing Cities; its task force is holding three city-utility summits in 2018, culminating with a playbook to capture best practices and case studies.

Citizen engagement is a secret sauce to help smart city evolution perform for all stakeholders. Aussieker of Envision Charlotte agrees that utilities are natural partners to cities. ""Most cities have a public utility, which owns assets outside the city. So, if the city doesn’t engage with that utility, how can you get to a sustainable [model]?"" To illuminate the point: ""Duke Energy [in Charlotte] owns the light poles while the city owns the right of way and leases the poles."" In addition, ""You need to partner with your utility to act on a goal of 100 percent renewable energy."" Do you need to form a PPP for that? ""No, but if you do you will be a lot more successful.""

Envision Utah is following precisely that path. Salt Lake City is in a region whose climate is warming more than twice as fast as the national average, negatively affecting water reserves and air quality. Led by the findings of Envision’s Utah’s citizen survey, the region is responding with urgency, and is partnering with its local utility Rocky Mountain Power. Envision has drafted a plan to acquire all the community's electricity from renewable sources by 2032, reducing emissions, saving water and improving air quality in the process.

Communications network providers represent another potential utility partner with a natural role to play within smart cities. Partnership examples include communications projects such as New York City’s street-facing LinkNYC, built in partnership with the CityBridge consortium (there’s Google inside); and Huntsville, Alabama’s unique network build-out partnership with Google Fiber. In contrast, Chattanooga’s game-changing municipal Internet the Gig was built alone when incumbent private partners were not ready to step up their play.

The lesson for utility providers: Don’t play with the public sector at your own risk.

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

You're reading Entrepreneur Middle East, an international franchise of Entrepreneur Media.

Back in the day, one could say that business success could be achieved solely through entrepreneurship, acquisition, and the harnessing of capital to fuel growth. While these strategies can still help keep a company in the black, my personal experiences have taught me that today’s enterprises are more likely to find success in the long-term by establishing partnerships and alliances with complementary innovators and suppliers, rather than attempting to forge ahead alone.

As global economies shift, and we face world changing events like Brexit, war on trade, and conflicts that impact resources, companies are expected to do more with less. Rather than reinvent the wheel each time a new technology or service is needed, more companies are looking to partner with like-minded businesses to help improve and drive efficiency in their own business processes and operations. Such an approach is easily said, yet not so easily done, as it requires creating partnerships that go beyond paper contracts and fixed deals. This is about building relationships that form the foundations of smart business.

For example, the partnership between Middle East’s leading e-commerce retailer Souq.com and innovative solutions conglomerate 3M, which will avail a large variety of 3M products to customers on the e-commerce platform. This increases the ease of accessibility for 3M products and widens its reach, without having to build their own e-commerce operations from scratch. But if one is to follow these enterprises’ lead and get the most out of partnerships, there are several areas to consider- from finding your partner, to signing on the dotted line, and beyond.

Choosing the right partner for business

The success (or failure) of any business relationship depends heavily on how well the partnership works. Particular effort should be directed towards ensuring the right relationships are formed. Businesses need to establish precisely what they are seeking to achieve from these relationships, whether it be, expanding into new territories, providing new services, or discover a new route to market. Amazon Web Services is a good example where businesses don’t have to build their own hosting infrastructure. Instead of buying, owning and maintaining their own data centers and servers, organizations can now have access to these resources and other services on an as-needed basis. As a result, businesses are freed to focus their time on other activities that can drive growth and influence customer satisfaction.

Building on the foundations

Once you have a partnership in place with defined and shared goals, it is important to foster growth and set up a rhythm of checking-in on the status of the partnership at regular intervals. While a contract might be signed and sealed, a partnership has a lot more scope to grow if all parties involved provide feedback and share what aspects of the partnership are doing well, and where there are areas for improvement.

Emphasis on flexibility

With this in mind, it is also worth considering partnerships built around flexible contracts. This gives both sides the opportunity for adjustment of parameters set, enabling innovation, and a crosspollination of ideas, which ultimately delivers more value out of a partnership in the long term. The benefits of such a partnership usually outweigh any disadvantages. For example, sharing of contacts, supply chains, or the experience of how to break into new markets or arenas, you may not have considered before. This could then be further expanded to develop small one-to-one partnerships, into group ventures, or even establish a community of companies, suppliers and customers working together. Such a community could flourish into an ecosystem, leading to the sharing of products, services, and infrastructure, thereby creating a situation where everyone involved can benefit and support each other.

Gaining buy-in at the highest level

Whatever the size of business, and however lofty the ambition, partnerships can be strengthened and boosted by gaining executive sponsorship, as having the right support can bring experience, knowledge and authority to the forging of long-lasting partnerships. Equally, having a clear line of leadership and ownership on both sides of a partnership can help spearhead its early success, with people taking responsibility to ensure a partnership expands beyond a contract and into a strong working relationship that promises to bloom over time.

Scratch beneath the surface of any of today’s prominent companies and you are likely to find a handful of partnerships helping fuel that success. Companies can no longer afford to work in silos– taking influence, technology, and resources and applying them to a successful business model not only makes good commercial sense, it’s a great way to meet customers changing needs. And in the ever more competitive business world, successful long-term partnerships are likely to be the difference between a company blazing a trail, or fading into obscurity.

Here Dr Angela Kukula, Director of Enterprise at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) – and responsible for its interactions with industry – gives some tips on what makes a good collaboration between industry and academic researchers.

The ICR is well known for establishing productive partnerships with industry, along with major research successes such as our discovery and development of the prostate cancer drug abiraterone. We often come out at or near the top of UK and international rankings for research impact and commercialisation.

We have more than 100 current partnerships with a range of companies, from small, specialised biotech firms to big pharma.

One of our most significant new partnerships is a multi-project collaboration and licensing deal with Merck and the charity Cancer Research UK.

This alliance will take a strategic joint approach to drug discovery and development in areas of shared scientific expertise, building on successful collaborations in the past on individual research projects.

The partnership will aim to progress the discovery and development of potential cancer drugs, from target discovery to the nomination of preclinical drug candidates, in three areas of mutual interest.

Scientists working under the collaboration will also develop new biomarker tests, to show how new drugs work, guide the selection of patients for clinical trials and ultimately identify those patients most likely to benefit from treatment.

Forming this type of partnership doesn’t happen overnight.

So what goes into making a successful collaboration between a company and an academic institution like the ICR?

Respect and understanding

Perhaps the most important principle of successful partnerships is an awareness and appreciation of the differences between the organisations in terms of culture and approach.

Partnerships that cross the boundaries between public and private organisations need to actively consider their different ways of working and what this can bring to the relationship.

Academic institutions often have different drivers from commercial companies. For academic organisations drivers might be around societal benefit and the discovery and dissemination of new knowledge, whereas for businesses it is more likely to be the timely development of new products and delivering value for shareholders. There has to be understanding on both sides of each other’s needs and goals for partnerships to work.

But even if the drivers for the ICR and our partners are different, they don’t have to be mutually exclusive – and partnerships between different organisations can be very productive if these different goals and processes are harnessed to accelerate progress towards the same end.

One way to develop mutual understanding is to insist on transparency within the project, acting as a single project team regardless of which organisation you are working in.

The ability to see, comment on and critique each other’s results not only benefits the project by harnessing ideas from both sides but also breaks down barriers, and builds trust, preventing silos developing within different laboratories.

Encouraging entrepreneurial culture

From the ICR’s point of view, it helps that we have a philosophy of encouraging interaction with industry, often partnering very early so we can benefit from the input of industry resources and expertise.

Many of our researchers, including at the most senior levels, have substantial industry experience, which helps to foster an entrepreneurial culture. That many of our researchers want to collaborate with industry makes it relatively easy for conversations to start.

We are also finding that, particularly in large companies, more and more industry people now seem to understand the academic culture and how to work with it to achieve successful collaborations.

When a person at a company understands our philosophy and approach, it makes everything much smoother, and can help to open up new possibilities. That’s the case for our strategic alliance with Merck and Cancer Research UK, but we are very happy to help new collaborators understand how we work.

However – it’s still a big jump from mutual understanding to building a successful collaboration.

There are a number of other practical steps that both academic institutions and companies can follow to increase their chances of success.

Start small

One piece of advice I often give to our academic staff is to start small – for example with small consulting projects. The Merck collaboration started with smaller projects relating to specific drug targets, before leading to our new alliance.





One piece of advice I often give to our academic staff is to start small – for example with small consulting projects. The Merck collaboration started with smaller projects relating to specific drug targets, before leading to our new alliance. Complimentary expertise

As well as finding areas of shared interest, it’s useful to have complimentary expertise – with each side bringing something different to the table that will enhance the project overall. When looking at new possible collaborations, we often look at the resources a project will need that we don’t have readily available in house.

When looking at new possible collaborations, we often look at the resources a project will need that we don’t have readily available in house. ‘Deal breakers’

It also helps for both sides to be clear at the outset which terms will have little, or no, room for negotiation – where the ‘deal-breakers’ are. For the ICR, for example, our ability to publish our work (possibly after a short delay for the filing of patent applications) and to continue working in a specific field are unlikely to be negotiable. From the industry point of view, a business might need to insist on exclusivity in certain aspects of the deal.

From the industry point of view, a business might need to insist on exclusivity in certain aspects of the deal. Timing

Another potential sticking point to get out in the open as early as possible is timing. New partners need to understand each other’s timeframes. For example, a company might be looking for an answer to a research question in six months – which wouldn’t work within the timeframe for an academic PhD studentship, but might be suited for a short postdoctoral project.

Team science

Modern science is a team endeavour. In cancer research, the questions we are asking now are so large we often require teamwork between many different specialists, with different knowledge and skills.

Building strong connections between individuals with different sets of skills is essential, and this principle applies to teams across different organisations as much as within just one. And with mutual respect and understanding, cross-organisational alliances can be very successful indeed.

ABIDJAN — The Islamic Development Bank revealed a rebrand last week, with insiders saying it represents an internal evolution to better empower its country members and beneficiaries through an emphasis on innovation and partnership.

Islamic Development Bank looks to expand its support of innovation and entrepreneurship In April, the Islamic Development Bank held its annual meeting in Tunisia, and among the issues discussed were social innovation, entrepreneurship, and youth. Hayat Sindi leads the bank's efforts on some of this work and Devex spoke to her about a new fund and platform aimed at connecting and supporting innovators and entrepreneurs.

The first rebrand in its 44-year history, the bank’s “new brand identity,” including a new logo, reflects a wider transformation that Hayat Sindi, scientific adviser to the president, told Devex includes an internal restructuring, decentralization, and establishment of regional hubs within member countries. The Saudi-based multilateral development bank remains a leading lender in the Muslim world, with 57 member countries covering a population of 1.6 billion, and a working capital of $16 billion.

“After conducting internal and external interviews, we realized we need to transform, to be seen as more than a bank of businessmen, but a bank of developers,” Sindi said. “We want to empower communities, not just be seen as an ATM machine.”

To better address the difficulties facing lower-income countries today, IsDB has created specialized departments for climate change, partnerships, and resilience, to streamline external commitments and guide member countries before, during and after a natural disaster for example.

“Our mission will focus on youth and the Fourth Industrial Revolution ... and will drive innovation and partnerships which are so critical to the delivery and financial planning that impact the entire value chain,” Sindi explained.

Technology, partnership, and innovation sit at the heart of IsDB’s strategy to alleviate poverty and provide equitable health care and education through Islamic financing. However, Sindi noted that making technology accessible to the most vulnerable will require a shift in thinking at the local level.

“We want to empower communities, not just be seen as an ATM machine.” — Hayat Sindi, IsDB’s scientific adviser to the president

She argued that IsDB funding will “encourage the culture of technology that even though you may not have invented [something], you have the right to [the] technology, and with that comes a bit of development work to help them understand that they have this right,” she told Devex.

To this end, IsDB launched the “Transform Fund” to increase member access to financing for innovation. This $1 billion fund will provide seed money for innovators, startups and small- to medium-sized enterprises; and finance partnerships between researchers and entrepreneurs for projects that address challenges aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals, such as food security, education, water and sanitation, renewable energy, and infrastructure.

IsDB also launched the digital platform Engage in February, which connects agencies, NGOs, and the private sector with market opportunities and funding, in hopes of serving as an incubation space for idea sharing among innovators.

Along with internal shuffling, the new logo — a blue and green half globe comprised of interconnected dots — “really reflects the modern age; reflects our forward vision in terms of organizational partnership, science and innovation, [and] global engagement being at the heart of our work,” Sindi said.

The green is part of the Islamic bank’s traditional identity, while the blue represents sustainability — a color used by other international organizations. The interconnectivity of dots represents liberation, partnership, a meeting of the minds, and innovation, according to Sindi, while the half globe symbolizes an openness for new partnership opportunities.

“The challenges are huge, and to be sustainable in supporting [them] we needed to have a different approach in how we go into poor communities. So, here we are entering a new era as an institution,” she said.","A view of the Islamic Development Bank Group building in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

SOUTH BASE, Serbia - Nearly 45 members of the Ohio National Guard's 838th Military Police Company arrived in the Republic of Serbia on June 10 to participate in exercise Platinum Wolf.

The two-week, multinational peacekeeping exercise will bring 10 nations together to enhance military cooperation and interoperability at Serbia's South Base and Borovac Training Area, June 11 - 22.

The full-scale exercise, led by Serbian Armed Forces, will allow the Ohio National Guard's military police, along with more than 45 members of the Tennessee National Guard's 269th Military Police Company, to train alongside and develop partnerships and mutual understanding between partner nations including, the United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, Slovenia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Montenegro, Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The training event kicked off Monday with the official opening ceremonies, where approximately 550 military personnel participated in an open ranks inspection and listened as Col. Slobodan Stopa , 4th Army Brigade Commander, welcomed and thanked the partnering nations and highlighted the exercise objectives.

""Since 2014, we have conducted the multinational training exercise called Platinum Wolf every year and the experience we have gained so far is very positive,"" said Stopa. ""Considering that we carry out the exercise in a multinational environment, it is an excellent opportunity for the members of partner nations' armed forces to gain and exchange new experiences.""

Throughout the two-week event, participants will conduct hands-on training share best practices and execute a full-scale exercise incorporating tactics in Military Operations on Urban Terrain, or MOUT; civil security and operations; public law and order; crowd and riot control and use of non-lethal weapons.

""Exercises like Platinum Wolf are a terrific opportunity to enhance our partnerships, professionally, while also building personal friendships,"" said Capt. Carl Roberts, Ohio National Guard operations exercise planner. ""Training together, with 10 other nations, brings out the best in our Soldiers, fostering readiness and reinforcing field craft.

The University of West Alabama and the City of Livingston have added a new initiative to a long list of collaborations designed to improve the quality of life for city and campus residents. Together, UWA and Livingston have been selected by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a 2018 Healthy Places for Healthy People partner.

Healthy Places for Healthy People was established by the EPA, with support from the Delta Regional Authority (DRA) and U.S. Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to engage community leaders and health care partners to create walkable, healthy, economically vibrant downtowns and neighborhoods that can improve health, protect the environment, and support economic growth.

Through the program, UWA and Livingston will receive planning assistance centered around a two-day community workshop. At the event, a team of experts will join community members with federal and state agencies to develop an implementable action plan to focus on health as an economic driver and catalyst for downtown and neighborhood revitalization. The assistance is not a grant, and the program does not provide money directly to communities. The workshop will make the connections between health, place-based considerations, and community and economic development goals.

“Being selected for ‘Healthy Places for Healthy People’ gives the University of West Alabama and the City of Livingston another valuable opportunity to collaborate with the focus of utilizing and improving the physical attributes of our community in a way that leads to many greater opportunities for healthy living,” said UWA President Ken Tucker. “Simply put, we want to make a positive difference for all those we serve on campus and in the community, so the University is committed to partnering for community, economic and workforce development success.”

Now in its second year, the program gives special consideration to communities that are economically distressed and/or underserved. Only six cities nationwide have been selected as partners, and Livingston, in its collaboration with UWA, is the only Alabama city included. Applicants were evaluated for their commitment to advancing health efforts that are linked to community livability and economic diversification.

The University assumed a lead role in the application, Dr. James Robinson, associate professor of physical education and athletic training, collaborating with UWA’s Office of Sponsored Programs and Research. Robinson also serves as executive director of academic innovation and workforce readiness at UWA.

Robinson will help steer a leadership team comprising university representatives, civic leaders, and elected officials from throughout the at-large Livingston community.

“The City of Livingston has for many years enjoyed a supportive town and gown relationship, and we have seen so many benefits over the years joining forces to boost our community,” said Livingston Mayor Tom Tartt. “Having the movers and shakers of our community at the table with local government and city administration as well as the University, we can have a wide-angle view of our community’s needs, interests, abilities and resources and align those to benefit the greater good.”

The local project is currently in the assessment phase, which involves defining outcomes, identify issues and opportunities, and coordinating community-wide participation. The second phase, convening, includes a two-day workshop that will bring together community members with the facilitation team of consultants and federal and state partners to develop a set of goals and an action plan. In the next steps phase, the facilitation team will work with the steering committee to finalize the action plan for the community.

Workshop dates and other details will be announced as they are developed.

This time, Lucy Walker, trade mark attorney and partner, Barker Brettell does the honours.

× Expand IP

Question: We want to work together with another party — but who owns the IP?

Answer: It’s true what they say; two heads are better than one, especially when you are looking to find a solution to a problem. Collaboration is a fantastic way to help drive improvements and bring big ideas to the markets. But who owns the IP when two parties collaborate? No two sets of circumstances are the same and who owns the IP will depend on how you negotiate the terms of the collaboration agreement.

For example, you could agree that any IP owned prior to the agreement stays with the original owner but any IP created through the collaboration, is jointly owned by all collaborators. Or, if the collaboration is commissioned by a backer, will the backer want to own the IP on the basis without their funds, there would be no developments? If you have the strongest bargaining position in the collaboration, could you negotiate that you own the IP but you will then provide your collaborators with a licence to use the IP.

Once you know who is going to own the IP, you need to make sure a complete collaboration agreement is drafted to address the consequences and mechanics of the IP i.e. who pays for it, who maintains it, who decides where to protect it etc.; the list goes on.

Don’t be put off by the thought of negotiating the terms of a collaboration agreement before you even get a chance to work together. Getting it right from the outset is hugely important and can save you a real headache in the long run.","× Expand IPQuestion: We want to work together with another party — but who owns the IP?

Q: Thanks very much for joining us today Pippa. Today we’re going to talk to us about partnerships and growth, so, on that note, how is technology shaping the number and nature of partnerships in the TMT sector?

Partnerships in the TMT sector are far from new. They have been there since the inception and traditionally TMT companies have used partners as channel partners to take their products to consumers. This is a symbiotic relationship in which both organisations take a share of the end consumer value chain and that’s been a very accepted way of going to market.

Now you’ve got shifting consumer perceptions and a fundamental shift in the way consumers are both perceiving providers and purchasing. Technology changes, which give companies a direct route to those customers through e-commerce and platform business models, are also taking place. This means there are different types and numbers of partnerships that are available to TMT organisations.

In the one sense we are seeing a shift away from traditional channel partners. We are also starting to see competitors coming together within platform business models to market their products and services to end consumers – that’s the main shift we are seeing.

Q: What challenges are companies in the space facing and how can they collaboratively work together to overcome these?

The main challenge is how do you access new forms of growth and how do you tap into new technology.

If you take the example of customer data, this is proliferating and its across multiple touch points. There’s an opportunity for organisations which have access to different types of that data to partner together to offer an enhanced proposition to the customer.

We are seeing mobile network operators and credit card providers being able to stitch together the purchasing behaviours and the geolocation of customers to provide a richer picture of behaviours and therefore provide enhance products to those end consumers.

Q: On that note, what should these businesses look to get out of a partnership?

The main thing is really focusing on that word; ‘partnership’.

There needs to be that symbiosis and there needs to be a shared goal.

If you take companies that are starting out, a partnership is a wonderful way to tap into a different type of skill set and experts in the market without actually inuring costs so ecosystem partners.

What we advise companies to do is to seek genuine partnerships in a way that there is a shared goal and there’s a common value system, but also to seek partnerships that offer a brand perception that enhances the genuine nature of those.

Be quite careful about who your partner with and who you choose to do business with.

Thank you very much for your time, Pippa.

89,https://emerging-europe.com/interviews/nix-solutions-collaborative-partnerships-are-the-future/,"Fri, 08 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Emerging Europe,NIX Solutions: Collaborative partnerships are the future,"Vladimir Kuzmenko, business development director at NIX Solutions, speaks to Craig Turp about the future of IT outsourcing.

Successful outsourcing deals tend to be characterised by a change in the nature of the relationship between the buyer and the vendor towards true partnerships, rather than transactional relationships. Such a partnership means both parties are incentivised by the same outcomes and aligned to the buyer’s objectives. What’s your take on that?

What has made NIX successful for over two decades is that we are always forward-looking when we deliver services and products. While we endeavour to make the project at hand highly successful, our strategy — and, you might say, our company credo — has always been to form solid, long-term partnerships that clients can depend on for years.

I believe that the term partnership can be and often is understood differently by buyers and vendors. Do you think the term outsourcing will be replaced with collaborative partnering?

It’s likely that some part of outsourcing will convert to collaborative partnering. I say “some part” because it means a lot more than the kind of quick money and “we’ve done what you asked for” transaction. Long-term collaborative growth means shared goals and shared risks. Not all companies are willing or equipped to do that.

What is lacking then?

Collaborative partnering requires vendor management maturity, and readiness to invest now in building long-term relations. Not all vendors are ready to go this way.

For example, some of them, known as ‘body-shops’, operate in a fast turnover model, hiring engineers for exact projects and firing them when the project finishes. Such vendors will not invest the full team effort for weeks and months to earn initial trust and gain knowledge. And they won’t send the team onsite at their own expense. As such they’re not prepared to work in a true partnership model.

One day the market will just kick them out, but with current demand I don’t think this will happen anytime soon.

The sector is growing and evolving really fast. If we look at the UK alone, in 2017, 73 per cent of the UK outsourcing industry was comprised of information technology outsourcing (ITO) contracts. UK businesses spent 3.8 billion GBP, more than twice as much as in 2016, on ITO. Is there time for relationship building?

For sure. ITO is aimed at developing and/or supporting a software product or service. If the product/service is successful, its development and support is ongoing. There are several moving parts in this market: competition is strong, users and clients are constantly demanding new features and more user-friendly interfaces, technologies are rapidly evolving, and regulations are getting stricter (for example, GDPR forces companies to add specific features and scenarios to their software). Having a true partner who will help you with ITO is a good idea and finding the right one requires some relationship-building effort.

We have said that the sector is developing fast. How can a vendor be up-to-date with all the changes and developments: automation, AI, IoT as well as legal requirements, such as GDPR?

The short answer is to learn, learn, learn and then, learn again. There are numerous ways to do it.

Build a robust R&D department. Do R&D not only in tech, but also in business and legal domains. Attend important conferences and events. Exchange information even with competitors. Share knowledge within the company. Experiment with your own products in the latest tech and business domains. Work with startups, particularly in a risk-sharing model. And always be eager for more!

What are the biggest challenges that a vendor has to struggle with when providing services to clients?

The biggest challenge, especially with a new client, is getting a true understanding of their business need and finding the best solution for it. It takes a lot of expertise to translate the client requirements into a feasible development plan that your software developers can work from. This must be done way before the project starts, specifically during the discovery phase, which includes a pilot and proof-of-concept tasks.

Otherwise, the true understanding will come after two-three months after the project is done when a lot of time, money and resources has already been wasted.","Vladimir Kuzmenko, business development director at NIX Solutions, speaks to Craig Turp about the future of IT outsourcing.

Telemundo

It's the moment of truth for Telemundo, with the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia kicking off exactly one week from today. Will its coverage meet or exceed all expectations? The network, which in 2011 secured the U.S. Spanish-language World Cup broadcast rights for the first time in its history, spent $600 million for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments and is heavily invested in making it an unforgettable, immersive event for viewers in broadcast and digital platforms, offering wall-to-wall coverage, virtual reality experiences and special content.

It has also lined up numerous partnerships to raise its visibility and score its own goal: attract more viewers, regardless of language.

Today, Telemundo announced its latest partnership with Google. For the first time ever, World Cup fans will be able to find matches and scores in Spanish in the U.S. and see close to real-time video highlights from Telemundo Deportes, including in-game clips featuring goals, halftime highlights, match previews, winning probabilities, line-ups and news within Google Search.

This World Cup initiative expands on Telemundo’s strategic presence and partnership with YouTube, which includes more than five official channels with more than 14 million subscribers. The network will upload more than 1,000 hours of exclusive content across digital platforms, including content from YouTube Creators and fan reactions from across the world on the official Telemundo YouTube channel.

The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia games on Telemundo will also be offered on YouTube TV, allowing subscribers to record and watch games via the YouTube TV Cloud DVR feature.

“Soccer is more exciting in Spanish, and we’re thrilled to be amplifying the access and engagement of the World Cup through Google and YouTube technology,” said Peter E. Blacker, Telemundo's EVP, Digital and Emerging Business.

Last week, Telemundo also partnered with Spanish soccer star David Villa and his newly-launched production company, Designated Player, to produce soccer content around the World Cup to air across all Telemundo network and digital platforms.

As part of the deal, Villa, who played for the Spanish national team in the 2010 and 2014 World Cups and is currently captain of MLS team New York City FC, will narrate a video series titled ""Como Llegaron"" (How Did They Get Here), detailing the ups and downs that 10 national teams (the eight Latin American countries participating in the tournament, as well as Spain and Portugal) endured in order to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.

Telemundo sends small army of staffers to Russia

Telemundo and Universo networks will broadcast all 64 World Cup games live from Russia - about 500 hours - starting with the first match between Russia and Saudi Arabia on opening day, Thursday, June 14, at 11 a.m. Over 1,000 hours of additional content will be featured on digital platforms. All matches will be live streamed on TelemundoDeportes.com as well as via the Telemundo Deportes En Vivo and NBC Sports apps.

According to the network, it is sending a staff of 500 to Russia with hundreds more working the World Cup in Miami, adding several million more to the price tag of producing and broadcasting the month-long soccer tournament. Staffers started arriving May 1 in preparation for the event with the sportscasting team landing in Russia this week.

The on-air team will include Telemundo Deportes’ award-winning television presenters and former soccer star players and coaches to serve as experts and join the announce teams for relevant matches.

Five-time Emmy award winner Andrés Cantor will lead Telemundo Deportes’ coverage. Former Mexican National Team and Chivas player Manuel Sol will join Cantor (play-by-play) for at least 14 games during the group stage. Soccer commentator and two-time Emmy award nominee Sammy Sadovnik will serve as play-by-play commentator alongside sports analyst Eduardo Biscayart on 12 games throughout the group stage. Copán Álvarez will provide play-by-play alongside Viviana Vila, the first female analyzing a men’s World Cup. Erasmo Provenza will serve as play-by-play commentator alongside 1986 World Cup champion Claudio Borghi, who played for Argentina's national team with Maradona.

The four announce teams and the entire commentary team of experts will be based in Russia throughout the duration of the tournament, June 14 - July 15, with commentators calling the action live from stadiums for the majority of games.

That's a stark contrast to Fox, which is broadcasting the games for English-speaking audiences, but will be doing play-by-play commentary for the majority from its West L.A. studios - not stadiums in Russia.

Soccer stars recruited as experts for game coverage analysis

Experts include:

Carlos Hermosillo - former soccer star and one of the all-time scorers for the Mexican national team. He currently co-hosts Telemundo's weekend show “Titulares y Más” with Miguel Gurwitz.

Diego Forlán - Uruguayan professional soccer player who currently plays for Hong Kong Premier League club Kitchee. Considered one of Uruguay's greatest players, he participated in three FIFA World Cups, including the 2010 tournament where he received the Golden Ball as the best player.

Juan Pablo Ángel - retired Colombian soccer star, best known for playing with clubs around the world, including Premier League’s Aston Villa, Atletico Nacional and River Plate. He who represented the Colombian National Team during the qualifiers for the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cup.

Juan Pablo Sorín - retired Argentinean former soccer player and sports broadcaster. Represented the Argentina national team at two FIFA World Cups.

Teófilo ”Nene” Cubillas - former soccer star, considered one of Peru’s greatest players. Represented Peru in three FIFA World Cups, including the 1970 and 1978 tournaments. As the last Peruvian star featured in a World Cup 36 years ago, he'll provide commentary during the Peru matches.

Rolando Fonseca - Costa Rica’s national team’s all-time top goal scorer, widely known among Mexican soccer fans for playing for Liga MX’s Pachuca.

Jesús “Chucho” Ramirez - former Mexican soccer player, who served as manager of the Mexico National Team and won the U-17 World Cup in 2005.

Tab Ramos - former American soccer player, who played as a midfielder in Spain, Mexico, and the United States and participated in three FIFA World Cups with the US men's national team. He currently serves as head coach of the United States U-20 team and US Soccer Federation’s Youth Technical Director.

Horacio Elizondo - former international football referee from Argentina, best known for his officiation throughout the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

JEDDAH: With Ramadan drawing to a close, a family and friends charity celebrated the success of their ninth consecutive year in operation ahead of Eid festivities.

Abdulmajeed Hashem, the 25-year-old founder of Jeddah-based charity Khair for All, told Arab News about how his family and friends played their part in giving and lending a helping hand this holy month.

Whilst endeavoring to get involved in the spirit of Ramadan aged 16, the Jeddah-born Hashem discovered that local charities in his area had too many volunteers. However, he knew that there was no cap on good that can be done — so he founded his own charity.

Khair, the Arabic term for good, well-being, blessings and benevolence, was the operative word founder Hashem chose for Khair for All.

“We started in about 2012 with a small group of my cousins and friends. We decided to start by giving out meals for Iftar Sayim,” Hashem told Arab News.

Iftar Sayim is the charitable act of providing ready meals, usually dates, water, laban and a sambosa, to Muslims in Ramadan for them to break their fasts with.

“That simple beginning turned into something that grew in size, in number of volunteers, in effort — we just kind of started from there and it naturally grew.”

Hashem and his team purchased Iftar Sayim meals using their own money and began distributing them in the suburbs of Jeddah — soon they found themselves in a daily routine they could not do without.

“Meeting here everyday, setting up the packs and distributing them ourselves has really been a bonding experience with our group,” he said. “We really enjoy this activity — it’s become a part of our Ramadan that’s very important to us.”

The global health crisis did not stand in the way of the charity’s vision for 2021, and while adjustments had to be made and precautions taken, they swiftly adapted and made the necessary changes for another successful Ramadan.

Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 has played a role in getting the youth moving, according to the Khair for All founder. “I feel like with the new direction a lot more of my friends have been more willing to volunteer,” he said. “More people are ready to go and take on these projects.

“I’ve definitely noticed an increase in enthusiasm and energy in the past few years, and I think it’s very much linked to the direction of the country.”

Khair for All sets no limits on where and how it can be of service, and so ventured into more sustainable projects in which their effects will be seen in the years to come.

While Iftar Sayim is the basis for why Khair for All began, in 2014 Hashem and his team discovered that there were more ways to help the community than to simply help break their fasts.

“We later shifted to giving monthly packs,” the Khair for All founder said. “We kind of understood that families needed something more stable, something that would make them not have to worry about where their food was coming in for the next month.”

Since then, packaging monthly supplies consisting of basic goods and necessities has become the primary activity of the charity — and they soon found themselves working with local schools.

“We like to have more of a lasting impact in the places we’re helping out, rather than just providing a meal and then going back home,” Hashem said. “We want to provide something to the communities that we can see grow ourselves, so we’re really focusing a lot on education.”

Hashem and the team began pooling money together each year to improve the state of impoverished schools in Jeddah.

“Vision 2030 emphasizes a lot of the power the youth can have,” he said. “We believe any way we can make the schools a better learning environment for the kids would be a way of having a more lasting impact.

“We do a lot of work getting new chairs, painting and providing internet — and I hope we can continue to do more things like that in the future.”

Hashem believes that more direct communication with people in the community is necessary to address the real underlying issues, rather than just basing measures on assumptions.

“Basically, put our energy into what they tell us they need,” he said. “Talk to everyone there, and get to know them really well — that way, it’s addressing actual problems.”","However, he knew that there was no cap on good that can be done — so he founded his own charity.

Blue Prism, a prime mover of the robotic process automation (RPA) market, is showcasing its vision of building out a workforce of intelligent, automated digital workers at its Blue Prism World event in London today.

The company’s RPA offerings are designed to augment and assist the skills of human workers, rather than replace them, said the company this morning, and are increasingly enhanced by artificial intelligence and cognitive services.

Additional skills

Blue Prism has announced six new “intelligent automation” skills for digital workers, which the company said “provide a foundation for true enterprise RPA”.

These are:

Knowledge and Insight: Using pre-built integrations with AI platforms such as AWS, Google, IBM, and Microsoft, Blue Prism’s software robots can now “identify trends and patterns in text communications to isolate issues, and seamlessly turn that communication into an action item that can be assigned to the right person or system”, said the company.

These “digital workers” can operate “within any application screen in the same way as a human can”. Integrations with the aforementioned AI platforms allow Blue Prism’s robots to use machine learning-enabled computer vision to understand image data and documents, added the company.

Problem Solving: Logic, business, and system problems can now also be solved more efficiently at scale “without human intervention”, claimed the company this morning. Its software robots can also tackle complex business problems that require “both deterministic and probabilistic, machine learning-driven” solutions, it added.

All of these functions “mark a clear line of delineation over desktop-based and other automation tools”, explained the company.

New partnerships

Blue Prism has also announced new integration and partnership deals with Ephesoft, TimelinePI, and XpertRule – along with Appian and [24]7.ai – to help drive the adoption of AI in the enterprise.

“As businesses continue to evolve, we’ve witnessed a growing desire for organisations to establish a solid foundation of automation that’s intelligent, connected, and easy to control,” said Dave Moss, co-founder and CTO of Blue Prism.

“By coupling our automation capabilities with the most innovative cognitive and AI technologies on the market, we are augmenting human workers to achieve and do more. We’re delivering an intelligent digital workforce now.”

By building a foundation of “intelligent automation”, the company believes that cognitive technologies such as AI, machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and neural networks can dramatically expand horizons for autonomy, process scope, transaction speed, business revenue gains, and cost savings.

More, it believes that these “intelligent automation” skills can be deployed as easily as downloading an app on a smartphone. “Many tasks that were once considered only manageable by humans can now also be done by digital workers, working alongside their human counterparts”, it said this morning.

So the questions for many organisations must be: at what point does assistance and augmentation become replacement and human redundancy? And how transparent and auditable are these machine-operated processes, based on what rules and data?

As many organisations rush to implement cognitive services and automation tools – sometimes driven more by a desire to slash costs than to support strategic business goals – these questions will become increasingly important to answer.

Internet of Business is putting these points and more to Blue Prism CTO Dave Moss in an exclusive interview, which we will be publishing shortly.","Blue Prism, a prime mover of the robotic process automation (RPA) market, is showcasing its vision of building out a workforce of intelligent, automated digital workers at its Blue Prism World event in London today.

Dell State of Gaming Report debunks gaming stereotypes

Who’s that player you’re competing with across the digital transom? It’s not necessarily the stereotypical teen loner playing in his parents’ basement. The gaming industry has changed at such an exponential rate in recent years, that the face of gaming has transformed before our eyes, both literally and figuratively. An extensive survey of 5,763 video game players in 11 countries, commissioned by Dell, revealed that today’s gamers are quite diverse; from a coworker with two kids, to the woman next to you at the gym, or, most commonly, a spouse, sibling or friend.

Through online platforms and social media, and fuelled by the popularity of esports, the gaming community is ever-expanding while also growing in diversity and inclusiveness. Gone are the days that being called a “gamer” is derogatory. According to those surveyed, fewer than one in 10 feel either “judged,” “childish” or “embarrassed” being called a “gamer” (8-9% each). Instead, they consider “gamer” a positive label and feel “fun” (35%), “cool” (29%), or “excited” (26%) as a result. While some gamers are willing to self-sacrifice to continue gaming, the majority are well-rounded with interests in music, sports, travelling and socializing. The gaming community has also become less of a “boy’s club,” with only 14% of gamers globally concerned about the gender of their rivals. In general, gamers are welcoming to whoever is behind the computer. When it comes to being matched with rival gamers, culture/ethnicity (8%), political views (7%), and sexual orientation (6%) are for the most part inconsequential to a player. What matters most is the other gamer’s skill level (40%).

Launched at the Partnership Exchange, taking place alongside the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), the guidebook works at two levels: 1) the broader partnering journey of two or more institutions, to maximize the value that the partnership is creating; and 2) at the level of individual partner institutions, such that each maximizes the value of their being in the partnership. Working at each of these levels, two tools – a partnership value creation tool and an individual partner value tool – are featured as annexes.

The goal is to ensure that partnerships are greater than the sum of their parts.

Looking at the partnership as a whole, the guidebook defines collaborative advantage, or the power that partnership can bring to an issue or set of issues. This advantage yields a “partnership delta,” defined as the difference that a partnership can make compared to a single-actor or single-sector approach. The goal, TPI Executive Director, Darian Stibbe, noted, is to ensure that partnerships are greater than the sum of their parts.

Looking at value creation from the perspective of a participating institution, the guidebook distinguishes achievement of an organization’s mission – be it direct or indirect impact – from the value gained as an organization, which can include increases in funding, boosts to reputation, and capacity building, among other benefits.

The guide articulates eleven different ways in which partnerships create value, including but not limited to: bringing together complementary resources; sharing risk; shifting norms or raising standards; and scaling up across geographies. Illustrating the benefits and lessons, three case studies spanning energy, data, gender and health highlight key steps taken throughout the partnership cycle and the multiple value adds delivered.

Just over 1000 days after the Goals were agreed upon, the SDG Business Forum opened with a call on all participants to think critically about the progress made so far, considering the long way ahead.

“Three years in, I think we need a reality check. We’re not going fast enough. How do we scale the positive experiences presented at the #SDGBizForum? And how do we help entrepreneurs do the same for their sustainable innovations?” @ICCSecGen @iccwbo #HLPF pic.twitter.com/oixlVGtPgx — SDG Business Forum (@SDGBizforum) July 17, 2018

Under this year’s theme ‘Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies’, 47 countries reported on progress so far. But according to a new report by the United Nations Development Solutions, no country is on track to deliver on the 2030 Agenda. This concerning trend underscores the importance of partnering with all economic actors in society to ensure that implementation of the 17 Goals will be realised in time to achieve our common objectives within the next 12 years.

Business is already partnering to speed up progress for the SDGs, but more can be done to establish action-oriented collaborations with the United Nations and governments around the world. Here are four takeaways on how we can improve partnerships in the year ahead:

1. We need to be transparent about both progress and failures

It was clear that both business, governments and the UN representatives at the Forum want to see more transparency in discussions around the SDGs.

Jean-Pierre Clamadieu, CEO, Solvay, said that “transparency is critical to raising benchmarks and keeping companies challenged,” and called on companies to continue their transformation for the SDGs. “Things are changing — probably not at the speed we would like — but we are moving in the right direction.” “I’m a big believer in naming and faming companies that are doing good, and naming and shaming those who do not play a role,” said Erik Solheim, Executive Director, UN Environment. Rebecca Self, CEO Sustainable Finance, HSBC, highlighted the need for more alignment in the way we report on sustainability targets and investments with ESG policies. “I think we need to be more innovative about our reporting processes.”

Tonye Cole of the Sahara Group, Nigeria, intervened from the audience to share an example of ways to develop Voluntary National Reviews (VNR), the mechanism by which governments report on SDG progress at the High-level Political Forum each year. By collaborating with local business organisations and the government, the group has now established a dialogue where Nigerian businesses feed information on activities that are later taken up in the country’s official government communiqué on SDGs.

To provide governments with an idea of what business is doing in all countries around the world for the SDGs in focus this year, ICC launched a report at the SDG Business Forum on ‘Business for Sustainable and Resilient Societies’, which highlights case studies from businesses taking action, and policy recommendations on how governments can help more companies implement the SDGs into their strategies. Here are a few highlights from the report:

2. Trade is key to sustainable development and inclusive growth

“Trade is essentially a partnership that can drive economic growth, increase incomes […] and empower societies,” said David MacLennan, CEO, Cargill, during the panel discussion on ‘Leadership and Innovation for the SDGs’. “In a time when trade is under attack, we cannot forget to talk about its positive impact on sustainable development.”

Working together for the SDGs requires governments, businesses and civil society to act openly and engage in partnership across borders. Participants at the SDG Business Forum agreed that trade can fuel inclusive growth, if a dialogue that includes both big and small businesses is established. The Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation is a great example of how the public and private sector can partner to enable more efficient cross-border trade.

3. Technology can help speed up transformation for the SDGs

Technology can not only help governments and businesses communicate digitally and thereby be more transparent about progress for the SDGs; it can also provide governments with the tools to improve lives. Financial solutions, digital access to information on health and connectivity to global markets are just some of the benefits that Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) can bring.

ICC just published a paper on ICTs’ role in fuelling the Goals in focus this year. Read the full report with more case studies like this:

The Global Enabling Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) in partnership with Accenture also presented a new report called ‘Enabling the Global Goals’, which points to strong positive correlations between digital access and the SDGs.

Several countries and organizations outlined examples of SIDS partnerships and initiatives they launched. Many also called for: predictability and continuity of SIDS support; ensuring monitoring and accountability of partnerships at the global and national levels; and strengthening capacity building, including on resource mobilization.

The annual Global Multi-Stakeholder SIDS Partnership Dialogue is one component of the SIDS Partnership Framework established by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) following the Third International Conference on SIDS, held in Samoa in 2014. The Dialogue provides a global platform for SIDS and partners to review progress of existing partnerships for SIDS, launch new partnerships, and allow stakeholders to exchange lessons learned and identify good practices. The 2018 Dialogue took place at the UN Headquarters in New York, US, in parallel with the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

Addressing the meeting on 12 July 2018, Peter Thomson, Ambassador and UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Ocean, noted that the UN Ocean Conference in June 2017 resulted in over 1,400 voluntary commitments to advance implementation of SDG 14 (Life below water), and a large number of these commitments were announced by SIDS countries. He remarked that the financial sector is “getting on board” and many governments are being more active than before on the oceans Goal He added that multilateralism is more needed than ever, and genuine and durable partnerships are “the best way forward.”

François Martel, Secretary-General, Pacific Islands Development Forum, said partnerships need to focus more on community resilience, and remarked that most of the best partnerships come from islands and are replicable. Simona Marinescu, UN Resident Coordinator and UN Development Programme (UNDP) Resident Representative in Samoa, stressed the importance of internal partnerships within the SIDS, and noted the need for relevance, respect for sovereignty, commonality and additionality, and political consensus for meaningful partnerships.

Fekitamoeloa Katoa ‘Utoikamanu, High Representative for the least developed countries (LDCs), landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) and SIDS, remarked that recurrent natural disasters in SIDS countries make it difficult to attract financing, and indicated that the 2018 SIDS Global Business Network Forum in Mauritius, convened by the UN Office of the High Representative for Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (OHRLLS) together with the government of Mauritius, was the third in a series of SIDS private sector partnership fora launched by UN-OHRLLS and its partners. She noted that the one-day high-level review of progress on the implementation of the SAMOA Pathway scheduled for September 2019 will be an opportunity to assess progress and consider priorities for action in the coming years.

Elliott Harris, Assistant Secretary-General for Economic Development, Chief Economist, UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) noted that preparations for the 2019 high-level review are already underway. He noted that DESA, with the funding support provided by Italy, is undertaking a project to increase stakeholder capacity to support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Samoa Pathway in line with the high-level review preparatory process.

Among other initiatives, Aliioaiga Feturi Elisaia, Permanent Representative of Samoa, noted that the Pacific Resilience Fund seeks to provide resources to South Pacific communities to invest in their resilience to climate change. Saud Al Shamsi, Deputy Permanent Representative of United Arab Emirates (UAE), outlined the UAE-Pacific Partnership Fund (UAE-PPF), and the UAE-Caribbean Renewable Energy Fund (UAE-CREF), two funds of US$50 million each, for renewable energy projects in Pacific Island nations and Caribbean countries. He called on SIDS to consider forecast-based financing, an innovative mechanism where early preparedness and community-level actions are pre-planned based on credible forecasts, and are funded and implemented before disasters strike.

Ahmed’ Abdel-Latif, International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) noted that sustainable energy is a key area for SIDS partnerships, and underlined the success of the SIDS Lighthouses Initiative, that seeks to bring together SIDS and partners to promote the accelerated deployment of renewables on islands. He also reported that 20 SIDS adopted national energy roadmaps to support their transition to renewable energy. The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) provided several examples of partnerships it carried out with the SIDS, and said it is planning to revive the University Consortium of Small Island States (UCSIS) together with DESA and other partners.

Canada told the SIDS “your challenges are our challenges,” adding her country would invest $162 million to support the goals outlined in the ‘Charlevoix Blueprint for Healthy Oceans, Seas and Resilient Communities’ issued during the Group of 7 (G7) Summit in Charlevoix, Canada, in June 2018. She also noted that as part of the G7 Presidency, Canada will host a meeting of G7 Environment, Energy and Oceans Ministers in Halifax, Nova Scotia, from 19-21 September 2018. The meeting will consider the theme ‘Working Together on Climate Change, Oceans and Clean Energy’ and discuss global climate action, clean growth and sustainable finance, resilient coasts and fisheries, plastic pollution, energy security and clean energy.

Norway said: it organized a week-long capacity building workshop for SIDS to prepare for the marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) negotiations; it supports a World Health Organization (WHO) initiative to address the health effects of climate change, particularly on SIDS; and has worked to establish a multi-donor trust fund on marine litter and pollution in the World Bank.

New Zealand reported that it is supporting the trust fund established for the SAMOA Pathway high-level review, and that out of seven SIDS partnerships registered on the SIDS Action Platform, three are now completed. He said New Zealand announced an increase in its development cooperation financing, with most of it allocated to SIDS. Australia remarked that it will allocate $1.3 billion to the Pacific region next year. The Russian Federation said it provided humanitarian assistance, financing and other types of support to Vanuatu and other countries that were impacted by hurricanes Irma and Maria, and is working to strengthen capacity to manage natural disasters.

Seychelles noted that it launched Blue Bonds, and asked for support on setting up the enabling environment, the architecture and the mechanisms to establish the partnerships needed to address SIDS challenges. Belize announced it will phase out single-use plastic products by April 2019, and has revised its legislation to better protect its mangroves.

The Dialogue was organized by DESA and OHRLLS, in close consultation with the Steering Committee on Partnerships for SIDS, co-chaired by Belize and Ireland.

""Singapore pursued sustainable development even before the term became fashionable,"" he said.



""Since independence, we have tried balancing environmental considerations with economic development, believing that the two are complementary, not contradictory.""

In a Facebook post about his speech, the minister said he spoke on the progress Singapore had made in its ""unwavering pursuit"" of sustainable development.

Said Mr Masagos: ""Our path of sustainable development was not without challenges, and these achievements are testament to the strong collaborative partnerships built between our Government, industries and people, as well as Singapore’s firm belief in building a clean and green city that we can call home.

""But we will continue to work hard to improve the well-being of our people.""



The HLPF is a global forum for providing political leadership, guidance and recommendations on implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development - a commitment to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development by 2030 worldwide - and its 17 sustainable development goals.

At the forum, 47 countries, including Singapore, presented their voluntary national reviews over three days of ministerial meetings from Jul 16 to 18.

Presenting Singapore's review, Mr Masagos highlighted the importance of ""collaborative multi-stakeholder partnerships"", saying that in the first half of 2018 - Singapore's Year of Climate Action - close to a quarter of a million Singaporeans, corporations and civil society organisations have pledged to save energy and water, practise recycling and fight climate change.

""Partnerships are key to sustainability,"" said the minister. ""For a decade, Singapore has been hosting the World Cities Summit, Singapore International Water Week and Clean-Enviro Summit Singapore to share and co-create solutions for urban sustainability.""



As Chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Singapore also convened the Special ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Climate Action last week, said Mr Masagos. Together with key partners, it reaffirmed its commitment to the Paris Agreement and regional action to tackle climate change.

The minister also gave an overview of Singapore's progress in implementing the sustainable development goals.

Firstly he spoke about the issue of water resilience.

Pointing out that the World Resources Institute ranks Singapore as the country most at risk of water stress by 2040, Mr Masagos highlighted features such as Singapore's national water recycling system that transforms wastewater into reclaimed NEWater, as well as the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System that collects and transports wastewater.

This will be extended by 100km by 2025 to transport and turn more wastewater into NEWater for industrial use and domestic consumption, said Mr Masagos.

The former teammates at Real Madrid promise to be a fascinating duo and their partnership could possibly yield tons of goals.

Cristiano Ronaldo is often labelled as one of the greatest players of all time and it is no surprise that any player will want to play alongside the legendary number 7. While his real Madrid stint has been hugely successful with lots of trophies to show for including 4 champions league titles, Ronaldo was very often left alone with the burden. But Higuain presents something Cristiano Ronaldo will appreciate that is his work rate. The Portuguese forward loves to play alongside hardworking footballers and relishes the opportunities presented to him in front of the goal.

Many great players have had the opportunity to play alongside the 5-time ballon dor winner from Portugal but only a few have been able to leave an impression on the mighty Cristiano Ronaldo.

Over the years Ronaldo has played with some of the greats of the game but there have been 4 men who formed a deadly partnership with the Real Madrid winger. Here we present you the top 4 partners Cristiano Ronaldo had in club football:

#4 Angel di Maria, Real Madrid

Angel di Maria

The Argentine sensation Angel di Maria played with Cristiano Ronaldo for 4 seasons and it is fair to say that the Portuguese winger loved the presence of di Maria.

Di Maria with all the tricks in his bag baffled defenders on his way to provide Cristiano Ronaldo with the perfect chances in front of the goal.

The Argentine was named the man of the match in real’s champions league triumph over Atletico Madrid in 2014. The duo did help real in winning La Liga once, in 2011-12 with di Maria and Ronaldo being the main men responsible for Los Blancos' title triumph.

Di Maria famously assisted Ronaldo in real’s 1-0 victory over bitter rivals Barcelona in 2011 Copa del ray final. this was the duo's first trophy for the club and thus began their beautiful journey of terrorizing defences around Europe.

Ronaldo's former employees and di maria's future ones- manchester united did face the wrath of real Madrid's sensational duo as the Argentine once again turned out to be the provider for Cristiano and the Portuguese did the rest with a towering header to level their round of 16 match of UCL at Bernabeu in 2013.

Jaime Miranda and colleagues argue that partnerships are key to building and sustaining health research capacity in Latin America

One of the main objectives of the Pan American Health Organization’s (PAHO) policy on research for health1 is to develop partnerships to implement appropriate and sustainable health strategies. The policy aims to facilitate the development and scale-up of affordable and accessible products and technologies relevant to the public health challenges of the Americas; develop research groups in PAHO member states with skills that enable the exchange of research knowledge; and facilitate collaboration between diverse stakeholders including the public, government, and the academic and private sectors to tackle national and regional priorities.1

Attempts to establish partnerships in the region date back to the 1970s. For example, UNESCO, the United Nations Development Programme, and various other UN agencies funded south-south partnerships among institutions in Latin America—to support research networks in biology, microbiology, and biomedical sciences.2 The objective was to promote knowledge exchange and build research capacity in countries with less well established research infrastructure by training their scientists in larger and more experienced institutions in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. However, many networks broke down because of a lack of national funding. Decades later, some noteworthy examples are emerging of north-south and south-south collaborations and partnerships.

Partnership and collaboration are often used interchangeably, but the relationships are different.3 Collaboration entails parties working together in an intellectual endeavour, whereas partnership implies a relationship between equals who share mutually defined objectives and goals.3

Developing, implementing, and sustaining partnerships can be challenging and require an understanding of the factors that hinder or promote these partnerships. Cultural barriers and knowledge silos can also affect the pursuit of meaningful partnerships. Here we explore some features of existing research partnerships that are maximising funding opportunities and succeeding in sharing resources, goals, and objectives in Latin America. Case studies were selected to highlight interdisciplinary, interagency, north-south, south-south, and academia-industry interactions.

Partnerships to produce new knowledge The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the United Health Group have identified a pressing need to build research capacity and infrastructure to tackle the major challenge of the growing non-communicable disease burden in low and middle income countries.4 Together, they set up the Chronic Disease Initiative, which ran between 2009 and 2014, to support a network of 11 research centres in 10 low and middle income countries, four of them in Latin America (Mexico, Guatemala, Peru, and Argentina).4 Each centre of excellence partnered at least one high income academic institution in the United States, Canada, Australia, or Europe and a local organisation, which could be a university or institution focused on research or healthcare.4 Low and middle income countries were the main recipients of grants awarded by the programme, which meant that many had to develop quickly scientifically and bring their administrative and grant management procedures up to international standards.4 As of 2016, the four centres of excellence in the Latin America region had engaged in 14 collaborative research projects encompassing various research designs, producing 86 publications and 97 research presentations and training 216 postgraduate researchers.4 Additionally, this partnership facilitated a data harmonisation process that enabled further research questions focused on non-communicable diseases to be explored by centres of excellence in the region. The centres of excellence in Latin America and their global partners mutually benefited from the programme, not only from the scientific advancements but also from the interaction at personal and institutional levels across the continuum, from research conception to disseminating research findings. The centres of excellence for chronic non-communicable diseases achieved success by strengthening research capacity, sharing data and networks, promoting profit and merit pooling, and transforming a single funding effort into a long term venture. Unfortunately, without sustained funding ongoing interactions may suffer, putting the partnership and its research pursuits at risk. This emphasises the importance of supporting networks working in line with current research needs and studying health from a multidisciplinary and multimorbidity perspective instead of working in silos.5

Partnerships promoting stakeholder engagement Researchers in the region rarely have the opportunity and support from governments to test and recommend public health interventions. Project GUIA (Guide for Useful Interventions for Physical Activity in Brazil and Latin America) is a cross-national multidisciplinary research partnership that has taken a different approach. Rather than evaluating new interventions through a randomised controlled trial and then scaling up those that are successful, the project evaluates public health interventions that are already being implemented in Latin America. Using an iterative process of evaluation, collating evidence, and adapting interventions, Project GUIA has produced academic research evaluations of different public health programmes, leading to federal and national scale-up in Brazil of programmes offering physical activity classes in the community (Academia da Cidade) and programmes encouraging physical activity through provision of public spaces and resources (Academia da Saúde). Similar programmes in other countries, such as Colombia and Chile, are also being evaluated and scaled up.6 Project GUIA was funded and coordinated by the Centers for Disease Control and the Prevention Research Centre in Saint Louis, US, in partnership with three universities in Brazil.6 The project made use of established public health ties and collaborations between the countries’ governments that existed before the project started. A diverse network of partners in academia, government (at all levels), and non-governmental institutions (for example, the PAHO and CELAFISC (Centro de Estudos do Laboratório de Aptidão Física de São Caetano do Sul)) were invited to take part in the project. An important part of its success was the project’s approach to cultural sensitivity, which enabled recipient partners to identify or prioritise research efforts according to the local context.6 Project GUIA exemplifies the importance of interacting with stakeholders from the outset, strengthening the capacity of researchers and policymakers to use and generate practice based evidence. Disseminating findings for use by regional entities and implementing them within programmes has been recognised as an important aspect of the partnership.6 Reflections on the success of Project GUIA have also highlighted the importance of timing. The project began as Brazilian public health agencies were ready to embrace initiatives for non-communicable disease prevention6 and at a time when a pool of talented young investigators in Latin America was emerging,7 showing that investment in researchers early on in their career can develop into larger initiatives. However, retaining such talent requires further investment. Without such support, it will be a challenge to maintain a flow of talent for working, innovating, and advancing public health efforts to tackle non-communicable diseases in the region. A critical mass of talent is key in using their experience to promote the lessons learnt or sustain knowledge and policy engagement at various levels.

Partnerships for more appropriate and affordable technologies Transferring innovations from one region to another does not simply result in desired outcomes, and developing new medical technologies costs time and money. Partnership will therefore be crucial for implementing appropriate and affordable medical technology in Latin America. Partnerships between academia and industry, including north-south and south-south collaboration, could lead to more cost effective, appropriate, affordable, and sustainable interventions for the region’s major public health challenges. Moreover, by engaging multiple entities within and between institutions these partnerships can help to build capacity for interdisciplinary research and researchers in Latin America who engage in research and development and innovation. One example in the region where partnership is being encouraged for global health research innovation is the competitive funding provided by the National Institutes of Health, through its National Cancer Institute. These partnerships are especially relevant given the disease burden in the region: 85% of cervical cancers worldwide occur in low and middle income countries, with 16% of cases in the Americas.8 One of the current partnerships supported by National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute funding includes public and private institutions in Latin America and the US looking at the accessible and affordable use of molecular diagnostics in the early detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) subtypes that can lead to cervical cancer. Specifically, researchers from Latin America and the International Agency for Research on Cancer are working to develop an HPV test based on detecting the activity of oncoprotein E6/E7, which is present in the eight most common HPV subtypes associated with cervical cancer. The study will use pre-existing clinical research networks in Latin America to assess the test’s potential as the standard screening tool for cervical cancer.9 Another example of a partnership supported by this programme which built on existing networks in Latin America includes the transformation of a non-gas based ablative device, the CryoPen(R) Cryosurgical System, into an inexpensive and portable cryotherapy device that can be operated by any healthcare provider.10 The industry, academia, and government partnerships, as described in the policy on Research for Health, rely on setting a joint agenda clarifying responsibilities, strengthening capacity, and sharing data and networks for a long lasting impact on current and emerging public health challenges. However, these partnerships could be at risk if multiple agencies cannot match or align priorities, and changes in political agendas may create obstacles. The development of these partnerships relies on existing and future funding opportunities. Unless the partners concerned have a sustained product development plan, there is the risk that when the funding ends the interactions facilitated by the partnerships may cease, putting at risk the research and innovation process and, therefore, its targeted products.

Discussion Multidisciplinary partnerships promote greater understanding among stakeholders across public and private sectors both nationally and internationally. They are key to tackling current and future health challenges: treating communicable diseases and non-communicable diseases, sustaining public health interventions, and creating innovative solutions for common problems that can be applied in low and middle income countries. For partnerships to be effective, stakeholders need to agree a shared vision and mission; negotiate roles, responsibilities, and actions; define aims; and establish processes for negotiations and sharing power.11 Creating strategic alliances with all potential stakeholders (governments, universities, private sector, funders, international organisations, professional societies, community based organisations, and patient groups) is necessary to tackle national priorities through research for health. Partnerships between different stakeholders are also crucial in achieving the aims of the policy on research for health: improving equity, health, and development.12 Nascent research partnerships often fail because of unrealistic budgets and a lack of leadership, negotiation, teamwork, and management skills. Such skills are currently acquired by researchers in Latin America in a learning-by-doing fashion, late on in a professional’s career. Introducing and building such skills during undergraduate and postgraduate training could lead to long lasting and sustainable relationships of equals, a prerequisite for meaningful partnerships. Incorporating these skills into the curriculum will require another partnership: one between academic institutions and governments for capacity building. The Latin America region can take advantage of its diverse population and common languages, mainly Spanish and Portuguese, to build partnerships that would be unlikely to work otherwise. We will have to adapt, as existing challenges (that is, the unfinished agenda of infectious diseases, strengthening health systems, and achieving universal healthcare) will be paired with newer ones, such as multimorbidity, non-communicable diseases, and big data approaches for research—issues that will be better dealt with through successful partnerships.13 PAHO’s policy on research for health provides a basis for involving and aligning multiple agencies dedicated to a common goal: research for health and equity. These alliances and their outputs will be crucial for strengthening health systems dealing with major public health challenges. They will allow benchmarking on health advances, so countries can make evidence informed plans for improving the overall quality of, and access to, health services—both being major pillars of the universal health strategy that PAHO and all member states have committed to implement. Key messages Partnerships have been, and will continue to be, crucial for advancing quality health research in Latin America and worldwide.

PAHO’s policy on research for health guides Latin America and provides strong support to promote partnerships.

Research partnerships in the region should be between equals who share mutually defined objectives and goals.

For partnerships to be effective, stakeholders need to agree a shared vision and mission; negotiate roles, responsibilities, and actions; define aims; and establish processes for negotiations and sharing power.

Not all partnerships are identical, and they should evolve based on their unique strengths.

Latin America will need to adapt to a changing world by sharing information. Data pooling initiatives will challenge existing collaboration paradigms, and a partnership framework can help determine a way forward for the region.

102,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/07/20/maximizing-influencer-partnerships-means-getting-micro/,"Fri, 20 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Forbes Now,Maximizing Influencer Partnerships Means Getting Micro,"Microinfluencers made a name for themselves in 2017, and their ability to lead the masses has only grown in 2018. These social media celebrities may vary in follower count, but they all share one thing: an audience of super-engaged users. Forget the big names and, instead, take advantage of these small but powerful internet personalities.

Investing in up-and-coming talent may seem counterintuitive until you consider the value of this targeted engagement. More agencies recognize that promoting a message to a huge pool of consumers means nothing if it’s not a good fit for the brand. And based on our experience, microinfluencers provide equal (if not greater) engagement as their macro counterparts, plus more intimate audience relationships, the opportunity for longer-term partnerships and improved return on investment (ROI).

Here’s what you need to know to craft your own marketing strategy with these internet icons in mind.

Where Are We Now?

There’s no current standard for how much companies are spending on influencers. Although the largest majority in Linqia’s The State of Influencer Marketing reported spending $25,000 to $50,000, the full range stretched from less than $10,000 to $500,000 and beyond. The beauty industry was the first (and most effective) industry to capitalize on influencer potential. Having started representing clientele in beauty, I’ve witnessed the influencer media model grow into lifestyle, luxury and more. As influencer marketing budgets are set to increase for more than 70% of respondents in Celebrity Intelligence’s Influencing Beauty report, I anticipate other industries are soon to follow suit.

This increase could show up as brands paying big prices for big names or distributing their funds to work with multiple microinfluencers across niche audiences. No matter the route, this diverse method allows for flexible, cost-effective partnerships -- a good move considering 92% of surveyed marketers in Linqia’s 2018 study found influencer marketing to be effective when measured by engagement, clicks and impressions.

Alongside greater investment in influencers, the face of the internet is getting a revamp. Gone are the days of consumers sitting passively behind a screen. Now, social media users are demanding a place at the table and influencers are pulling out the seat. To preserve the credibility of this relationship, brands should find partnerships that appear effortless to followers and seamlessly integrate your product into an influencer’s existing story.

Macrobenefits Of Microinfluencers

The most significant benefit to microinfluencers is their small but involved army of followers. According to a study by Markerly, Instagram engagement peaks for users with around 1,000 followers. For this demographic, audiences liked posts 8% of the time, while users with more than 10 million followers got likes only 1.6% of the time -- meaning more eyes on your product doesn’t always translate to more interest.

These intimate, tailored communities nurture a deeper connection with micro-influencers and their audiences. By making their followers an integral part of the content-creation process, influencers ditch the internet’s detached reputation and create personalized, meaningful connections.

Still, it would be naive to disregard performance entirely. The key is balancing optimal engagement and interest, a goal that’s easier to achieve when accessing these specialized audiences.

Where Can You Start?

The breadth of the influencer landscape is a blessing and a curse. Brands are never without options, but knowing which is the right choice can be overwhelming. In reality, it takes more than selecting a picturesque feed to discover your brand’s dream influencer. Start by considering your company’s unique identity and goals and ask, “Why this user or campaign?”

Then start your search. The best place to find relevant talent is on your own profile. See who’s already engaging with a brand’s existing campaigns and content, then reach out to show your appreciation. Establishing a relationship with influencers who already love a brand helps ensure authentic content, and because followers rely on influencers’ honesty, producing natural-feeling content is vital to protecting their trust.

An influencer’s heart lies with their followers, and few are willing to sacrifice the relationships they’ve established -- and for good reason! Fullscreen and Shareablee reported in the 2018 Influence by the Numbers study that over one-third of participants would trust a brand more after seeing it promoted by an influencer.

Turning to the numbers is another effective strategy. Sixty-seven percent of respondents in the Influencing Beauty report found that a data-led approach is most effective, in addition to considering the skills, themes or values of an influencer. By gathering audience insights and engagement metrics, agencies can analyze how an influencer’s audience compares to a client’s target demographic and how they will fit with the brand’s goals.

By being clear about a brand’s values and how they are exemplified through a partnership, agencies can access the tight-knit communities held by microinfluencers. Combine a client’s identity and goals with data to identify relevant talent and develop a variety of well-tailored contracts. With this strategy, brands can collaborate to develop longer-term relationships with microinfluencers that result in more creative, effective storytelling.","Although the largest majority in Linqia’s The State of Influencer Marketing reported spending $25,000 to $50,000, the full range stretched from less than $10,000 to $500,000 and beyond.

Some local transit agencies are pursuing partnerships with private mobility companies—including car-share and ""ridesourcing"" companies such as Lyft and Uber, which provide access to a shared vehicle “on demand”—with the aim of offering public transit riders more efficient and convenient service options. Most of the transit partnership projects that GAO selected (14 of 22) involved private partners providing on-demand transportation for the “first- and last-mile” connections to or from public transit stations (see figure). Local transit agencies use first- and last-mile connections to increase their public transit ridership. Other services provided through selected projects included filling transit service gaps in under-served areas. Most selected projects have not yet been evaluated to determine whether they achieved intended outcomes.

Concept of First- and Last-Mile Connections to Access Public Transportation

The Department of Transportation's (DOT) efforts, especially the Federal Transit Administration's (FTA) initiation of the Mobility on Demand Sandbox program, have facilitated partnerships, but confusion about how to meet some requirements and how to report data pose challenges to implementing projects. In October 2016, FTA announced the selection of 11 projects to receive grants and has since provided assistance to the grantees. FTA also issued clarifications about how certain federal requirements—such as those related to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)—apply to transit partnerships. However, most selected local transit agencies (14 of 16) said that additional information beyond what FTA has already disseminated, including how agencies have successfully structured partnerships and met federal requirements, would be helpful. Collecting and disseminating such information could help FTA be better positioned to respond to changes in the transit industry that could impact its own efforts and goals, such as planning for future Mobility on Demand grants. In addition, most selected local transit agencies reported confusion related to reporting information about their on-demand projects into the FTA's National Transit Database, including confusion about which on-demand project data would qualify for entry. This confusion has led to possible reporting inconsistencies by some local transit agencies. Ensuring that data contained in the National Transit Database are complete and accurate is important, since according to FTA officials, FTA uses these data (1) to apportion certain grant funds to local transit agencies based on factors such as passenger miles traveled, and (2) to track its progress in achieving goals such as promoting efficient transportation systems, among other things.

Why GAO Did This Study

The public transit landscape is changing, as advances in technology have enabled more on-demand mobility services, such as ridesourcing and bike-share services. In response, some transit agencies have started to partner with private mobility companies with the aim of offering public transit riders more efficient and convenient options through on-demand services. FTA supports public transportation systems through a variety of federal grant programs.

GAO was asked to review various issues related to such partnerships. This report examines, among other things: (1) the types of partnership projects that selected transit agencies have initiated with private mobility companies and (2) how DOT's efforts and funding and federal requirements may impact such partnerships. GAO interviewed DOT officials and reviewed DOT documents; interviewed 16 local transit agencies and 13 private mobility companies involved in transit partnerships; and reviewed 22 projects initiated by the selected partners, including 5 funded by the Mobility on Demand Sandbox grant program. GAO selected these partners to represent a range of service types and geographic locations; the results are non-generalizable.","Local transit agencies use first- and last-mile connections to increase their public transit ridership.
Most selected projects have not yet been evaluated to determine whether they achieved intended outcomes.

Though fintechs and credit unions are both beginning to recognize the value of working closer together, there are still some issues (and frustration) on both sides when it comes to establishing a true partnership. Much of this friction could come down to broad disconnects between the two types of organizations. For example, a recent study by the Fintech Innovation Lab of New York suggested that while 60% of the financial institution respondents cited regulatory compliance and security as major areas for concern, less than 20% of the polled fintechs listed these as issues. Instead, fintechs identified budgeting, internal competition and sunken costs of legacy technology as their top concerns.

The honest truth is that fintechs oftentimes do not have a full understanding of how risk management and compliance work within a credit union. Many tend to be focused on creating a viable product, rather than the regulatory issues and security concerns that credit unions keep top-of-mind. The same study above showed that while more than 60% of surveyed fintechs said they consult with financial companies on regulatory issues, 38% said that they are not currently addressing any regulatory issues at all.","A new fintech partnership offers new and innovative ideas for credit unions.

Here’s how to form smarter alliances.

The success of your development business depends on strategic business partnerships. On the other hand, unfortunately, some partnerships can be detrimental to your business. There are signs that a partnership isn’t working, says Chris Yurko, Director of Business Development at First American Payment Systems, and the first indications will come from your customers.

“You will know it’s time to end a partnership by the feedback you get from your clients. Technology will fail, and clients will be frustrated with the quality of support. If they don’t receive the service they need, they won’t be happy,” Yurko explains. “You’ll see attrition because it all reflects on the ISV.”

He says the majority of First American’s new ISV partners have come to them after a bad experience with another payment provider. “One switched because their customers were telling them hold time for the partner’s call center was 8 to 10 minutes. A small business owner can’t be on hold that long,” says Yurko, contrasting that level of service with the 39-second average hold time at First American. “You are choosing a partner to provide better experiences for your customers,” says Yurko. “You want the best technology, but technology only opens the door. Once you’re through, there’s a lot more to a partnership.”

What are Your Customers Saying about Your Partners?

To make sure your partnerships are beneficial to your business, pay attention to the feedback you receive from your customers about their interactions with your partners, especially in these three areas:

Support. Your clients should tell you your partner has a knowledgeable, responsive 24/7 call center. Yurko says your customers will receive better service if call center technicians can understand the difference between a payments question and an ISV question. “First American demos software so we can answer those questions,” says Yurko. “This really helps ISVs with smaller teams from having to take extra calls if we can answer the customer’s questions.” Onboarding process. Clients should report that the onboarding process with your partner was smooth and efficient. Your partner should take a hands-on approach and give your clients the personalized attention they need for a successful deployment. Hassle-free integrations. You shouldn’t be getting feedback from your customers that solutions don’t work. Your partners should fully participate in the certification process to make sure the integration is successful — even before beta — so your customers always experience the solution at its best. Your partner should not be willing to release a solution that hasn’t been fully certified and tested.

Ask the Right Questions, Upfront

Of course, you don’t want a business partner that doesn’t make customer experiences or your business growth a priority. To avoid this situation, Yurko says to dig deeper when talking to potential partners.

“Have the vendor paint a picture of what the partnership is going to look like,” says Yurko. “Ask, ‘How have you helped your clients grow?’” He suggests requesting case studies of how the company has helped other ISVs and the resources they have in place to support integrations and software development. Talk about plans you have for your products and ask if the partner is willing to help develop a roadmap to help you reach your goals.

Yurko says understanding the support the potential partner is willing to offer your business is especially important for startups, which can be somewhat overlooked. “Make sure they aren’t just throwing revenue at you to have an additional integration,” he says. “Make sure they are really invested in your growth.”

With a payment processing partner, Yurko says to also ask about steps the partner has taken to streamline and automate processes and reporting — value-adds that will save you and your clients time and money.

“Ask questions, and if you have concerns, be smart enough to ask more questions,” says Yurko. “If they can’t answer your questions, they aren’t the right partner.”

“You will know if they genuinely care about what you’re doing and, ultimately, if their goal is to keep your clients happy,” he says.

Increase student proficiency in math and literacy by 5 percent in 18 months and 10 percent in 36 months.

FLINT, Michigan — Flint Community Schools will work with six heavy hitters over the next 18 and 36 months to improve its performance, under a partnership agreement approved Wednesday.The partnership agreement is a tool to maintain local control while also sparking collaboration and bringing in additional resources to poorly performing schools, said William DiSessa, spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Education.If performance benchmarks — including increasing attendance rates, reducing suspensions, and improving standardized test scores — are not met, the district will face “mutually agreed upon” measures listed as bullet points in the partnership agreement:The listed consequences are required by state law, DiSessa said. The Michigan Department of Education has never closed a partnership school or a school district, he said. However, continually poor performing schools have previously faced a state takeover and last month a new CEO of Benton Harbor Schools was named through a state agreement.“We are not planning to close any schools. Let me say that right up front,” DiSessa said. “The whole idea is to be collaborative. There is a consensus there to move forward. … After that 36 months, hopefully there is going to be ample progress and turnaround. If not, there could be additional accountability steps.”Under the partnership agreement, Flint Community Schools maintains local control of the schools. It also includes commitments from six community partners to provide additional assistance to Flint schools, including help removing barriers to academic achievement from the Michigan Department of Education, technical support and professional development from the Genesee Intermediate School District and Michigan State University, financial support from the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, community education coordination by the Crim Fitness Foundation, and community engagement by Concerned Pastors for Social Action.“In signing the Flint Community Schools Partnership Agreement, we are excited to continue to develop and fortify existing relationships with these essential partners, each of which is committed to improving student outcomes in Flint,” said interim Superintendent Gregory Weatherspoon.The partnership agreement follows an announcement in March that the Michigan Department of Education would be entering into discussions with 21 school districts, including Flint Community Schools. Four of the district’s buildings performed in the lowest 5 percent of schools statewide and were identified as needing intervention: Accelerated Learning Academy, Holmes STEM Academy, Northwestern High School, and Potter School.Flint Community Schools included every open school building in the partnership agreement, which allows all Flint school buildings to be eligible for increased assistance and resources, DiSessa said.“The partnership agreement signifies the District’s commitment to deliver on and measure student attendance, student behavior, school curriculum and state exam performance, and to develop an Advisory Council to create a continuum of support from cradle-to-career for Flint students,” Weatherspoon said in a statement released Wednesday evening.The 19-page partnership agreement is dated June 2018 and was posted on the state’s website on July 5. The Flint Board of Education approved it Wednesday, July 18, 2018. The state gave the school district 90 days to sign the contract or face possible closure.The agreement starts with the 2018-19 school year and continues through both the 2019-20 and 2020-21 academic years. Among the goals outlined by the partnership agreement:The partnership agreement also outlines creation of the Advisory Council, which will produce a “comprehensive, multi-year, multi-partner” district plan that will remain intact during leadership changes.Over the past five years, the Mott Foundation has provided more than $54 million to support Flint Community Schools, including help to get the district out of debt, purchasing new text books for all K-12 students in core subjects, funding the community education initiative, and building improvements at Southwestern Classical Academy.“We hope the partnership agreement with the state will help Flint chart a course for progress in our public schools that will lead to better outcomes — and brighter futures — for our students. We also hope the state will more directly address the broad challenges that contribute to declining student achievement across Michigan,” Mott Foundation President Ridgway White said in a statement.White also specifically applauded the Board of Education and Weatherspoon for including all Flint schools in the agreement and engaging the broader Flint community in its improvement plan.Steve Tunnicliff, assistant superintendent of the Genesee Intermediate School District, said it remains committed to ongoing collaboration with Flint Community Schools.“While we have worked with Flint schools and community partners in many areas for a number of years, this formal 'partnership agreement' offers even more opportunities to collaborate with, and support, Flint schools to help ensure that Flint children reach their greatest potential,” Tunnicliff said in a statement Thursday.","Engage an intermediate school district to assume control of the school(s).

International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union) in partnership with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, brought together leaders and experts from the government, civil society, and private sector to discuss the role of innovations and partnerships for a TB-Free India.

With over 2 million incidence cases each year, India contributes to 26% of the global TB burden.

Earlier this year, around World TB Day, the Prime Minister had announced an ambitious target to eliminate tuberculosis from India by 2025, five years ahead of the globally agreed Sustainable Development Goals targets. During the intense exchange of ideas between experts from various backgrounds, it was suggested that for achieving this goal, the country needs to change its approach and have greater emphasis on innovations and multi-stakeholder partnerships. Multi-sectoral engagement and participation of all stakeholders at every level of the elimination process will have a significant impact on the lives of the poor, who are most vulnerable to TB.

When it comes to TB diagnosis and treatment, India still faces stringent challenges, making it pertinent for all stakeholders to address the loopholes, urgently, and accelerate the journey toward achieving the goal of TB elimination.

The session on 'Transformative Innovations and Technology to End TB in India', examined the innovation dynamics for TB control in the country. They emphasized on the need for private sector entrepreneurship and engagement to derive solutions that will streamline the processes in this domain. For instance, the merits of implementing the easy-to-use rapid molecular test (GX) that helps bring the lab closer to patients, enabling a test and treat approach in one visit, was discussed deeply. The power of technology to develop tools which will ensure treatment adherence among TB patients was also delved into during this conversation.

The panel on 'Advancing TB Elimination through Multi-Sectoral Actions and Sustainable Partnerships', explored the need and role of multi-sectoral partnerships that could lend their urgent intervention to hasten the progress in tackling this menacing epidemic. Given India’s progress, gaps and next steps for eliminating the deadly disease by 2025, experts deliberated on the social determinants such as poverty, malnutrition, crowded and poorly ventilated living and working environments, among others, which block the way to disease elimination. The panelists consented on the need for multi-sectoral action to enable a holistic approach and tackle the problem of determinants.

Defining the imperatives shaping healthcare innovation in India, Vikas Sheel, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India said, ""We cannot achieve India's TB elimination goal unless we innovate. While new product and technology development has been the general focus of innovation, we must focus on preventive, cost-effective medicine, and on educating India on leading a lifestyle that delays disease onset. Additionally, all processes and tools that we develop should be easily replicable. I look forward to the inputs from the Ministry of Health on how we can reform our process and systems to facilitate faster roll-out of new technologies, processes, and ideas.”

Speaking at the discussion, Dr. Jamie Tonsing, Regional Director-USEA, The Union, said, “Ending TB is one of the key global health priorities, of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, committed to by the UN member states, including India. Call to Action for a TB-Free India had steered multi stakeholder movement against TB in India. Different stakeholders have responded very positively. As an active participant, we are pleased to get experts, enabling a platform to gather insights on existing challenges to TB diagnosis in the country. We hope that the comprehensions and opinions collected from this panel will help generate more momentum and galvanise collective actions to eliminate TB in our country. We thank all members for agreeing to be a part of this forum and keep the work on TB-free India going.”

Voicing his opinion on the panel, Xerses Sidhwa, Director of Health Office, USAID India said, “The Indian government has identified TB elimination as a key health priority, and TB today is on the political agenda. As we move forward, it will be critical for states to continue their support. Secondly, one-size interventions don't fit all. We need to innovate, evaluate, replicate, and increase R&D investment to create newer technologies and diagnostic tools to take informed programmatic decisions.""

Other members who participated in the discussion included Dr Sunil Khaparde, Deputy Director General -TB, DGHS, MoHFW, GOI; Mukta Sharma WHO; Mr. Peter, Farrell, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Commercial Operations, Cepheid; Dr Sanjay Sarin, Head, FIND; Nandita Venkatesan, TB Champion, India among others.","With over 2 million incidence cases each year, India contributes to 26% of the global TB burden.

111,https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/beauty-features/rewardstyle-data-influencer-partnership-campaigns-1202766954/,"Tue, 31 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",WWD,How RewardStyle Is Using Data to Create Successful Influencer Partnerships,"What’s the secret to a successful influencer partnership? Data, according to Amber Venz Box, cofounder and president of RewardStyle.

Venz Box launched RewardStyle, an invitation-only platform that allows bloggers and influencers to monetize their content, in 2011. The Dallas-based company now works with 4,500 brands and 30,000 influencers and last year, drove more than a billion dollars in sales to retail partners through its Liketoknow.it channel.

Influencers are among the leading voices in fashion and beauty, which is why brands are now competing with each other to work with them. But according to Venz Box, many are making the mistake of not using data to inform who they work with.

“Last year, over 80 percent of brands engaged in some type of influencer marketing and a large percentage of those had over $25,000 budgets for influencer [marketing],” said Venz Box. “The problem is they’re investing in influencer [marketing] because they know it’s a trending topic, but they’re using no science behind it.”

In 2013, RewardStyle launched Campaigns, a tool that allows the company to cast influencers for brand campaigns based on historical performance data, thus helping brands be more strategic about their influencer partnerships. The feature is available exclusively to RewardStyle’s enterprise clients — those paying six and seven figures — and has proven quite popular for the company. In the first quarter of this year, RewardStyle received 1,000 applications for Campaigns, and Venz Box said she’s seen a 68-percent year-over-year increase in brand spending through the feature.

She also said RewardStyle has a 90-percent retention rate for its enterprise clients.

“As a brand, when you’re giving us your exact goals and targets, like ‘I need to hit this many sales and this much traffic and this is my target demographic,’ we’re using all of that data to cast,” said Venz Box. “Brands are always very surprised at who we cast for those campaigns because it might not be celebrity influencer A, B or C, who they thought, but we already know who that person’s audience is and what type of products they convert at. We’re able to rationalize their rate because we know what kind of sales they drive.”

The influencer marketing space is becoming increasingly cutthroat. Influencers with a high ability to drive sales are being booked up, which means that more of their links are now paid.

As paid content gains favor over organic, Venz Box is seeing three major trends emerge within the RewardStyle community. The first is a halo effect among the influencers.

“We found that for every piece of paid content published, [the companies] receive on average three and a half pieces of organic content from these long-term campaign partners. Said another way, they’re paying an influencer to do a single post and the influencer then also does essentially three and a half pieces of organic content incremental to what they’re paid for,” said Venz Box.

She also found that influencers who are being paid for their content have a higher average order value — by $17, to be exact — than organic linkers.

“The RewardStyle influencer who is paid for content is not only incentivized by the flat rate, but they’re also incentivized by the commission that they will get on that piece of content and they work harder for the brand and they’re driving higher order values than someone who picks up the brand and talks about them organically,” she said. For context, RewardStyle influencers can earn anywhere from thousands of dollars “on the low end” to millions of dollars annually.

Lastly, Venz Box said the Campaigns partnerships continue to grow over time. “One of our partners executed collaborations for 27 months and they’re seeing 56-percent year-over-year sales growth,” she said. “What we see is those long-term [influencer] partnerships continue to drive incremental sales growth. It doesn’t flatten.”

I am about to express an opinion that some people will agree with, but those who don’t will just dislike me for it and maybe be a bit hurt and alienated. They might tell me to “stick to comedy”, like lots of people do whenever I mention Brexit.

In fact, I’m slightly surprised, in retrospect, that when I turned up at the polling station on referendum day, no one barred my entrance telling me to “stick to comedy”. I mean, I didn’t vote Remain as a joke. In my view, it would have been funnier to vote Leave – as a piece of geopolitical slapstick, a massive national pratfall. So my vote was not a humorous act, and therefore it was outside the remit of comedians, and straying offensively into the purview of human beings.

Now, I would be the last person to claim to be a human being. It’s just not for me to say. Apart from anything else, that’s exactly what bots on social media do, so it only arouses suspicion. And how could I possibly know for sure? I’ve seen Blade Runner. Or at least, I think I have. I know that we can’t completely know anything – to the extent that I even know I can’t really know that. Or at least I think I do.

I’m putting it off. Sorry. Here comes the opinion. Apologies in advance for all the offence caused. Right, OK: at weddings, I don’t really like it when people write their own vows.

There’s no doubt that the history of the institution of marriage is riddled with religious and patriarchal bias

There, I’ve said it! And immediately I’m in incredibly personal territory. I’m passing judgment on a sincere and loving choice that millions of people have solemnly made, and can’t unmake. It’s like telling someone I hate the name they’ve chosen for their child. It’s dismissing a decision that, in most cases, will not have been taken lightly or selfishly, but reverently and responsibly – and sometimes, but not always, in the sight of God. If God exists, that is.

I’m straying on to religion now. Honestly, I’ve really got to stick to comedy! Just like the Church of England has got to stick to religion, as the Tories always say whenever a cleric’s expression of sympathy for “those less fortunate than ourselves” dips briefly below the completely platitudinous and so strays into the realm of redistributive economic goals.

But let me try and explain why I’m not keen on bespoke wedding vows. To my mind, a marriage is a standard contract. What a wedding means about two people, and the promises it involves them making to one another, are always broadly the same. Across religions, cultures and an unimaginably vast expanse of time, it has meant a very similar thing. A wedding is about two people, but it’s also about billions and billions of people throughout human history and prehistory, all making the same commitment. To me, that very uniformity of intent is what gives the act of marriage, whether made in a religious or nonreligious context, its ineffable significance.

Now, you might argue that, over that vast span of time, marriages have been conducted in so many different forms that it’s ridiculous for me to quibble about some vow-tinkering today. But my point is that they have tended to take the standard forms prescribed by whatever culture they were happening in. It’s always an off-the-shelf deal, not one specific to the two people concerned. There is the glorious multiplicity of contract law to accommodate all the other sorts of arrangements two or more parties might wish to make with each other.

I was thinking about this subject because of last week’s news that the supreme court has ruled in favour of a heterosexual couple who want a civil partnership. As the law stands, same-sex couples can have civil partnerships or marriages, but heterosexual couples can only get married. I was vaguely aware of this campaign bubbling along in various courts and my instinctive reaction was that it was a waste of time. It seemed like a pedantic point on which to insist on equality – like a lacklustre attempt at a sequel to the triumph for civilisation of equal marriage.

That’s not what I think any more. I mean, I still think that equal marriage is a triumph for civilisation. A triumph and a salvation, because how can a society credibly claim that it sincerely accepts homosexuality if it excludes gay couples from the ancient institution by which two people have always proclaimed their love? Saying it’s fine to be gay but I don’t see why they need to get married is like saying it’s fine for women to have jobs but they obviously shouldn’t be doctors.

But now I also agree that it’s important for every couple to be allowed a civil partnership instead of marriage. The campaigning duo, Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, speak of rejecting the “legacy of marriage”, which “treated women as property for centuries”. Instead they want to enter into “a modern, symmetrical institution”. They don’t want to write their own marriage vows, they don’t want to “make marriage their own”, or “do it on their own terms”. They want new general terms, a new off-the-shelf deal without the atavistic legacy.

History matters and there’s no doubt that the history of the institution of marriage is riddled with religious and patriarchal bias. That doesn’t mean marriage still has to be influenced by those forces, but they’re undeniably part of its hinterland. So, if we believe that public statements of emotional and sexual commitment are important, and should carry tax benefits and legal status, then it’s reasonable that there should be a version of it that is overtly separated from what marriage has meant historically.

Just as many gay couples longed to be admitted to the ancient institution, so heterosexual ones should have a way of publicly rejecting it while, equally publicly, proclaiming their togetherness. If marriage matters, then that matters too. You can only dismiss both, or neither, as irrelevant.","I know that we can’t completely know anything – to the extent that I even know I can’t really know that.

These articles contributing to this discussion are based on the third Tun Hussein Onn Chair lecture delivered by Jomo KS, now a member of the Council of Eminent Persons.

COMMENT | After the failure and abuses of privatisation and the contracting-out of services from the 1980s, there was a period of renewed appreciation for the role of the state or government. However, this has since given way to the promotion of public-private partnerships (PPPs).

PPPs are essentially long-term contracts, underwritten by government guarantees, with which the private sector builds (and sometimes runs) major infrastructure projects or services traditionally provided by the state, such as hospitals, schools, roads, railways, water, sanitation and energy.

PPPs are promoted by many governments associated with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and some multilateral development banks – especially the World Bank – as the solution to the financing shortfall needed to achieve development, including the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Since the late 1990s, many countries have embraced PPPs in many areas ranging from healthcare and education to transport and infrastructure – with problematic consequences. They were less common in developing countries, but that is changing rapidly, with many countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa now passing enabling legislation and initiating PPP projects.

Nevertheless, experiences with PPPs have been largely, although not exclusively, negative, and very few PPPs have delivered results in the public interest. There has been some supposed success with infrastructure PPPs, mainly due to their financing arrangements. Generally, PPPs for hospitals and schools have much poorer records compared to infrastructure projects.

One can have good financing arrangements, due to preferential interest rates, for a poor PPP project. Nevertheless, private finance all over the world still accounts for a small share of financing of infrastructure. However, good financing arrangements will not save a poor PPP.

PPPs typically involve public financing for developing countries to attract bids from influential private companies, often from a foreign country.

‘Blended finance’, export financing and new supposed aid arrangements have become means for foreign governments to support such powerful corporations bidding for PPP contracts abroad, especially in developing countries. Such arrangements are justified and counted as overseas development assistance, or even as north-south, south-south or triangular development cooperation.

Like privatisation, PPPs often increase fees or charges for users. PPP contracts often undermine the public interest in other ways, with generous host government incentives and other privileges, often compromising and undermining the state’s obligation to regulate in the public interest.

PPPs can limit government capacity to enact new legislation and other policies – such as strengthened environmental or social regulations – that might adversely affect or constrain investor interests.

PPP contracts are typically complex. Negotiations are subject to commercial confidentiality, making it hard for civil society and parliamentarians to scrutinise them and resulting agreements. Such limited transparency significantly increases the likelihood of corruption and undermines democratic accountability.

Hence, in many instances, PPPs become the most expensive financing option and much less cost-effective than transparent competitive good government procurement. They cost governments – and ultimately, citizens – significantly more in the long run than if projects are directly financed with government borrowing.

It is important to establish the circumstances required to achieve efficiency gains and to recognise the longer-term fiscal implications of PPP-related contingent liabilities. Shifting public debt to government guaranteed debt does not really reduce government debt liabilities, but obscures accountability, as it is taken off-budget and is no longer subject to parliamentary, let alone public scrutiny.

Hence, PPPs are more likely to be abused because they can be taken ‘off balance sheet’ so that they do not show up in government budget and debt accounts, giving the illusion of ‘easy money’ or credit. Hence, despite claims to the contrary, PPPs are typically riskier for governments than for the private companies involved, as the government may be required to step in to assume costs and liabilities if things go wrong.

PPPs also undermine democracy and national sovereignty as such contracts tend not to be transparent and subject to unaccountable international adjudication due to investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) commitments rather than national or international courts. Under World Bank-proposed PPP contracts, for example, national governments can even be liable for losses due to strikes by workers.

PPPs are now an increasingly popular means to finance mega-infrastructure projects, but dams, highways, large plantations, pipelines and energy or transport infrastructure can ruin habitats, displace communities and devastate natural resources. Typically, social and environmental legislation is weakened or circumscribed to attract investors for PPPs.

There are also a growing number of ‘dirty’ energy PPPs, devastating the environment and undermining progressive environmental conservation efforts and exacerbating climate change. PPPs have also led to forced displacement, repression and other abuses of local communities, indigenous peoples, displaced farmers and labourers among others.

One alternative, of course, is government or public procurement. Generally, PPPs are much more expensive than government procurement despite government subsidised credit. However, with a competent government doing good work, government procurement can be efficient and low cost.

Yet, international trade and investment agreements are eroding the rights of governments to pursue such alternatives in the national or public interest. With a competent government and an incorruptible civil service, and competent accountable consultants doing good work, efficient government procurement has generally proved far more cost-effective than PPP alternatives.

It is therefore important to establish why and under what circumstances meaningful gains can be achieved through PPPs, and when these are unlikely.

Coping with PPPs

Clearly, PPPs have emerged in recent years as the development ‘flavour of the decade’ replacing aspects of the old Washington Consensus, including privatisation. Instead of trying to replace or limit the role of government, corporations are increasingly using governments to advance their own interests through PPPs.

On the one hand, in a contemporary variant of previously condemned ‘tied aid’, governments in developed countries are increasingly using their aid or overseas development assistance (ODA) budgets to promote their own national – read corporate – interests, such as by providing ‘blended finance’ on concessional terms to secure PPP contracts, or to otherwise advance the interests of such businesses.

On the other hand, aid-recipient governments have been encouraged to replace government procurement with PPP arrangements to undertake infrastructure and other projects despite the mixed records of PPPs. Hence, many developing countries have little choice but to deal with PPPs.

To secure financing for needed infrastructure, they need strong institutional capacity to create, manage and evaluate PPPs. When presented with PPP proposals, governments need to have the capacity to critically evaluate proposals and to make counter-proposals. It is therefore important for the relevant government institutional capacity to be enhanced to create, manage and evaluate PPP proposals.

Governments should be empowered and discouraged from presuming that they have no choice but to accept PPP proposals from the private sector. Most developing country governments cannot dodge the PPP bullet and need to be able to better deal with the challenge it poses.

Strong institutional capacity to better cope with PPPs requires having a dedicated competent service loyal to government and public priorities and concerns to do the needed. But most low-income and many middle-income developing countries do not have the capacity, let alone the capabilities needed to be able to effectively evaluate and respond to such proposals. Hence, most developing countries need international technical support to accelerate needed capacity building.

Using private consultants to fill the gap in the interim, before national capacities are sufficiently developed, can be useful in the short-term, but most such consultants are mainly oriented to serving better paymasters from the private sector.

Hence, strengthening public sector capacities to cope with PPP proposals is necessary and urgent. This may not be a major problem in some emerging market economies, which generally have more choice in such matters, but it is a major challenge for most developing countries.

ODA should therefore enable public sector capacity building, rather than give governments little choice. Instead of helping countries develop such capacities, ODA often gives developing country governments little choice but to accept favoured PPP proposals.

As many governments may not be able to develop such a centralised capacity and mechanism to deal with very varied PPP proposals, one alternative is for them to work together to develop some kind of shared capacity.

However, relying on organisations committed to PPPs, such as multilateral development banks (MDBs) or international finance institutions (IFIs), raises different problems. So far, they have largely failed to credibly provide such capacities and mechanisms.

They have also not enabled cooperation among developing countries to better cope with the PPP challenge, partly due to their current inclination to promote and enable PPPs involving corporations associated with ‘donor’ governments.

Alternative arrangements

Hence, there is an urgent need to consider and develop alternative arrangements. Government procurement, involving sovereign debt if necessary, has been found to be generally much cheaper, contrary to the misleading claims of PPP advocates.

Ensuring transparent competition among prospective PPP proposals would also help. Many PPP proposals have been approved and implemented following ‘direct negotiations’ without any real or meaningful transparency or competition despite pious rhetoric by donor governments, international financial institutions (IFIs) and multilateral development banks (MDBs) about the importance of and need for competition and transparency.

There are many recent abuses in Malaysia that clearly show that the public interest would have been well served by transparently competitive bidding instead of ‘direct negotiations’.

It is important to make sure that PPPs are not abused. Typically, the government, and ultimately, the public, will bear the costs or take the bulk of the risks while rents or profits mainly accrue to the private partner.

Internationally agreed guidelines would also help. International guidelines for PPPs need to be developed multilaterally through an inclusive multi-stakeholder process. Perhaps, this can be led through the UN Financing for Development (FfD) process. Alternatively, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) in Geneva is well placed to work for such guidelines which would go some way to levelling the playing field.

Such guidelines should endeavour to enhance developing countries’ bargaining and negotiating positions, such as by ensuring competition through open bidding. Such guidelines should also avoid the abuse of PPPs, for example, by ensuring that public money is not used to subsidise private risk and rents/profits.

Responsible and accountable developed and developing country governments must work together to ensure that we are all better able to cope with this growing trend of state-sponsorship of private corporate expansion.

The Government of India has been working towards evolving the people’s power in governance as functionaries and facilitators. Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model is the core of it. This is an arrangement of a government and a private entity, for-profit or non-profit, undertaking a traditional public activity. PPP is also described as one government unit and a consortium of private firms created to initiate and bring about major civic redevelopment projects.

The ruling party in its 2014 general elections manifesto had stated about transforming the PPP model into a People-Public-Private Partnership (PPPP) model. But nothing active has been done. Government budgets and aid alone cannot ensure that everyone gets access to sanitation, water, and electricity.

But reports show that there is no guarantee that PPP models will lead to successful achievements of set goals. According to UNECE’s Revised Guiding Principles on People-First Public-Private Partnerships for the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, “most of the PPPs have been undertaken in fully developed Western countries with mature economies.”

World Bank Group’s senior director for infrastructure and public-private partnerships, Laurence Carter said PPPs can involve the private sector in making public services more sustainable, more efficient and cost-effective.

However, the PPP model remains to be much better identified on the basis of many common issues. The Revised Guiding Principles on People-First Public-Private Partnerships for the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals argues that “governments using PPPs introduces a dangerous profit motive in the delivery of public services.”

The government and its partners need to work in a transparent and committed manner. According to the World Bank, enabling a framework for PPPs needs to be strengthened with independent regulators. “In terms of transactions, India needs to focus on sectors other than transport and power and customize the PPP architecture to suit each sector.

A people-first approach is needed. This will prioritize the value for people. It will also foster access to essential public services for all where sustainable development as its objective and putting people first at the core.","World Bank Group’s senior director for infrastructure and public-private partnerships, Laurence Carter said PPPs can involve the private sector in making public services more sustainable, more efficient and cost-effective.

A working group of payer, provider, academic, and pharmaceutical industry stakeholders was convened to provide insight into these challenges and identify barriers to and opportunities for collaboration to address them. A series of structured discussions was conducted among workgroup members over several months in 2017. As the challenges were discussed, stakeholders identified 4 key areas for improvement and collaboration: to (1) better manage touchpoints of healthcare, (2) identify and focus on patients most likely to benefit from interventions, (3) better incorporate social determinants of health into population health interventions, and (4) better measure return on investment among interventions and improve its alignment with stakeholders. The working group further identified several major themes to enhance the frequency and impact of collaborative population health initiatives: Stakeholders should (1) seek to mine and cross-leverage the increasing volume of health-related data that they each develop independently, (2) collaborate to create patient touchpoint “ecosystems” in which patients are maximally engaged through a diverse and complementary set of contact channels and technologies, and (3) collectively determine the investments required for high-impact population health initiatives and how to allocate them, so that individual returns on the various investments can be estimated and calibrated according to the stakeholders’ needs.

Am J Accountable Care. 2018;6(3):e8-e11The US healthcare system has struggled to achieve high-quality, accessible care at affordable cost. Recent efforts to improve quality of care, expand access, and reduce costs have included insurance market reforms as well as novel payment and delivery system reforms that attempt to shift financial risk across key stakeholders while improving population health, particularly for the sickest and highest-cost patients.

Although recent payment and delivery reforms have shown some effectiveness, challenges remain in achieving the “quadruple aim” of better health of populations, improved quality care, lower costs, and sustained health of healthcare providers and/or caregivers. Consistently delivered high-value care remains elusive, and by some estimates, low-value care is estimated to cost the United States $340 billion each year.1

In our view, an important contributor to limited progress is the lack of consistent communication and collaboration among key healthcare stakeholders. Patients, healthcare providers, drug and device manufacturers, and payers (eg, traditional managed care organizations, integrated delivery networks, pharmacy benefit managers) all have different perspectives and incentives that make the reality of high-quality care at affordable cost challenging to achieve.

To provide multistakeholder insight into these challenges, Novartis Pharmaceuticals convened a working group of payer, provider, academic, and pharmaceutical industry stakeholders. Providers represented integrated health systems and accountable care organizations, and payers represented commercial managed care organizations. The working group had the following objectives: to (1) bring together diverse healthcare stakeholders; (2) discuss the critical issues and challenges arising from the transforming healthcare environment, in particular related to population health; (3) brainstorm approaches to address current problems and future needs related to population health; and (4) identify barriers to multistakeholder collaboration and improved care.

Prior to convening the working group, we conducted comprehensive discussions with payers and providers to identify priorities of these stakeholders and inform selection of topics for working group meetings. Three separate meetings were held that focused on the following topics: (1) multistakeholder approaches to population health and wellness, (2) promoting medication compliance through patient engagement and education, and (3) building creative solutions to improve population health and patient engagement. Through these meetings, common priorities and challenges emerged.

Overall, all stakeholders are currently implementing their own population health programs with the key goals of improving quality of and access to care, preventing disease, decreasing avoidable healthcare utilization, and ensuring healthcare provider job satisfaction. However, there are significant challenges to the success of these population health programs, including fragmentation in their implementation and delivery and gaps in communication and collaboration.

For example, population health programs tend to be fragmented, as approaches are typically executed under 1 stakeholder’s umbrella (eg, all population health activities occurring under the purview of the provider organization as opposed to collaboratively with payers and/or pharmaceutical industry partners). All working group members agreed that cross-stakeholder collaboration could leverage strengths of individual stakeholders, but there has been limited precedent for this collaboration. This inherent fragmentation leads to communication and collaboration gaps.

Although there are multiple payer-, provider-, and community-driven programs that all touch the patient, there is limited communication among programs, resulting in both the reduction of individual programs’ effectiveness and duplicative overlap in some programs’ services.

The working group also identified a key unmet need of identifying which stakeholders are best suited to manage certain components of care and leveraging those strengths to achieve improved overall outcomes. For example, 1 component of improving heart failure care requires more local efforts by providers that can shift social determinants of health. A health plan may have strategies to improve heart failure management (eg, lowering co-pays, deploying nurse managers, notifying providers of heart failure hospitalizations, etc), but it may not have the on-the-ground capabilities to affect social determinants of health. Ideally, it could leverage the provider’s influence in the community to meet these needs, resulting in an optimal approach of complementing payer and provider strategies. This level of collaboration is not broadly achieved today. These communication and collaboration gaps can impact both the patient experience and the ability to achieve positive health outcomes.

As these challenges were discussed, stakeholders identified 4 key areas for improvement and collaboration: to (1) better manage touchpoints of healthcare, (2) identify and focus on patients most likely to benefit from interventions, (3) better incorporate social determinants of health into population health interventions, and (4) better measure return on investment (ROI) among interventions and improve its alignment with stakeholders.

Better Manage Touchpoints of Healthcare

As patients move along the care continuum, the use of technology has been widely promoted to facilitate coordination (eg, telehealth). In addition to physicians, other individuals on the care team, such as nurse navigators who help guide patients and their families through a complex healthcare system, may also find significant benefit in new technologies such as telehealth. However, the promise of the potential of these technologies has not been achieved. Although the payers, providers, and pharmaceutical industry members of our working group are all engaging in programs utilizing telehealth/telemedicine to address key challenges, financial and patient compliance barriers impact the ability to successfully incorporate technological solutions to drive high-quality care. These barriers include the costly investment in the technology itself, payer reimbursement for the technology and service, personnel investment in the program to facilitate use of the technology (eg, nurses to monitor patients using a remote monitoring scale in a heart failure program), inability to accurately measure ROI, and patient engagement to promote compliance with the technology.

Although in the current environment it is challenging to measure ROI and financially justify technology-driven programs that manage patient touchpoints across the continuum of care, stakeholder collaboration and exploration of alternative financing models that more explicitly link financial rewards to assumed risks can support further expansion of these programs to recognize their potential benefits. For example, with the implementation of federal programs such as the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act and the Merit-based Incentive Payment System, stakeholders are increasingly focused on meeting quality measures, as the federal programs have given these measures a greater financial impact on stakeholder payment. As a result, the ability of technology-based solutions to improve quality of care and support achievement of quality metrics should also drive their implementation across the care continuum.

Identify and Focus on Patients Most Likely to Benefit From Interventions

Many current interventions aimed at reducing costs focus on identifying the highest-risk, highest-cost patients. However, this strategy may not be the most effective way to reduce costs to the greatest extent.

When developing interventions to address key issues such as medication adherence, the highest-risk and highest-cost patients may not be those for whom the needle can be moved with regard to outcomes and cost. This is because healthcare behaviors that are correlated with poor adherence and poor health outcomes will persist in some patients even if adherence itself is improved.

Therefore, stakeholders should be focusing on patients for whom the maximum benefit of an intervention can be realized both clinically and financially. Almost all stakeholders in our working group are implementing ways of analyzing data for this purpose. For example, 1 provider stakeholder in our working group described a risk stratification model that is applied to their data warehouse to identify patients in the top 1%, 2.5%, and 10% of cost and utilization. The top 2.5% to 10%, as opposed to the top 1%, are identified as “rising risk” and are thought to be the patients with the potential to change their health trajectories for the better, and where the greatest ROI from an intervention is possible.

As payers and providers seek to develop programs to better care for these rising-risk patients, there is the potential to harness advancements in data analytics to identify patients who are both high-cost and most likely to respond to healthcare interventions, as well as to partner with pharmaceutical industry stakeholders who are implementing patient-centered programs to improve engagement of these critical patients. Achieving this potential will require stakeholders to view each other less as adversaries and instead more as partners in identifying and delivering appropriate care to the right patients.

Better Incorporate Social Determinants of Health Into Population Health Interventions

A theme stressed by all stakeholders in the working group was that improving the value of interventions, and ultimately quality of care and patient outcomes, requires addressing not only clinical but also nonclinical components of care (ie, social determinants of health). This is a key priority of payers and providers, both of whom are addressing social determinants of health in various ways. Providers in our working group identified several ways in which their organizations are attempting to improve quality and outcomes through nonclinical components of care, including creating a culturally sensitive diabetes cookbook, identifying which patients would qualify for or benefit from Meals on Wheels, identifying which patients are in greatest need of assistance with transport to medical appointments, and piloting house-call models in which primary care is provided in the patient’s home for patients who are unable to reliably make visits to a physician’s office. These traditional care management techniques are effective but financially burdensome for the provider. This misalignment of action and payment is a point of stress on the system.

These efforts were echoed among stakeholders; however, the integration of nonclinical components of care in interventional programs more broadly has not been achieved. Risk stratification models need to include community data from community needs assessments, as well as patient-specific data, to target “hot spots” for improving social determinants of health. Solutions offered by pharmaceutical industry stakeholders have not typically included social determinants of health in their design, possibly because they are viewed as inappropriately diffuse targets for investments whose returns need to be quantified. Nevertheless, as programs are developed moving forward, the most effective interventions will include these components and take advantage of stakeholders’ unique abilities to influence social determinants. For example, with the powerful direct-to-consumer communication channels they have developed, pharmaceutical industry partners may be able to break through some of the social determinant barriers to facilitate program implementation.

Better Measure ROIs Among Interventions and Improve Alignment With Stakeholders

A factor underlying all of these identified challenges and barriers is the measurement of ROI and the resulting impact on the ability to implement and maintain these programs. All stakeholders are concerned about the measurement of ROI; however, with so many touchpoints and interventions affecting the patient, it is difficult to ascribe ROI to a particular intervention or stakeholder’s investment. Moreover, for most interventions, detailed data on intervention costs and any cost offsets associated with the intervention are frequently lacking, making it challenging to compare ROI across multiple competing interventions. Ultimately, these challenges make it difficult for individual stakeholders to financially justify many population health programs. In addition, stakeholders have different financial incentives, and the return derived from a particular intervention may not be aligned with the financial incentive of that stakeholder or even be realized by the stakeholder making the investment. For example, even as they take on increased financial risk, providers still are not typically accountable for pharmacy spending, so the ROI of interventions to improve medication adherence may not be realized by providers, even if they are primarily responsible for funding the intervention. However, as providers engage in alternative payment and care models, such as the Comprehensive Primary Care Initiative and the Oncology Care Model, and are more accountable for the care that they provide, there may be ways to evaluate the impact of interventions on cost and quality of care compared with that in traditional care settings.

One example from our working group was the provider implementation of a heart failure program that used telemonitoring to communicate with at-risk patients with heart failure. An enhanced weight scale used at home communicated patient information back to case managers, who would intervene if necessary. However, even though the program realized positive clinical outcomes, there was insufficient ROI to justify the costs of the technology and the case managers, and the program was subsequently terminated.

Conclusions

Despite potential opportunities for providers, payers, and pharmaceutical industry partners to collaborate to improve quality of care, including better population health, collaboration among these groups has traditionally been low, particularly with regard to engaging industry partners. This is in part due to misalignment of financial incentives, as well as difficulties in measuring and properly attributing returns on investments. Our working group brought together stakeholders from diverse organizations with the goal of identifying barriers to and opportunities for multistakeholder collaboration. The working group identified several major themes to enhance the frequency and impact of collaborative population health initiatives:

Stakeholders should seek to mine and cross-leverage the increasing volume of health-related data that they each develop independently. Each type of stakeholder collects and curates a somewhat different data set; these data sets are useful independently, but together they enable exceptionally powerful patient targeting.

Stakeholders can collaborate to create patient touchpoint “ecosystems” in which patients are maximally engaged through a diverse and complementary set of contact channels and technologies offered by providers, payers, and pharmaceutical industry members working together. Such ecosystems should be effective in modifying key patient behaviors and particularly powerful in affecting social determinants of health.

Payers, providers, and pharmaceutical industry members need to collectively determine the investments required for high-impact population health initiatives and how to allocate them, so that individual returns on the various investments can be estimated and calibrated according to the stakeholders’ needs. This collaborative approach also can facilitate the equitable sharing of the investment burden to overcome population health barriers recognized as meaningful, although diffuse.

Experience has taught us that we can expect only limited success in addressing population health challenges with fragmented single-stakeholder initiatives. Significant progress will require innovative thinking from the critical stakeholders—patients and their families, providers, payers, and pharmaceutical industry members—and a willingness to collaborate, in recognition that improved population health is a worthy goal deserving of unprecedented approaches.Author Affiliations: Precision for Medicine (NS, DP), Boston, MA; Beth Israel Deaconess Care Organization (SA), Boston, MA; Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma (PA), Tulsa, OK; Banner Health (DD), Phoenix, AZ; Montefiore Health System (JM), Yonkers, NY; Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey (SP), Newark, NJ; Memorial Hermann Health System (EAS), Houston, TX; Novartis Pharmaceuticals (JC), Hanover, NJ; Harvard Medical School (ABJ), Boston, MA.

However, there are significant challenges to the success of these population health programs, including fragmentation in their implementation and delivery and gaps in communication and collaboration.
For example, population health programs tend to be fragmented, as approaches are typically executed under 1 stakeholder’s umbrella (eg, all population health activities occurring under the purview of the provider organization as opposed to collaboratively with payers and/or pharmaceutical industry partners).
This collaborative approach also can facilitate the equitable sharing of the investment burden to overcome population health barriers recognized as meaningful, although diffuse.
Experience has taught us that we can expect only limited success in addressing population health challenges with fragmented single-stakeholder initiatives."

We live in an era in which space is an increasingly challenged and even hostile environment. Today’s adversaries are able to jam satellites for reversible effects and even permanently damage space assets with kinetic attacks from ground-launched missiles, building urgency for optimal resilience in space.



In April during the Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, Colorado, I joined Defense Department, intelligence community, State Department and Canadian Armed Forces leaders to examine the potential for adversaries to transform space into a battleground.



The panel discussion, titled “Warfare that Extends into Space: National Security, International, Civil and Commercial Partnerships,” focused more on tangible, achievable solutions rather than doomsday scenarios, with participants expanding upon the immediate need for partnerships that would coalesce the efforts of the U.S. government, its allies and commercial industry to foster a more protected space environment and encourage responsible behaviors in space.

The need for such resilience and strong partnerships is not new: In 2007, the world was shocked when China fired a ground-based, medium-range ballistic missile to destroy its own weather satellite, some 537 miles above the Earth. This satellite intercept test served as an awakening, opening our eyes to a new challenge of space as a contested and potential hostile domain — one that could possibly emerge as a dangerous environment.

Now just over 10 years later, there is an increased urgency to act as we are more dependent on space today for so many aspects of our modern lifestyle. We must be mindful that the increasing challenges in space represent ever-increasing potential dangers to all space assets, not just military space vehicles.

To respond with a new, multinational and industrial-based national security strategy centered around space, we have to “go fast and we have to innovate,” according to the panel’s moderator, Stephen Kitay, deputy assistant secretary of defense for space policy. “Partnerships are key to our strategy.”

What is clear is that the commercial satellite industry plays a primary, driving role in today’s national security strategy rather than a secondary or reactive one. Across all domains and capabilities — satellite communications for ground, maritime and airborne operations, space situational awareness, global navigation satellite systems, satellite launches and hosted payloads — the commercial industry continues to innovate and advance comparably and even beyond what governments can do. And satellite companies pursue these accomplishments not as competitors to agencies, but as collaborators for assured, protected access to space assets.

During the panel, I was encouraged to find that my co-participants agreed with this perspective.

“We need the aspirations provided by the commercial sector,” said Jonathan Margolis, acting deputy assistant secretary for science, space and health at the State Department’s bureau of oceans and international environmental and scientific affairs. “We need the inspiration that the commercial sector has brought forward to inspire … what we can ultimately achieve in space. We need the efficiencies of the commercial sector.”

Brig. Gen. K.G. Whale, director general space, Canadian Armed Forces, described commercial advancements as a “forcing function” that greatly help satisfy strategic objectives: “New space innovation is clearly outpacing government culture, policy and procurement in orders of magnitude. … We should welcome that forcing function. We need to find ways [to harness] the benefits of this commercial innovation.”

My fellow panelists and I also took the opportunity to elaborate upon critical components of the partnerships — and how they can combine to form a formidable, defensive posture to discourage hostile actions on the part of our adversaries.

We must take an enterprise approach to partnerships, one that incorporates mutual trust, upfront planning and reciprocity. The formal establishment of a commercial presence within the Joint Space

Operations Center serves as a good example of this. It follows the creation of the commercial integration cell pilot program within the center in June 2015, in which Inmarsat and six other satellite companies were selected to collaborate with the U.S. government via cooperative research and development agreements. Literally working on the center floor every day, the partnership enables industry and the government to share technology and information on a collaborative basis, expanding integration and space situational awareness while increasing the command-and-control capacity of the joint force space component commander under Strategic Command. It has focused on the improvement of processes and commercial/government integration in conducting conjunction assessments and addressing electromagnetic interference and resolution.

Gen. John W. “Jay” Raymond, commander of Air Force Space Command and the joint force space component commander, has described the commercial integration cell as “the next step in our ongoing efforts to partner with like-minded spacefaring entities to promote the peaceful and responsible use of space” through the enhanced integration of industry capabilities into day-to-day space operations.

In these and likeminded efforts both nationally and on a global scale, we acknowledge that there are cultural differences between commercial providers and U.S. federal agencies, as well as their international counterparts. And yet we establish transparency to rise above these differences, always with an eye toward common goals and mutually desired effects. We need to understand shared risks and perceived advantages to make beneficial, informed decisions.

Without transparency, we will encounter misunderstandings that will result in delivery gaps that could ultimately prove destructive to partnerships, only enabling or even perhaps encouraging adversarial activity. With transparency, we holistically blend cultural backgrounds, technical know-how and performance strengths, to create a unified state of enhanced resiliency. Together, we identify the threats and, together, we assemble an integrated response.

In the satellite community, we often grow so enamored with the satellite itself and lose sight of the rest of the end-to-end system required for capability delivery. A truly cohesive space architecture relies upon so much more. A complete architecture encompasses the requisite ground infrastructure supported by the robust connectivity of fiber networks, and of course the user terminals necessary to consume the service. Without this fully end-to-end system of systems, a satellite in orbit amounts to merely “space junk.”

Indeed, when we think about an architecture, the aforementioned enterprise concept should come into play. In addition to the satellites and the ground infrastructure, the architecture is about the users consuming it and the people who make that happen — the solution providers and government leaders who seek multiple means of function via diverse sources. Yet, this is not diversity for diversity’s sake. Our response demands more than just “one flag.” We are an international team, bringing the best of what many nations and companies can offer. We are in the game of space together. Sharing resources as one enterprise makes the architecture viable.

Security and interoperability remain crucial. Without them, the partnerships will not realize their potential.

Within certain agency circles, however, there are misconceptions that a strong commercial presence will invite compromises in the form of reduced security and interoperability. As to the latter, industry is constantly engineering solutions and services so that they are interconnected to Defense Department and other required information networks. Instead of interoperability obstacles, agency partners take advantage of a plethora of capabilities that complement and strengthen government performance.

In addressing security, satellite companies invest so that systems are not only competitively defended but superior in this regard. In addition to the government, strong commercial companies support a wide range of sectors and each brings unique security demands and requirements to satisfy. As a trusted operator, the protection of internal and customer data is essential. Frankly, this is done for their own economic viability. If their satellites and networks are vulnerable, they are out of business.

With space emerging as the next potential focus area, the time is right for partnerships, and the time is now. The U.S. government, its allies and the trusted commercial satellite industry are highly invested in the freedom of action in orbit because the mission of our servicemen and women depends upon it.

Therefore, we will commit to do whatever it takes to deter adversarial activity that threatens our ability to operate. If the partnerships effectively combine our knowledge and resources to build an entirely capable, interoperable and secure enterprise space architecture, the effort will be well worth it.

118,https://www.cfo.com/health-benefits/2018/08/beware-of-health-care-consultants-partnerships/,"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",CFO,Beware of Health Care Consultants' Preferred Partnerships,"Partnerships and preferred relationships are a critical piece of the business model in the group health care industry. The perception is that the relationships provide better value for clients.

That may well be the case. It is the duty of consultants and insurance brokers to provide the options that best fit clients’ needs and meet their goals.

However, the possibility that a consultant or broker may abandon objectivity when recommending client solutions is a significant concern.

Consulting firms and brokers have preferred relationships with insurance carriers, enrollment firms, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), and others. Insurance carriers and third-party administrators (TPAs) have preferred relationships with PBMs, stop-loss carriers, price-transparency vendors, and others. To best serve clients, it’s often necessary to integrate these relationships.

In recent times our firm has performed several consulting engagements where the objective was not to replace a broker or carrier relationship but rather to analyze a client’s current relationships, review its contracts, and provide recommendations.

We found some disturbing trends among preferred partnerships and vendors that did not serve clients’ best interest. Here are some examples:

Example 1: A consulting firm recommends voluntary benefits to a client. The client signs a sub-agreement under a master contract between the consulting firm and a carrier that offers voluntary benefits. A commission for the consulting firm is built in and disclosed in the sub-agreement.

However, the master agreement, which is not shared with the client, contains language that provides a volume-based override from the carrier to the consultant. This override is not disclosed.

Example 2: A health insurance carrier integrates with a national PBM as a pharmacy solution. A client wants to use a different PBM. The carrier charges a considerable integration fee to carve out its preferred PBM.

The carrier had contracted to receive a considerable amount of revenue from the PBM based on volume and claims mix. Removing this relationship for that particular client dramatically increases the client’s claims administration fee.

Not only is the revenue from the PBM to the carrier typically not disclosed to the client, in many cases the carrier raises the admin fee more than it would need to in order to be revenue neutral.

Example 3: A TPA has preferred relationships with three stop-loss carriers. The TPA offers clients a significant administrative credit to use those carriers in conjunction with its claims services. Should a client want to use an alternative stop-loss carrier, its administrative fee for claims would increase.

The stop-loss contracts reveal that the TPA receives a substantial override from each of its preferred stop-loss carriers. The increased administration fee for switching to a more competitive stop-loss carrier replaces the override revenue that the TPA loses. Here too, the flow of money may not be fully disclosed, and the admin fee may be hiked up above a revenue-neutral level.

In each of these examples, a recommendation was made that caused the client’s costs to increase when other options were available that would have served the client’s needs more economically and improved overall value.

These practices are not new, but they’re increasing prevalent ways to increase revenue streams for health care consultants and brokers or their preferred partners. The incremental revenue can come from direct fees, commissions, overrides, or integration fees. Sometimes it’s clearly disclosed, sometimes it’s disclosed in confusing contract language, and sometimes it’s not disclosed at all.

Clients should look more closely at their contracts with consulting firms and brokers and ask the right questions in order to understand how money flows through these arrangements and how value is created or destroyed.

Indeed, clients should demand true objectivity from the consulting and broker community and insist that consultants and brokers demand the same from the carrier community. If we are ever to begin repairing our health care economy, it must start with objectivity and transparency.

120,https://searchitchannel.techtarget.com/feature/Digital-marketing-partnerships-key-to-vendors-channel-strategies,"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",TechTarget,Digital marketing partnerships key to vendors' channel strategies,"For some vendors, a thriving channel ecosystem means engaging a variety of partner types, including digital marketing partnerships.

Digital marketing organizations were among the earliest firms to recognize the IT budgets for marketing shifting from the purview of customers' IT departments to marketing executives. Vendors took note of the agencies' influence and unique reach within customer organizations. While on the surface, digital marketing agencies didn't appear to be direct competition for traditional channel partners, some industry watchers asserted the agencies did in fact pose a potential threat. For example, agencies working on digital initiatives with a client's marketing department could hypothetically usurp the client's infrastructure decisions, cutting channel partners out from those deals.

Vendors, however, view their digital marketing partnerships as an important subgroup of their overall partner ecosystems that, if anything, is complementary to a traditional channel base.

Progress cites potential partner synergies Progress Software, an application development and deployment software vendor, said it sees an opportunity for digital marketing agencies to partner up with traditional channel firms. Progress began to pursue digital marketing partnerships following its acquisition of app development vendor Telerik in 2014, said Matthew Gharegozlou, vice president of sales at Progress. The Telerik buyout brought with it Sitefinity, a content management system, as well as digital marketing agencies that had been working with the product. Matthew Gharegozlou Matthew Gharegozlou ""The acquisition of Telerik and Sitefinity gave us the ability to go after these relationships,"" Gharegozlou said. He noted that about 65% of Progress' content management business is now derived from channel partners. About 80% of those partners are digital marketing agencies. Progress' traditional partners typically share a few traits: They work in the app development space, deal with customers' IT departments and lack skill sets related to digital experience and digital marketing. ""So far, we haven't had any conflict"" between traditional and agency partners, he said, because ""the bulk of the experience needed on the digital side, our traditional partners don't have it."" Traditional Progress partners also usually have expertise in vertical industries, he said, adding that most are based in markets such as financial services, government, healthcare and education. ""Our traditional partners are extremely knowledgeable"" and have strong relationships in their vertical spaces, he said. Because of traditional partners' strengths, Gharegozlou said Progress looks to pair them up with digital marketing agencies for certain leads. Combining the expertise in back-end work and vertical markets with agencies' expertise in web development and related technologies can produce compelling offerings. But while optimistic about these synergies, he recognized that a ""full-service"" digital marketing agency, which can do both the front-end and back-end work for a customer, diminishes the value that traditional partners may offer. In this sense, full-service agencies may be preferable to customers ""because they can do the entire project,"" he said.

Salesforce supports acquisition trend For Salesforce, digital marketing partnerships play a critical role in advancing its marketing platform. Stephane Viallet Stephane Viallet Salesforce has signed numerous digital marketing agencies over the last six years, spurred by several acquisitions to build out its business-to-commercial and marketing portfolio, said Stephane Viallet, vice president of global alliances, agencies, at Salesforce. Salesforce's acquisitions have included digital marketing software company ExactTarget in 2013, as well as e-commerce provider Demandware and data management platform Krux in 2016. Viallet also cited Salesforce's alliance with Google as a driver behind the company's growing digital marketing agency partnerships. ""Partners, including digital marketing agencies, are the lifeblood of Salesforce, extending our platform in new and exciting ways and fueling our growth,"" Viallet said in an email. He said Salesforce and its partners are pursuing opportunities created by ""our ability to merge media, adtech and martech to execute on a whole new way for brands to connect with customers."" Digital marketing organizations use Salesforce's products such as Salesforce Commerce Cloud, Marketing Cloud and Service Cloud to offer ""transformative digital experience that enable clients to meet consumer expectations,"" he noted. I think often agencies can help us get into areas of the business or with clients that we may not thoroughly be in today. Adrianna Bustamantedirector of digital sales and alliances, Rackspace In addition to having digital marketing and advertising skills, Viallet said Salesforce seeks partners that understand ""the importance of merging data, technology and creativity"" to deliver customer experience strategies. Viallet also pointed to a trend among digital marketing organizations acquiring Salesforce practices, such as Publicis.Sapient's 2016 buyout of Vertiba, a Gold-level Salesforce Consulting partner. Other notable acquisitions have included the following: Wunderman bought a majority stake in Salesforce consultancy Pierry Inc. in September 2017.

Dentsu Aegis purchased Swiss digital marketing company Blue-Infinity in January 2017.

MRM//McCann acquired e-commerce service provider Optaros in December 2014.

121,https://warontherocks.com/2018/08/the-trouble-with-counter-terrorism-partnerships-tackling-the-toughest-cases/,"Thu, 02 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",War on the Rocks,The Trouble With Counter-Terrorism Partnerships: Tackling the Toughest Cases,"Editor’s Note: This is an excerpt from “Book Review Roundtable: America’s Hot and Cold Relationship with Its Counterterrorism Partners” from our sister publication, the Texas National Security Review. Be sure to check out the full roundtable.

With many Americans — led by the current occupant of the White House — questioning the value of global partnerships and talking as though the United States would be better off going it alone, there is no better time to assess the role other countries play in achieving U.S. counter-terrorism objectives. Anyone who has been involved in crafting U.S. counter-terrorism policy inside the government knows the essential importance of these relationships. But they also are soberly aware of how troubling they can be.

America’s fight against terror has been the subject of a mountain of books over the nearly two decades since 9/11. Most have been inside-accounts of policymaking from Washington’s bureaucratic trenches or dramatic tales of counter-terrorism missions. Yet few have made a systematic assessment, benefitting from the latest scholarship, of the ways counter-terrorism cooperation actually works, showing how and why success is often so elusive. That’s what makes Stephen Tankel’s latest book, With Us and Against Us, so timely. It combines his solid grounding in the academic literature on alliances and international cooperation with his first-hand experience in sausage-making policy at the Pentagon to give readers a comprehensive and thought-provoking tour through some of the toughest — and certainly most frustrating — counter-terrorism relationships in recent U.S. history.

The fight against terrorism is usually discussed simplistically as one in which there are only friends and enemies, best summarized by the “with us or against us” statement of President George W. Bush just a week after the September 11 attacks. Yet the reality is far more complex, and the countries that take up the most time for policymakers are those that fall in between the categories of ally or foe — especially Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Mali, and Pakistan. In many ways, when it comes to tackling terrorist threats, these countries are both firefighters and arsonists. And while cooperation with them is crucial, it has been exceedingly difficult, whether because of state weakness, conflicting interests, or outright duplicity.

Tankel takes a deep-dive into the toughest cases, detailing the recent history of Washington’s approach toward these “frenemies” and providing a useful analytical framework for understanding when and why success is possible or not. It is an unflinching account of how difficult these partners can be. He also reveals the difficulties that the United States itself brings to the table, whether it is unrealistic expectations that cooperation will be easier or leverage more effective, over-reliance on military tools, sending mixed messages, or misunderstanding threat perceptions. Any aspiring policymaker will benefit from this book, as well as by following the debate and discussion it provokes, illustrated by the three insightful contributions to this roundtable.

In a comprehensive overview of Tankel’s book, Stanford’s Martha Crenshaw supports his core arguments, highlighting the value of his conceptualization of the challenge and his clear and informative case studies. At the same time, she also proposes several interesting avenues of research that are worth further exploration. For example, Crenshaw highlights the fact that, despite trillions of dollars spent on a variety of counter-terrorism activities during the past 15 years, the United States still has difficulty accounting for where the money goes and what precisely the impact has been. She also makes the intriguing suggestion that there is something to learn from U.S. efforts to cooperate with other countries in other security areas, such as with Mexico in counter-narcotics efforts and law enforcement.

Finally, Crenshaw echoes a point Tankel stresses: The United States will never be able to get more out of its partnerships with these difficult states unless it develops a comprehensive, clearly articulated counter-terrorism policy with improved integration of policy tools. Tankel’s concluding chapter offers some pragmatic suggestions, but the subject is so knotted it warrants a book of its own.

Jacob Shapiro, professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton, seems to agree with many of Tankel’s and Crenshaw’s assessments and policy recommendations, but focuses mainly on the theoretical foundations of Tankel’s work, offering an alternative academic literature, which he argues provides a more compelling way to understand the problem. (Crenshaw makes a similar point, but spends far less time on the subject.) Instead of seeing these counter-terrorism partnerships as interstate security relationships relying on the logic of alliances, Shapiro contends that they are better described as interdependent relationships with only partially-aligned interests, and, therefore, are better understood through the frameworks of agency theory and organizational economics.

To make his case, Shapiro highlights the work of other scholars working in these traditions, going into detail about theoretical arguments that will be unfamiliar to many non-academic readers, including this one. His explanation of competing conceptual arguments is informative and adds some nuance to Tankel’s analysis. But despite the differences in theoretical approach, the bottom-line remains essentially the same: If interests diverge and threats to punish partner states — such as curtailing engagement or withholding assistance — don’t generate meaningful costs, then cooperation will be limited.

Policymakers fully understand this point, as Christine Abizaid’s thoughtful and revealing response to Tankel makes clear. Abizaid spent several years during the Obama administration shaping the Pentagon’s approach toward Pakistan. Her account reinforces Tankel’s narrative about the difficulties in dealing with that deeply troubled but essential counter-terrorism partner. She reviews the tangled recent history of Washington’s attempts to influence Islamabad’s behavior to make it a more “strategic partner,” from pouring in civilian and security assistance to threatening to withhold it. These efforts achieved narrow results where interests overlapped — such as the disruption of al-Qaeda and Tehrik-e-Taliban — but not the kind of strategic shift anyone hoped for. Creating and using leverage has proven to be much easier in theory than it is in practice.

So where does this leave things? Taken together, Tankel’s book and the responses to it in this roundtable explain the limits of American power, even when it comes to addressing an issue that is at the core of U.S. national security. All these authors suggest ways the United States could be more effective in getting what it wants — such as by better understanding America’s partners, adjusting expectations, sending a consistent message about goals and redlines, and having greater balance among U.S. military, diplomatic, and development tools. These are hard to achieve even in the best of times. With the current administration, progress in any of these areas seems unlikely.

Although none of these authors offer a silver bullet — or assert that any are available — policymakers and citizens alike will benefit from thinking about the post-9/11 counter-terrorism challenge, soon entering its third decade, with a clearer analytical framework and a dispassionate understanding of recent history. And in this respect, Tankel’s With Us or Against Us, and the essays it inspired in this roundtable, are a terrific place to start.

The study, Partners in Transit: A Review of Partnerships between Transportation Network Companies and Public Agencies explores 29 partnerships designed to enable transit operators and TNCs (predominately Lyft and Uber) to solve mobility problems collaboratively that each sector would have difficulty solving alone.

This strategy has its risks, but is backed by research showing ridesharing and transit can complement each other in many situations, notes professor Joe Schwieterman, a co-author of the study. A properly designed program, the experience shows, can be cost effective when compared to the cost of buying buses and paying for labor, fuel and maintenance on lightly used routes. Nevertheless, both political and operational barriers exist: “Partnerships can be awkward due to heightened competition between ridesharing and transit, especially where the expansion of new lower-priced services such as Lyft Line and UberPool is taking place,” Schwieterman concludes.



The partnerships tend to differ widely between metropolitan regions. Dublin, California, offers across-the-board 50 percent discounts of up to $5 on all Uber and Lyft trips within its boundaries, including those shuttling to its Bay Area Rapid Transit station. Monrovia, California’s partnership goes one step further, subsidizing Lyft rides to the point that all trips starting and ending within its boundaries cost just $0.50. Since the program’s introduction in March, more than 53,000 trips have been taken at this ultra-low rate.

Other partnerships focus on particular routes or areas. Programs in Dayton, Ohio, (administered by its Regional Transportation Authority), as well as those in San Clemente, California, and Marin County, California, are good examples of this, limiting rideshare discounts to certain designated transit stops. Across the Canadian border, Innsifil, Ontario — reportedly Uber’s first program in that country — offers $5 discounts for most trips within its boundaries.

Charlotte, North Carolina, improves access to its Lynx light-rail system by offering discounted Lyft rides to/from a pair of stations that start or end within certain geographic areas. Austin, Texas’s program involves RideAustin, a homegrown TNC; riders receive free trips within its Exposition Area, which has many technology jobs, as well as those trips to/from nearby Capital Metro bus stops.

Even so, as co-author Mallory Livingston notes, “Public officials are feeling pressure to think outside the box to fill gaps in their transit networks and gain experience working with new technologies. Many programs have a distinctly home-grown feel. Almost all take into account local problem spots, such as “transit deserts” and recent service cutbacks”.

Altogether, the study shows, 11 of the 50 largest transit agencies in the United States have partnerships strategies involving TNCs. If more major players develop programs, there will likely be “strings attached” for users due to the obvious problem that a poorly designed program could cannibalize bus and train ridership — and worsen roadway congestion. Agencies in Boston and Las Vegas, for example, have created programs limited primarily to paratransit-eligible users to test the waters while managing risk.

Presently, there is a great deal of interest in incorporating payment for both rideshares and transit — and connections between the two — on a single app. The rollout of this appears imminent—once sensitive issues such as protecting private information and technological hurdles can be crossed.

123,https://geomarketing.com/why-marketers-are-prioritizing-partnerships-with-microinfluencers,"Thu, 02 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",GeoMarketing,Why Marketers Are Prioritizing Partnerships With Microinfluencers,"Nearly half (46 percent) of fashion, cosmetics, and luxury retailers in Europe and the U.S. consider “microinfluencers” to be the most effective tier of influencers on social media — and will dedicate their influencer marketing efforts to partnering with them, according to a new report from eMarketer.

What’s a microinfluencer? Defined as a public social media personality with 10K to 100K followers (typically on Instagram, but platform agnostic), these niche-popular profiles are increasingly of interest to marketers, who find that a smaller following increases the perception of authenticity amongst an audience.

Proof of the trend? While in the earlier days of influencer marketing celebrities (1.5+ million followers) were seen as the major “get” to boost brand awareness on a massive scale, today only 11 percent of retailers surveyed believe celebrity endorsements are the most effective. In fact, a whopping 80 percent rate micro and macro influencers as most effective — meaning that they’ll be focusing on working with influencers who have 10K to 500K followers total. They cite mega influencers (500K +) and celebrities as markedly less attractive.

“People connect with microinfluencers because of their authenticity and honest perspective,” says Laura Brinker, VP of beauty brand partnerships at Influenster, in the report. “They feel as if they are a person just like them. And with authenticity at the core of what brands desire, they’ve started looking more toward smaller influencers with higher engagement rates.”

Does Size Matter?

Deciding whether to partner with a micro or “macro” influencer? It all depends on the brand, the campaign, and the goals for reach — but the present trend toward “micro” means that marketers are coming to realize that, with influencer marketing, bigger isn’t always better.

As we’ve written previously, the additional advantage of working with a micro-influencer is that, due to their smaller fan base, many of them are able to directly engage with followers — meaning that they can answer questions about a promotion or brand via direct message or in a comments, building a valuable one-to-one connection. Because they’re not dealing with comments and messages from millions of followers, they have the time to respond directly, thereby seeming more accessible. They are often available to answer organic questions about why they chose to partner with a certain brand, which can make sponsorships more authentic that your average “celebrity holding up a Coke can” campaign.

Additionally, “when you’re dividing up a market budget, it helps if you can pilot a lot of small experiments rather than spend your budget in one fell swoop,” Simon Ross explained in an article for Entrepreneur. “Working with micro-influencers allows you to do just that. The average micro-influencer charges around $250 per post, whereas the average celebrity can cost you upwards of $25,000.”

At the end of the day, influencer marketing is not a replacement for direct communication between a brand and its consumers. But it is an incredibly valuable tool — particularly in the current social media marketing landscape. And with an abundance of hyper-specific microinfluencers out there, SMBs and local biz can try out the tactic without breaking the bank.","“People connect with microinfluencers because of their authenticity and honest perspective,” says Laura Brinker, VP of beauty brand partnerships at Influenster, in the report.

Not long after the National League for Democracy came to power in 2016, public-private partnerships (PPPs) became a buzzword among government ministers and public officials.

It is understandable, given Myanmar’s immense infrastructure needs. In a 2013 country report, the McKinsey Global Institute estimated Myanmar’s infrastructure needs at $320 billion by 2030. The G-20 Initiative Global Infrastructure Hub estimated in 2017 that Myanmar needed $224 billion by 2040.

Investment shortfalls against these estimates will have a huge impact on Myanmar’s economic development and nation-building. There are also many studies, by the World Bank and others, pointing to a strong correlation between infrastructure investment and GDP growth. If Myanmar continues at its current level of infrastructure investment, the country’s sustainable development goals will not be met.

One way to fill the huge infrastructure gap left behind by successive authoritarian governments is PPP. Numerous studies by multilateral and bilateral institutions such as the Asian Development Bank have recommend this approach for Myanmar and other countries in the region. Therefore, it is not surprising that the government adopted PPP as the main approach to fulfilling the country’s infrastructure needs.

However, PPPs are not a magic wand. It is a very complex investment model involving multiple stakeholders and long-term regulatory oversight. Although it is called a public-private partnership, it is privatization by another name since public assets are transferred to private entities on long-term concession contracts, in some cases for 70 years.

PPPs have been in existence in Myanmar for many years and are commonly known as build-operate-transfers (BOTs). The track record of privatization and BOTs in Myanmar is not good and most people consider them to be asset stripping by cronies. A number of country analyses by bilateral and multilateral institutions on the current PPP situation also point out that Myanmar lacks a legal and regulatory framework and is weak on the institutional capacity needed to manage PPPs effectively and efficiently.

In my opinion, by observing the calls for expressions of interest and requests for proposals from various ministries for different types of PPPs — from community centers to airport rehabilitations, elevated expressways to power projects — it seems the government is going all-out on PPPs.

A draft PPP policy document prepared for the government by two UN consultants reinforces this belief. It states that “participation in PPPs may take place in both productive and socio-economic service sectors.” The list includes every public sector, from health care to education, social welfare, energy, transportation, tourism and information and computer technology.

This all-out approach to PPPs can be problematic, as it can be tantamount to wholesale privatization or a massive transfer of public assets without benefiting the public to the extent that past practices have. Public utilities and state real estate assets, for example, could fall into private hands via PPPs given the current level of institutional capacity and human resources in the ministries and regional governments.

There are many examples in which even the governments of developed countries could not manage PPPs properly and wasted hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers’ money. Metronet, in the U.K., is a case in point. Moreover, if all the ministries and regional governments in Myanmar were involved in complex PPP projects, they might end up spending much of their time on them and not be able to fulfill their core functions effectively. Therefore, the central government should take a more strategic approach to PPPs by identifying priority infrastructure projects and setting criteria for different types of financing.

The government understandably needs to tap private capital for infrastructure development in Myanmar and naturally adopted the PPP model as a main pillar of its infrastructure program. However, taking the example of the Philippines, the successful implementation of a sustainable and inclusive PPP program necessitates strong political support, clear and transparent policies, enhanced capacity of implementing agencies, a sufficiently resourced PPP knowledge center able to provide essential technical, financial and legal advisory support to ministries, and a pipeline of viable PPP projects.

There is no shortcut to a sustainable and inclusive PPP program. If the government goes headlong, it could face political backlash.

Over the past two years, ESFCOM representatives have met with hospital and clinic staff in 37 of Washington’s 39 counties. As of the beginning of the 2018-19 academic year, the college has secured 63 affiliation agreements with clinical partners across the state, with 24 of them being in rural communities.

In addition, the college has affiliation agreements with the Tulalip Tribe of Indians and has entered discussions with the Spokane, Colville, Kalispel and Coeur d’Alene tribes.

Part of the college’s community-based training model, affiliation agreements allow hospitals and clinics to host and educate WSU medical students during their four years of medical school. Students spend their first two years on the Spokane campus and experience six clinical campus weeks at affiliate sites during those two years. They spend their final two years gaining full-time clinical experience at affiliate sites in communities near WSU campus locations across the state: Everett, Spokane, Tri-Cities and Vancouver.

Clinical partners in rural areas are thrilled to host WSU medical students who learn about the town and its people and become part of the community. These clinics and hospitals are often critical access hospitals that are the lifeblood of their communities. By providing unique clinical experiences for students to be embedded in rural and underserved settings, it increases the likelihood they will remain there to practice medicine.

For the 60th Maintenance Squadron (MXS) from Travis Air Force Base, California, they are unable to spray paint to renew their C-17s’ paint and have to roll the paint onto the aircraft. Airmen at McChord Field are able to spray paint and are working toward building a partnership with Travis AFB, and other C-17 bases, to use McChord facilities to meet this requirement.

Travis Airmen visited McChord to use their paint barn for the first time from July 31 to Aug. 9, as it takes about ten days to prepare and paint the jet while providing enough time for the paint to cure.

“McChord has arguably the best C-17 field level paint barn in Air Mobility Command (AMC),” said 1st Lt. Joshua Fugle, 62nd MXS fabrication flight commander. “The facility as it stands is good, but it needs upgrades to continue to be reliable and those upgrades cost money. Travis and many other bases not only don’t have a paint barn but are also extremely limited as to how and how much the base can paint.”

With McChord’s paint barn being a step above what most AMC bases have, and the need for other bases to paint their C-17s, McChord is sharing their facilities. The increase in traffic also helps further justify the needed paint barn upgrades.

“What we hope is this will be a mutually beneficial partnership,” said 2nd Lt. Krista Kelly, 60th MXS fabrication flight commander. “Long term, our goal is to get every single one of our jets touched up [at McChord] at least once in the next few years. We’ll probably do about three a year; at least that is what our hopes are, but we don’t know if that will happen.”

The paint on the C-17 protects the aircraft from water entrapment, provides ultraviolet protection, aids in fuel efficiency and, most importantly, is a form of corrosion control. Without the paint as a protective layer, the metal components, such as the panels, hinges, rivets, etc., would be eaten away by rust and potentially fall off. Spraying is much more effective in bonding the paint to the metal versus rolling it on, and can provide protection for a longer amount of time.

“It’s making sure we’re extending the life of our jet, and corrosion is the number one killer of jets,” Kelly said. “We don’t have anything else coming down the line to replace our C-17s, so we have to take the best care of them we can. That plane flies because of paint; corrosion prevention is vital. It’s a huge part of what we do.”

Because the 60th MXS does not have the permission or ability to spray-paint their C-17s, the Airmen stationed at Travis then do not have the means to train on how to use the spray paint equipment or prepare the jet for the process. Collaborating with the 62nd MXS to paint their C-17s at McChord Field provides their Airmen with the opportunity to learn those skill sets, making them better qualified Airmen.

“This is our first time painting here, and for a lot of these guys, this is the first time they are going to be spraying at all,” Kelly said. “Some of our [less experienced] members, and even some of our [more experienced], have never sprayed before because we can’t do it in California. We’re taking it pretty slow so they have all the training they need.”

This is Travis’ first trip to McChord for this purpose, and is a test to see how everything will go and if it will be a viable option to meet future needs.

“The 62nd Airlift Wing has been fabulous in regards to making sure we have all of the supplies we may need,” Kelly said. “Working with them has been a dream. A lot of this trip is specifically going back and making sure we know what we need for next time. Lessons learned, like things that we didn’t bring enough of or at all.”

The ultimate plan is to have multiple bases using McChord’s paint barn to maintain their C-17s.

“The initial test run was a great success,” Fugle said. “This was just one of many to come as we are working with almost every C-17 base to make McChord the AMC C-17 regional paint facility. Travis was first due to proximity, interest in the program and the EPA hardships they face in California.”

“Like any program this regional paint facility can either be a huge benefit to AMC or it can become the bane of the corrosion control program, it all depends on how it is treated and how we as leaders treat our assets,” Fugle continued. “If not properly managed, we will have a great idea with high expectations turn into a total flop. I fully believe our leadership team is on track to make this program a success and the greater Air Force will benefit from this partnership.”

Every base is like a wheel or cog in the engine that is the Air Force. It is when they work together that the Air Force can be most efficient and achieve its goals.

“I think it will be beneficial for us to come up here and use these resources,” said Staff Sgt. Fernando Ortiz, 60th MXS aircraft structural maintenance technician. “We’re all one Air Force. I know there are different bases and subcultures, but at the end of the day we’re all in the same Air Force and should be helping each other out.”

McChord is working on building a new partnership with all of the bases in its command that will help extend the life of one of their vital assets to better the Air Force for everyone involved.

“MXS is a great team and we all believe in being good teammates across the C-17 community,” said Anthony Babcock, 62nd Maintenance Group commander. We’re really pleased that we can help out other units across the Air Force.”","For the 60th Maintenance Squadron (MXS) from Travis Air Force Base, California, they are unable to spray paint to renew their C-17s’ paint and have to roll the paint onto the aircraft.

Why is it that despite Africa’s vast natural resources and the recipient of tens of billions of dollars in foreign aid every year, the eradication of poverty remains an illusion?

As Mia Perry a Senior Lecturer at the University of Glasgow, concludes in theconversation.com: “Money is not the currency of well-being, sustainability and community cohesion. More often, it’s a tool for influence and power dynamics that will favour the creditor. That’s why partnerships that rely on different types of resources and bring people together to design and act on context-relevant solutions can be such powerful drivers of change. That’s why for resource rich Africa, promoting self reliance would be key to eliminating poverty.”

This is Mia Perry’s analysis of what has become a complex, multifaceted and protracted problem for Africa:

Nigeria recently surpassed India to become the country with the highest number of people living in extreme poverty: 87 million. Nigeria is oil rich and boasts Africa’s fastest growing economy. Yet six of its people fall into extreme poverty every minute.

This story isn’t unique to Nigeria. It’s echoed in other resource-rich countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola where an exploitative elite and multinational companies keep wealth from reaching the majority of citizens. By 2030, it’s estimated that 82% of the world’s poorest people will live in Africa.

This is the continent’s paradox: vast natural resources and mineral reserves alongside extreme poverty.

Historically, poverty has been predominantly dealt with as a lack of material resources or an income deprivation issue.

Development work has focused on pushing resources to poor communities.

Many have criticised the availability of “free money” though international aid, which they say has created a “dependency syndrome”, dishonest procurement and white elephant projects.

Aid work has also been accused of fostering paternalism rather than partnership.

The reality is that poverty is about more than just money. If money alone were the solution, poverty would have ended: more than $50 billion was given as overseas development assistance to Africa in 2017 alone.

Without contextual knowledge, education and adaptation, foreign or imposed practices or resources cause new sets of problems. This is seen again and again across countries that depend on aid.

For example, where food poverty was causing under-nutrition in parts of Malawi, financial aid has alleviated it. But that problem is quickly being replaced by diabetes and hypertension – because of a narrow financial solution to a complex problem.

We argue that tackling poverty requires a different focus, rather than just money. It requires partnerships and practices that promote learning, particularly in relation to cultural and self knowledge. Having communities identify their own problems, then collaborate to find solutions, is also crucial. Money has a role to play in partnerships, but projects shouldn’t default to depending solely on it.

Driven communities

Many of the factors that are blamed for contributing to poverty are not measurable in dollar terms or connected to income. These include people’s lack of choices, restriction of freedom, lack of skills, gender castes and barriers.

Understanding these issues and their complexities requires looking at poverty through a sustainability lens. This is a perspective that focuses on ethical and innovative ways to look at and use resources, share knowledge, and build community to affect positive change.

Our work with the Sustainable Futures in Africa Network has shown the importance of this lens. We’re an interdisciplinary collective of researchers, educators, and communities of practice that aims to build understanding, research, and practice in socio-ecological sustainability(which recognises the interconnection between social and ecological systems) in Africa.

We work from the understanding that because poverty is multifaceted, solutions to alleviate it must be multifaceted, too.

A number of the community projects we work with are engaged in poverty reduction practices but don’t focus solely on generating income. These projects are driven by communities on their own with existing resources; they rely on their own abilities and efforts that are not externally funded.

One example is ECOaction, which works in a slum community on the outskirts of Kampala in Uganda. Residents largely rely on collecting and selling discarded plastic bottles collected from across the city for small amounts of money.

With no resource other than time and vision, residents have built a community hall from recycled water bottles and an urban garden that grows food for residents and a chicken farm. Colourful murals and sculpture can be found around every corner.

In Botswana, the Sustainable Futures in Africa team is working with a community in Mmadinare to develop a project that will protect their farm land from wild elephants. This will not rely on, or generate, external funding. But it will protect the farmers’ and the wild animals’ interests.

There are other ways to build strong sustainable communities without external financial resources. In Taba Padang, a village in Indonesia, sustainable community forestry is helping improve human wellbeing. There’s also Boomu African Village in Uganda, where a women’s group participates in eco-tourism and invests back into the community. They have built a nursery school and trained other residents in their village to get involved in eco-tourism.

Other self-reliance projects centre on health. For example in Lesotho, volunteers participate in community home-based health care and fill the gap in the community health care chain.

A new lens

There is, of course, no one-size-fits-all solution that will end poverty. But aid in the form of donated money, from one place to another, is culturally, practically, and ethically problematic.

Money is not the currency of well-being, sustainability and community cohesion. More often, it’s a tool for influence and power dynamics that will favour the creditor. That’s why partnerships that rely on different types of resources and bring people together to design and act on context-relevant solutions can be such powerful drivers of change. That’s why for resource rich Africa, promoting self reliance would be key to eliminating poverty.

The Reds were rarely under serious threat against West Ham United at Anfield on Sunday, easing to a 4-0 Premier League win once Mohamed Salah broke the deadlock in the 19th minute.

The visitors registered only two shots on target as Alisson made his competitive debut for the club and helped extend an impressive defensive run on home soil.

Jürgen Klopp’s side have not conceded a goal in any of their past six Anfield league matches.

That streak continued despite a reshuffle; Joe Gomez switched from full-back to the centre in the absence of the injured Ragnar Klavan, Dejan Lovren and Joel Matip.

But Van Dijk alongside him had no doubts about the No.12’s capabilities.

“I was not really worried, to be fair,” said the Netherlands international.

“I’ve played a couple of games in pre-season with Joe at centre-back and I have a very good relationship with him, a very good understanding outside of the pitch as well.

“We need everyone in the squad.”

On Alisson, he said: “We speak a lot. He’s very vocal and that helps. It helps me and everyone in the backline. I think his presence is very good as well.

“He has a lot of qualities on the ball that help us playing. We’ve worked on [our relationship] the whole pre-season and we’ll keep practising. There’s still a lot to do.

“It’s just one game. We had a good pre-season with good results and games where we’ve played very well.

The UN system heads’ conclusions are reflected in a report of the UN Secretary-General to the UN General Assembly (UNGA).

In 2017, the JIU issued a report titled, ‘The United Nations System: Private Sector Partnerships Arrangements in the Context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’ (JIU/REP/2017/8), authored by Petru Dumitriu, Inspector. According to the author, the need for this review came from: a “new wave of creating silos”; a need to shift from “ad hoc, short-term partnerships, focused primarily on resource mobilization” to longer-term, strategic and more stable forms of collaboration with the private sector; and the private sector’s need for information on engaging with the SDGs. The inspector adds that “these educational efforts are a major responsibility of the United Nations system as the orchestrator and facilitator of partnerships at regional, national and global levels.”

The 43-page document outlines the “normative basis” for private sector partnerships, including legal forms and operational frameworks, and discusses operational and administrative aspects of partnerships. The report builds on previous reports on protecting the image, reputation and values of the UN, including through safeguards for due diligence and risk management, and focuses on making the UN system “more effective in its cooperation with the private sector to support the 2030 Agenda” and fostering sustainability in the private sector’s business models. The report notes a shift in the approach to due diligence from “do not harm” to “do good.”

A chart outlines 12 recommended actions to be taken by various parts of the UN, its funds and programmes, and specialized agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The recommendations address, inter alia: revising the current guidelines on cooperation between the UN and the business sector; proposing a set of rules and guidelines for partnerships with the private sector, to allow for greater flexibility, simplification of procedures and speed in reaction; reviewing the mandate of the UN Office for Partnerships (UNOP) with regard to responsibilities for providing advice and facilitating partnerships in support of the SDGs; enhancing the role of the Private Sector Focal Points Network; creating a common database for vetting businesses; revising the mandate of the UN Global Compact to clarify its role in engaging business to support the 2030 Agenda and enhance UN Member States’ role in governance of the Global Compact; enhancing ownership and partnership at the regional and country levels; and support engagement by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

The report notes a shift in the approach to due diligence from “do not harm” to “do good.”

High-level UN officials met in the context of the UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB) to discuss the JIU report on private sector partnerships, and their views are captured in a report to the UNGA from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. The CEB organizations welcome the report and “generally support its findings and recommendations.” They also:

note that their specific needs and objectives vary in terms of private sector engagement, inviting the JIU to be specific in formulating its recommendations;

support the idea of updating frameworks for collaboration and shifting towards stimulating partnerships, rather than focusing on protection from risk;

note capacity needs at regional and country levels;

suggest clarifying the definitions of “business sector” (for-profit) and “private sector” (including not-for-profit foundations); and

note the establishment of a dedicated Results Group for Strategic Partnerships, within the context of the UN Sustainable Development Group. The Results Group’s members include the Global Compact Office and UNOP. The Results Group is tasked with: developing a UN-coordinated approach to strategic partnerships with the private sector, aligning tools and due diligence processes, and supporting countries and regions in their development of collaborations with the private sector; and simplifying processes to facilitate an increase in partnerships and effective communication between the UN and the private sector.

The CEB organizations also offer specific comments on each of the 12 recommendations. The report is expected to be considered by the UNGA during its 73rd session.

In another report to the UNGA, the Secretary-General discusses UNOP, which provides partnership advisory and outreach services in response to demand from the UN system, governments and non-State actors. The report indicates that in 2017, numerous companies, foundations and civil society organizations approached UNOP to seek advice and explore paths of engagement with the UN, with most enquiries related to mapping specific collaborative opportunities and identifying relevant partners within the UN system towards the advancement of the SDGs.

In December 2017, Guterres announced that UNOP will be “firmly established as the Organization’s global gateway for partnerships” (A/72/684-E/2018/7). In 2018, the Executive Office of the Secretary-General initiated a review of the operations of UNOP to inform a “reinvigorated platform for more effective partner engagement of public and private sector stakeholders.” [JIU report: United Nations System: Private Sector Partnership Arrangements in the Context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (A/73/186)] [CEB Report] [SDG Knowledge Hub story on UNEP report]","30 August 2018: The heads of UN system entities discussed the UN’s approach to private sector partnerships for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in response to a report from the UN’s Joint Inspection Unit (JIU).

Now, in a rather surprising turn of events, the fast food giant and coffee chain are teaming up to tackle an issue facing the global home team — namely, how to make their operations more sustainable.

Combined, the two iconic brands are responsible for circulating 4% of the 600 billion disposable cups used around the world each year. While their current cups are technically recyclable, infrastructure limitations in the U.S. render the process impractical. Thanks to a donation of $5 million from each company, the NextGen Cup Challenge is opening the initiative to the public and distributing grants to fund the most promising ideas for a fully recyclable and compostable alternative.

Companies worldwide are increasingly moving toward sustainable practices, driven by both consumer demand and a desire to contribute to a solution to our environmental woes. Now, sweeping changes are being enacted by entire cities, such as Seattle’s ban on plastic straws and utensils. Not only does this initiative keep environmental causes in the limelight, but it also demonstrates that the broader the buy-in, the more meaningful the change.

The Power of Partnerships

Whatever you’re hoping to accomplish, and regardless of the size of your organization, a successful partnership will allow you to achieve it on a much greater scale than you could hope to operating alone. Especially for small organizations, it’s important not to discount the power that can be unleashed by engaging with the right partner. For Peter Seligmann, founding CEO and chairman of the board at Conservation International, this realization came as the organization was celebrating its 20th anniversary.

In its first two decades, the nonprofit established protections for more than 200 million acres of some of the most biodiverse land around the world. While this was certainly a significant accomplishment, it struck Seligmann that the total area amounted to only a 30-mile-wide strip of land around the equator. With the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Control’s Fourth Assessment Report, he knew that the conservation effort needed to go from protecting obscure species around the world to protecting one in particular that was facing impending danger: humanity.

With its change in mission, Conservation International had to find new partners. As Seligmann points out, “Companies can scale in a meaningful way only if they have partners to amplify their good ideas. When we changed our mission, we changed our partnerships in order to pair with organizations that not only understood our goals, but also could better us.” That included separate partnerships with Starbucks and McDonald’s to help create more sustainable farming practices in Central and South American rainforests.

In its search for partners, Conservation International sought companies that wanted to make a lasting impact while offering a chance to appeal to consumer values. As it turns out, partnerships offer quite a few important advantages.

1. Creative partnerships drive engagement.

If you’re aiming to adopt a cause or mission, you’ll need to secure buy-in from your organization. One of the best ways to accomplish this goal is by forming partnerships that can ignite passion among employees and leaders alike. When Microsoft partnered with the Earthwatch Institute, the tech giant’s employees went out in the field to gather data on climate change, which they used to create a teamwide action plan for reducing the company’s environmental impact.

2. Partnering often beats competing.

Competition is inevitable in business, but many challenges are best tackled with a partner. If you’re wondering where to find those opportunities, look no further than industry externalities. Maybe you own a freight company, and you’re concerned about the environmental impact of burning fossil fuels. Partnering with peer companies to offset emissions with carbon credits helps the industry as a whole while giving the participating companies a bigger PR boost than they would get operating alone.

3. Partnering for a cause excites your audience.

Millennials have demonstrated a clear preference for companies that advance a cause, and as they don the mantle of the nation’s largest living adult generation, companies hoping to do business with them should take note. Look to partner with nonprofits, ideally ones relevant to your industry, that have historically done a good job of working with privately owned companies. If your customers can relate to your cause, you’ll do more good while unlocking additional avenues for growth.

4. Working together amplifies your message.

While Starbucks and McDonald’s remain competitors, their partnership to produce a more sustainable cup has mutual benefits. First, the combined resources of the two companies allow them to explore more solutions and ultimately choose the most effective and refined option. A partnership also allows each company to multiply the reach of its message; together, they have a greater societal impact.

Looking at the example set by Starbucks and McDonald’s, it’s clear that partnerships can form in some unlikely places and precipitate far-reaching benefits. And don’t think you have to donate a cool $5 million to form one, either. In fact, to realize the profound benefits of a partnership, all you need is an open mind and a willingness to team up with competitors for a cause.","When it comes to parting you from your breakfast dollar, McDonald’s and Starbucks have always been fierce competitors.

In today’s post, Paula Arce-Trigatti, Director of the National Network of Education Research-Practice Partnerships (NNERPP ; @RPP_Network ) talks with our close friend of the Network, Caitlin Farrell (@ccfarrell ), Director of the National Center for Research in Policy & Practice (NCRPP ; @NCRPP ) about what ‘effectiveness’ means and where the challenges are in measuring the impact of RPPs.

Stay tuned: Thursday we will share a practitioner’s perspective on RPP effectiveness.

Interest in our ability to assess the performance and impacts of research-practice partnerships (RPPs) has noticeably increased in the last few years. With a growing number of partnerships popping up all over the country, more resources are being invested in this type of approach than ever before. Understandably then, a variety of stakeholders are interested in knowing what effective partnering looks like. While there has been some work expanding our thinking on how we might assess the outcomes of RPPs, we are still far from having reliable tools for measuring partnership effectiveness.

At the National Network of Education Research-Practice Partnerships (NNERPP) , we are well aware of this need and are actively working on further developing our knowledge in this area. At the National Center for Research in Policy & Practice (NCRPP) , Caitlin Farrell and colleagues have studied research-practice partnerships and thought about the different questions that emerge when trying to understand the impact of RPPs (see for example here and here ). Here, we share a conversation between Paula Arce-Trigatti and Caitlin Farrell about the insights from that work.

PA-T: Caitlin, as a researcher of research-practice partnerships, what does “RPP effectiveness” mean to you?

CF: You’re right — Before we can start thinking about how to measure RPP effectiveness, we have to think about how we’re defining effectiveness. There are a number of possible outcomes of RPPs that someone might focus on.

Some partnerships seek to bring in parent and community voices into discussions on how to improve education, so whether these groups feel more heard and included as a result of an RPP might matter. Others may want to focus on intermediate outcomes, like whether RPP participants’ access to research increases or whether they value and use research more due to their involvement in an RPP. (See for example this previous blog post about what happens when educators and researchers work together in partnerships.)

Still others might want to focus on long-term outcomes of RPPs, like changes in student academic or socio-emotional outcomes. Sometimes, it’s the innovation, like a new curriculum, an RPP produces that results in increased learning. My colleagues and I at NCRPP are interested in understanding how RPPs may contribute to shifts in research use in policymaking, and with what consequences for policies and practices in school districts.

So, the first question in any discussion about RPP effectiveness needs to be, what possible consequences of RPPs do we value and want to track?

PA-T: One thing we’ve seen in the RPP field is that there is no one shared focus for RPP effectiveness emerging yet. What’s contributing to that divergence?

CF: One issue is that different stakeholders have different kinds of questions related to RPP effectiveness, and each group likely has different intended uses for the data gathered, too. So, at NCRPP, we’re policy researchers who focus on questions with an organizational lens. One NCRPP study focuses on understanding how ideas from RPPs contribute to organizational policies, practice, and routines, for example. A major goal of ours is to use the data we gather to help generate empirical findings and develop theory for the field more broadly.

In contrast, an individual RPP may have specific goals that are a part of their localized theory of action . Their gathering of RPP effectiveness measures are then useful for formative purposes, to test that theory and also refine their strategies as an RPP so they can work more effectively and efficiently.

A third potential perspective are the questions arising from the funding community. A funder of RPPs may be most interested in understanding the return on their investment , focusing on a particular outcome based on their organization’s overarching mission. They may be interested in developing criteria for comparing investments, evaluating the “success” of past investments, or to guide future funding investments.

These different foci — and the potential uses of the evidence gathered — all contribute to the variation we’re seeing in the field today. It’s important to note that this variation is not a bad thing. It just presents challenges to quickly developing a shared language around RPP effectiveness and requires us to be thoughtful about these different dimensions when designing any kind of measurement tool for RPP effectiveness.

PA-T: Given that the RPP field itself is in its infancy, it makes sense that we are only recently able to say something meaningful about impact, performance, and effectiveness of partnerships. What, in your opinion, are the biggest challenges to assessing RPP effectiveness?

CF: Figuring out what outcomes you’re interested in, for whom, and for what purposes is the first place to start.

Some inquiries — like those focused on the return on investment of RPPs, for example — may also beg the question, RPPs as compared to what else? Figuring out what makes for the best counterfactual is not an easy task.

Say, for instance, you want to understand the impact that an RPP focused on college readiness had on the students’ college attendance rates in one district. What would be the best hypothetical comparison here? One might argue that you should compare those outcomes against outcomes from a similarly situated district that had no researcher involvement at all. Or, should you compare it against a district working with a researcher in highly traditional ways, where the research questions were largely developed by the researcher, and findings eventually were published as peer-reviewed journal articles? Or, perhaps you should focus on the RPP as compared to other kinds of external partners who engage with districts, like for-profit organizations or advocacy groups? While not all questions related to RPP effectiveness will require this kind of comparison group, some will, and we will need to think carefully about what makes the most sense.

Being able to determine if an RPP had a certain impact is only one part of the story. Equally as important is understanding the underlying the chain of change that contributed to particular RPP outcomes — the how and the why an RPP was able to make the progress it did.

Let’s return to our hypothetical district who worked with an RPP to improve college readiness. With some investigation, we might learn that RPP members worked together in ongoing ways that supported trust and collaboration. The trust that developed meant that the members made sense of some difficult research findings together, contributing to shifts in how district leaders understood the problem of college readiness. Leaders also trusted researchers to connect them to new information on effective course re-design strategies for increasing college readiness. Together, the partners drew on these new understanding as they re-designed high school courses. The new policy went into effect, and the accompanying professional development helped shift school leader and teacher behaviors. Ultimately, school sites had more supportive college-going cultures in school, and it was at this point that the district saw increases in college attendance rates.

Understanding this pathway helps make clear the complex, interrelated chain of events, actors, behaviors, and conditions that are involved in achieving these outcomes. It helps us identify particular short-term outcomes (e.g., the development of trust within the RPP) that may contribute to proximal outcomes (e.g., district leaders’ use of research in policymaking) and long-term outcomes (e.g., change in student outcomes). When things don’t go to plan, we have a better idea of where we might intervene. And, for another RPP looking to replicate this successful experience, this pathway provides a roadmap for understanding what may need to be in place before getting started.

PA-T: There have been some efforts around developing frameworks and definitions to help RPPs assess their impact. How are these helpful for the field, and what do you think are the next steps?

CF: The Henrick et al. framework is my go-to resource to share when someone asks me about RPP effectiveness — either for researchers who want to study this phenomenon or for participants of RPPs who want to think about progress they’re making towards local goals. The framework lays out five different dimensions, surfaced from conversations with RPP members from different forms of RPPs. They include both process and outcome dimensions — both are critical for understanding RPP effectiveness. The indicators are also general enough that many different types of partnerships — including research alliances, networked improvement communities, design research, or community-based partnerships — may find them useful. The framework is a great starting place for the field, and next steps include developing more specific measures, indicators, and tools to help assess progress.

PA-T: Thanks so much for joining us and sharing your thoughts with us, Caitlin! We look forward to more conversations with you on all things RPP.

CF: My pleasure!

It’s now a common occurrence to see businesses pledging to tackle societal issues that have previously gone unmet.

I find it empowering to hear business leaders discussing societal impact and inclusive growth alongside other traditional business priorities. This exemplifies a shift in the relationship between purpose and profit. They no longer have to be adversarial priorities – purpose and profit can co-exist within the same business strategy.

Deloitte

Sustaining this momentum will require more businesses to adopt a new mindset for action - one that embeds societal impact within the core of an organisation’s purpose.

Over the last year, Deloitte Global has been surveying executives globally across a range of sectors to gain a better understanding of their inclusive growth approach. According to our first Inclusive Growth survey, executives are acutely attuned to the importance of addressing societal issues. However, we found that while the majority of business leaders surveyed publicly support global goals such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), they did not believe their current programmes and initiatives would help achieve the SDGs by 2030. This finding motivated our second survey, which looked at how internal and external stakeholders perceive and measure these programs.

Our second survey found that a rapidly changing business environment—and media coverage—are influencing decision-making when it comes to inclusive growth programs. Over two-thirds of executives noted external factors such as current public sentiment and media coverage are either encouraging them to reevaluate their current strategies and take new action or are adding momentum to efforts already underway.

As businesses tackle systematic challenges such as sustainability, access to education and skills development to prepare for the Fourth Industrial Revolution as well as diversity and inclusion, news headlines are shifting leaders’ approaches as they try to keep up with societal trends.

In our survey, we noticed that not only does the news cycle influence leaders, but also the evolving cultures in which they operate their businesses. For example, according to our survey, the #MeToo movement increasingly motivated leaders in the APAC region, while the skills gap was of growing concern to leaders in Latin America.

The power of collaboration and a multi-stakeholder approach As I have previously explored, business-led inclusive growth efforts require collective action and a sharing of knowledge to understand and implement best practices moving forward. As with other high priority business initiatives, driving inclusive growth efforts requires both internal and external relationships, along with a well-defined strategy embedded within organisational priorities.

Groups such as the World Economic Forum and Social Progress Imperative showcase the power of relationships to drive results, as do collaborative initiatives like Business for 2030. Our survey underscored this point. Executives indicated that partnerships and collaboration with other business leaders as well as with government and nonprofit organizations are necessary when looking to scale and implement solutions.

Measuring for sustained impact As with other aspects of one’s business, measurement is key. Our survey revealed that executives measure their societal impact in a variety of ways to determine if they are successful.

They use internal factors such as employee engagement, retention, and attraction as the primary measure of an initiative’s success. This is particularly crucial as the Millennial and Gen Z generations become a majority of the workforce and seek out businesses that prioritise purpose beyond profit.

However, while inclusive growth initiatives drive employee engagement and inspire the workforce, it is also important to measure their external impact. Executives need to focus on having measurement mechanisms in place that show the broader impact of their efforts.

The survey showed that qualitative, quantitative and revenue metrics are less widely used forms of evaluation. This presents an opportunity for businesses to begin using non-financial and financial measures to evaluate their efforts.

Deloitte Global also found that business leaders might not be reviewing and adjusting their inclusive growth approach as often as they should. The leaders surveyed indicated that they evaluate their programmes once a year or every other year. However, in a 24-hour news environment, and one where public sentiment is having a larger impact on business decisions, business leaders need to be nimble and adjust their approach as needed.

Business can affect systematic change if they set themselves up to make a meaningful impact. As we look to the future, businesses need to develop thoughtful strategies championed at senior leadership levels with clear goals and targets reviewed on a frequent basis. As we continue to drive progress in this area, cultivating partnerships and implementing a strong measurement program will be key to achieving an organisations inclusive growth goals.","I find it empowering to hear business leaders discussing societal impact and inclusive growth alongside other traditional business priorities.

This week, we take a look at an EIT Climate-KIC supported WWF initiative, the Landscape Finance Lab.

Land use accounts for one fourth of world emissions and potentially over one third of possible solutions. But currently, in terms of green finance, only one per cent is going to land-based solutions: Investors and land managers still struggle to generate high-quality and de-risked land-use projects.

In the meantime, major corporations are increasingly engaged with the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability practices. With their brand power and capital, large corporations, in partnership with environmental organisations, have the potential to drive green finance towards land-based solutions, transforming industries and supply chains, and mitigating climate change.

The “Supply Chain and Landscape approach in the Eastern Plain Landscape (EPL) of Cambodia” (SCALE) is an H&M and WWF Landscape Finance Lab initiative to design a landscape investment programme for the textile industry and energy supply chains in Cambodia.

The programme will contribute to the SDGs by promoting sustainable energy materials in the textile industry (from sustainable wood fuel to agricultural waste) and by supporting the resilience of ecosystem services through a jurisdictional sourcing approach in the EPL.

The overall objectives of this landscape scale investment programme are: Hook carbon sinks and resilience into textile supply chain (and other industries at a later stage), engage the garment sector in an energy transition and leverage innovative climate finance.

“There are a number of ways corporations can act on climate. Most of the prominent companies have put measures into place to reduce their emissions by 2020 or 2030, in line with the two degrees UNFCCC target, and using science based targets to do so. This is the case of many WWF partners,” said Paul Chatterton, Founder and Lead, WWF Landscape Finance Lab. “Additionally, a growing number of companies have pledged to a zero deforestation supply chain by 2020 or 2030, engaging their operations in increasing climate resilience and carbon sinks. But, implementing these commitments is a complex and challenging issue that requires strong partnership and multi-stakeholder approaches.”

The Landscape Finance Lab can help turn these commitments into real results: The landscape sourcing prototypes developed by the lab will craft ad-hoc solutions to establish measures to transition to renewable energy, reduce carbon emissions, promote sustainable sourcing of materials and support biodiversity protection and ecosystem resilience.

The Landscape Finance Lab is pioneering an integrated approach that brings together sectors, scales and stakeholders. It incubates landscape programmes and sources, structures, designs and applies new financing solutions. By moving beyond silos of individual interests and working together around one common landscape vision, all stakeholders can find mutually beneficial solutions to achieve environmental, social and economic results.

The landscape incubator utilises innovative financial instruments to unlock new types of capital at scale from untapped sources. The Landscape Finance Lab employs market-driven approaches to create revenue streams that increase their financial viability. It helps landscape stakeholders create long-term holistic solutions over large areas with sustained finance. These landscapes span land and sea areas of more than one million hectares, attracting investments of over €100 million and are able to run sustainably for decades.

“Well managed landscapes can inspire shifts in trade and finance patterns towards sustainability. If we can show that a few landscapes can be sustainable then all landscapes can be sustainable,” said Natalia Krasnodebska, Community Lead, WWF Landscape Finance Lab. “We advocate globally for policies and incentives that stimulate sustainable landscape initiatives.”

The Landscape Finance Lab’s short-term goals are to bring its current landscapes to successful funding and show results in the landscape. In the long-term, it hopes to make sure the whole planet is covered in sustainably managed, regenerated landscapes.

It's more common to think carefully about the commitment you're considering — and examine the likelihood of its success.

Whether you're exploring an alliance to grow your business with other financial advisors or recruiting newcomers to groom over time, the key is choosing compatible individuals who share your sensibilities and passion for client service.

Louis Diamond says the best partnerships flow from diligent preparation. Advisors lay the groundwork by clarifying their goals, researching their options and selecting potential partners in a deliberate, disciplined manner.

Diamond, 27, is executive vice president of Diamond Consultants, a recruiting firm that specializes in advisors. His mother, Mindy Diamond, founded the company in 1998.

Are You Ready To Start Your Own Practice?

Before joining the Morristown, N.J.-based firm, he was a consultant at Ernst & Young and worked in wealth management at Morgan Stanley and UBS. His current role involves working with advisors going independent or changing firms, as well as those who run their own firm as they explore growth opportunities in the financial advisor business through mergers, acquisitions and recruiting.

Building A Successful Financial Advisor Business

In this interview with IBD, Diamond discusses how advisors can increase the odds of orchestrating mutually beneficial partnerships. Finding a good match requires patience, preparation and the ability to empathize with others and offer them a pathway to attain greater success.

IBD: When advisors consider partnering with another advisor, how do you suggest they begin the process?

Louis Diamond: The advisor should take a lot of time to be very clear on what's to gain from the partnership. What are you looking for? What's in it for you? What's in it for the other side?

IBD: Most advisors know to ask themselves these questions, right?

Diamond: Many advisors don't think about what's in it for the other side. You can have the best idea ever for a partnership. But you'll only convince the other person if you do the pre-work that shows how you've thoughtfully considered their side and how they'll gain.

IBD: But what if you're not sure what they want or what they'll gain?

Diamond: You may have to have a series of conversations to find out. Many advisors think they don't have time for these conversations or assume they already know what the other side wants. But you can assume a lot of things that turn out to be wrong. It's better to ask lots of questions and get to know someone personally and professionally rather than jam in what you think they want without asking them first.

IBD: What kind of questions should you ask?

Diamond: It depends on the type of partnership you're considering. But in general, we're talking about questions such as, ""What's your ideal succession plan?"" and ""How can your clients be better served in the future?""

IBD: You said that advisors should know what they're looking for in a partnership. Isn't that obvious?

Diamond: It might be, but they still need to think about it to focus their time more productively. For example, are you looking to expand your capabilities and partner with someone with a complementary skill set? Or are you looking to retire and want a younger advisor for your succession plan?

IBD: How about midcareer advisors who are simply looking to grow their practice by partnering with other advisors?

Diamond: It's important to be realistic and self-aware of what you're looking for. If you're just looking to acquire another advisor's book of business, you might want to go beyond that.

IBD: Why is that important in the financial advisor business?

Diamond: If you just want to acquire a book of business, it's a low probability that you will be successful because everybody is looking for that. So it's better to research advisors out there and show how you can marry what you do with what they do so that it will work out better. For example, you want to be able to say, ""You're a great stock picker. So am I,"" or, ""You want to help your best clients as you retire. I can accommodate that.""

IBD: If you see a good fit and convince the other advisor that a partnership makes sense, what's the next step?

Diamond: Weigh options on how to structure the partnership agreement. Will you approach the new partnership as a true merger where both sides share in the combined revenues of the practice? Will you fully acquire the business and pay the other advisor a salary? Or are you just sharing in new revenue that's generated after the partnership is inked?

IBD: What are some pros and cons of these structures?

Diamond: A pro of an incremental revenue share is you're not 100% betting on the partnership and it's easier to unwind it if necessary. You each run your own business and do a revenue split for each new client that each of you bring on. Or for every new client or existing client, you decide to team with another advisor. It can be a 50/50 split or 80/20 or 60/40 or whatever you both agree on.

IBD: What structure tends to work best?

Diamond: In many cases, the best way to partner is to merge everything together so that everyone has the same interests and rows in the same direction. There isn't a magic bullet because each partnering opportunity is unique.

IBD: What traps do advisors fall into when entering into partnerships?

Diamond: They might chase an opportunity just because it's a large opportunity or they see easy money to be made. It's better to partner with someone who does less business but who is better aligned to your culture or your practice. Focus on the fit, not the financials.

IBD: Any other traps you'd warn advisors to avoid?

Diamond: Be patient. Don't rush into it. Don't try to partner with the first person that comes along. Be thoughtful and thorough. You have to kiss a lot of frogs before you find a prince.

Five Eyes refers to the agreement to share intelligence between five English-speaking countries with a lengthy history of cooperation: the United States, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand. To supplement UNG's academic programs in strategic studies, intelligence, and cyber, the university has been working to create new partnerships and opportunities in Five Eyes countries and among the intelligence communities.

""The United States has many bilateral agreements in the intelligence community, and we have very close NATO allies, but the Five Eyes is a very special relationship,"" said Sharon Hamilton, director of liaison and military operations for ILSS. ""Based on those relationships, when UNG began establishing relationships in security studies and intelligence to support our academic programs in that area, it was just natural to gravitate toward the Five Eyes countries.""

UNG has since established partnerships with security think tanks and universities in the Five Eyes nations to facilitate faculty and student exchanges and conference attendance. To date, UNG has established partnerships with the following universities and professional associations: Massey University (New Zealand), University of New Brunswick (Canada), Australian National University, Aberystwyth University (Wales), Australian Institute for Professional Intelligence Officers, New Zealand Institute of Intelligence Professionals, and the Canadian Association of Security and Intelligence Studies.

The partnerships have multiple benefits for UNG such as providing additional study abroad, internship, and conference opportunities for students, especially those who haven't developed foreign language skills.

""It exposes them to a different culture without the barrier of language. New Zealand and the Maori culture is just an amazing example of how different cultures work together and how the indigenous Maori culture has been incorporated into New Zealand's mainstream culture,"" said Hamilton, a retired Army intelligence officer who also teaches homeland security at UNG.

The experience of going into an unfamiliar environment is key for leadership development.

""Those going into the military are going to serve all over the world. The more comfortable they are with stepping into ambiguous and unfamiliar environments, the more effective they will be,"" Hamilton said. ""Every leader, whether they're going into the military, civilian, or business, has to understand and appreciate that there are other perspectives out there.""

Because of the high level of cooperation between the intelligence communities in the five countries, which includes sharing personnel, doctrine, and future concepts, Hamilton said the chances are good that UNG graduates who go into security or intelligence fields will work closely with colleagues from these same countries.

Boaz Craddock, a UNG cadet from Jasper, Georgia, who is pursuing a degree in information systems, attended the National Military Conference at Massey University of Auckland, New Zealand, earlier this year. Craddock seeks to commission as an officer in the Georgia Army National Guard upon graduation and eventually work for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.

""I realized how large the world is, and how small we make it with the power of technology. Speaking to high-ranking officials of a national government helped me make connections in my mind that explored humanity and the art of diplomacy,"" Craddock said. ""Given my expanded scope, I was given a purpose, and when I arrived back in the U.S., I saw my goals and realized what a difference I could make, not only in my immediate community, but also my country and possibly the world.""","Building on national partnerships forged in the wake of World War II, the University of North Georgia’s (UNG) Institute for Leadership and Strategic Studies (ILSS) is finding opportunities for students with colleges, universities and programs in ""Five Eyes"" nations.

People helping others and those partnering with the food bank in their effort to fight hunger were highlighted at a Hunger Action breakfast Tuesday at the local food bank.

Even though it was supposed to primarily serve communities in a 13-county area, what is considered the Northern Tier, the food bank really has become a 27-county logistics hub, said Joe Arthur, executive director of the food bank, who gave an update on the group’s work.

Since 2015, Arthur said the agency’s goal was to serve everyone struggling with hunger with nutritious food by 2025.

“That’s a very tall order,” he said. “But we’re making good progress towards that.

“We decided to add to it this year. We’re in a position where we can’t do everything, but we have amazing partners that are helping people get to the point where they don’t even need our help. That’s really our goal, that’s solving hunger,” he added.

Although the food bank has reached many who struggle with hunger in its coverage area, Arthur said there’s still work to be done. He said contrary to what most people think, hunger is a problem in rural, not just urban, areas of the state.

“We’ve got more people to reach, and it’s highly rural,” he said. “That doesn’t necessarily align with what we see in public reporting. Yes, there is a lot of urban hunger, but there is a lot of rural hunger. We’re going to be at this for as long as it takes.”

The food bank has about 1,000 partners that work with them, such as soup kitchens, shelters, senior centers, low income housing centers and girls’ and boys’ clubs and schools, according to Arthur.

Citing what he called a sobering statistic, “About 150,000 individuals are relying on our network, us and our partners, each and every month. That’s a huge number.” He compared it to one and a half times the capacity of Beaver Stadium coming for food assistance every month.

While his agency has achieved success in getting food to the people who need it and improving the nutritional quality of available food, there are two areas that still need work, he said.

Empowering the food bank’s partners so people can reach a point where they don’t really need help and uniting the support of the general community to alleviate the problem are two goals he noted.

“Even though we talk about hunger and the causes and the work that needs to be done, and while nobody is for hunger, I think our public servants in the room will tell you that we need more of a commitment than that. We can’t just be against something, we need to be engaged. We need to commit resources to do it. And we really want to focus more on our work with the public, to get them in the game as well, to get them into this mission. There are a lot more people that could help that maybe are not engaged in the mission like you are. You are ambassadors for us and you can help us with that,” he added.

Partners of the food banks who received awards and those accepting were:

• Advocacy — Sen. Gene Yaw, Erik Houser, legislative assistant to Yaw

• Corporate donor — Woodlands Bank, Joe Farley, vice-president and CFO

• Food donor — LeClerc Foods, Kevin Rosenow, general manager

• Individual philanthropist–Frank Pellgrino

• Innovation — First Community Foundation Partnership of Pennsylvania, Jennifer Wilson, president and CEO

• Individual volunteer — Heather Kennedy

• Group volunteer — Faith United Methodist Church, Pastor Jake Waybright, Jane Zimmerer and Sharon Atherholt","What really matters to the Central Pennsylvania Food Bank is the people.

Working with its partners, the nation has dismantled terrorist networks and hideouts. It is also engaged with religious leaders, community elders, women, youth and the civil society to “turn the tide against the twisted ideology of hate and religious intolerance,” said the Minister, addressing the UN Assembly’s annual debate.

“The silver lining is, young men and women are not joining terrorist groups,” he added.

He went on to note that the ideologies presented by Al-Shabaab or Al-Qaida are no longer appealing, and the groups no longer have new recruits. In addition, leaders and members are surrendering along with so-named ‘technicals’ (improvised attack vehicles) and weapon caches.

In that context, the Minister called on the UN Security Council to lift the arms embargo on his country, stressing that stronger fighting capacity will help national security forces fully dismantle terrorist groups in a shorter time.

In his address, Minister Isse thanked the African Union Mission for Somalia (AMISOM) and its personnel for their sacrifice and keeping Somalis safe, noting that the country “remains indebted to them.”

Alongside that, gains in security, as well as the Mission’s support to Somali security institutions will enable the country to gradually take over responsibilities from AMISOM, he said.

The Somali Minister highlighted that the country’s reformed, inclusive electoral model has been approved at both central and provincial levels.

He also informed the General Assembly of the country’s economic development goals, building upon its productive capacity, natural potential and international trade.

“We are seeking to strengthen alliances with our core partners to promote trade and investment opportunities even as we widen our scope in our quest for broader, far-reaching economic cooperation,” said Minister Isse.

“We are ready for business,” he said.

What is entrepreneur Cordelia Smith’s biggest challenge? “Letting go of control,” she says.

Since launching her Pueblo, Colo., bath, body and home goods business in 1993, Smith has had her hands in everything from soapmaking to bookkeeping to sales calls. “I’m a very specific, type-A person as to how I want things to look and how I want things done.”

Today, she continues to oversee many aspects of operations at her company, Formulary 55, including marketing and packaging. But there is one critical area where she has loosened her grip: production. In addition to putting more trust in her nine-person in-house team, she has forged partnerships with other small-batch makers to keep product flowing.

“Certain parts, I’ve had to let go of to grow,” Smith says.

Distributing product-making this way has allowed her to offer a range of products that’s entirely handmade, which she sells to both online shoppers and the 800-plus retailers she has wholesale relationships with. Her mix of smart hires and strategic partnerships allows Formulary 55 to get bigger while maintaining the same craftsmanship as when she started out more than 2 decades ago.

Strategic, Sustainable Relationships

Smith’s team of seven full-time and two part-time employees help her meet demand by manufacturing the majority of her products. The revenue from their work funds growth goals like expanding their facilities, she says, making them a critical piece of the puzzle -- though finding the right workers hasn’t always been easy.

“Our crew now is incredibly productive,” she says. But some former employees were taken aback by how demanding the job is. “It’s really hard -- we manufacture so much, and it’s by hand.” So she supplemented her output through partnerships with other experienced vendors, which allowed Formulary 55 to expand its distribution, she says.

And expand, it has -- Smith today has wholesale relationships with popular American retailers like Anthropologie, West Elm and Nordstrom, as well as stores in locations as far-flung as Japan, Australia, Nigeria, Switzerland and Saudi Arabia. In all, 30% of sales revenue comes from deals with larger stores and international retailers, while 59% comes from smaller U.S. boutiques -- many of which are woman -owned, she says.

Best of all, her relationships with the three other small-batch ventures currently crafting her wares -- located in Washington, California and Idaho -- came about organically. She teamed up with one company that a group of past and present employees started, and forged a relationship with another entrepreneur she met on a flight. Smith pays partners per-piece for what they make, and supplies them with the recipes and materials they need. Makers then complete and ship back the finished products to her facilities in Colorado.

Smith has high standards for potential partners. “We look for makers that are already skilled in their fields and still make their products in small batches with great attention to detail,” she says. Engaging other small-batch makers gives her assurance that trusted hands are crafting products to her specifications.

And “it’s really important to us to continue making everything by hand,” Smith says.

Going handmade is not just a selling point for her products -- “it’s the right thing to do,” she says. “It surprises me when I hear about large corporations or manufacturing facilities polluting their own water. I can’t wrap my mind around producing something that’s not socially responsible.” She even confesses to losing sleep over how recyclable her packaging materials are.

The Crafty Life

Smith’s fastidious approach to making products is born of a lifelong love of it. She recalls spending countless afternoons crafting at Campfire Girl meetings and weekends bonding with her beloved Aunt Judy, who made bohemian-style rugs.

As an adult, Smith began focusing on creating soaps and candles, inspired by products she enjoyed using in her own home. She realized she had a knack for making them and enjoyed the process, so she started selling her wares at local farmers markets near her then-home in Seattle.

“In the beginning, I didn’t think it could be a full-time job,” she recalls. But when she did the math, she saw that she was pulling in an extra $2,000 per year, and wanted to see how much further she could take the business.

Formulary 55

She started it as a side hustle called Essential Soaps in 1993 using tips from her full-time barista job as startup funding, and soon made herself a mainstay at those weekend farmers markets.

It was there that she got her first request to enter into a wholesale relationship, from a high-end perfume store in town. Area home goods and furniture shop owners also took interest. In 1995, she changed the business’ name to Sweet Petula -- a childhood nickname from her mother. Soon, she became a full-time business owner, opening up several of her own retail locations.

The company grew steadily until the Great Recession hit in 2008, she says. And it hit Smith hard -- she was forced to let go of all of her employees, close up most of her shops and work out of her studio apartment.

[Related: Heritage and natural ingredients saw this business owner through significant loss.]

She found her way back to solid ground by 2012. And to celebrate the start of a new chapter, she debuted new products and rebranded again as Formulary 55. Two years later, she relocated to Pueblo, Colo., to take advantage of lower real estate costs, and has been back on the path to growth ever since. She declined to disclose annual revenue figures, but says each month she and her team fill roughly 100 orders for various wholesale clients and about 400 orders for 1,200 and 2,000 items to individuals who order through her e-commerce site.

A Community in a Business

Later this year, Formulary 55 will move into a larger manufacturing facility. Amid rising sales projections, “we are growing the team and constantly training.” She is also continually coming up with new recipes for her soaps, masks and other products as she works to remain competitive in a crowded market.

No matter how big the company grows, though, Smith says her top priority is ensuring that “the people who work here still feel fulfilled, happy and well-compensated.” Her desire for control persists, she says, but it’s balanced out by the value she recognizes in her team and partners.

“It’s so important to me that the people I work with feel like they are a big part of the story,” she says, adding that she is now just as invested in fostering a sense of community within her company as she is in creating a quality product.

Dar es Salaam. The government has provided training on Private Public Partnership (PPP) approach to permanent secretaries, managing directors and chief executive officers of public institutions with a view to building up their skills and experience necessary for implementation of development projects.

The workshop was organized by the Ministry of Finance and Planning after realizing that public sector resources alone were not enough to push development goals, while the capacity of the private sector remains hugely untapped, according to permanent secretary Doto James.

“Truth be told, PPP projects are quite complex to prepare, structure and transact, and usually require specialised skills not always available in our ministries and public institutions. With this in mind, we decided to take various initiatives including building the capacity among public servants and amending the PPP Act of 2010,” he said.

In his opening remarks, Mr James was positive that, the training will help the public officials in implementing the government’s Five-Year National Development Plan (FYP) of 2016 to 2020.

“We have some valid examples of successful PPP projects including that of Dar es Salaam Rapid Transit (Dart) phase one and the construction of natural gas pipeline from Mtwara to Dar es Salaam to mention a few.

“I’m also confident that those development projects in the FYP will be a success if the PPP initiative is to be effectively utilised,” he said.

The same capacity building programme for PPP was previously provided to ministers, Members of Parliament and other public officers in local government authorities, according to him.

He either mentioned some projects which are in line to be implemented by PPP method including that of Regional Natural Gas Distribution by Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) and construction of students hostel project by College of Business Education (CBE).

Also, the project of constructing operation and maintenance of Medicine and Medical Supplies Manufacturing plans by Medical Store Department (MSD) and the first mover local government authority project by President's Office - Regional Administration and Local Government (PO-RALG).

An interview with the acting director of TPDC for Downstream Operations Mr Emmanuel Gilbert established that the regional natural gas distribution was planned since 2007, but it failed due to lack of funds.

The project aims at connecting natural gas infrastructures in every region, according to Mr Gilbert.

“The project has been failing for almost 11 years until last year when we decided to partner with private sector through PPP,” he said.

According to him, the partnership plan is at initial stages where TPDC has conducted a pre-feasibility study for the phase one of the project which will cover Dar es Salaam, Mtwara and Lindi regions.

“Natural gas infrastructure need a lot of investments that cannot be funded from local sources alone. For instance, connecting Dar es Salaam alone will cost almost $118 million (Sh269.85 billion) while Lindi and Mtwara $10 million (Sh22.86),” he noted.

However, he was confident that funds will be there through PPP, as investors have shown interests in the projects even as the draft is yet to be completed.","Dar es Salaam.

Ranging from search and rescue to coastal security, navigation markers, and living marine resource enforcement; Coast Guard crews aboard our assets around the nation often perform more than one of these missions regularly, and most of our assets are designed to be effective in multiple purposes.



U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Sequoia (WLB 215) is a 225-foot seagoing buoy tender, recognized by its black hull, homeported in Apra Harbor, Guam. The primary mission of the cutter’s crew is to maintain aids to navigation in Guam and the Northern Marianas; however, the capabilities of the cutter and the team are a prime example of this multi-mission success. The Sequoia crew regularly conducts fisheries enforcement missions through the Western Pacific in support of Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) treaties and regulations as well as supporting bilateral agreements between the Pacific Island nations of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia.



“Sequoia completed a multi-mission patrol on behalf of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission to enforce Conservation Management Measures amongst the commercial fishing fleets operating within the treaty area,” said Lt. Cmdr. William Adams, Sequoia’s commanding officer. “During the first half of the patrol, the crew participated in Operation Island Chief, a sponsored collaboration under the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency. This operation included participants from Fiji, Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Nauru, Republic of Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Quadrilateral Defense Coordination Group.”



During this recent patrol, Sequoia’s crew conducted a total of 12 boardings on foreign-flagged fishing vessels and cited 16 potential violations which reported to the fishing vessel’s home nation for further investigation and disposition. The patrol took place over 16 days, covering approximately 4,500 miles west of Guam on high seas targeting vessels fishing in the WCPFC area. Coast Guard cutter crews also visit and work in the exclusive economic zone of partner nations throughout the year to conduct bilaterally negotiated fishery enforcement agreements designed to protect the sovereignty and marine resources in the Pacific.



Some stated goals of the operation were to detect, deter, report and apprehend potential illegal, unregulated or unreported fishing activity, and enhance Pacific Island Country involvement and participation in maritime fisheries surveillance and response operations. Sequoia’s crew also embarked observers from Canada’s Department of Fisheries and Oceans in what was the first USCG-DFO joint exchange with enforcement of the WCPFC Fishery. The DFO Officers integrated and accompanied Sequoia's Coast Guard boarding teams, bringing their professionalism and experience as they observed the Coast Guard’s boarding operations.



About 66 percent of the world's tuna comes from the Western and Central Pacific according to the National Fisheries Institute, and fisheries are the primary economic driver in the Pacific, especially for small Pacific Island Nations. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing results in losses of more than an estimated 21 to 46 percent of catch representing a $1.5 billion revenue loss in the region according to the Marine Resource Assessment Group. This loss directly detracts regional stability, governance and increases the risk for other transnational crime from supplanted traditional fishing voids created by economic declines. This threat is why a robust multilateral enforcement presence is crucial.



Not only did the crew conduct the fisheries boardings, but also assessed and documented aids to navigation while entering the harbor of Koror, Palau, to ensure the safe navigation of the waterways.



""We will have a continued and robust presence in the Western and Central Pacific,” said LCDR Nicolas Jarboe, chief of the Coast Guard 14th District Waterways Management Branch.“This assessment of Koror’s aids to navigation provides a reference point to work with the government of Palau on a plan to improve the integrity of their aids thus enhancing the safety of inbound and outbound vessel transits.""



The work of the crews didn’t stop there and was not just on the water. Crewmembers volunteered to help the community as well. Several members participated in assisting the state to clean up and renovate facilities for victims of human trafficking.



The crew of Sequoia, like all Coast Guard crews across the country, are devoted to serving the people in any way they can. Whether it be on the open ocean, in the harbor, on land or in your neighborhood, we are Semper Paratus.

147,https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/09/08/3-reasons-big-tobacco-and-marijuana-partnerships-a.aspx,"Sat, 08 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Motley Fool,3 Reasons Big Tobacco and Marijuana Partnerships Are Imminent,"The green rush is in full force. Beginning in less than six weeks, recreational marijuana will be completely legal in Canada. Aside from Canada becoming the first developed country in the world, and second overall, to wave the proverbial green flag on adult-use weed, this move could also generate upwards of $5 billion in added annual revenue once the industry is running on all cylinders.

Dealmaking ramps up as legalization inches closer

Legalizing weed in our neighbor to the north has also spurred a lot of dealmaking activity both outside and within the cannabis industry. Within the industry, leading producer Aurora Cannabis, which is expected to yield 570,000 kilograms a year once fully operational, acquired CanniMed Therapeutics and Ontario-based MedReleaf for $852 million and approximately $2.5 billion, respectively.

But what's happening outside the industry is what has investors' full attention. Last month, we witnessed two major partnerships take place between Big Alcohol and the cannabis industry. On Aug. 1, Molson Coors Brewing announced the formation of a 57.5%-42.5% joint venture with HEXO Corp (previously known as Hydropothecary Corp) to develop nonalcoholic, cannabis-infused beverages. Interestingly enough, infused beverages won't be legal come Oct. 17, although Canada's Parliament is expected to discuss, and likely broaden, what forms of consumption are legal next year.

Making even bigger headlines was Constellation Brands' (NYSE:STZ) $3.8 billion equity investment in Canopy Growth Corp (NASDAQ:CGC) at a 51% premium to its prior-day closing price on Aug. 15. This was actually the third time the maker of the Corona and Modelo beer brands had invested in Canopy Growth. Aside from just product innovation, Constellation should be able to offer its marketing and international expansion expertise to Canopy Growth, while Canopy will be able to offer its insight into the cannabis industry to Constellation Brands.

A Big Tobacco-marijuana marriage appears inevitable

Though most investors have wondered what alcohol company could be next -- rumor has it that Diageo is looking for a cannabis partner -- they might be overlooking the next-most logical entrant into the cannabis space: Big Tobacco.

Here are three reasons a Big Tobacco-marijuana partnership appears inevitable.

1. Key tobacco metrics are declining in developed markets

The biggest impetus for Big Tobacco to seek out a partnership or investment opportunity with the marijuana industry is declining usage and shipment volume in developed markets. Within the U.S., the percentage of U.S. adults smoking cigarettes has declined from around 42% in the mid-1960s to just 15.5% as of 2016. The industry is also facing marketing, advertising, and branding restrictions in key developed markets around the globe.

For example, Altria (NYSE:MO), which is best known for its premium Marlboro brand in the U.S., reported a 6.3% sales decline in smokable products during the second quarter of 2018, as well as a 3.7% decline through the first half of the year. Overall, Altria's smokable domestic shipment volume wound up plunging 10.8%.

Meanwhile, Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM), which operates in more than 180 countries around the world, not including the U.S., saw its total cigarette shipment volume fall by 1.5% in the second quarter, and 3.3% through the first half of the year. In fact, with the exception of its Fortune and Dji Sam Soe brands, every other cigarette brand has delivered a volume decline during the first half of 2018.

2. Big Tobacco has more than enough capital to make a deal happen

Another good reason to believe a deal should happen between Big Tobacco and cannabis is that Big Tobacco has more than enough cash on hand, and operating cash flow, to make it happen.

Despite the fact that volume has been in constant decline for Altria and more recently Philip Morris, both tobacco companies offer incredible pricing power as a result of nicotine's addictive nature. For instance, even though Philip Morris experienced a 3.3% slide in cigarette shipments during the first half of the year, it still managed to grow revenue by 8.3%, if you exclude the benefit of currency movements. Being able to pass along price hikes to consumers has long been a means to higher sales and profitability for tobacco stocks.

But the thing is, Big Tobacco also needs to innovate and find new ways to grow. For as long as this investor can recall, Altria and Philip Morris have paid out enormous dividends to lure in long-term investors. Yet, these companies are still generating a lot of annual operating cash flow. Altria has averaged about $5 billion annually over the past five years, with Philip Morris generating closer to $8.5 billion over the same time frame. That's more than enough to divert some of this cash flow to an investment or joint venture in the cannabis industry.

3. It's a logical product evolution

Finally, Big Tobacco partnering with the marijuana industry would be a logical evolution of where the tobacco industry is already headed.

Earlier this decade, the introduction of electronic cigarettes were all the rage. More recently, heated tobacco units, such as Philip Morris' iQOS device, have been garnering attention. The point being that Big Tobacco has been working on ways to lessen its reliance on traditional dried tobacco for years, and what the cannabis industry is trying to accomplish would be complementary to the tobacco industry's goals.

For example, assuming the Canadian federal government approves new forms of consumption in 2019, beyond just dried cannabis and cannabis oils, vaporized cannabis cartridges could be used in existing devices that consumers have been using for vape products, or perhaps even with heated tobacco units. It would be a relatively seamless transition for both the tobacco and cannabis industries, and should be beneficial to both.

And the winner is...?

So, which lucky marijuana stock is going to snag a partnership with Big Tobacco? While no one knows the answer to that with any certainty, I'd surmise that Aphria (NASDAQOTH: APHQF) has the best shot for two reasons.

First, it's a matter of market and existing deals. Some of Aphria's peers, such as Canopy Growth, have already landed a major partnership. And while it's not out of the question that Canopy Growth finds new partners beyond Constellation Brands, it's going to be busy plotting with Constellation and expanding its international infrastructure to take on too much else.

Aphria, on the other hand, has no major partners as of yet and, unlike Aurora Cannabis, isn't going all in on the medical cannabis market, which should appeal to Big Tobacco. Also, with 255,000 kilograms of peak annual pot production and a sales pathway to a dozen countries, Aphria checks off a lot of boxes that would make it an attractive partner for Big Tobacco.

The second reason would be that Aphria already has vaporized cartridges with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) of the sativa or indica variety, or a combination of THC and cannabidiol (CBD), on the market in Florida. There would be virtually no innovative lag time if Aphria were to partner with Big Tobacco.

In short, I'm counting on Big Tobacco to aggressively seek deals with cannabis companies (possibly Aphria) in the not-so-distant future.","Big Tobacco has more than enough capital to make a deal happenAnother good reason to believe a deal should happen between Big Tobacco and cannabis is that Big Tobacco has more than enough cash on hand, and operating cash flow, to make it happen.

Mrs Kagame said this Tuesday while addressing the Organisation of African First Ladies against HIV/AIDS (OAFLA) resource mobilization event themed “Free to Shine: Global partnership towards eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Africa”.

The event was held in the margins of the 73rd United Nations General Assembly in New York.

In Rwanda, the Free to Shine campaign was launched at national level, on 10 September, and will be carried out across the country until 1 December, with an aim to increase awareness and accountability to end AIDS in children, and reinforce partnerships and advocacy to mobilise the needed resources to eliminate Mother to Child HIV Transmission.

The First Lady noted that the Free to Shine campaign should be an opportunity to reflect on the impact of our HIV response to-date, while raising the bar higher to remove remaining barriers to thriving lives in all communities.

“In Rwanda, our desire to fight the AIDS epidemic drove us to call on all stakeholders to come to the table so that, together, we could pull all our resources to fund initiatives aimed at ending AIDS by 2030,” she explained.

Her Excellency attributed Rwanda’s success in HIV response effectiveness to concerted efforts and active community involvement, siting the reduction of HIV prevalence rates from about 10% in the early 2000’s, to below 3% nationwide today.

With this, First Lady Mrs Kagame called on her fellow OAFLA members and partners working in the sector to continue devising ways to maintain and improve existing interventions.

“I, call on you here today, to join this noble cause by committing or recommitting yourselves to invest in human capital and the building of foolproof systems as the surest way to reach our goals and sustain them.”

Mrs Kagame also recognised and affirmed her support for efforts across Africa, following powerful testimonies from a Zimbabwean HIV positive mother, that highlighted the need for more investment in issues, such as literacy for parents, and therefore bringing up a clear vision of remaining gaps, especially related to new mothers and their children.

Following this event, First Lady Mrs Kagame joined a luncheon discussion on the key role of public-private partnership, organised by Gilead Sciences and the Business Council for International Understanding, as well as a reception hosted by Ms Grégoire Trudeau, spouse to Canadian Prime Minister.

The reception hosted spouses of head of delegations attending this year’s United Nations General Assembly.","First Lady Jeannette Kagame has said that with global cooperation and goodwill, the fight against HIV/AIDS can be won, once and for all.

Much has remained the same in the Middle East for past few years: the split into pro-and anti-Iranian camps; the intra-Sunni Cold War between Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (UAE) on one hand, and Qatar and Turkey on the other; the interrupted revolution in the Arab World; the preeminence of Russia and its inroads into the American alliance system in the region; the strategic concert between Moscow, Ankara, and Tehran; the restoration of the Bashar al-Assad regime; the chaos and suffering of Yemen and Libya; and the overall marginality of Egypt. But this summer of quiet diplomacy, military preparation, and psychological warfare, as well as turbulence in the United States, has set the stage for a slew of new developments.

Domestic Unrest in Jordan and Iraq

The summer started with unrest in several Middle Eastern countries. Attention has centered on Iran, with the dramatic American steps, their international repercussions, and the impact inside Iran, the scope and trajectory of which (threat to the regime or strengthened hardliners) is as yet unclear. But on the Arab side, Jordan, one of the few countries to survive the Arab Upheaval relatively unscathed, saw a week of large-scale protests in early June. These protests kept to the well-known pattern: non-violent public demonstrations against price increases, subsidy cuts, and tax rises. The government made these moves as part of a multiyear economic adjustment plan agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other donors. Jordanian security forces gave a measured response, the planned austerity measures were frozen, and King Abdullah II dismissed Prime Minister Hani Mulki. This pattern is the traditional Hashemite method of placating the masses, deflecting public pressure and distancing the royal family from criticism of government policy; the average term of a Jordanian Prime Minister since independence in 1946 has been eight months, and since King Abdullah II came to power in 1999, it has been 19 months. However, criticism of corruption and of economic inequality is reported to have become more prevalent, and the most recent demonstrations are reported to have encompassed previously quiescent social groups, such as the middle and commercial classes. August saw another aspect of Jordan’s durable crisis, with clashes between security services and jihadists in Fuheis and Salt, which led to the deaths of four security personnel and three terrorists.

More serious unrest also broke out in mostly Shia southern Iraq in July, radiating out from Basra and precipitated by Iran’s halt of electricity exports—ostensibly after Baghdad failed to pay its accumulating debts—causing an electricity shortage and a cutoff of potable water. Many saw nefarious intent in Iran’s action—coming just after the American decision to resume sanctions—as signaling the regime’s ability to destabilize its recently re-stabilizing neighbor and to disrupt the Middle East oil trade: the riots also targeted Basra’s oil installations. Others pointed to Iran’s own spiking demand for electricity and its government’s need to address protests encompassing, inter alia, the regime’s support for foreigners at the expense of its own citizens.

Demonstrations in Iraq, like in Jordan, are a known phenomenon, especially during the searing summer heat (the temperature in Basra this week is 46°C, or 114.8°F), when electricity consumption far exceeds available supply. However, the protests were much more widespread and violent this year, with protesters occupying or torching Iraqi government buildings and political party offices. The government and armed militias linked to Shia Islamist political parties—like the influential Hashd al-Shaabi—responded with violence. The rioters expressed criticism of Iranian influence in Iraqi politics, but especially in the outgoing government: a new government has yet to be formed after the May parliamentary elections led to a court-mandated partial manual recount, which still left Moqtada al-Sadr’s anti-Iranian Shia-leftist bloc with the largest share of the vote. But more broadly, it reflected profound unhappiness with the post-2003 political order, which is largely dependent on a distribution of spoils system among the powerful players, which expresses itself in corruption and in failed institutions. The Saudis, in any case, appear to be using the events in their continuing recent efforts to strengthen ties with the Iraqi population, especially in the South, by sending diesel to help generate electricity in the worst-hit areas.

The riots flared again this week, with al-Sadr expressing his support and demonstrators killed by security forces. The long hot Iraqi summer looks like it will stretch into autumn.

Syria: Closing the Book on the Civil War?

In Syria, the “great game” continues. In the beginning of the summer, Syrian and allied forces regained control of the southern borders with Jordan and the Golan Heights, including Daraa, the birthplace of the revolt against Assad in 2011. Retaking these areas led to talks between Russia and Israel, obviously with concurrent talks by Russia with Assad and Iran, regarding new “rules of the game” near Israel’s Golan border. Continuing this momentum, in the past month, Russia pressed its plan for return of one million refugees to Syria and called on Western countries to help fund reconstruction efforts, saying doing so would reduce the flow of refugees and migrants to Western Europe.

Such developments would not only symbolize sovereignty and legitimacy to the Assad regime, but would also be greeted extremely positively by its neighbors, whose economies and societies are groaning under the weight of their unfortunate guests. Russia is reported to have offered to help Jordan repatriate 150,000 Syrians (of some 700,000 refugees) to the newly conquered provinces by the end of 2018. The PLO Refugees Affairs Department on July 20 invited Palestinians who fled Syria to Lebanon (approximately 50,000) and Gaza (under 1,000) to register for return to Syria, pursuant to an agreement between the PLO and Syrian officials. Lebanese Foreign Minister Gibran Bassil, who met with the Russian Foreign Minister on August 20, said that Lebanon, which is hosting more than one million refugees, fully supports Russian efforts to help Syrians return home. Reports claim that several thousand Syrian refugees in Lebanon have started to return to their homes in Syria voluntarily in recent months. The UN estimates that over 600,000 displaced Syrians returned home in 2017 alone, though mostly from within Syria. One of the cardinal reasons for refugees returning to a still precarious future is a new Syrian law which grants refugees just one year to reclaim their property before the government seizes it. However, the regime doesn’t seem too much concerned whether their citizens return or not, judged by the timing of their publishing details of their past repression.

One of the two last major obstacles to the restoration of Assad’s power over Syria is the province of Idlib. The other is the Kurdish-controlled area in northeastern Syria, where the military option is less on the table for now, due partly to significant U.S. military presence. Idlib has been used in recent years as a “dumping ground” for insurgents and civilians relocated en masse from areas “liberated” by Assad and his Russian and Iranian allies; it today houses over three million civilians. Government and Russian air strikes have targeted the area for months, leaving its infrastructure in desperate condition. Damascus and Moscow are ostensibly concerned with the rebranded al-Qaeda-affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra—as well as other Salafi-jihadi organizations (some of which are said to enjoy Saudi support). Turkey has until now opposed plans by the Assad regime to restore its control in the region, which contains Turkish military observation points. The Turkish interest in Idlib is dictated by its interest in retaining its tight control of the neighboring areas of Afrin and Jarablus. It is also worried about the possibility of a new influx of refugees—it already hosts over three million—pursuant to a major offensive.

Recent developments indicate that Russia and Turkey are reaching agreement on a blueprint which will allow the anticipated Syrian offensive, perhaps in a more limited form. The issue may be settled by Presidents Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on the margins of a tripartite summit with Iran in Teheran on September 7, in the context of the Astana peace process for Syria.

Potential for Clashes?

Russia has deployed at least a dozen vessels to waters off Syria, ostensibly as part of a major exercise in the Mediterranean, but probably in preparation for the final regime offensive against the rebels. American officials have condemned the upcoming campaign and have warned Syria not to use chemical weapons in Idlib: their statements seem, however, to signal that if chemical weapons are not used, they will stand by and tut. The Russians have countered warning the U.S. against “reckless steps,” stating that the Syrian opposition, perhaps with U.S. cooperation, is planning a provocation to provide a pretext for Western attacks on Syrian regime targets.

Iran’s presence in Syria has been less visible in the past months, since the Israeli-Russian talks (and reported agreement) on distancing the Iranian presence from the Golan border. Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman described Iran in recent days as having slowed down its long-term force deployment in Syria, attributing this change in behavior to continuing Israeli military intervention, as well as to the economic crisis in Iran. Reports of recent Israeli airstrikes against Iranian, Syrian, and Shia targets in Damascus, on the coast, and on the Syrian-Iraqi border serve to remind, however, that the Iranian influence and presence remains embedded in the new order in Syria.

The Travails of Mohamad bin Salman and the “Steadfastness” (Sumud) of Qatar

Elsewhere in the Arab Middle East, the grandiose plans of Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (MbS) of Saudi Arabia—to use controlled economic and social reform to rapidly modernize the Kingdom in his image, while retaining absolute political control (he is said to admire the so-called Chinese model)—seemed to continue to unravel this summer. Admirers of the Westernized, reformist prince have received additional evidence of his authoritarian and vindictive streak. First was the arrest of Saudi activists who were promoting some of the steps he himself has taken. Then, came his severe response to the Canadian foreign minister’s tweeted expression of concern for civil and women’s rights activists in Saudi Arabia. Riyadh called it a “major, unacceptable affront to the Kingdom’s laws and judicial process, as well as a violation of the Kingdom’s sovereignty.” It expelled the Canadian ambassador, recalled its own, suspended all new business and investment transactions with Canada, withdrew funding for the approximately 15,000 Saudi bursary students in Canadian universities, and suspended flights; Saudi media and spokesmen also attacked Canada’s human rights record. The step is seen, apart from an expression of personal pique, as a strong warning—through steps against a minor partner of Saudi Arabia—to other Western powers not to involve themselves in Saudi Arabia’s internal affairs. This signal comes despite the continued, enthusiastic involvement of Saudi Arabia in the politics of Yemen and Lebanon, among others. Western sensibilities have also been exercised by the Saudi public prosecutor’s seeking the death penalty for non-violent activity by five Shia activists—including one woman—who have been held in pretrial detention without legal representation for more than two years.

In an unusual public expression of criticism from within the Saudi royal family, Prince Ahmed bin Abdelaziz, a younger brother of King Salman who served as deputy interior minister for 37 years and briefly as interior minister under King Salman’s predecessor, asked anti-Saudi protesters on a London street chanting “down, down Al Saud” and “Al Saud criminal family”: “What does the al-Saud family have to do with your chants? We have nothing to do with what is happening (in Yemen). Certain officials are responsible.” Asked by protesters whom he held responsible, Prince Ahmed said, “the king and his heir apparent.” The state-run Saudi News Agency subsequently quoted Prince Ahmed as seeking to roll back his comments (which were captured on video).

On the regional level, the Saudi-UAE-led military operation in Yemen has failed to achieve decisive victory over the Houthis (who have responded by firing missiles on Saudi targets) and has garnered more and more international opprobrium for its many civilian casualties. An offensive against the Houthi-held port of Hodeida, begun in June, does not seem to be progressing significantly.

In addition, the Saudis are apparently retreating from the intent to make a public offering of part of Aramco stock, due to weak interest in the markets. This reflects the possible unravelling of a key component of MbS’ Vision 2030 “great leap forward.” Foreign direct investment (FDI) in the Kingdom dropped from over $7 billion in 2016 to $1.4 billion in 2017, while FDI in UAE and Qatar rose. Bloomberg reports that according to research by JPMorgan, capital outflows of residents in Saudi Arabia are projected at $65 billion in 2018, or 8.4 percent of GDP (they were $80 billion in 2017). Standard Chartered reported that the first quarter of 2018 saw $14.4 billion in outward portfolio investment into foreign equities, the largest surge since 2008. The market seems to be losing confidence in the Crown Prince’s touch.

MbS’ nemesis, Qatar, seems to be coping well with its second year of the Saudi- and Emirati-led embargo (which has weakened the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), thus indirectly helping Iran). The crisis between Washington and Ankara (discussed later) has made Doha’s relationship with Turkey even closer. Qatar attempted to stabilize the Turkish lira with a 15 billion dollar loan and a currency swap in a bid to provide liquidity and financial stability to Turkey; it also promised to increase investments. Qatar is reported to also be heavily involved—alongside the competing good offices of Egypt (backed by the UAE)—in the intensive Israeli negotiations-by-proxy with Hamas. These negotiations seem to have headed off, for now, an escalation of the ongoing cross-border clashes, sporadic rocket fire, and incendiary attacks into another mini-war. In this role, the Qatari leadership has carried out high-level talks with the American Middle East peace team and with Israel’s defense minister. Aside from its involvement in negotiations for achieving a truce and lifting the blockage of Gaza, Qatar is reportedly willing to pay tens of millions of shekels monthly in salaries to Hamas employees in Gaza—which the Palestinian Authority has refused to pay—to fund provision of electricity from Israel to the Strip, and to pursue infrastructure projects. In this role, it is aided by its long relationship with Hamas.

A Palestinian Reversal of Roles

The ongoing negotiations over Gaza illustrate how the dynamics of Palestinian politics have been largely reversed. It is Mahmoud Abbas who is now obstructionist and trying to block the way to an internationally brokered agreement. This switch is a reaction to what he sees as a reversal by the Trump administration of American policy on the Palestinian issue and adoption of the Israeli narrative in its entirety. In the move of the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, the suspension in recent weeks of $200 million in U.S. assistance for humanitarian and development programs in the West Bank and Gaza, and the halt of all funding for United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, the Trump administration seeks, the Palestinian Authority claims, to prejudge the outcomes of the most sensitive issues in the conflict: the fate of contested Jerusalem and the future of Palestinian refugees and to remove them from the table in future negotiations (based on statements by President Trump). Abbas also sees the American moves and Israeli contacts with Hamas as an attempt to marginalize and leapfrog the Palestinian Authority, and therefore as a threat to the Palestinian Authority and to his own authority and legacy. He may well be urged on in this position by persistent reports that one of the goals of the Egyptian-Israeli ceasefire efforts in Gaza is to pave the return of former PA Gaza security chief Mohamad Dahlan as a successor to Abu Mazen .The PA has therefore broken off formal contact with the American administration, taken an obstructionist and rejectionist position regarding recent developments in Gaza, preemptively rejected the trumpeted Trump peace initiative, and ramped up its promotion of unarmed resistance to Israel and public diplomacy to delegitimize Israel.

The Turkish Crisis and the Trump Factor

The last significant influencing factor in the Middle East this summer is the United States and the American President. The biggest news this August was the Turkish financial crisis, aggravated by American sanctions and punitive tariffs imposed over the continued detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson (and others) on charges of assisting opponents of the regime. There are good reasons for the U.S. distancing itself from the increasingly autocratic Erdoğan regime, which is deeply enmeshed with Russia and Iran in Syria and beyond. As Richard Haass, President of the Council on Foreign Relations, notes, “We are witnessing the gradual but steady demise of a relationship that is already an alliance in name only.” The suspension of a deal for Turkish purchase of American F-35s, while cooperating with Russia on advanced air defense systems, seems a no-brainer.

The current kerfuffle, however, does not seem to be part of a strategy to use levers of American power to bring a rogue NATO ally to heel (it does not help that NATO has no mechanism for suspending membership). The current crisis with Turkey seems more to follow the hasty and extremely problematical policy towards North Korea, Russia, and international trade issues. It has provoked Turkish national pride—an extremely potent force and strengthened Erdoğan’s position with his base. It widened the opportunities for Moscow to make further inroads in one of the most influential and powerful actors in the Middle East and the Eastern Mediterranean (two weeks ago, the Turkish foreign minister referred to Russia, during his visit to Moscow, as a “strategic partner”). It has also allowed the Turkish president to blame “economic war” waged by the United States (as well as Zionists) for Turkey’s economic predicament, in an attempt to deflect criticism from his own economic mismanagement, especially populist, expansionary fiscal policy and ideologically based low interest rates.

Puzzled by Washington

This summer has also seen statements by President Trump, and actions in the region, which indicate a worrisome disregard for the complexities of the region. Trump and his policies illustrate apparent unwillingness—with the extremely significant exception of Iranian sanctions—to shoulder the burden of leadership, which is being taken up by rival powers. One example is his interview with Reuters on August 20, in which he said, inter alia, “We never should have been in the Middle East. It was the single greatest mistake in the history of our country.” Another was his worrying statement on August 21 at a campaign rally in West Virginia that “you know what? In the negotiation, Israel will have to pay a higher price because they want a very big thing, but I took it off the table. . . . There’s nothing to negotiate but [the Palestinians will] get something very good because it’s their turn next. Let’s see what happens. It’s very interesting.” While American and Israeli officials rushed to clarify that the president did not mean what he said, the statement reinforces the perception that Trump’s attitude towards Israel and Middle East peace may be more game-like than ideological.

In addition, the U.S. decided in mid-August to cut $230 million in stabilization assistance for northeastern Syria and shift the money to support other foreign policy priorities. This move came after the administration elicited pledges from coalition partners, including $100 million from Saudi Arabia and $50 million from the UAE. This cut further weakened the American position in the Syrian issue, since those who don’t pay—whether in treasure or in the willingness to spill blood—don’t usually have a chance to play.

As for the administration’s Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, much ballyhooed in the past, it looks like the administration is making efforts to reduce expectations. This change in tune could well be due to declining enthusiasm on the part of America’s ostensible regional partners in the plan: Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. These countries, presented with PA’s steadfast opposition to any Trump administration plan (even if they disdain Abbas), and facing their own issues, are uninterested in stepping out too far ahead of their publics, who are not fond of the American President or of Israel. Arab leaders, even those friendly to the U.S. administration, and clandestinely with the Netanyahu government, will not be able to support too lopsided of a solution, or one that goes over the head of the Palestinian leadership. The “Deal of the Century” may already be on its way to the dusty warehouse of American peace plans for the Middle East: but every failed attempt leaves its mark on both sides and makes it harder for them to engage constructively in the future.

Looking Forward

As summer turns to autumn, America’s rivals still seem to be ahead. The much heralded Sunni Camp seems to be more of a theoretical construct (popular in Israel) than a unified player with the ability to shape regional politics, since the interests of Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia are often not lining up. MbS’ Saudi Arabia may be losing its sheen: Qatar is still standing. Egypt, while still not punching its weight in the region, has come off the bench. Hamas may be up, and Abbas down.

In Israel, the whiff of election fever is in the air: Prime Minister Netanyahu may push for the polls to open in February-March, rather than November 2019, to preserve his ascendancy and perhaps even cement it further.

Turkey may be slowed in its quest for regional hegemony by its economic woes, but seems to be cementing its existing alignment with Russia and distancing itself more and more from what used to be called the Free World. Iran is eclipsed temporarily, both by internal protests encouraged by the renewal of American sanctions and by the changing dynamics of the Syrian crisis. However, while Iraq may be shifting more out of Tehran’s orbit, other components in its regional architecture—in Damascus, Lebanon, and Gaza—are doing well. Russia is still on an upward vector in the Middle East; the U.S. is largely irrelevant, when it is not disruptive, and is certainly not providing clear leadership. With the current disarray in D.C., it does not look like this will change any time soon.","Domestic Unrest in Jordan and IraqThe summer started with unrest in several Middle Eastern countries.
Reports claim that several thousand Syrian refugees in Lebanon have started to return to their homes in Syria voluntarily in recent months.
In this role, the Qatari leadership has carried out high-level talks with the American Middle East peace team and with Israel’s defense minister.
The Turkish Crisis and the Trump FactorThe last significant influencing factor in the Middle East this summer is the United States and the American President.
One example is his interview with Reuters on August 20, in which he said, inter alia, “We never should have been in the Middle East."
151,https://www.gponline.com/dr-nigel-watson-will-networks-threaten-support-traditional-gp-partnerships/article/1493142,"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",GP online,Dr Nigel Watson: Will networks threaten or support traditional GP partnerships?,"Primary care networks (PCN) are not necessarily new to everyone. These structures have been evolving in many different areas and may be referred to as clusters, localities, neighbourhoods, natural communities of care or primary care homes. To avoid confusion, I shall refer to them as a PCN - because they are all examples of this.

The NHS is moving towards commissioning services and outcomes based on populations. This means that in a defined population, you look at the current state of health and the health needs of that population, then design, develop and implement services within that population that will have the greatest benefit.

General practice has always been based on a defined registered population and is therefore well placed to be at the centre of this but cannot do this alone. The reason this is called a primary care network rather than a GP network is because it will involve health and social care professionals working together as a locally based multi-disciplinary team, removing many of the existing barriers because they will be locally led and managed.

> Partnership review chair backs 50,000-patient networks

Are they an opportunity or a threat? If they have general practice at the centre and they have a feeling of ownership and play a significant role in the leadership, the PCN attracts new resources, is given existing resources to directly managed more effectively, and is given the freedom to implement change, not only will they support general practice and the wider primary care team, they will also help to manage demand in primary care and by doing so start to address many of the demands on hospital based care.

If the NHS is serious about trying to address the challenges of an ageing population and growing numbers of people with one or more long-term conditions and more and more people with preventable disease, it cannot achieve this by simply focusing on investing more and more resource in hospital-based care.

The challenges for the NHS are often seen as the pressure on hospitals, defined by four-hour trolley waits, outpatient waiting times, delays in elective operations and delayed discharges - but rarely do you hear about the challenges faced by general practice and the wider primary care team. The NHS has described ‘wrapping services’ around patients, moving services ‘closer to the patient’s home’ and supporting primary care by creating an ‘integrated team’, but how can that be achieved in reality?

General practice delivers holistic care, based on the needs of the individual and organises care around a registered population. The size of practices can vary considerably from 2,000 patients or less to an increasing number of practices who have a registered population of 30,000 or more working from several sites. The PCN is not about creating a network of single practices, it is also about supporting small practices.

Primary care workforce

GP practices provide the front door to many services within - and forms the foundation of - the NHS. General practice is currently under considerable pressure and more needs to be done to support, sustain and develop not only general practice but the wider primary care-based workforce. We should also create other routes to care so that they do not always need to go via a GP.

One of the many attributes of general practice is its ability to innovate, drive change and implement at pace with the minimum of bureaucracy. We know that general practice is responsible for 90% of the daily patient contacts within the NHS, therefore if you want to develop a greater focus on population-based care you need to have general practice at the centre of it and for GPs to have a leadership role within this.

Size is important but needs to reflect local circumstances. We know through the work that the primary care home has led, that geographical populations of about 30-50,000 work well, as it is small enough for those involved to feel a sense of community and responsibility for their local population but also large enough to work as a ‘delivery unit’ that can have real influence in the health and social care system. For some places the size might be less than a population of 30,000 and for others they might be larger than 50,000.

PCNs are not statutory bodies or formal organisations. They are a network of providers collaborating, working as a ‘delivery unit’ providing the vehicle to support general practice, integrate local services and develop and deliver services that would support the wider community.

GP collaboration

At the centre of the PCN must be the constituent practices, which feel a sense of ownership and also benefit, without them this will not work. This does not require practices to merge, simply to collaborate for the benefit of all their patients. There could be additional advantages in terms of joined up CQC policies, centralised management of back office functions, increased buying power.

Within a PCN there needs to be a leadership team that should include GPs, managers, nurses and may include other relevant people. There are services which should be delivered at a network level and have a presence in every practice, for example a team of pharmacists, care navigators, mental health nurses, community nurses, a wound care team. These services may not be delivered at an individual practice level, but they should be working with and for practices.

An essential component to deliver this is the use of a shared patient record which has been shown to improve efficiency, stop duplication, reduce the administrative burden and improve patient safety. Some services could be delivered at the population of a network with the network leadership team having responsibility for the delivery such as physiotherapy, health coaches, ‘tier 2’ dermatology, frailty, etc.

These services may be responsible and accountable to the network but does not necessarily have to be employed by them. We know that culture and relationships are vital to any organisation being effective, the PCN will bring together clinicians and others who no longer meet together on a regular basis, if at all, and that the strength of this would be built on people feeling part of a common team with common goals.

GP workload

A PCN has the potential to improve quality and gain efficiency. They must support general practice in terms of workload and expanding the workforce it will then help with recruitment and retention, making general practices more resilient and a better place to work.

The potential for the network is significant and but can limited by the constraints that the system places on it. The system must not only support PCNs - but will need to work closely with them. No two PCNs will look or perform in the same way but below are some potential examples:

Community Nursing

Working for the network, based in practices but working at the network population level. Using a single record with the practices, accountable to the network leadership team. A new set of outcome measures looking at the network population needs to be developed.

Home visiting

This could be achieved by practices working together, supported by nurse practitioners and emergency care practitioners. In some areas a home visiting service has been commissioned to support general practice and help meet the demands of the local population.

Frailty

One of the major challenges for the NHS is the ageing population, many who have more than one long term condition. These patients will have greater needs and most of these are best met by a multi-disciplinary team based in the community as the alternative is hospital-based care which is far more costly and may not address their needs in a holistic way.

Wound care

Community and practice team create a wound care team which ranges from an HCA removing sutures and working with the nursing team to manage leg ulcers or simple dressings to a complex wound care service – e.g. ‘Lindsay Leg Club’ with some in-put from the tissue viability nurse.

Pharmacy team

The practice-based team will include an experience pharmacist who is a prescriber, and then may have newly qualified pharmacists who work with the experienced pharmacist. This team would then work with the GPs, practices, community pharmacist and also hospital pharmacists. Reducing polypharmacy, managing medication queries, helping with repeat prescribing and increasing the uptake of electronic prescribing, managing some long-term conditions, ensuring patients discharged from hospital are prescribed the correct medication on an ongoing basis.

Some CCGs have invested in a prescription POD (prescription ordering direct) which works on behalf of practices and manages most of the repeat prescription requests, dealing directly with patients.

Diabetes team

Based in the network, with a team made up of extended scope GPs, Trainees, specialist nurses and lead by a specialist who would cover a population that is greater than one network. Care plans made in patients records, negating the need for referrals etc.

Paediatric hub

Being implemented in Hampshire, monthly clinics based in general practice with a lead consultant, GP with an interest who could become an extended scope practitioner and at the end of the clinic, potential for an MDT meeting with whoever wanted to engage with the team. Direct booking for GPs and records made on patient record.

Access

Currently there is extended opening, delivered at practice level and improving extended access delivered at a larger population level. The improving extended access is funded via the GP Forward View at £6 per patient. This funding could be offered to networks who are then responsible for delivering better access across their population and reflecting the local need. This might involve more than one network working together to meet the demand for example at weekend or where a network is unable to deliver the service. Federations may also be an organisation that can deliver this service at scale.

Mental health

This is one of the priorities for the NHS. It is also one of the clinical areas where the workload in general practice could be supported by suitably trained and skill staff. For example, CPNs working across general practice and the community mental health service.

For children and older people services could be focused at a population level and work more closely with the emerging networks. For example, dementia advisors and nurses based in a network but also working with the specialist teams.

Health coaches

Available in some areas, aim to de-medicalise care, help people to care for themselves and find different ways of supporting individuals. These could be based in a network.

Education and training

The network can become a training hub and takes on some responsibility for apprentices, medical students, nursing students, paramedics, pharmacists etc. all of which attract new funding and start developing a pipeline for new staff in the future.

Voluntary sector

One practice I visited have developed a community hub with regular voluntary sector/health promotion/social care clinics.

These are just examples of what could be possible and are currently established in different parts of the country. We have seen how these networks can not only benefit patients but can benefit the staff that work within them where this has created opportunity for new roles and has made recruitment and retention easier and this has also expanded the team that is supporting the GPs. The potential even in the more advanced areas is considerable.

We would expect the networks to get some business intelligence from CCGs, the commissioning support unit (CSU) and public health. As these delivery units are sufficiently large and cover well defined populations the local authority and hospitals will want to engage with them and potentially partner with them to develop services.

The networks will not develop unless they are given adequate resource and that will include protected time for those leading the network and support the development, given the authority and autonomy to make more efficient and effective use of some existing services and provided with new resources to develop and expand the workforce.

The benefits may not be realised in a matter of weeks or months but to gain the maximum benefit there does need to be a clear vision, incentives and some time and space to develop without annual changes in priorities or targets.

I believe that the workforce is one of the main issues facing most of us, but I'm convinced working as a team rather than in silos is part of the solution. Networks can also review training and workforce plans together and create a better place to work in and lead to a better environment for staff and patients.","General practice delivers holistic care, based on the needs of the individual and organises care around a registered population.

152,https://www.universityaffairs.ca/news/news-article/private-public-partnerships-are-the-new-face-of-student-housing/,"Tue, 04 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",University Affairs,Private-public partnerships are the new face of student housing,"Across Canada, several big-city universities are building student residences through a variety of partnerships with private developers.

University of Toronto environmental chemistry professor Scott Mabury said the spacious units and five-star amenities offered by privately owned, university-affiliated student residences like CampusOne in downtown Toronto are a far cry from the bunk beds, common bathrooms and cinder-block buildings that were the housing norm for students of his generation. But, he acknowledged that the plush new digs reflect modern living standards and expectations.

They’re also a response to the acute need for Canadian universities in tight housing markets to deal with increasing enrolment and to compete globally. “This is all about attracting and retaining top talent – and not just students, but faculty and staff as well,” said Dr. Mabury, who is now in his second five-year term as U of T’s vice-president, university operations, and vice-provost, academic operations.

Dr. Mabury was careful to point out, however, that U of T has no financial stake in the 890-bed CampusOne and that it’s not part of the university’s official student-housing plans. The university only provides food services to the year-old, off-campus residence, he said.

“Funding in education is challenging and there is no government funding or philanthropy for student housing,” said Dr. Mabury. But, “where appropriate, we will partner with private developers to build residences in buildings that we own, operate and occupy.” He said the university estimates it needs 2,300 new beds by 2020 and is currently in a joint venture with a private developer, The Daniels Corp., to build a 511-bed residence downtown, which is scheduled for completion in 2021. “This is the first of what we hope is a number of residential projects,” he said.

U of T is not alone. Across Canada, several big-city universities are either building or planning to build and operate high-quality student residences through a variety of partnerships with private real estate developers and builders. In Hamilton, McMaster University is in the advanced planning stages of its first off-campus student residence. The 12-storey project, which is intended to begin housing 1,400 first-year students in 2020, is a joint venture between the university and Knightstone Capital Management, a real estate development company that owns CampusOne and another 620-bed residence in a converted hotel in downtown Toronto, called Parkside, that caters to students at U of T, Ryerson University and OCAD University.

“We don’t have enough bedrooms on campus to accommodate first-year students,” said Roger Couldrey, McMaster’s vice-president, administration. “That puts us at a disadvantage because housing can become an issue for a student.”

Under the private-public partnership (P3), the new residence will be built by Knightstone on land owned by McMaster close to its campus in west-end Hamilton. The new residence will be managed by the university as part of its campus residence system, and students living there will be subject to the same codes of conduct and responsibilities as students living in an on-campus residence.

“We have 12 residences that we built and have run ourselves since 1930, so we are using our expertise to help the partnership,” said Mr. Couldrey. He said the P3 approach is both a smart and popular way for universities to deal with rising demand for student housing in an environment of growing enrolment – especially among international students – and shrinking endowments and government funding. “If we do it ourselves, we have to fund construction and the cost is multiple tens of millions of dollars,” said Mr. Couldrey. “Because there are legal limits on how much we can borrow, this is a way to deflect risk and cost away,” he said, allowing the university to direct funding “to our many other infrastructure needs.”

A main driver for such partnerships, he added, is the growing interest of insurance companies, pension funds and private developers to invest in quality assets like student housing that provide stable sources of income and high returns on investment.

A huge demand

Knightstone president Alan Perlis said his company is one of only a small number of Canadian developers focused on building high-quality, off-campus student residences – in partnership with neighbouring universities whenever possible – in large urban centres where rents and housing demands are highest. “The demand is huge and its widespread,” he said. According to brokerage firm SVN Rock Advisors of Burlington, Ontario, there is an unmet need of more than 400,000 beds for university students in Canada.

“Our units are renting very well, we’re very happy,” said Mr. Perlis, whose company recently acquired and is now renovating Campus1 MTL, another former hotel converted to amenity-filled apartments catering to students attending McGill University. “We are talking to universities across the country. They all have different needs and requirements. No two situations are the same.”

Joshua Grondin, vice-president, university affairs, with the University of Toronto Students’ Union, said he understands why universities are turning to the private sector to help house students close to campus. But, he cautioned that administrators mustn’t lose sight of their duty to ensure safety, accessibility and affordability for what is essentially social housing.

“These private residences give more students the opportunity to live close to campus, socialize with other students and be more engaged in student life,” said Mr. Grondin. “But, they are often significantly more expensive than traditional residence spaces. This is great for students who can afford it, but many are left out.”

Marisa Albanese, senior director of student housing and hospitality services at McGill, said she too understands both the dynamics and growing popularity of high-end private student housing, which she characterizes as “more of a hot-topic issue in Ontario than here in Quebec.” Nevertheless, she said the many “shiny objects” they offer – everything from swimming pools to fitness centres and fireplace lounges – are meaningless if those residences fail to provide students with a sense of community.

“Student expectations are changing in that they have more appreciation for housing and condominium-like living,” said Ms. Albanese, who is responsible for 36 McGill-owned residences with 3,500 beds, 95 percent of which are earmarked for first-year students. “But, what students really want are the connections they make living for eight months in residence halls,” she said. “Those connections are crucial to the student experience.”

The student experience

Andrew Parr, managing director of student housing and hospitality services at the University of British Columbia, agrees. He said the social engagement and academic success of students declines as the distance they live from campus increases. “Unlike with graduate and married students, who require more independent living environments, the undergraduate student experience really revolves around that dormitory setting, where there are central eating and meeting rooms in traditional settings.”

That knowledge, said Mr. Parr, is the impetus behind a proposal from UBC to create what’s called a government business enterprise named UBC Hospitality Trust that could borrow the money needed to build several new state-of-the-art student residences at more favourable rates. There is an urgent need, at the university’s two campuses in Vancouver and Kelowna, B.C., to build 6,300 new beds in the next 10 years to deal with long waitlists, he said. The university has already added 3,500 new beds since 2011, bringing UBC’s on-campus bed total at the two campuses to just under 13,500.

“The goal is to densify the campus by bringing student services and amenities like gyms, games rooms and even music practice rooms together under one roof,” said Mr. Parr. “Students today love those things. And having that proximity and access to faculty and classrooms really livens things up.”","Across Canada, several big-city universities are building student residences through a variety of partnerships with private developers.

The $65 million Tech Lab will host much of the translational research and industry partnerships that apply breakthroughs in information technology to other fields of engineering and technology.

“One thing we’re very keen on with Tech Lab is to get companies in, working with us on collaborative projects that really deliver for companies as well as deliver for research the university as well,” said Tech Lab director Ray Kirby at the facility’s launch.

Officially launched on Monday, the lab has already attracted the likes of NBN Co and Sydney Water to its ranks as the custom-built facility develops and punishingly tests everything from internet of things (IoT) devices and 5G technology through to artificial intelligence and robotics.

The 9000 square metre facility houses a variety custom-built labs, including rooms that can simulate the weather from -20 degrees to 38 degrees with humidity control to test the durability of new materials and whether sensors embedded within them can survive and record accurate data.

The outcomes could also directly benefit the university's bottom line, with UTS' main Faculty of Engineering and IT (FEIT) building riddled with IoT sensors designed to help cut back on energy costs.

“We see Tech Lab as a way of joining university research with commercial problems and issues that will be really important for the future of the economy and jobs and business and growth within NSW,” associate professor Kirby said.

“What this allows us to do is to go to companies and say to them ‘where are your problems, where are your issues, what solutions do we need to work on for you?’”

Also featured are anechoic chambers that can block out either sound waves or electromagnetic waves - perfect for testing 5G and IoT devices.

“5G is a very amazing technology which we’re going to have to work on very hard in Australia because Australia has challenges for 5G which other countries don’t have,” dean of the Faculty of Engineering and IT professor Ian Burnett said.

“If we’re going to use the internet of things to enable agriculture, to enable mining and the industries that we rely on here, we’re going to have to have different solutions for communication.”

Is it still a university?

While the lab serves as a hub for industrial testing, a startup incubator, and even a small function centre available for more hands-on presentations, it will still serve over 200 students a week.

On top of introducing them to industry contacts and being a space for short courses, rather than lectures, the space is also a testbed for projects too large or heavy to fit into the university’s busy and dense high rise CBD campus.

For the academics, Botany provides a hub for combining different areas of research that are normally siloed away in different buildings or faculties - the Tech Lab’s particular focus will be on combining IT research with heavier engineering disciplines.

Projects and partnerships at the Tech Lab could also contribute to UTS’ goals of having all of its students complete industry-relevant internships and producing workforce-ready graduates.

Areas of study that are more focused on pure IT, such as data analytics' impact on superannuation or research into cybersecurity for the education and telecommunication sectors, will remain at the CBD campus.","The University of Technology Sydney, whose iconic brutalist tower looks over the southern end of the city’s CBD, has revealed its foray further south into the industrial heartland of Botany.

155,https://performancein.com/news/2018/09/13/awins-ian-charlesworth-influencer-partnerships-and-affiliate-marketing-innovation/,"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",PerformanceIN,Awin’s Ian Charlesworth on Influencer Partnerships and Affiliate Marketing Innovation,"Black Friday has become a global event thanks to the growth of online shopping. At this year’s PI LIVE event, Awin will take to the stage to discuss what the impact online global retail events have had on shopping habits and advertiser tactics.

In the lead up to PI LIVE, we caught up with Awin’s UK country manager Ian Charlesworth to discuss how marketers can make the most of online global retail events and his take on the influencer and affiliate industry.

It’s certainly been a busy 2018. What are the biggest changes you have seen in affiliate and performance marketing this year?

Ian Charlesworth: From a network perspective we’ve continued making big strides in our journey to be the definitive global affiliate solution provider. We have invested heavily in creating and rolling out a best-in-class platform across all our regions whilst forming closer ties with ShareASale and expanding into APAC via our partnership with Commission Factory.

This is part of a long-term strategy for Awin but we are now approaching a point where we can focus innovation on one platform, for the benefit of all our clients, publishers, and technology partners across the world.

In terms of the wider industry, 2018 has been a tough time for the UK high street with many traditional brands struggling with footfall as a result of a variety of economic (and climatic) factors.

Affiliate marketing is well positioned, relative to other forms of digital marketing, to offer retailers a growth channel to offset declines in the high street. As the most transparent and performance focused channel, we need to work hard to ensure we are seen as a safe place to invest, amidst the backdrop of wider consumer concerns around privacy.

Influencer marketing has been accelerating and Awin has certainly made some steps towards it. What is your take on the current activity within the influencer marketing industry?

IC: Influencer and affiliate marketing sit well together for a raft of reasons, not least because our technology can bring tracking and transparency to these increasingly important campaigns, offering advertisers visibility on how each influencer performed and allow ROI to be assessed via a range of calculations.

We have seen increased interest in influencer marketing from advertisers (both from within affiliate teams and brand teams) and I feel this is reflective of the range of solutions we can offer – be it with a technology partner that can monetise content on social networks, an influencer subnetwork that can deliver campaigns at scale globally or even building one-to-one relationships with a small group of influencers.

Ultimately influencer marketing is here to stay, but we need to work hard to educate brands, publishers, tech partners, and even the influencers themselves as to how this activity needs to complement other marketing investment in support of company goals so that it is not seen as something disparate or disconnected.

You recently launched a voucher attribution to facilitate brand and influencer partnerships. How has it been received?

IC: The solution was developed based on direct client feedback so we’ve seen strong adoption by those clients as you might expect. However, what’s really exciting to see is how warmly other advertisers have adopted it – we now have approximately 50 advertisers live who are using it to enhance influencer activity and improve their control of voucher allocation.

What future plans do you have in place over the coming months?

IC: That would be telling! However, to provide some context to this topic, we are entering the final phase of our project to ensure that all territories have access to the latest Awin platform (which supersedes the functionality of Affiliate Window, zanox, and affilinet platforms) and the supporting infrastructure required to handle the huge transaction volumes.

As a result, we can start to shift our focus much more towards new product development and feature innovation. Given the size of our product and technology teams, this is going to be an incredibly exciting phase for us – expect to see evidence of this step change of pace from as early as the end of this year!

We are also about to complete a major refurbishment of our London office to modernise it and also provide a more flexible working environment for our 300 plus UK based employees. We’re adding more options for clients and publishers to use our office so they can work in between meetings with Awin teams.

Awin is leading a session on Black Friday and the Evolution of Global Retail Events. How do you think marketers can capitalise on retail’s biggest event of the year?

IC: Aside from the usual planning, which has already taken place, it will be interesting to see just how early brands launch their deals this year. In 2017, we saw the biggest year-on-year growth at the start of Black Friday week rather than on the day itself. This, coupled with Singles’ Day, is turning the whole of November into one long promotion event, which presents challenges about how to sustain this in the run-up to Christmas.

As a result, I think there’s an opportunity for affiliates and brands to use Black Friday to offer more creative solutions, potentially exploiting functionality from our ecosystem of technology partners to do so. I think the West has a lot to learn from the Chinese approach to Singles’ Day, which isn’t purely focused on the discount but adds an element of branding merged with entertainment.

There’s going to be plenty going on at the PI LIVE event this year – what do you think will be the hottest topics discussed?

IC: I think we are starting to see a subtle shift in the relationship between publishers and advertisers. This is driven by consolidation in parts of the market, creating more powerful publisher brands, and the fact that media houses are now seeing affiliate marketing as an attractive revenue stream. I, therefore, expect publishers to be more discerning about the advertisers they work with and the conditions under which they do so.

From an advertiser point of view, I think the hottest topics will be how to integrate influencer marketing within the affiliate model and how to address consumer concerns around privacy.","Ian Charlesworth: From a network perspective we’ve continued making big strides in our journey to be the definitive global affiliate solution provider.
Affiliate marketing is well positioned, relative to other forms of digital marketing, to offer retailers a growth channel to offset declines in the high street.

Progress to date

SDG17, the final sustainable development goal, is the goal that is the most clearly focused on traditional development issues. It pulls together a host of targets covering long-running concerns such as levels of overseas development aid, debt relief and tax reform, the need for capacity-building in poorer countries, trade reforms, and the challenges associated with obtaining accurate data.

As with most of the SDGs, performance against the various targets to date has been patchy and the UN warns ""more needs to be done to accelerate progress"".

On the finance front, several key indicators are heading in the wrong direction. The ratio of tax revenue to GDP in the Least Developed Countries fell from a peak of 11.1 per cent in 2012 to 8.8 per cent in 2016. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa as a whole reported a similar trend falling from 14.9 per cent in 2006 to 10.7 per cent in 2016.

Overseas Development Aid (ODA) also continues to lag well behind international goals. Total funding from countries on the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) fell 0.6 per cent in 2016 to $146.6bn, while just five countries Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and the UK - met or exceeded the UN's benchmark for ODA contributions of at least 0.7 per cent of gross national income (GNI). Overall ODA as a share of donors' GNI stood at just 0.31 per cent.

Transfers from richer to poorer countries via migrant workers are also falling, largely thanks to tighter immigration rules in destination countries.

At the same time, despite high profile campaigns for debt relief for developing nations, the downward trend in debt service as a proportion of exports of goods and services has reversed over the past five years. It has now risen from a low of 3.5 per cent in 2011 to 8.6 per cent in 2016. As the UN notes, ""the ability to sustainably service debts out of export earnings is crucial for countries most in need of resources for development"".

Funding for capacity building in developing countries has remained relatively stable, reaching $20.4bn in 2016, and there has been some progress on trade reforms - in 2016 the trade-weighted average preferential tariff rate applied to imports from LDCs was 7.9 per cent, a two-percentage points drop from the 2005 level.

However, at the same time there has been a stagnation in global trade since 2011 which has seen the expansion of developing countries share of overall trade stall. In fact, between 2014 and 2016 the share of world merchandise exports enjoyed by both developing and LDC regions fell.

Finally, gathering accurate data to measure progress against the SDGs remains a challenge in many areas. The UN notes that as of 2017 102 countries or areas were implementing national statistical plans, but even where plans are in place they are not always properly funded. In the least developed countries where the need to track progress is often most acute, data collection is typically at its weakest. Around 11 per cent of countries conducted no form of census in the past decade. In sub-Saharan Africa, only eight out of 53 countries have birth registration data that are at least 90 per cent complete, and only nine out of 53 countries have death registration data that are at least 75 per cent complete.

Business implications

SDG17 is one of the easiest for businesses to ignore, given its initial focus on the aid policies and practices that are primarily determined by governments. However, the goal's official title is Partnerships for the Goals and while the private sector only gets a passing mention it is clear it will be a critical partner in delivering on any and all of the SDGs.

There may be a huge debate raging about the value and effectiveness of aid funding, but done well effective financial support and capacity building should help open up major new markets by accelerating development in some of the world's poorest countries.

More specifically, all the targets requiring technology transfer and capacity building imply the opening up of new and sustainable markets in developing and least developed economies.

Target 17.7 and its promise to promote the development, transfer, dissemination, and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on favourable terms, implies a major boost to the expanding global market for clean technologies and green services. Similarly, target 17.8 and the promise to enhance the ""use of enabling technology, in particular information and communications technology"" suggests an ambitious plan to rapidly extend the global digital economy. Meanwhile, the wider pledge to deliver long promised trade reforms to lower trade barriers for poorer nations should also provide a fillip for many businesses.

The wide-ranging targets to ""enhance policy coherence for sustainable development"", ""enhance the global partnership for sustainable development"", and ""encourage and promote effective public, public-private and civil society partnerships"" could be interpreted in a number of ways, but taken at face value they reiterate the general commitment to make the SDGs central to government policy making and underscore the crucial role businesses and civil society will have in ensuring their delivery.

Business risks

There are clear businesses risks associated with a failure to deliver the kind of effective ODA strategies that drive development, bolster resilience, and secure economic growth in developing countries. Equally, a failure to build capacity and improve governance will also serve to undermine growth prospects in emerging markets.

The long-running saga of global trade talks highlights the difficulties and risks associated with any form of trade reform, which inevitably carries with it the risks of new trade barriers and the potential creation of winners and losers. In an era of growing protectionism there is always the risk that efforts to liberalise trade and remove trade barriers for poorer nations will be seen as a threat to farmers and industries in industrialised economies.

Similarly, the targets covering technology transfer may promise to open up new markets, but they also play into debates about intellectual property protection and the extent to which companies have an obligation to relax copyright rules or forgo profits to help aid development.

More broadly, the calls for greater co-operation between the public and private sector and other stakeholders are well intentioned, but they are not without risks. Companies that fail to tread carefully risk knowledge sharing initiatives straying into areas where they give up competitive advantage, while public and private partnerships and more general co-operation between business and governments can fuel accusations of corporate lobbying and undue influence, even if the end goal is sustainable development for all.

Business opportunities

Beyond the economic growth and sustainable development that should flow from effective overseas aid and capacity building, SDG17 offers a host of business opportunities.

For example, one of the indicators for SDG17.6, which covers technology co-operation, is the number of fixed Internet broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants, by speed. Access to fast broadband and mobile coverage is now one of the primary mechanisms for unlocking new commercial opportunities, and that trend will only accelerate as innovative online finance, health and energy services evolve for developing economy markets.

Other capacity building and technology transfer arrangements similarly imply both fresh infrastructure investment and the emergence of new markets as businesses step up to provide critical services.

Specific opportunities for the clean tech sector are on offer thanks to SDG17.7 and its pledge to ""promote the development, transfer, dissemination and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on favourable terms, including on concessional and preferential terms, as mutually agreed"". It may not refer specifically to on-going global efforts to agree a free trade deal for clean tech and green services, but it suggests there remains widespread backing for stimulating green trade.

More broadly, SDG17 reasserts government's commitment to free trade, even if the rise of Trumpism since the SDGs were agreed has transformed the political landscape. Were long-promised trade liberalisation to be delivered it would serve to cut costs and boost trade opportunities for all businesses, even if such a move led to significant disruption for some industries.

The promise of enhanced global macroeconomic stability and sustainable development policy coherence may be vague, but it can only benefit a business community that increasingly recognises that it enjoys the best long term prospects in stable societies with credible sustainable development paths.

The call for a partnership approach to drive sustainable development and better links between government, business, and civil society provides businesses with a valuable opportunity to contribute to effective policy development and underscore their commitment to the societies in which they operate, as well as the wider SDGs.

Finally, improvements in access to development data and the advance of reliable censuses can only help business planning and investments in much the same way as it helps shape government strategy.","TargetsFinance17.1 Strengthen domestic resource mobilization, including through international support to developing countries, to improve domestic capacity for tax and other revenue collection.

Excellencies, Distinguished panelists and participants, Ladies and Gentlemen;



With the adoption of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, the world’s nations agreed to an ambitious set of commitments and pathways which – if successfully implemented - will lead to fundamental transformations of our economies and societies.



Addressing the SDG investment gap



Estimates on achieving the SDGs vary broadly, but some indicate that will take between US$5 to $7 trillion, with an investment gap in developing countries of about $2.5 trillion. In contrast, global flows of development aid (ODA) reached USD 146.6 billion in 2017.



While traditional types of development financing – including ODA and domestic public resources – will remain critical to achieving the SDGs, particularly for the poorest and most vulnerable countries, private and blended capital will also be central.



The good news is there is no shortage of private capital across the world. There is currently about US$256 trillion in private wealth in the global capital markets. Attracting just 1% of this amount would meet the financing gap for the SDGs in developing countries.



Blended finance instruments, where official resources are ‘blended’ with commercial private capital, also show promise. Between 2012-2015, official development finance interventions mobilized USD 81.1 billion from the private sector. At this rate, blended finance is expected to increase to $252 billion by 2030, but this would still fall short of filling the SDG funding gap.



Private sector investment continues to be highly concentrated, mostly in resource-rich countries and extractive industries. At the same time, investments in many developing countries have been curtailed by: 1) the high perception of risk; 2) a lack of investment-ready opportunities; and 3) unpredictable and limiting regulatory frameworks to de-risk and incentivize sustainable investments.



In the words of our UN Secretary-General, “the world has the resources to deliver, but they are not allocated where they are needed most” .



The SDGs have put a spotlight on a market failure or lack of alignment between, on the one hand, those policy objectives we set for ourselves in developmental terms and, on the other hand, the issues the financial system and financial markets are focused on. Our challenge is to recognize that we have to bring two global conversations together.



One conversation is about the international, economic and financial policies and the national space for policy-making that is focused on economic development and growth. And the second is a conversation about securing private and public finance for SDG achievement, including ODA, but also many domestic financial resources that are currently not being deployed in that context.



It is now an imperative to work towards a global strategy that can look at an alignment between the incentives that a financial system has to invest in the SDGs and long-term economic development prospects, including a fair globalization agenda.



Last month, the UNSG launched his strategy for Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, laying out actions the UN will take support countries to accelerate financing the SDGs, including: (1) we must align global economic policies and financial systems with the 2030 Agenda; (2) we need to create and/or strengthen sustainable financing and investment strategies at the regional and country levels; and (3) finally, we must seize the potential of financial innovations, new technologies and digitalization to provide inclusive and more equitable access to finance.



The SDGs as an investment opportunity



The SDGs are not only highly relevant for promoting broad-based trust and prosperity but offer an excellent economic investment opportunity for financial markets and economic growth.



Drawing on consultations with governments and companies, UNDP and the Global Reporting Initiative published a report on how business accelerate the achievement of the SDGs . Two complementary trends are clear: (1) businesses are increasingly engaged in impact measurement and sustainability reporting to capture their sustainability impact and (2) there is growing public sector interest in capturing the business contribution to the SDGs.



Indeed, according to the Business and Sustainable Development Commission, up to $12 trillion in new economic opportunities could be generated through investments in agriculture, cities, energy and health alone – all critical areas for SDG achievement. This could lead to the creation of 380 million jobs by 2030.



It is here that the critical importance of partnerships, and the role of multilateral institutions – like UNDP – in forging such partnerships, come into play.



The importance of innovative partnerships



We are witnessing a growing change in business models, where innovation and broad-based partnerships often play a key role.



Sustainable and responsible investing, blended finance instruments, green bonds, and corporate venturing – represent a range of investment approaches which are more readily aligned to the SDGs because they already incorporate social and environmental considerations.



Governments can create partnerships with institutions working on climate change, such as the Climate Bonds Initiative, to develop financial products such as green bonds and securities and to develop new market platforms such as crowdfunding and fintech.



The fintech revolution, for instance, is disrupting practices in banking, investment and insurance and offering new ways to democratize and make affordable the participation into the financial system, including to the poor and excluded in remote and rural areas. Frontier technologies open possibilities for financial innovation to mobilize capital towards the SDGs, including risk-assessment and investment returns, such as in the case of Artificial intelligence, blockchain, the internet of things, and cloud computing .



Last year, HSBC launched the first SDG Bond for $1billion, which matures in 2023 and was three times oversubscribed. It will be used to support projects that offer broad social, economic and environmental benefits as aligned to seven selected SDG targets.



Indonesia and Malaysia have been leading with the ‘green sukuk’ – an innovative financing mechanism aimed to protect the environment and tackle climate change. Earlier this year, Indonesia traded $1.25billion in five-year green sukuk that will invest in renewable energy and green infrastructure. Globally, $155.5 billion of green bonds were sold in 2017.



Moving from Billions to Trillions



Impact investment is gradually growing from niche-to-scale in a few years’ time globally: 26% or almost US$23 trillion of investments worldwide were managed under Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) standards in 2015; and green bonds emissions grew from zero to close to a trillion in a decade.



So, it is truly viable to move from billions to the trillions required to fill the SDG investment gap. Right now, our biggest challenge for scaling up private investments on the SDGs continues to be the lack of harmonization and standardisation.



To move from billions to trillions, greater cooperation is therefore needed to build and sustain the progress attained by putting in place regulations and incentives, to ensure that financing flows towards investments that advance the SDGs prove the “additionality” offered by responsible investment and innovative finance models.



UNDP, in partnership with governments, philanthropy, businesses, investors, communities, civil society and academia, seeks to amplify and accelerate this momentum for market change into transformation.



Few weeks ago, during the UN General Assembly, UNDP launched the SDG Impact Facility which aims to support business to adapt and transform their core strategies to deliver financial, social and environmental performance, and to use the SDGs as the basis for engaging in untapped markets.



Conclusion



To meet the challenge of addressing the SDG investment gap, our efforts must be accelerated ahead of the 2030 deadline. In so doing, partnerships are of the essence – and not only traditional ones, but also the ones that draw on non-traditional forms of cooperation and co-creation for transformative impact.



We in the UN development System, the IFIs, and other multilateral institutions must use our convening capacities to prepare the ground for the confluence of these conversations between the interests of international financial markets and the need to finance the SDGs.



Our success will represent our collective legacy to the generations of the future.","One conversation is about the international, economic and financial policies and the national space for policy-making that is focused on economic development and growth.

Photo by: DFAT / CC BY

To advance global health around the world, aggressive targets have been set by the United Nations to mobilize action as set forth in the Sustainable Development Goals. The business community plays a critical role in these efforts by providing products and services to help meet health care needs.

But if the business community is going to help scale up efforts to deliver real progress, it's crucial that it look beyond its own operations and proactively partner with the public sector to tackle the world’s most difficult global health challenges through the formation of public-private partnerships.

Public-private partnerships are important for a couple of key reasons. First, achieving a global public health goal, such as UNAIDS' goal of ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030, is an enormous undertaking — one that no single sector can accomplish on its own. Second, both the public and private sectors bring unique and complementary assets that can be marshaled collectively to realize the goal.

The evolution of partnership Since 2014, Abbott has partnered with OAFLA to provide life-saving rapid diagnostic technologies to 17 countries in Africa. Rapid tests have been used in pilot programs for testing pregnant women for HIV and syphilis during antenatal clinic visits. Successful pilots have paved the way for expanded testing and treatment in those countries. Financial grants provided to eight OAFLA member states have helped increase awareness of HIV/AIDS in areas with high disease burden. The first ladies convened capacity-building workshops for health workers while sponsoring health screenings for the general population and counseling services for at-risk individuals. In 2017, we also signed on as a private sector partner of Free To Shine and have funded the development of advocacy tools for the first ladies and partners to use during the awareness-building phase of the program. As Free To Shine enters the implementation phase, Abbott will continue to support and share technical expertise for capacity-building regional workshops and country symposia for triple testing of HIV/AIDS, syphilis, and hepatitis in pregnant women, and early infant detection of HIV.

Bringing organizations together across different sectors can be challenging. However, at Abbott we're seeing an openness to applying the power of the private sector to address key needs. For example, the emerging public-private partnerships between the Organisation of African First Ladies against HIV/AIDS, the African Union, multiple U.N. agencies, NGOs, and Abbott.

Known as Free To Shine, this partnership’s goal is to bring urgently needed health care services to pregnant women and newborns at risk of contracting HIV/AIDS and thus break the cycle of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and comorbidities. Of the 1.8 million children living with HIV globally, 1.4 million are in sub-Saharan Africa, and only just over half are currently receiving treatment. Without treatment, 35 percent of HIV-infected children will die before their first birthday, and half will die before 2 years of age.

In the early stages of our work with OAFLA and partners, we applied the following three principles of partnership that we believe are essential to ensuring sustainability and could be applied to others looking to embark on partnerships for change:

Listen and collaborate

Private sector companies need to listen carefully to understand a partnership’s true vision and goals. When partners are invested and committed at each stage of the initiative — from strategic planning to the design of the operational framework — collaboration becomes more seamless and facilitates long-term success.

For example, since 2015, Abbott has collaborated with PSI on the design and operation of a fellowship program where both Abbott and PSI employees work together to solve complex problems. In Myanmar and Honduras, the fellowship teams applied their expertise to market and package affordable diabetes and hypertension management services for low-income clients.

“By bringing together highly engaged organizations across both the public and private sectors, public-private partnerships can help improve the lives of those in greatest need around the world.” — Damian Halloran, vice president of infectious disease in emerging markets, Abbott

Align resources with needs

As a result of listening and collaboration, a private sector company is better able to determine the unique set of assets it can contribute to support the program. Assets can include deep technical expertise, human resources, financial support, and product donation.

For example, in 2014-2015 through a partnership with the nonprofit global advocacy organization, Malaria No More, Abbott donated 2 million rapid diagnostic tests for use in Zambia, Kenya, and Nigeria. This led to faster diagnoses and treatments of malaria cases in these countries. Abbott collaborations with Malaria No More continue today, focusing on some of the countries hardest hit by malaria, one of the world’s deadliest, yet preventable diseases.

Systems matter

Donated products and funding won’t move the needle if systems are not in place to ensure effective fieldwork and long-term sustainability. Monitoring, evaluation, and data management systems are imperative for tracking the likes of disease epidemiology and the progress of interventions.

Capacity-building programs are required so that health workers — at all levels and in all geographies — are equipped to deliver high-quality services, even to patients living in the most remote settings. When taken together, partners can better manage not only infection outbreaks, but also establish effective strategies for epidemic control.

Clearly, there is much work to be done to tackle global health challenges such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and a host of other communicable and noncommunicable diseases. By bringing together highly engaged organizations across both the public and private sectors, public-private partnerships can help improve the lives of those in greatest need around the world.

This post is by Melia Repko-Erwin (@mere5280 ) and Mary Quantz (@Mary_Ann_Q ), doctoral candidates in the School of Education at the University of Colorado Boulder (@cueducation ). They have both worked as graduate research assistants with the National Center for Research in Policy and Practice (@NCRPP ).

Today’s post is written from the researcher perspective. Stay tuned: Thursday we will provide the practitioner perspective on this research.

There is increasing evidence that research-practice partnerships (RPPs) can help P-20 education researchers and practitioners connect, inform, and improve research, policy, and practice. But because education-based RPPs are a relatively recent development, questions remain regarding how and under what conditions these partnerships are able to achieve their goals. And, partnership work is not without challenges : A recent survey and interview study of 27 RPPs across the US conducted by the National Center for Research in Policy and Practice (NCRPP) suggests that partnerships are likely to encounter at least one of three common challenges: turnover of partnership members, differences in the timelines of researchers’ and educators’ work, and having the “right people at the table” to be able to act on the partnership’s findings.

These challenges to RPP work are not necessarily deal breakers, however. In fact, they can provide important opportunities for partnership growth by creating opportunities to strengthen relationships and build a stronger foundation for their work together. In this post, we draw from NCRPP’s recent study to highlight examples of partnerships whose experiences suggest that when it comes to facing challenges, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.

1) Addressing Turnover: Trust, Communication, and Shared Vision Across Organizations

Most of the RPPs in our study experienced turnover of partnership members, particularly within the practice organizations. Reorganization of personnel—especially in school districts and state education agencies—was also common. In some cases, partners’ new roles made it impossible for them to continue working in the partnership. In other cases, partners’ time was severely limited.

While turnover and reorganization pose significant challenges, especially when originators leave, many RPPs that experienced turnover sustained and sometimes even accelerated their progress toward meeting goals. Members attributed this success to mutual trust, regular communication, and sharing a vision for educational improvement with their partners.

Some researchers and education leaders further discussed the importance of building relationships with people at multiple levels in the educational organization. As one researcher put it, “Always work on building trust with as many people as you can, because ultimately, if there’s turnover in a high level, it’s better to rely on other people to keep things going, and to aggregate on your behalf.” In this case, building trust with people on many levels who shared the partnership’s vision gave the existing partners an anchor to work through the turnover challenges.

Strong and continuing communication about roles and expectations in light of turnover was also essential. As one researcher explained: “I think the whole group needs to come together and reevaluate their roles and who is going to do or take on some of that other responsibility if they’re not bringing on new members. I think it needs to be shared decision-making for sure.” These examples—among many others—revealed that turnover, though challenging, need not be fatal for partnership work.

2) Negotiating Timelines: Trusting Relationships Within and Between Organizations Facilitate Flexibility

Many partnerships were also challenged by the differences in how researchers and practitioners paced their work. As one RPP member noted, school districts tend to be “fast-paced,” while researchers can be “slow and methodical.” Education leaders often needed data or recommendations sooner than researchers could provide. Several RPP members also had competing work demands, limiting the time available for collaborative work. Although these challenges had the potential to slow or halt partnership work, many RPPs drew on strong inter- and intra-organizational relationships in order to be flexible in accommodating each other’s working conditions.

One researcher described her practice partner’s relationships within the educational organization, which allowed their RPP to adjust timelines as necessary:

“She was also really well connected. She had her ear to the ground, or her finger on the power...of the schools and the district, and what was going on, and she was able to answer and help us in making adjustments to the timeline. I think she was—I mean, not only when it came to timelines, she was our secret weapon, and not that much of a secret, but she was really, really instrumental in making sure we didn’t face too many timeline issues.”

The district leader described above further identified flexibility as an important strategy for addressing timeline challenges:

“I felt like [the research organization] had more flexibility than we did...I think in an organization like ours there were some things we couldn’t get around, but they could. I guess whoever has more constraints placed on them, when it comes to time, maybe is the one you need to work with more.”

RPP members stressed the importance of accounting for their partners’ working conditions and adjusting timelines accordingly to support them. To do this, RPP members benefited from strong inter- and intra-organizational relationships.

3) Getting the Right People at the Table: Trusting Relationships Facilitate the Involvement of Key Leaders

Several RPPs included education leaders with limited authority to make policy or program decisions. This made it hard to act on partnership findings, or even give priority to partnership work within the educational organization. Research and practice partners addressed this challenge by involving “mid-level” education leaders who championed the RPP and could see alignment between partnership work and other goals and initiatives within their organization. In some cases, RPPs also brought in new members over time. As one researcher stated:

“I think that the real key was when we first started the partnership, we approached [our practice partners] about [who should be involved]. They were the ones that wanted to do this research, so they knew who the key players on their end would be. Then, as we started to talk about other things, they [brought] those people in. They talked about early childhood, they brought the early childhood coordinator in to talk about what we could do in early childhood.”

Even if partnerships did not have all the “right” players involved from the beginning, partnerships found that relationships and communication were key to bringing those people in later.

In conclusion: Trusting Relationships Are a Condition AND Outcome of Partnership Work

Though one might assume that challenges in RPPs are obstacles to avoid, we argue to the contrary: When partnerships encounter challenges, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. Because at least one of the challenges we described was experienced by all of the RPPs in our study, it is likely that some challenges are unavoidable. Even more, challenges provide important opportunities for partners to both draw on and deepen existing relationships, both within and across organizations. In this way, trusting relationships are both a condition for and outcome of partnerships that sustain long-term work together.

The weekslong fundraising drive has been held in that country every other year since 1988 and has raised more than $1 billion. The effort is a lighthearted way to raise money for people in poverty, featuring a celebrity telethon and people wearing foam red noses to raise awareness and promote giving.

BBDO

Red Nose Day crossed the pond in 2015, yet Americans aren’t as familiar with it. But that’s starting to change, according to Comic Relief U.S.A., which organizes the now-annual drive in the United States.

Today, about 45 percent of Americans know the campaign helps kids in need, according to surveys conducted by the charity. That’s up from 10 percent two years ago.

The hope is that the campaign — held April through May each year — will become known broadly, says Janet Scardino, chief executive officer of Comic Relief U.S.A. “Our real objective is to engage as many Americans as possible” on the issue of child poverty, she says. The group wants to open Americans “hearts and minds,” she adds, “as well as wallets.”

As awareness has grown in America, so has revenue. The first U.S. campaign in 2015 raised $21 million for the Red Nose Day Fund, which supports charities such as Boys & Girls Clubs of America and Charity: Water. This year, it brought in double that: $42 million.

Corporate Sponsors Help Raise Profile

What’s driven that growth? For one, many American stars like Jack Black, Julia Roberts, and Jennifer Garner, have promoted it.

But just as important: Big companies, like Walgreens and Mars candy help publicize the drive and spur donations.

Walgreens stepped up as the exclusive provider of red noses when the U.S. campaign started, so many Americans learned of the campaign during visits to its stores.

In 2018, Walgreens’ total contribution to the drive was $23 million, which includes sales of red noses and other merchandise (a portion of proceeds go to the Red Nose Day Fund), employee fundraising, customer donations, and special sales.

M&M’s, owned by Mars, promotes the drive on social media and works with NBC to create marketing materials for a night of shows that the television network broadcasts in May each year related to the campaign.

On May 23, one day before Red Nose Day 2018, M&M’s released a video on YouTube featuring the education-focused charity City Year Chicago, which receives support from the drive. Students from Chicago’s West Side traveled to the Second City, a renowned comedy venue, to try out some stand-up routines with Vanessa Bayer, recently of Saturday Night Live fame. “I think humor definitely helps with hard times,” one student says in the video.

This year, Mars donated $1 million to the campaign.

Lots of charities want to build the same kinds of relationships with companies, but they’re unsure how.

Tips for Successful Alliances

The Chronicle spoke with Scardino and officials at Mars and Walgreens to get their thoughts on what’s made their partnerships successful.

Know your goals. Before approaching companies, charities need to think through their objectives, Scardino says.

For Comic Relief U.S.A., its aim is to get as many Americans as possible to donate to the campaign and learn about child poverty.

Thus, its corporate partners had to be well known nationally, she says: “We needed partners that had real scale.”

Walgreens has more than 8,000 stores (including its Duane Reade locations) in all 50 states and Puerto Rico. More than 95 percent of them sell red noses during the drive. The red noses are “a gateway into the charity” for many people, Scardino says. People who buy them or see store promotions gain a greater understanding of the campaign’s aims, she says.

Find partners with common values. Companies and nonprofits must have common interests and goals for partnerships to work.

Walgreens’ “corporate social responsibility” efforts are often focused on children and families, says Linn Jordan, senior director of brand marketing for Walgreens. Boots, the company’s British brand, has raised funds for the charity BBC Children in Need in stores and through telethons for 15 years. The company also supports Vitamin Angels, a charity the helps pregnant women facing malnutrition in more than 60 nations.

Red Nose Day U.S.A.’s emphasis on kids in poverty syncs up well with that focus, Jordan says: “We share common visions and missions.” Mars, which has partnered with the Britain’s Red Nose Day for years, takes giving back seriously, says Lee Andrews, vice president for corporate affairs at Mars Wrigley Confectionery Americas. Mars already supported some of the charities aided by Red Nose Day, such as Save the Children and Feeding America. “There’s this kind of congruence of values,” he says.

Mars has a sense of humor, too, he notes, and often works with entertainers in its promotions. That made Red Nose Day — which uses “the power of humor and entertainment” to achieve its goals — a natural fit, he says.

Give companies a business win. Companies need to see that a nonprofit partnership helps its business goals.

For Walgreens, it’s able to create a holidaylike atmosphere in its stores during the drive.

Companies that support the Red Nose Day Fund — including Mars — have their products placed in special sections, complete with themed signs and displays. More than 40 different brands — including Coca Cola, Starbucks, and Duracell — participate.

With more than 95 percent of Walgreens stores taking part in the drive, companies are confident that the promotions will get attention. Over all, the campaign helps Walgreens build stronger ties with its suppliers, Jordan says.

She declined to say whether more people visit stores during the drive — though she noted that customers now appear to look forward to it each year: “Doing good is good for business.”

Give companies a way to get employees involved. The campaign allows company employees to have some fun, which builds morale. Walgreens employees are allowed to purchase and wear Red Nose Day-themed shirts; some get people in their communities involved in fundraising, too. “It’s an opportunity to do something different and unique with our team members and get them involved in being a part of something that’s bigger than themselves,” Jordan says.

Be in contact regularly. Nonprofits need to make sure that they have staff available to work closely with their corporate partners, too.

Mars and Comic Relief representatives talk regularly, perhaps once a week, Mars’s Andrews says, with visits to Mars’s offices happening closer to the start of the drive.

Jordan of Walgreens says she talks with Scardino about the drive frequently, too. “There’s text messaging between us because that’s how close the relationships is,” Jordan says. “We are very much a family when it comes to Red Nose Day.”

Encourage companies to work together. Comic Relief has smart, creative staff who pitch good ideas, Andrews says. In 2017, the charity got most of its partner companies to promote a standard slogan for the campaign: “Noses On! Let’s Come Together to End Childhood Poverty, One Nose at a Time.” That’s a challenge when coordinating with many corporate teams.

Andrews says of Comic Relief U.S.A.: “I always imagine that there’s 200 of them and I always get shocked when I go into [their] office and I find out there’s like 20,” he says. “Because I think they each punch [above] their weight ten times over.”

Kemayah Asserts","Liberia’s Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary and Permanent Representative to the United Nations (UN), Dee-Maxwell Saah Kemayah, Sr., has told the UN that Liberia is ready to forge quality regional and international partnerships for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Amb. Kemayah’s statement on Monday, October 8, was contained in his address to the Plenary Session of the UN Economic and Financial Committee, otherwise referred to as the Second Committee. He said the achievement of the SDGs would depend on both an enabling international environment for development and domestic resource mobilization.

Kemayah who tailored his statement around the theme of the 73rd Session of the General Assembly, “Making the United Nations Relevant to All People: Global Leadership and Shared Responsibilities for Peaceful, Equitable and Sustainable Societies,” said the theme embodies the 2030 agenda, and is a call to restore hope to the world.

“For us, this mandates us to galvanize concerted efforts, to restore hope to the people of the world through our actions; and to consolidate these efforts to stamp out poverty, disease, hunger, and provide sustainable means of livelihood for us all. In the token, we are obliged to protect our vulnerable populations, preserve our environment, not just for ourselves, but for succeeding generations,” he emphasized.

According to a dispatch from Liberia’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations, Amb. Kemayah informed the global body that nationally, a robust domestic resource mobilization strategy was being strengthened to include expanding Liberia’s internal revenue generation and collection.

“We know our continued commitment to transparency and accountability in public financial management, as well as building the capacity and strengthening national oversight institutions to measure our resolve in driving these processes,” he said.

Kemayah also spoke of the government’s national development plan–the Pro-poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development, which overarching goals include, empowering the people through reducing developmental inequalities so that the people can prosper; stimulating economic stability and job creation through effective resource mobilization and prudent management of economic inclusion.

He however cautioned that while there was sufficient political will, Liberia lacked the available resources to achieve the full implementation of the SDGs, hence the need for partnership.

“While the government of Liberia and the people believe in ourselves to be sufficient in political will, we are insufficient in the available resources we so desperately need. We are therefore availing ourselves to the quality of partnerships, regional and international, to assist us to achieve the full implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals,” Kemayah said.

He also identified efforts to address infrastructure gaps and debt vulnerability as essential to the implementation of the SDGs and looks forward to Liberia’s participation in the upcoming meeting of the Economic and Social Council, which will focus on Infrastructure and Debt vulnerability in developing countries; especially Least Developed Countries.

The Second Committee commenced its main session for the recent 73rd General Assembly, and is considering issues relating to economic growth and development such as macroeconomic policy questions; financing for development; sustainable development; human settlements; globalization and interdependence, and eradication of poverty.

The Committee is also considering issues relating to groups of countries in special situations such as the permanent sovereignty of the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and of the Arab population in the occupied Syrian Golan over their natural resources.","Liberia’s Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary and Permanent Representative to the United Nations (UN), Dee-Maxwell Saah Kemayah, Sr., has told the UN that Liberia is ready to forge quality regional and international partnerships for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Goals are the end product that decides the outcome of matches which is why goalscorers enjoy the major share of fame in contrast to their counterparts.

Football has witnessed a number of great goalscorers since it was established as a sport. The alliance of these players with their fellow attackers is a crucial factor leading to their success in front of the goal. One player bombarding goals is always a pleasure, but two doing it for the same team is a cherry on the icing on the cake, isn't it?

Not every pair of strikers or attackers might share the same level of understanding between themselves. And, for those who have formed a partnership of the highest level with their subordinates, history remembers them as some of the greatest duos to grace the beautiful game.

Without further ado, let's have a look at 10 of the greatest attacking partnerships of all time.

#10 Romario and Hristo Stoichkov (Barcelona)

It was the presence of Romario and Stoichkov that made Barcelona a team to fear under Johan Cruyff

Barcelona has had the privilege of witnessing deadly trios like Xavi-Messi-Iniesta and Messi-Suarez-Neymar. But, Romario and Stoichkov was perhaps the greatest duo they have feasted their eyes on.

Romario joined the Catalans in 1993 and formed a formidable partnership with Bulgarian striker Hristo Stoichkov, who had been at the club since 1990.

It was the presence of Romario and Stoichkov that made Barcelona a team to fear under Johan Cruyff, who revolutionised the sport with his Total Football philosophy back then.

Incredibly talented as both goalscorers were, the partnership that should have lasted for at least a span of five years could last for only one.

Romario's controversial life off the field coupled with Cruyff's heavily criticized rotation policy stunted the growth of the pair as one of the greatest attacking partnerships of all time.

Together, the duo could guide Barcelona to only a LaLiga title and a Super Cup trophy in 1994. In the 1993-94 season, Stoichkov found the net 24 times in 48 games in all competitions. Romario, on the other hand, scored 32 goals in 47 games in all tournaments.

The pairing came to an end when both Romario and Stoichkov left Barcelona to play for Flamengo and Parma respectively in 1995.

Viet Nam News COPENHAGEN – Việt Nam is ready to foster public-private partnership (PPP) projects in green growth, saving energy, water resources and smart city development in order to put into practice initiatives of Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030 (P4G), Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc affirmed on Saturday while delivering a key note speech at the first ever P4G Summit in Copenhagen, Denmark. “Việt Nam will join hands with P4G partner countries to reach the sustainable development goals (SDGs) by 2030,” Phúc said, believing that green growth’s P4G PPP projects would be soon set up and implemented, contributing to substantially boosting the process of realising global SDG targets. As one of nine P4G partner countries, Việt Nam established the P4G National Platform in July this year with the chairmanship of Ministry of Planning and Investment, Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the participation of domestic and foreign invested enterprises. The PM believed that the Vietnamese business community would show their commitment together with the Government reaching SDG targets towards 2030. The Vietnamese Government has also made efforts in boosting sustainable development. In September Việt Nam hosted an international conference on plastic waste which highlighted the urgent need to sort waste at home. The Government has listened to a number of proposals recommended by the business community at this conference and put them into practice, he said.

Phúc spoke highly of P4G, especially the Danish Government, in promoting sustainable development through green growth strategies, and in particular, offering financial assistance to two Vietnamese start-ups within the framework of the programme.

These two partnership initiatives – a water loss reduction project and Viet Nam Materials Marketplace – received funding of US$100,000 each from P4G.

“Việt Nam wishes to continue receiving assistance and looks to further potential projects with the aim of helping Việt Nam’s P4G National Platform scale up co-operation activities in the sector,” he said.

P4G is a global initiative with the ambition of becoming the world’s leading forum for developing concrete PPP at a scale to deliver on SDGs and the Paris Climate Change Agreement. P4G was established last year with initial funding over five years from Denmark. The international partners include Chile, Denmark, Ethiopia, Kenya, the Republic of Korea, Mexico and Việt Nam.

About 30 leaders of Vietnamese enterprises in the sectors of clean energy, industry, investment and high technology attended the P4G Copenhagen Summit 2018.

The P4G Summit, which took place on Friday and Saturday, was attended by governments, global companies, entrepreneurs, academics, and civil society from 53 countries

Together with PM Phúc, other high-level leaders of P4G partner countries including Danish Prime Minister Lars Looke Rasmussen, President of the Republic of Korea Moon Jae-in, Ethiopia’s President Mulatu Teshome and Netherlands’ Prime Minister Mark Rutte also attended the session on Global Leadership for a sustainable future in which they agreed on the urgent need to respond to climate change and rising water levels. They believed that countries need to share experience and support each other to overcome climate change challenges.

The leaders appreciated initiatives launched at the summit which are considered to be a map for partner countries to roll out green growth policies and foster collaboration among nations.

The leaders committed to use raw materials until 2030 and to realise this target, they agreed that the efforts need to be made not only by the governments but also by business and civil society.

Participants have wrapped up the inaugural summit with the endorsement of the Copenhagen Commitment which aims to accelerate positive action on combating climate change and to speed up delivery of the UN SDGs. The new powerful alliance of global leaders have declared the commitment in recognition that the world needs concrete partnerships to get the job done.— VNS","In September Việt Nam hosted an international conference on plastic waste which highlighted the urgent need to sort waste at home.

165,https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/the-importance-of-law-enforcement-partnerships-in-combating-evolving-threats-and-keeping-communities-safe,"Sun, 07 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Federal Bureau of Investigation,The Importance of Law Enforcement Partnerships in Combating Evolving Threats and Keeping Communities Safe — FBI,"Remarks as delivered.

Great to be here with all of you. Last year was my first appearance at IACP, and I was still new to the job back then. Over the past year, I’ve gotten a good handle on the work of the FBI and the work you’re doing in your communities. And although I’ve always been inspired by the work of the FBI and the larger law enforcement community—including all of you here today—I’m even more inspired today.

After now visiting with 43 of our 56 field offices (and the rest by year-end), and meeting with law enforcement partners from something like 45 states, and more than 100 international partners, I’ve got an even deeper understanding of what you’re all up against, what you’re doing to help the people you serve, and what we need to do, together.

Just as importantly, I’ve got an even deeper understanding of who you are, as leaders and public servants. You’re tackling incredibly daunting work under tough circumstances, and you’re doing it well. Because you care about people. You care about your communities. And you’re determined to do everything you can to help others. That’s the true heart of law enforcement. And I’m humbled to be back part of it.

Today I want to focus on the threats we face. I want to talk about the work we’re doing—together—to address these threats. And I want to talk about the life everyone in this room has chosen and why it’s so important.

Let me turn to the threat landscape. When I left DOJ in 2005, the world was still a little back on its heels. We were facing threats we hadn’t imagined or foreseen. And we were doing our best to build our collective capabilities to fight those threats. Together, we’ve made a lot of progress. But when you look at the breadth and nature of the threats we’re facing today, you see how much has changed over the years—and not in a good way.

As you all know, in the years following 9/11, national security became the FBI’s top priority. And for many years, when we would meet with all of you, we’d inevitably say at some point, “Look, national security is our top priority, but we know it isn’t always your top priority.” And there was sometimes a bit of a divide between what we were doing and what you were doing.

That isn’t the case today. Because every threat we face impacts national security in some way. Terrorism, gang violence, espionage, hacking, opioid abuse, active shooters—these aren’t threats just for the feds or just for state and locals. They affect all of us to one degree or another.

I’ve made it a priority to visit every FBI field office by the end of the year. And we’re getting there, one by one. In every field office, when I meet with our state and local partners, I hear about the same significant challenges.

First, the opiate crisis. More than 72,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2017—including prescription opioids and illicit drugs. And by all accounts, the problem is getting worse. We’ve got to work even better together to reduce the supply of drugs coming into our country from China and Mexico. This has become a national security issue that plays itself out on our streets every day.

Many of you continue to combat violent crime, from violent crime with a firearm, drug user-derivative crime and drug trafficking, to decentralized street gangs and homicides.

And in 2017 alone, there were 30 separate active shootings in the United States—the biggest number ever recorded by the FBI during a one-year period.

On the terrorist front, we have investigations in all 50 states. The homegrown violent extremist threat is the new normal, and it has created a new set of challenges: a much greater number of potential threats, each with far fewer “dots” to “connect” and much less time to prevent or disrupt an attack. These folks are largely radicalized online, and they’re inspired by the global jihadist movement.

We’re also keeping our eye on domestic terrorism, from people who come up with their own customized belief systems and hope to advance those beliefs through violence. Since 9/11, we’ve had nearly 100 domestic terrorism-related fatalities across the country. And they’re becoming more frequent. We had 12 fatalities in 2017 alone.

In the last year or so, working with all of you, we’ve made hundreds of arrests on terrorism charges: 120 international terrorism arrests and 175 domestic terrorism arrests. These arrests are all over the map, in cities big and small: Dearborn, Columbia, Oklahoma City, Cincinnati, Boston, Salt Lake City, San Antonio, and Minneapolis.

The cyber threat continues to grow by leaps and bounds, and the more we shift to the Internet as the conduit and the repository for everything we use and share and manage, the more danger we’re in. Nation-state adversaries—China in particular—seek our trade secrets, our ideas, and our innovation. And they’re using an expanding set of non-traditional methods to pursue their goals, like cyber intrusions, foreign investment, corporate acquisitions, and supply chain threats.

You can’t put some of these threats neatly in the national security bucket and others in the state and local bucket. These are law enforcement threats; they are collective concerns.

If we think we have a drug epidemic now in this country, imagine how bad it will get if we have exponentially more opioids, fentanyl, and heroin on the market. A recent seizure from just one guy in China included enough fentanyl to impact half the population of the United States.

If a foreign adversary hacks into our power grid or our financial markets, we’ll all be dealing with the fallout.

If a terrorist strikes at a soft target in any one of our towns, we’ll all feel the reverberations.

Every company, every network, and every individual feels the impact of cyber crime, and everyone has something they don’t want to lose.

Violent crime can affect every neighborhood.

And as we’ve all seen, an active shooter can change someone’s world in an instant, in every community, large and small.

The seriousness of the threat in any one of these areas is unprecedented. But taken together, these threats cry out for an even more concerted level of collaboration.

We’ve been talking about partnerships and information sharing for a long time now. And there’s a reason for that. We need to stick together. We need to rely on each other for information, for experience and best practices, for new ideas and new ways of looking at old problems. So I won’t stand up here and talk about all the progress we’ve made in recent years. Don’t get me wrong—we’ve made great strides. But patting ourselves on the back for past successes won’t do us any good today. We’re looking to the future. How can we do more? How can we be better?

One of the things we’re focused on—collectively—is long-term strategy. For example, we’re working with the Major Cities Chiefs and the Major County Sheriffs to develop a comprehensive threat assessment, to help law enforcement leaders better identify, analyze, and prioritize the major threats facing their communities. This approach is modeled after the FBI’s own TRP—threat review and prioritization—which we’ve found allows us to better focus on the highest priorities in our field offices. We’re working together to help you drill down on the primary challenges you’re facing in your own communities, from violent crime, gangs, and drug trafficking to non-violent criminal violations, like property theft, which can take up a lot of time and resources.

When we have a full understanding of what we’re seeing in our communities, we can create a larger threat picture to really drive strategy and operations. We can have informed discussions about the threats we’re facing. But this isn’t the FBI’s information—it’s yours. So I hope you’ll share your TRP information with your local SAC. And I’ve asked my SACs here today to include you in their own TRP discussions moving forward.

We’re also making a concerted effort to host threat briefings for federal, state, and local partners. On September 11, at FBI Headquarters, we hosted an intelligence and information sharing meeting for more than 40 federal, state, and local partners. Leaders from the FBI and from partner agencies provided classified briefings on current and emerging threats, from terrorism, nation-state adversaries and cyber crime to active shooter and school threats. After the briefings, the group talked—openly and honestly—about what we’re facing and how we can help each other. And just this week, we brought together all of our SACs with the Major Cities Chiefs Association for a joint threat briefing.

These efforts—formal and informal—need to become commonplace, unremarkable. They need to become so routine, so second nature, that we don’t even think about them. We all need a full understanding of the collective threats we face. Because we’re standing in front of a tidal wave of trouble, and we need every resource, every bit of knowledge and experience, and every relationship we’ve got, to do our jobs and to do them well. Now, some of you may be asking, “How can we get in on those threat briefings?” We’re working on expanding those efforts because we know how important it is for all of us to have that 360-degree understanding. But in the interim, don’t hesitate to reach out to the SAC in your jurisdiction to talk about what you’re seeing, what you need help with, and we’ll do the same on our end. Because at the end of the day, that personal relationship—that one-on-one friendship—is better than any intel briefing.

We’re also working with the Major Cities Chiefs to develop a joint strategy to reduce violent crime and homicide. We’re identifying successful programs and best practices from law enforcement leaders and agencies across the country. The FBI’s Office of Partner Engagement has visited several cities, including Milwaukee, Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and New Orleans, to talk about what’s working, and what’s not. More visits are on the horizon.

We’re focusing our efforts in a few areas, like the need to be aggressive in prosecuting violent crime and homicide offenders, and to find a balance between long-term enterprise prosecutions and “quick hit” ones targeting the worst offenders. The need for strong leadership in law enforcement—leaders who recognize the dynamics driving violent crime and homicide. The need to make the best and highest use of limited resources. The need to share information in real time. And the need to identify best practices and new ways of looking at old problems, and to share those with other law enforcement leaders across the country so that we’re all using the strongest tools we can.

We’re also trying to find new ways to identify and stop active shooters. On June 27, we hosted the School Safety Summit at FBI Headquarters. We were just the host for the event. Our state and local partners determined the agenda, the presenters, the subject matter experts, and who should attend. The group talked about warning signs for troubled students, school crisis response plans, how to harden soft targets—especially our schools—and better ways to share information. We want to serve as a resource for you in any way we can, and unfortunately, the threat of active shooters isn’t going away anytime soon. So we all need to bring everything we’ve got to the table, to ensure the safety of our people—particularly our kids.

A big part of strengthening our partnerships is in improving the way we share information. On the fusion center front, we’ve joined the National Fusion Center Association to find new ways to share as much information as possible between fusion centers and the JTTFs. And to make sure that we’re on the same page when it comes to understanding the terrorism threat and the changing threat landscape. We’re increasingly co-locating FBI and fusion center personnel and helping more fusion center analysts obtain security clearances so they can share classified information.

Another way we’re improving information sharing is through the eGuardian process. After the Parkland tragedy, we took a hard look at what happened, and we’re doing everything we can to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Because the American people expect us to get it right the first time. They deserve that from us. So we’re working to make eGuardian the intake mechanism for all threats of violence on both the national security and criminal sides of the house—a single system into which your agencies and local emergency call centers can push information and ensure maximum visibility among law enforcement partners.

And when we receive violent threat information without a federal nexus through our Public Access Line or our website, we’ll use eGuardian to pass those leads along to the appropriate state or local agency, fusion center, or field office for action. We’re still working out the technical details and the official roll-out. But this new process will shorten the time between our receipt of a lead and passing that information to you. But what it really means is violence prevented and lives saved.

I want to turn to data collection for a moment. And try not to use the words “data collection” as an excuse to take a brief nap. On the first day of 2021, the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program will make the transition to a NIBRS-only data collection. I know that seems far away, but those of you who have been on this journey with us for the past few years know that it isn’t actually much time. NIBRS data will provide greater context at the national level to allow the FBI and its contributing agencies to identify and address evolving crime issues.

I want to personally thank those law enforcement agencies that have made this transition. And I’m grateful to those of you who have committed to transitioning by the 2021 deadline. We want to make this as painless as possible. We’re offering funding where we can, along with the Bureau of Justice Statistics. And we’re offering onsite training and computer-based tutorials, to get agencies comfortable with NIBRS.

I also want to thank you for helping us push for collecting use-of-force statistics on officer-involved incidents at the local, state, tribal, and federal levels. I know you understand the importance of collecting and sharing police use-of-force data. The National Use-of-Force Data Collection encourages law enforcement agencies to voluntarily report use-of-force data. The great news is that OMB approved the nationwide collection on September 5. We’re anticipating an official launch on January 1.

Approximately 4,000 law enforcement agencies are currently enrolled. And of those, approximately 500 are already submitting data. Enrolling is a good first step, but it means nothing without the data. So we’re encouraging all the agencies that enrolled to submit their data. More accurate and reliable data is something we all want to shape our understanding of the issues. So this is a good step forward.

Together, we’ve all been searching for new ways to approach the opioid crisis. From joint task forces targeting the distribution of these drugs, to a shared focus on the prevention of overdose deaths—which hasn’t been a historical focus for law enforcement. We all see the benefit in the growing interaction among law enforcement and the public health and mental health sectors. Working together in this fight is crucial, because we just don’t have the resources to go it alone. It’s going to require a whole-of-society approach.

On the cyber front, we’re trying to find new ways to maximize all of our resources, and to make the most of our collective experience. We’re working with our partners to triage cyber investigations at the local level. Operation Wellspring began in Utah as a partnership between the FBI’s Salt Lake City field office and the Utah Department of Public Safety. We knew the FBI didn’t have the resources to address emerging cyber crime at the state and local level, and there were cases that were not being investigated. So our Salt Lake Field Office and the Utah Department of Public Safety created a program to address cyber crime together, by integrating public safety personnel into our Salt Lake Joint Cyber Task Force.

Today, there are public safety task force officers working cyber-criminal intrusions and Internet fraud matters right alongside their FBI counterparts. They’re sharing investigative techniques and best practices, and learning from each other. The task force has disrupted a number of cyber-criminal organizations. The model has worked so well in Salt Lake that we’re mirroring it in several other field offices. Again, we keep looking for better and better ways to help you with the threats you’re facing, wherever we can.

But we’re not just focused on finding and stopping the bad guys. We’re focused on helping the victims they leave behind. There’s a simple truth we’ve come to know in the FBI: law enforcement officers interact with victims more often than any other professionals. The assistance you provide is critical. Your officers and deputies may be the only contact that victims ever have with the criminal justice system, and the only opportunity to be linked to the services necessary to begin their healing and recovery.

That’s not just the right way to treat a victim—it’s the best way, for all of us. Because victims who are treated with professionalism and compassion, and who are getting the help they need, are more likely to help us with investigations and prosecutions.

About a year ago, the FBI’s Victim Services Division started a partnership with state, local, university, and tribal law enforcement agencies to improve their interactions with victims of crime. The program is called Elevate, and it provides practical tools to law enforcement to develop or enhance their own victim services capacity. We link agencies across the country with mentors and coaches who have developed effective victim services programs, so that we can model best practices and new ways of thinking. We have a lot to learn from each other.

Over the past year, I’ve noticed a few bureaucratic words creeping back into my vocabulary. Words like “robust” and “seamless.” Words that normal people never use in real life. “Force multiplier” is another one of those words—although at least that one is rooted in military terminology, so it isn’t just “consultant speak.” But I was trying to come up with a better phrase, and I just kept coming back to “greater than the sum of our parts.” We’re pretty good on our own—and by that, I mean each of us. You’re doing great work in your communities. And I’m seeing the great work that the men and women of the FBI are doing all over the country. But together, we’re greater than the sum of our parts. We’ve worked hard to get here over the years. We’re in a new place now, and we’ve got to keep moving forward.

The past few years haven’t been an easy time in law enforcement. We face incredible challenges. From dangerous and diverse threats to our communities and our country to budget constraints, a lack of resources, recruiting challenges, and tension with some of the communities we serve. We’re all trying to grow our ranks, to attract new people and fresh perspectives to careers in law enforcement. But this isn’t always the easiest job to sell.

Our officers, deputies, and agents face long hours, low pay, and grave danger. There’s a great deal of criticism of the work we do, and it can sometimes seem like law enforcement is a thankless job. One for which too many good men and women have paid the ultimate price. This year, we’ve lost 43 law enforcement officers to adversarial gunfire, an increase of approximately 16 percent over this time last year.

Any reported increase is of concern, but the simple fact is that every officer, every deputy, and every agent we lose is one too many. It’s a loss to our organizations, a loss to our communities, and most importantly, it’s a devastating loss to the loved ones they leave behind.

Last weekend, two police officers from the Brookhaven (Mississippi) Police Department were shot and killed while responding to reports of shots fired. Patrolman James White was 35; Corporal Zach Moak was 31. The Brookhaven PD is a 38-person department. And while the loss of life wouldn’t be any less devastating to a major metropolitan police department, the impact is even more real for such a small department. Because everyone in the Brookhaven PD knew Patrolman White and Corporal Moak.

And as you all know, on Wednesday night, Officer Terrence Carraway—a 30-year veteran of the Florence (South Carolina) Police Department—was shot and killed in an ambush. Six other officers were injured in that attack.

I’ve made it a priority to reach out to every chief and every sheriff when they lose one of their own this way. Because your loss is our loss. And we want you to know we stand with you in your sorrow.

I also want to take a moment to recognize the 9/11 first responders we’ve lost this year, and all those who are battling illness right now. In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, thousands of first responders worked day and night, week after week, month after month. And we’re only now beginning to understand—and witness—the long-term effects of that work, and the full extent of the sacrifices they made, for the American people.

In the face of all these challenges—and then some—we’ve got to grow our ranks. We’ve got to keep attracting great young people to law enforcement. We need the best of the best to do what we need to do. Because we get the opportunity—every day—to help people. To make their lives a little safer, a little easier. To make our communities a little stronger and better.

But it takes hard work, it takes high energy, and it takes true dedication. Sometimes it begs the question: Why would anyone choose this life? When I talk to new agents at their graduation from the FBI Academy in Quantico, I always end with the same words. I remind them that there will be good days and tough days—days when they’re tested to their limits. I tell them on those days to remember that they don’t have ordinary jobs—that law enforcement is a calling. I ask them to remember that they chose—and earned—this job. That they chose—and earned—the privilege of serving this country. I ask them to take care of each other. And to move forward together: heads up, eyes forward, shoulder-to-shoulder.

And I think those same words are more than fitting here. Our jobs seem to be getting more daunting each day. And there are lots of days when you think there’s got to be an easier way to make a living. And there are of course lots of easier ways. But there aren’t any better ways to make a living. I’m so thankful we’re in this together—that we have each other to lean on and to learn from. In the days, weeks, and months to come, we’ll keep at it. Tune out the noise, the chatter, and the armchair critics. Focus on the work, and the people we do the work for. Heads up, eyes forward, shoulder-to-shoulder. We’ll forge ahead—together. I’m grateful to have the chance to see so many of you again all in one place, and I look forward to working with you.","These are law enforcement threats; they are collective concerns.

APEX – Imagine two shipwrecked sailors in a row boat struggling to reach land. Their survival depends on their success. There is only one island on the horizon and they need to row in harmony and navigate wind, waves and ocean currents in order to avoid going in circles.

Now imagine that the two sailors never communicate about where they are headed or when to row. In fact, they do not discuss any plan and the only communication between them is combative. In my experience, this is how the Public and Private sector typically interact. Both entities are seeking to achieve many of the same goals, however collaboration is a rarity.

I am elbow deep in my third Public Private Partnership (PPP) and it has made me an evangelist. Why aren’t these partnerships more common?

Maybe the aversion to the concept of the government collaborating with private companies is rooted in our American identity. The idea of the government helping business owners to succeed invokes feelings of banana republic corruption and runs counter to many American’s belief that the private and public sector should be separate and that the government should not be in the business of choosing winners and losers.

However, this oversimplified paradigm throws the baby out with the bathwater. The key to a successful PPP depends upon defining where public and private interests overlap and developing a symbiotic plan that is mutually beneficial.

Several years ago, the town of Holly Springs developed a new Police Station in town that left the old Police Station vacant. In an effort to utilize the space as an incubator for growing the town’s business community they sent out a public Request For Proposal to develop a coworking space to attract and host local businesses.

The Coworking Station, which now hosts over twenty companies, resulted as the fruit of this endeavor. The space filled up within 6 months attracted Gregg Sinders, a thought leader in the education space, who formulated a plan to launch Pine Springs Academy, a new charter school. Due to the flexibility of the space he was able to secure funding and recruit and hire the schools Headmaster, administrative team all of the school’s teaching staff, while working out of the coworking space.

Pine Springs went on to build a new campus in Holly Springs that now provides innovative education to over 500 local students. The town has benefited from the newly developed school campus, the newly created jobs, and the additional educational opportunities available to its residents. This is an example of how just one tenant has benefited the town as a whole as a result of the partnership.

In January of 2010, as an economic development initiative by the Town of Wake Forest, the Wireless Research Center (WRC) was formed out of a Public Private Partnership. It has become a world class testing and engineering facility devoted to the advancement of wireless technologies and the promotion of economic development.

As an independent, 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, the WRC is uniquely positioned to serve large and small corporations as well as to partner with universities and governments locally and globally, addressing broad market and technology needs. The WRC maintains industry leadership in the development, standardization, and harmonization of wearable, medical, 5G, IoT, aviation, and sensor systems.

Since inception, the WRC has supported over 250 organizations with research and development of wireless products over a broad range of market sectors (commercial, medical, public safety, aviation, and Department of Defense).

In 2015, the WRC supported the promotion of RIoT (Regional Internet of Things) as part of their economic development mission to establish a collaborative IoT ecosystem. According to Dr. Gerard Hayes, the President and CEO of the WRC, the RIoT initiative has grown to over 6,000 individual members and over 80 companies. Jason Cannon, the President of the Wake Forest Business & Industry Partnership and Economic Development Director for the town of Wake Forest points to the success of this collaborative effort and is always looking for other opportunities to leverage the power of public and private partnerships.

Seeking to revitalize the downtown and solve a parking problem, Irena Krstanovic, the Director of Economic Development in Holly Springs, again tapped the power of a Public Private Partnership. She successfully recruited two private companies for development projects by offering a collaboration with the town for the construction of parking garage.

The expanded parking capacity would enable the developers to focus on adding as much commercial square footage as possible and knowing that it would create the density of retail and office space that a vibrant downtown requires. The town’s $9.3 million investment in parking infrastructure and roadwork improvements was able to attract a $23.4 million investment of private funds into the downtown, which is projected to create over 500 new jobs and have an economic benefit to the town in excess of $1 billion over the next twenty years.

These are just a few examples of Private Public Partnerships that have occurred in our area and I hope they will serve as a template for future PPP collaboration. Much like rocket fuel, the mixture of public and private funds must be done carefully, but when executed correctly the results are explosive and even the sky is no longer the limit.

The high level UN delegation met with senior officials of the Eritrean Government during a visit to the country on 18 and 19 October.

Discussions were held with the Ministers of National Development, Health and Foreign Affairs on ways to strengthen UNFPA’s partnership with the Eritrean Government in the framework of the UN Strategic Partnership and Cooperation Framework (SPCF), and addressing bottlenecks.

Mr. Dereje said the development gains Eritrea has made on many social indicators in recent decades was impressive, and a good example to the rest of the world.

“We are satisfied with [Eritrea Government’s] cooperation with the UN,” said Dr. Gergish Teklemichael, the Minister of National Development. On the 15-year time frame given for attaining the targets set for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), he said that his country would not have to wait long to attain these goals, provided that the much-needed support of the international community, including the UN, is boosted.

In a meeting with the UN Resident Coordinator a.i. and the heads of five UN agencies, Mr. Wordofa was briefed on how the agencies are working together in the framework of the SPCF in coordinating UN support to the development efforts of the Government. The One UN initiative remains strong in Eritrea and earnest efforts have been made to integrate emergency and development programmes.

Mr. Dereje said that the UN Country Team has exerted much effort in Eritrea to work coherently, and that the SPCF is the single most important planning and coordination tool.

The One UN initiative is all the more relevant today in view of the UN Reform underway, in the effort to realize the goals of the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development in the remaining 12 years, he added.

He called on development partners based in Eritrea and drawn from Britain, Sweden and the European Union to channel resources to support the development work in the country.

Mr. Dereje, the Minister of Health, Amina Nur Hussien, and a UNFPA leadership team visited health facilities to see the impressive gains made by the country in improving maternal and neonatal health.

The maternal and neonatal health interventions supported by UNFPA at the Mendeferal Zonal Referral Hospital, including the medical treatment and rehabilitation of fistula survivors, were a highlight. The hospital is the national referral hospital for fistula in Eritrea and the rate of the incidence of obstetric fistula has declined remarkably. As part of the rehabilitation work, fistula survivors receive psycho-social counselling, vocational training, and literacy classes at the hospital.

The group also toured the Maternity Waiting Home at the Adi Quala Community Hospital, which is supported by UNFPA.

Mr. Dereje acknowledged the tremendous achievements made in maternal and neonatal health.

“This country has a lot to tell the rest of the world on achieving the transformative results UNFPA is pursuing – ending preventable maternal death, ending unmet need for family planning, and ending gender-based violence and harmful cultural practices against women and girls.” UNFPA is to step up its support to help the country achieve its development targets, he said.

Minister of Health, Amina Nur Hussien said her Ministry would continue working with partners such as UNFPA “to ensure universal health coverage and achieve the targets of the SDGs.” The cooperation with partners has made pivotal contributions to the achievements the country has made, she added.

The current peace agreement between Eritrea and Ethiopia bodes well for the two countries and the sub-region as a whole in channelling resources to development for the betterment of the lives of the people, Mr. Dereje said. The UN is committed to supporting Eritrea to sustain its impressive development gains in recent decades.

He also highlighted the critical importance of generating quality and accurate data for development planning, and stated that UNFPA is ready to support the country to undertake a Census and Demographic and Health Survey. He underscored the need for efficient and timely use of resources tackling impediments on programme implementation, which he said is imperative to mobilize additional resources to support the country’s development efforts.","Eritrea—The strengthening of partnerships to sustain development gains in Eritrea was the focus of a mission led by the UN Assistant Secretary-General and Deputy Executive Director (Programme), Dereje Wordofa and sister UN agencies.

The grant will enable the museum to invest in long-term financial stability and strengthen community partnerships for artistic and public programs, museum officials said.

Founded in 1898, WAM is the second largest art museum in New England.

“We are truly elated,” said Christine Proffitt, grant manager of WAM.

“We regard this award as strong testimony for the highly creative and entrepreneurial work that we do – through our collections, exhibitions, partnerships and public programming – as well as the meaningful impact we have on our local, regional and global communities.”

The Barr Foundation and Klarman Family Foundation teamed up to grant $25 million to 29 arts and cultural organizations in Massachusetts.

The organizations were chosen based on diversity across artistic disciplines, geographic reach, stages of organizational development and budget sizes.

“The Barr-Klarman Massachusetts Arts Initiative was proud to select Worcester Art Museum as a recipient because of its significant importance in connecting the Worcester-area community through art and its continual dedication to bringing vibrant, distinguished and innovative art for people to experience,"" said Laura Sherman, director of Greater Boston Grantmaking for The Klarman Family Foundation.

WAM will receive the amount in single annual installments over three years, beginning this fall. This is a one-time renewable grant with a potential lifespan of six years.

Regarded as unrestricted operating grants, these funds are intended by the foundations to be used as investments towards long-term financial stability.

Specifically, BKMAI funds will support WAM’s capitalization and will enable them to focus on several core activities, including strengthening their community partnerships, enhancing artistic and public programming, and refining their Campus Master Plan, a strategy for repairing the deteriorating facility infrastructure and tapping into regional funding opportunities, said Ms. Proffitt.

Ms. Proffitt said WAM’s broader strategic goals over the life of this grant include strengthening the organization, expanding and diversifying their audiences to increase access to WAM’s collection and resources, enhancing financial sustainability, and optimizing facilities to create a more welcoming and visitor-centered museum environment.

“We greatly appreciate the vision and expanded, statewide approach of these philanthropic funding agents by providing cultural anchors and community catalysts, like the Worcester Art Museum, with this rare kind of multi-year unrestricted support,” said Ms. Proffitt.","WORCESTER — The Worcester Art Museum is getting a $600,000 grant from the Barr-Klarman Massachusetts Arts Initiative.

The protest — organized by local advocacy group Massachusetts Peace Action — was meant to draw attention to Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's March visit to MIT. Standing amid university police and barricades, members of the group called on MIT President L. Rafael Reif to disavow Prince Mohammed and to sever ties with the Saudi Arabian regime.

In a statement she gave to MIT’s student newspaper following the visit, university spokesperson Kimberly Allen said that “Saudi Arabia and MIT have a longstanding collaborative relationship focused on subjects of mutual interest.” Allen added the partnerships bring female Saudi students to study in the United States and support “the development of sustainable energy.”

The next day, March 24, Prince Mohammed visited Harvard. Roughly two miles away in Cambridge, there were no protests and no University press releases.

At the time, Vice Provost of International Affairs Mark C. Elliott told The Crimson Prince Mohammed participated in two private roundtable conversations at Harvard's faculty club. Former University President Drew G. Faust did not meet with Prince Mohammed, citing a prior commitment; University Provost Alan M. Garber ’77 entertained the Saudi royal in her stead.

The Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication, did not report on Prince Mohammed’s visit to campus. The Saudi government was less quiet, issuing an official press release on March 24.

“The Kingdom has strong ties with various American educational institutions, including Harvard University, and it aims to further develop these ties,” the release read. “The Saudi-U.S. partnership is strong across various cooperative levels, including education and research.”

The University’s relative silence during the March visit parallels a broader quiet about the bonds between Harvard and the Saudi Arabian government. These links, whether established through donations or research partnerships, have drawn limited attention. They are listed at the bottom of web pages — if at all.

Prince Mohammed, the de facto ruler of the authoritarian kingdom, has embarked on an ambitious reform program and sought in recent years to bolster his country’s connections to the West. But after Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed by a group of Saudis affiliated with the crown prince in Turkey earlier this month, American businesses, lawmakers, and educational institutions are re-examining their relationships with Saudi Arabia and its heir apparent.

Harvard, it seems, has privately opted to wait out the tide of criticism.

A HISTORY OF TIES

Harvard has a long history with the Saudi royal family.

In 2005, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal gave $20 million to the University, prompting Harvard to establish the Alwaleed Islamic Studies Program and to endow three professorships in his name. Days after the donation was announced, then-Congressman Anthony D. Weiner (D-NY) urged former University President Lawrence H. Summers to return the gift. Weiner was unsuccessful.

Those professorships are today held by Divinity School Professor Ousmane Kane, art historian David Roxburgh, and religious studies scholar Malika Zeghal.

Prince Alwaleed bin Talal — Prince Mohammed’s cousin — hasn’t exactly remained on good terms with the crown prince. Prince Mohammed imprisoned his cousin in a hotel in Riyadh last year as part of a sweeping effort to consolidate his power within the sprawling royal family.

In the 13 years since that first set of professorships, programs across the University have quietly formed partnerships with the Saudi royal family and associated entities.

After the 2005 gift, Center for Middle Eastern Studies Director William Granara said a Saudi national has since endowed a position in contemporary Arabic studies. Granara emphasized that the nature of the donation was personal, not political.

Granara added that the Center does not “have ties to any government.”

“When we get funds... a lot of them are actually [from] graduates of Harvard University,” he said. “If and when there is a situation in which we would look for, or we were approached by an official government from the Middle East who wants to give us money, we work with the development office. We don’t do that directly.”

At least two programs at the Kennedy School have formal connections to the Saudi government royal family. Per its website, the Evidence of Policy Design initiative “collaborates directly with policymakers” at the Saudi Ministry of Labor” to identify opportunities for data and economic analysis meant to suppor local labor markets and social development.

Similarly, the Belfer Center’s Project on Saudi and Gulf Cooperation Council Security “is made possible through a gift from HRH Prince Turki bin Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia,” according to its website.

Earlier this semester — before Khashoggi’s murder — administrators met to reconsider the ethics of these partnerships.

In correspondence obtained by The Crimson, Kennedy School Dean Douglas L. Elmendorf referenced an internal meeting held to address whether Harvard should continue collaborating with repressive regimes including Saudi Arabia's. At the meeting, administrators discussed whether the school’s relationship with these governments might be construed as support.

At the end of the meeting, administrators did not determine a clear path forward, according to the messages.

Neither Elmendorf nor representatives for the Kennedy School have publicly commented on Khashoggi’s death or the relationship between the school and Saudi Arabia.

In an email to The Crimson, Elmendorf acknowledged that the “Kennedy School has accepted money from Saudi Arabia for various research projects and teaching activities.”

“Our principal standards for such work are whether it maintains our tradition of scholarly excellence, whether it can be conducted without donors’ attempting to influence the conclusions of our scholarship, and whether it has positive effects on people in the societies where we are engaged,” Elmendorf wrote. “We believe that our work in Saudi Arabia meets those standards and have made no changes in that work at this point.”

But connections between Saudi royals and Harvard are not limited to CMES or to the Kennedy School.

Prince Mohammed conducts much of his international advocacy through the The Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Foundation (MiSK), an education nonprofit. While Harvard websites make no mention of the group, MiSK's site lists the University as an official partner.

The foundation sponsors a summer leadership development course held at Harvard. An MiSK press release dated March 7, 2016 states that “MiSK Foundation has an agreement with Harvard University to allocate 12.5% of the 800 seats for MiSK students.”

MiSK has sent out multiple press releases and tweets about the collaboration replete with photos of smiling high school students posing in Harvard Yard. Arabic language news outlets have written about the partnership as recently as 2016.

Harvard, meanwhile, has remained mum.

Representatives for Harvard Extension School, which runs the Summer School, did not respond to a request for comment about the partnership.

After the March protests against Prince Mohammed, the Cambridge City Council passed a unanimous resolution calling on Harvard and MIT to dissociate themselves from the Saudi government. At the time, neither university did so.

Since then, the regime — and its connections to the United States — have re-entered the spotlight.

The Saudi royal family is currently facing international scrutiny in the wake of Khashoggi’s death. Khashoggi, a one-time ally of the regime, disappeared on Oct. 2 after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.

After initially offering a counternarrative, Saudi officials have since acknowledged Khashoggi died in the consulate following what they called a drawn-out fight gone wrong. Political leaders and analysts around the world have dubbed the Saudi story an attempt to cover up a premeditated assassination.

Representatives for the royal family have repeatedly denied any connection between Prince Mohammed and the events in Turkey. These denials come as Turkish authorities gather mounting evidence that the Saudi government was responsible for the killing — and as experts on the regime say any order to kill Khashoggi must have earned the Crown Prince’s sign-off.

On Monday, MIT Associate Provost Richard K. Lester wrote in an email that MIT President Reif had asked him “to conduct a swift, thorough reassessment of MIT’s Institute-level engagements with entities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia” in the wake of Khashoggi’s death.

He added the journalist’s death and the allegations leveled against Prince Mohammed “are matters of grave concern to all of us.”

No Harvard administrators have released public statements since Khashoggi died.

Across the past two months, some affiliates have questioned Harvard’s official Saudi ties, arguing their opaque nature renders them suspect.

Griffin N. Peterson and Yarden Katz, who are both affiliated with Harvard, wrote an editorial in the Guardian following Prince Mohammed’s March visit titled “Elite universities are selling themselves — and look who’s buying.”

Katz said he and Peterson wanted to highlight under-the-radar partnerships, not to “moralize.”

“There are just so many of these webs of alliance that you can’t make a list of the ties,” Katz said. “We didn’t want to do Saudi-bashing and engage in some kind of discussion of how MIT and Harvard are so pure, they shouldn’t engage. Rather we wanted to point to the fact that these universities have all these secretive, dubious partnerships.”

Rosie Bsheer, an assistant professor in Harvard's History department, wrote in an email that the royal family’s donations to international institutions “aim to rehabilitate the country’s negative image abroad while attempting to influence knowledge production in the United States.”

Bsheer added that the research goals of Saudi-funded projects often stand in stark contrast to the regime’s domestic actions.

“This is the same Saudi regime that has heavily restricted and policed the academic freedom, and the freedom of expression more generally, of its own citizens at home,” she wrote. “Many of these citizens have paid a heavy price.""

CAIRO - 27 October 2018: Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly received in the airport on Oct.26 Chinese Vice-President Wang Kishan who is accompanied by a delegation to discuss with the Egyptian side bilateral cooperation as well as regional and international affairs of mutual interest.



Madbouly and Kishan held a meeting on Oct.27 to exchange views and continue coordination over the aforementioned matters. Later on, a number of agreements in the fields of agriculture, education, and archeology were signed.



The agreement signed in the education sector covers a Chinese grant to fund the distance learning project which will be executed over three phases in the value of $11.5 billion. That is in addition to donating 1,000 books to the South Valley University and building Confucius Hall on its campus..



The agreement signed in the agricultural sector is the “2019 - 2021 Executive Programme for Agricultural Cooperation” to boost agricultural investment, and capacity building in that sector. The agreement signed in the archaeological sector consist of cooperation antiquities preservation, research projects, capacity building, and the exchange of temporary exhibitions and missions.



Economic Bilateral Relations



Madbouly said that the progress achieved in bilateral relations reflect the goals of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership agreement signed by Egypt and China in December 2014 as well as its 2016 - 2021 executive programme.



The prime minister added that exchanging high-profile visits between both countries gave the Egyptian-Chinese ties momentum as the president visited China five times.



Madbouly highlighted the success stories of Chinese corporations in Egypt such as TEDA Holding which operates in Sczone, Jushi Group Co., Ltd working in the fiberglass industry, and Sinopec (China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation).



Both countries are giving priority to executing 11 projects worth $24 billion and were agreed upon in September during the last presidential visit to China. Egypt is eager to boost Chinese FDI and cooperation in productive projects in order to increase exports and substitute imports.



Egypt will take part as an honorary guest in the first China Import and Export Fair or 2018 Canton Fair to be held in Shanghai on November 5 - 10. That will be an opportunity to introduce Egyptian goods to Chinese importers.



The prime minister asserted Egypt’s eagerness to become an energy hub eastern the Mediterranean and a liquified gas export centre to Europe and Asia. He revealed that negotiations are ongoing with Cyprus and Greece to establish an overhead power line between Egypt and Cyprus.



The Belt and the Road Initiative



The Belt and the Road or the Silk Road initiative will be an opportunity for Egypt and China to cooperate in the transportation sector such as containers handling, ship building, port design, establishing logistic zones for promising Chinese industries, and constructing high-speed railway networks.



The Suez Canal will be an integral part of the initiative, and SCzone - as an economic and logistic centre - will contribute in developing international maritime trade. Egypt can benefit from China in introducing modern industries while China can benefit from the different free trade agreements Egypt has with the European Union, Africa, and Arab countries.



President Sisi will participate in the Belt and the Road initiative summit to take place in April 2019.



The Chinese vice-president stated that the companies of his country created many jobs, and benefited from their presence in Egypt by exporting to Europe. He also displayed measures taken to achieve economic and social development.



Sectors China can help develop



Egypt aspires to benefit from the Chinese experience in sovereign funds and to achieve cooperation between Egypt’s sovereign fund and the Chinese counterparts.



Egypt also wants China to help with renovating 16 industries in the public sector. Those include metal, automotive, agricultural tractors, pharmaceuticals, solar energy for factories, and aluminium.The Chinese vice-president said that cooperation in those industries will be studied.



Tourism



Madbouly said he looks forward to increase the number of Chinese tourists as it rose throughout the past three years to reach 300,000 in 2017. On the other hand, the Chinese vice-president expressed his admiration of archeological sites he visited in Cairo and Luxor promising to promote tourism to Egypt in China.



Chinese airlines started operating a direct line between the Egyptian capital and the Chinese city of Chengdu starting from Tuesday, Oct. 23. The Chinese airlines operate two flights a week from Cairo to Chengdu on Tuesdays and Fridays.



Beijing and Guangzhou also operate direct flights to Cairo. In 2017, Chinese tourism to Egypt increased by 94 percent, becoming the fourth largest in Egypt.



In August, President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi held a visit to China to attend the China-Africa Forum as he witnessed along with his Chinese counterpart XI Jinping the inking of five cooperation agreements.



Both countries signed agreements to construct an electric railway linking the New Administrative Capital to the 10th of Ramadan city, to launch a satellite by a Chinese grant, to acquire a Chinese loan, and to boost Chinese industrial investments in Egypt, especially in SCzone.

The conglomerate’s executive vice president for global media, Luis Di Como, added strategic colour to chief executive Keith Weed’s promises made in Cannes this year: namely that Unilever will never buy followers or work with influencers that buy followers.

Di Como confirmed that Unilever will continue to ramp up its investment in influencer marketing space in line with the 65% of companies that plan to do the same over the next year. He noted that solving follower fraud would be critical to the success of that growth.

The EVP believes issues of fraud, dishonesty and malpractice in the influencer space can be partially mitigated by forging “authentic and long-term, purposeful relationships with influencers” and finding an affinity with the people behind the camera.

“I think we need to move on from this one-all transactional, commercial relationship with ... creators or influencers,” he told an audience at Advertising Week New York. “We need to create really much more long-term partnerships with all of them.”

It’s a theory that’s previously been put forward by industry commentators such as Cristina Sarraille, senior strategist at We Are Social. She explained longer partnerships between brands and creators are mutually beneficial from the latter’s point of view, too.

“We often see influencers jumping from one brand to another in search of short-term (financial) gains,” said Sarraille. “However, this ultimately undermines their audience’s trust and can devalue your brand's efforts.”

For brands, a long-term relationship may be an unintended consequence of vetting systems that are becoming popular with brands looking to combat fraud. L’Oréal now has a formal process to make sure its influencer partners are both aligned to the brand and followed by legitimate accounts, and Unilever has established a similar system.

“We have ... the selecting process and the vetting process to make the match between influencers and brand values,” he said. “And after that, we go deeper with that particular influencer [to find] fake followers, fraud or malpractices that maybe they're not even aware [are] happening.”

Di Como explained that Unilever has pushed these partnerships even further in particular markets and has begun treating influencers like boutique agencies. In Latin America, for instance, it is co-creating product lines with influencers and marketing them entirely through influencer marketing. An unintended consequence of the latter means measurement becomes an easy task, as there is only one platform to scrape.

“In other markets we look at our brand positioning and look into the right influencer with the brand fit,” he said. “But both of those processes are great – it depends on the business objectives and goals.”

Di Como is also tackling influencer fraud by instilling a culture wherein reach is no longer the key KPI. The “obsession” with the likes of follower counts and views has been to the detriment of the industry, he contends, and believes Unilever has a certain responsibility to stand against the practice.

“We would be blind to follow one KPI that will create behaviours in the industry for dishonest business,” he said. “I found that is absolutely crazy that some people are going down that path and we are being much more vocal on those kinds of things.”

He added that the perfect metric mix for monitoring influencer campaign effectiveness is still unclear, however: “I believe we are still in the early stages and we need to continue working with influencers to set what measurement and success look like to create a mutual benefit partnership rooted in transparency and trust.”","Unilever is urging the industry to forge long-term “purposeful” relationships with influencers and monitor KPIs other than reach in order to tackle fraud in the sector.

—

Fewer public trash cans result in more litter on streets and in parks. That was the conclusion of a nine-month studydone by city officials working with researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, Temple University, and Swarthmore College. But while the study— as well as the intuition of many Filthadelphians — points to a need for more public trash cans, city officials have no definite plans to roll out more trash cans, or request more money for waste bins in next year’s budget.

“This will be among the many important priorities that will be considered in the coming budget deliberations,” city spokesman Mike Dunn said in an email.

Zero Waste and Litter Cabinet Director Nic Esposito said the study will help him make the case within City Hall for more spending on trash cans. In the meantime, neighborhood residents that want to see cleaner streets sooner rather may want to start fundraising. The Zero Waste and Litter Cabinet plans to soon roll out a new initiative that will encourage community groups to team up with the city and share expenses, Esposito said.

“I can’t promise that we’re going to be putting cans [this fall],” said Esposito.“I can promise that we are going to be coming up with a program where we can work with people and with community organizations and the city to have more trash cans.”

Such a program would reflect a trend towards public-private partnerships across Philadelphia. Already, many business districts and well-organized, affluent neighborhoods pay for increased cleanup services.

In the concluding pages of the study, the authors recommend using their research to “justify an expansion” of an existing “adopt-a-receptacle” program beyond block captains.

While the findings may sound like common sense, researchers said the question of whether adding or removing trash cans reduces or increases the amount of litter and the amount of time spent by staff cleaning it up had until now never been answered in a quantifiable way. According to the study, “some city departments feel that removing receptacles will prevent household trash dumping and force people to either hold onto their trash or waste less.”

“There was no evidence,” said Dan Hopkins, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania and collaborator of the study. “This is the kind of question that probably falls between the cracks; the kind of question that cities and municipalities are desperate to know the answer to, but that researchers would rarely have the capacity or interest to pursue.”

Hopkins said he was not surprised with the results, but that doesn’t mean testing it was worthless because even in cases where you have a strong intuition, sometimes an experiment can prove you wrong.

Recently, the New York City Sanitation Department removed 223 trash cans from Harlem because residents were using them to deposit their trash bags. And, as the city’s sanitation commissioner told the New York Times, the measure has been effective and the amount of trash on the street has been reduced.

But in Philly, it’s exactly the opposite. When the city removed trash cans from commercial corridors and parks, Philadelphians tended to drop their litter on the ground. The lack of trash cans resulted in higher costs for the city in staff hours required to clean a site.

On the other hand, when more trash cans were added, researchers didn’t necessarily see the amount of trash increase due to dumping.

A second study tested the effect of distributing lidded recycling bins to prevent litter and increase the amount of recycled tonnage, but the results were inconclusive.

The studies didn’t cost the city anything other than staff time, according to GovLabPHL Director Anjali Chainani. “No external actors were paid, and no grants were used,” Chainani wrote in an email. GovLabPHL, an initiative launched by Kenney, partners with universities on research that can inform city policy.

“The Zero Waste and Litter Cabinet has a number of goals, and we wanted to offer a way for them to measure if their pilots and efforts actually have an impact and how much of an impact,” Chaniani said. “Even marginal gains in evidence of what worked, and what didn’t, gives us more confidence in what next steps to take and how to further allocate the very limited resources we have.”

The city spent upwards of $5.6 million out of the city’s $4.4 billion budget to service wire wastebaskets in FY 2018, Dunn said. More than $2.8 million went towards servicing the Big Bellys found in Center City and other dense commercial areas. These figures don’t account for the money spent by the Department of Parks and Rec to maintain the cans on park property.

The hard cost of a new wire bin represents only teeny part of the cost — $100 per can. The Big Bellys cost $3,200 each, or $3,500 if a recycler is attached. The metal baskets take crews twice as long to service than Big Bellys, Dunn said.

The Zero Waste and Litter Cabinet has a budget of about $105,000, only large enough to cover salaries for Esposito and a staffer.","Zero Waste and Litter Cabinet Director Nic Esposito said the study will help him make the case within City Hall for more spending on trash cans.

Title: Strategic Yeast Nutrition Supplementation for Hard Cider Fermentation

Cider production and consumption has increased dramatically over the past decade, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. One area of interest to cidermakers in this region is how yeast nutrition during fermentation impacts aroma and flavor development in cider. One aroma, hydrogen sulfide, is responsible for a rotten-egg-like odor and is often produced as a response to yeast nutritional stress. Though much work has been done to evaluate the production of hydrogen sulfide during grape wine fermentation, there is a significant lack of research pertaining to cider fermentation.

Therefore, this research aims evaluate nutrient supplementation strategies during hard cider fermentation to reduce the occurrence of hydrogen sulfide formation by adding various forms of nitrogen and vitamins at different rates. This study will be the first in a multi-institutional effort to address yeast nutrition in cider fermentation to support the growing cider industry.

Title: Fire-adaptive trait diversity across spatial scales: Consequences for productivity recovery following wildfire

Coincident with recent warm and dry conditions, ecosystems across the globe have experienced an increase in wildfire activity. Future changes in climate are widely anticipated to increase area burned and fire occurrence. In the context of anticipating the ecological consequences of altered fire regimes, a key challenge is understanding which systems may be most resilient, or able to recover their essential structure and function following disturbance. It is widely thought that resilience is greater in more diverse systems because any individual species lost to wildfire may be compensated for by another species that is functionally similar. Yet empirical evidence for the diversity-resilience relationship is lacking, particularly across complex landscapes. To address this knowledge gap, the proposed research seeks to quantify the effects of biodiversity and environmental conditions on resilience across spatial scales.

Title: Musical Ekphrasis in the Flute Works of Women Composers: A commissioning and recording project

Within the scope of this project, the PI, Sophia Tegart, will commission, record, and perform works by women composers for flute alone and flute and piano. Musical ekphrasis, or the representation of art, nature, and poetry in music will act as the unifying theme of the project. The commissioned, recorded, and performed works on the CD will exemplify musical ekphrasis. The CD will contain previously written works by composers Jean Ahn, Jessica Rudman, Laura Schwendinger, Sofia Gubaidulina, and Gabriela Lena Frank, as well as newly commissioned works by Canadian-born, Scottish-based composer Emily Doolittle and German-American composer Ingrid Stolzel. The PI will perform and record the works in collaboration with Washington State University School of Music faculty pianist, Michael Seregow. The eventual result of this project will be the addition of new creative works, preservation and dissemination of the works, and national and international recognition of the works through published scores and reviews, recordings, and musical performances.

Title: Towards Mass Production: Developing Functional Maternity Hospital Gown

In labor and delivery services, all women deserve good quality maternal health services for the wellbeing of themselves and their children. However, there has been an increase in patient dissatisfaction of current hospital maternity gowns since they are not fully functional for the healthcare practitioner and are physically and emotionally uncomfortable to the user. The purpose of this project is to conduct the research needed that informs development of economically feasible and functional hospital gowns that satisfy the needs of both patients and the practitioners throughout different stages of labor. The researcher will (a) identify key design attributes of patients and practitioners’ user needs through a nation-wide online survey and interviews conducted at Pullman Regional Hospital, and (b) determine a cost-effective design and sustainable supply chain of the maternity hospital gowns. This study extends the user-centered approach to a society-oriented focus through product innovation, product-service system innovation and socio-technical system innovation. Patients, healthcare practitioners, and health insurance organizations will benefit from the results.

Title: Health Education through Arts Learning: A STEM Partnership in Diverse Rural Communities

For many low-income and minority children living in US rural-agricultural regions, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) can seem out of reach. There is a pressing need to develop educational programs that allow underrepresented children to see themselves and their rural communities as a genuine part of the STEM landscape. This project will launch the Health-STEM Education through Arts-based Learning (HEAL) partnership. Emerging STEM-education scholars in WSU’s College of Education lead the HEAL partnership. Additional collaborators include faculty in CAHNRS, the College of Medicine, and the Franklin and Yakima Extension campuses, as well as community partners in rural Washington. HEAL’s long-term mission is to broaden minority and rural participation in STEM. This project will develop a novel educational program to teach children in grades 3-5 from predominantly-Latino populations in Central Washington about ecological dynamics and infectious diseases that affect rural-agricultural areas. This unique partnership will investigate innovative arts-based strategies to reveal diverse opportunities for students to engage in STEM fields.

Title: Large-scale multiple hypotheses testing: adaptivity, accuracy, stability and reproducibility

In many scientific endeavors including genomics, genetics, medical science and drug safety studies, researchers need to simultaneously compare one or more features of thousands or even millions of study subjects and then identify highly relevant ones for further investigations. This leads to large-scale multiple hypotheses testing for high-dimensional data. However, observations in such data usually follow heterogeneous distributions, are dependent on each other, and inherit various sources of uncertainty. This greatly affects the adaptivity, accuracy, stability and reproducibility of a statistical procedure. To date, these four issues have only been addressed for very special cases. Correspondingly, the proposed research will address them in general by developing testing procedures that adapt to the overall level of signals in data, classifying the type of dependence under which a statistical procedure is accurate and stable, and proposing reproducible and scalable statistical methods that account for heterogeneous sources of uncertainty in data.

Title: Strength and stiffness of unsaturated clay in relation to internal stress state

Strength and stiffness of the soil are the two most important parameters in the design and analysis of geotechnical engineering structures (e.g., foundations, pavements, natural and man0made slopes, etc.). The traditional framework that is used in geotechnical engineering practice to determine the mechanical soil behavior is based on the assumption that the soil is fully saturated with water. The assumption simplifies the analysis by reducing the soil into a two-phase medium an considers the worst possible environmental conditions, however, cannot represent the true stress state of soil. More importantly, change in soil saturation results in a nonlinear change in internal stress state, and therefore to mechanical soil behavior, which cannot be captured by the current framework. This study is a step to develop a new framework to quantify mechanical behavior of soils in the entire range of saturation (i.e., from 0 to 100%). Soil stiffness is measured through resilient modulus and shear modulus tests in the entire range of saturation. The change in soil stiffness with saturation is explained through the change in internal stress components (i.e., adsorptive and capillary components) with saturation.

Title: Access to Opioid Addiction Treatment and Overdose Risk in Spokane County

Regions throughout North America are experiencing unprecedented rates of morbidity and mortality associated with opioid overdoses (OD). In fact, the increase in OD-related death is attributed to have caused the first drop in US life expectancy since 1963 (0.1% between 2015 and 2017). Within Washington State, Spokane County had a 78% increase in opioid drug-related deaths in 2016 compared to 2014 (64 vs. 36 respectively). There is growing evidence that methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is effective in reducing rates of OD and OD mortality. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to: 1.) examine the relationship between access to the only publicly-funded MMT clinic in Spokane county and both adherence to treatment and likelihood of OD and, 2.) to map locations (hotspots) within Spokane County where either high or low concentrations of MMT clients are found. A web-based mapping and visualization dashboard will display the results and provide an analysis platform for decision makers.

Title: Effect of buprenorphine/bupivacaine in brachial plexus block for elbow arthroscopy in dogs.

Local anesthesia techniques have many advantages besides producing pain relief during surgery. It also promotes pain relief after surgery, better recovery from surgical procedures, and a faster healing time. Bupivacaine has been the agent of choice for local blocks due to its longer duration of time (6 h). Human research has shown that adding buprenorphine, a partial opioid, to a nerve block can increase the analgesia duration threefold. This could benefit patients undergoing surgeries by providing prolonged analgesia after discharge from the hospital. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of buprenorphine added to the local anesthetic (bupivacaine) for brachia! plexus block in dogs that will be subjected to elbow arthroscopy. The effect of this drug combination will be compared to the effects of brachia! plexus block given only the local anesthetic. Data collection will include intraoperative cardiorespiratory variables, postoperative pa_in and lameness scores, and opioid consumption postoperatively which will be given when any dog is showing signs of pain.

Title: Investigating cellular heterogeneity during skin development in a porcine (pig) model.

Adult skin wounds in mammals heal via a reparative, rather than regenerative, process and, therefore results in fibrotic scarring. Small scars in the skin are not normally a problem for mammals, but fibrotic scars that cover large areas of the human body, such as burn wounds, can be debilitating. To fully regenerate a wound, re-formation of a complex micro-tissue-architecture including skin appendages, hair follicles and sweat glands is required. Fibroblasts are key cell types in regulating appendage formation during skin development and tissue repair. We have discovered that regulating the relative abundances of different fibroblast populations during wound repair in mice will direct skin regeneration instead of scarring. Here we intend to investigate fibroblasts during porcine (pig) skin development as a surrogate model for human skin, to lead to therapeutic strategies for human skin regeneration.

Title: A mixed methods approach to understanding the human-building interface

As evidenced by a growing body of research, building interface design profoundly affects occupant comfort, building usability and energy use. However, there is limited research and practical guidance on residential building interface design. This project will use a set of novel surveys, interviews, and field studies to determine best practices for design considerations for common household interfaces (e.g. thermostats, light switches, windows, blind controls, and water fixtures). An online survey and interviews will be implemented to understand occupants’ perceptions of thermal and visual comfort, as well as respective adaptive opportunities and corresponding behaviors (e.g. opening/closing windows).

Ultimately, findings from this study will provide major insights about the importance of: (a) the human-building-interface, (b) design missteps and lessons learned, and (c) understanding the building context when implementing behavioral approaches. This research has the potential to greatly improve residential design and human-building interface controls. Results will be disseminated through a free webinar, journal and magazine article, and an illustrated user-friendly report of results.

Title: Design and Synthesis of Porous Smart Materials

The proposed research aims to design and synthesis porous smart materials for applications in sensing of toxic chemicals in air and water. These smart materials can change color when contacted with specific chemicals. We plan to use highly emissive organic ligands as building blocks to construct porous luminescent coordination polymers and porous organic polymers. On one hand, the feature of these materials is that the structure of the framework can change upon chemical or physical stimulation, for example, metal ions in water or external pressure. The change of structure will cause the color or emission color change, which can be recorded to identify the contacted species and calculate the concentration. On the other hand, the rigid framework can be constructed by using flexible organic ligands, in which there are functional groups that are not directly used to connect to the network. In this case, the free functional groups can interact with chemicals, which will change the relative conformation of the organic ligand, which will alter the color of the material. As the color of the material is very sensitive to the conformation, the detection of chemicals with very low concentration can be realized.

Title: The role of emotions and social media in young women’s tanning attitudes and behaviors

Melanoma, the deadliest type of skin cancer, is prevalent in young women. Melanoma kills one person every hour. Younger skin is particularly vulnerable to ultraviolet light that promotes skin cancer, making young women a prime target audience for prevention messaging. Messaging focused on increasing knowledge has not been found effective at changing behaviors. Our project will examine the role of psychosocial variables related to media use and emotional states in promoting or preventing skin damaging and skin protection behaviors through real-time data collected via ecological momentary assessment with young women in two states. Results of this research will provide us with valuable insights that can inform the development of an intervention to promote sun safety for young women. Additionally, it will provide preliminary data for external funding applications.

Title: Human cognition in computer simulations: an evaluation of poverty alleviation.

The pattern of cyclical poverty is a frequent feature of households in poverty across low – middle income countries. Interventions may contribute to cyclical poverty when immediate gains don’t change household’s long-run productive capacity. The integration of economic theory with agent-based models to better understand the importance of micro-level assumptions on macro-level outcomes aligns to a complex systems framework. This same framework is appropriate to better understand long-term epidemiological and environmental dynamics associated with poverty alleviation and the use of livestock asset transfers. Two agent-based models will be built each with a different geographical and livestock asset focus. The simulation model requires two sets of human decisions: a) sale of livestock, and b) vaccination against infectious livestock disease. The contrasting assumed levels of information associated with persistent knowledge of the availability of livestock feed and limited information about livestock disease outbreaks provides natural contexts to test the effects of cognitive information processing costs.","To address this knowledge gap, the proposed research seeks to quantify the effects of biodiversity and environmental conditions on resilience across spatial scales.
The PI will perform and record the works in collaboration with Washington State University School of Music faculty pianist, Michael Seregow.
The change in soil stiffness with saturation is explained through the change in internal stress components (i.e., adsorptive and capillary components) with saturation.

They need to be constantly active, should be good readers of the game and look to time their tackles to perfection. These qualities are essential in modern day centre-backs as they easily made the scapegoats if their team performs badly in a particular match.

Centre-defensive partnerships are necessary in order to stay in the game and prevent the opposition attackers from scoring goals. A good centre-defensive partnership can make the entire defence organisationally strong and hence add pressure on the opponents. On the other hand, a bad centre-defensive partnership can create confusion among the entire defence and open up an opportunity for the opposing team to capitalize on.

Let us rank the 5 World Class centre defensive partnerships of the 21st century.

#5 Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld

Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld have established themselves as one of the best defensive partners in the Premier League at the moment. The positional play of this pair is excellent, are comfortable in possession and can cover the pitch with their pace quickly in order to negate any threat from the opposition.

They are no-nonsense defenders who have helped Tottenham attackers by conceding very few goals in the last couple of seasons.

They have also formed a successful defensive partnership for Belgium and hence were instrumental in helping them achieve the 3rd place at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. Both of them also pose a threat to the opposition from set-pieces and hence complement each other perfectly in several areas.

178,https://ewnews.com/govt-establishes-formal-policy-for-public-private-partnerships,"Wed, 03 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",EyeWitness News,Gov’t. establishes formal policy for public private partnerships,"The Government has established a formal policy for public-private partnerships (PPP) that sets out clear definitions and terms to govern the process of identifying, screening, procuring and managing PPPs, including how to treat unsolicited proposals.

Deputy Prime Minister Peter Turnquest said in the past, the term PPP has been used in broad, often metaphorical terms to account for any number of projects, including those categorized as joint ventures, management contracts, and even simple vendor-financed transactions that represented essentially short-term loans to the government.

He noted, however, that with the new policy, the government specifically defines a PPP as a relationship between the government and a private sector entity or consortium designed to introduce private sector resources and expertise into public infrastructure projects.

The intended use of a PPP is to implement priority investment and infrastructure projects that are aligned with the government’s development objectives, where doing so is expected to provide the best value for scarce resources.

Turnquest said the government is looking at every possible avenue to limit its borrowing and constrain its debt while meeting its financial obligations.

“The reality is meeting The Bahamas’ infrastructure needs is beyond the fiscal capacity of the government alone, given the geographic dispersion of the islands, coupled with low population densities of the Family Islands and higher than average infrastructure costs,” Turnquest said.

“These factors create particular challenges with regard to policy, management and maintenance of public infrastructure.

“To address these challenges, the government recognises the private sector has financial and technical resources that can be mobilised to help provide high-quality, responsive, resilient, and sustainable public assets and services in a way that achieves value for money for the government and public users.”

Turnquest said while it is not new for the government to use PPPs to advance its policy objectives, the government has taken responsible action to develop a formal policy and move away from the ad hoc approval of previous governments.

The PPP Policy will inject a new level of transparency and accountability to the regulation of PPP projects, creating a standard set of objectives and criteria for the identification and screening of projects, for the procurement of PPP partners and the management of PPP projects. In a climate of fiscal restraint, a formal policy also ensures that the fiscal impact of all PPPs is not only well understood, but in line with the Government’s legal obligations to fiscal responsibility.

The new PPP Policy provides guidelines for reviewing unsolicited PPP proposals from the private sector; however, its primary focus is public investments that have been identified and prioritized by the government in order to close critical infrastructure gaps that stifle medium and long-term growth and social development. The policy creates flexibility in structuring PPPs by allowing for a variety of contract types.

“Partnerships of this nature undertaken by the government must go through a rigorous accountability process because we are talking about using public money on major infrastructural projects that have profit incentives built in for private sector partners,” he said.

“This is not the private sector where you can make snap decisions and do what you want when you want because it is your own private money. These are public investment projects and there is no shortcutting the accountability process. It must have transparency and it must be open and fair, and it must be fiscally responsible. That is why a policy is necessary and that is why our policy establishes these as guiding principles along with value for money, environmental and social sustainability, partnership and inclusiveness.

“We have created a streamlined process that is fair and transparent with essentially only three stages: Project Identification and Screening; Business Case Analysis and PPP Procurement. The oversight and management structure has four reasonable tiers: Sector level/project specific management teams; overall PPP Operational Unit at the MOF and oversight bodies responsible for all approvals in the PPP Steering Committee and Cabinet.

“This creates the needed checks and balances for responsibly managing public money and protects the return on investment for the Bahamian people,” he said.

“It important to note as well that although the policy sets guidelines for the ideal size of projects and the nature of same, the government will retain its right to exercise flexibility on project types and project sizes that it will consider and make exceptions when warranted.

“The primary ambition is to engage the private sector in a way that makes optimal use of public resources toward public sector goals.

“I emphasize the point because I want to encourage all Bahamians who may have a project idea that may not fit into the prescribed scope to still come forward with their ideas and plans. If they fit into the guiding principles of the PPP framework and the project makes sense for the Bahamian people, the government will be prepared to give consideration to it,” he concluded.","He noted, however, that with the new policy, the government specifically defines a PPP as a relationship between the government and a private sector entity or consortium designed to introduce private sector resources and expertise into public infrastructure projects.

The company is in the process of identifying locations to develop grade A warehousing stock across the country, CEO Venkatesh Gopalakrishnan told PTI.

""We have a large residential portfolio and now we want to build a warehousing platform. This is mainly because only residential is also risky. Initially we were commercially heavy and now we are residential heavy,"" he said.

Talking about potential in the warehousing sector, Gopalakrishnan said there is a good demand for grade A stock and with the introduction of GST and growth in the FMCG and e-commerce sectors, they see it as a huge opportunity to foray into the segment.

According to a recent KPMG report, the Indian warehousing industry, which was valued at Rs 560 billion in 2017, is expected to reach 297 million sqft by 2021.

""Currently the is cluttered. With the introduction of GST, there is a consolidation in the warehouse structure in the hub and spoke model. We will have to do more research and analysis. But we feel warehousing is a long-term business and we want to be in this sector,"" he said.

Asked whether the company was looking at acquiring assets, Gopalakrishnan said, ""Warehousing is both greenfield and brownfield opportunity. We are also in talks with global firms for making the foray.""



""It is important to have good partner who understands the international standards because the sector has to be seen as a product offering rather than as a structure or a shed.""

Apart from this, the company has developed and leased around 7.5 million sqft of commercial space under the brand SP Infocity and has a portfolio of nearly 10 million sqft of proposed development under this.

""We have two eyes on debt and one eye on growth. We are not very hungry for growth but we would now want to shift our focus to more specific sectors like warehousing or low cost housing where we see immense potential,"" he said.

The company, which is sitting on a debt of around Rs 40 billion, is looking to sell its commercial projects as a strategy to focus on core businesses.

""We are identifying locations where we can set up Grade A warehousing facilities and we believe it can be done across the country,"" he said.

Explaining the business model, Gopalakrishnan said the returns in this sector are between 12-15 per cent, less than what the company would make on land deal or on sale of residential space.

""In warehousing, if you buy land and lease at Rs 20-25 per sqft and after 10 years this land gets re-rated, then all your payback is happening on warehousing as land becomes very valuable,"" he added.","Looking to further diversify its portfolio and tap the growing warehousing sector, Real Estate plans to enter the segment and is in talks for strategic partnerships, a top company official has said.

Tunis: Minister of State for Foreign Affairs H E Sultan bin Saad Al Muraikhi affirmed Qatar's keenness to continue efforts exerted by all Arab and African countries by working together in order to effectively address the dangers of disasters facing humanity and to prepare the appropriate preparedness plans to anticipate what would negatively affect our peoples and planet.

In a statement before the Arab-African Platform on Disaster Risk Reduction in Tunis today, the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs expressed Qatar's support for the platform's final declaration, stressing that the country will spare no effort to build regional and international partnerships to confront what threatens our peoples, now and in the future. This emanates from the belief that development is a right for all and represents an added value that must be preserved for the prosperity of humankind, Al Muraikhi said.

He said that the State of Qatar looked forward to seeing constructive coordination and cooperation, working together to reduce the negative effects of natural disasters and emergencies on human life, population, the environment, national economies and social conditions in general, and minimizing disaster losses by promoting the concept of preparedness and response as an integral part of national development plans in countries.

Al Muraikhi emphasized that disaster response required a renewed effort to respond to new and emerging risks, adding: ""As everyone knows, we have adopted the Sendai framework, which replaced the 2005-2015 Hyogo Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. The new framework for 2015-2030 will continue and requires effective and influential international and regional cooperation.""

He noted the organization of major conferences in the Arab region to address disaster risks, pointing in this regard to the conferences held in Jordan in 2013, Egypt in 2014 and Qatar in 2017, during which political declarations focused on issues related to the implementation of the Hyogo framework for action at local level and consultation on the Sendai framework, the Paris Convention on Climate Change and sustainable development goals 2030.

The Minister pointed out that this high-level platform at the ministerial level which is held in the Arab region followed the Third Arab Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Doha in May 2017, during which the Arab Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction 2030 and its Plan of Action were approved.

He stressed that Qatar attaches great importance to the issues of sustainable human development as it is one of the pillars of its national vision. He pointed out that preparing and addressing the dangers of man-made or natural disasters is one of the most important ways to preserve national achievements and capabilities.

Emanating from this, he said, the State of Qatar supports the Sendai framework for disaster risk reduction 2015-2030 and its seven common objectives, pointing out that Qatar has enacted the necessary laws and regulations and established institutional arrangements such as the Permanent Committee for Emergency, which oversees the urban and civil expansion in line with all the standards of security and safety at global levels, in addition to investing in qualified personnel to work in the fields of rescue, development and relief for safety for all who reside on its land.

Al Muraikhi added that the State of Qatar has established the standing committee for rescue and relief operations and humanitarian aids for areas afflicted by catastrophes in brotherly and friendly countries. It has enacted the laws of humanitarian and non-governmental organizations and donor institutions, which direct support and relief to all countries affected by natural disasters or conflict-stricken and civil wars areas.

He pointed out that the State of Qatar had a long history of supporting the efforts of States in cooperation with the UN and international agencies to help overcome these catastrophic effects, including in the Arab region and the African continent.

The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs highlighted that the State of Qatar provides generous assistance, and is undertaking its role as an active and responsible member of the international community to bridge South-South cooperation and the rest of the world, and it is recognized as a leading donor to development financing.

On behalf of the State of Qatar and the participating delegation, he welcomed the adoption of the Arab coordinating mechanism for disaster risk reduction and the establishment of the special fund for disaster risk reduction by the Arab platform for disaster risk reduction.","Al Muraikhi emphasized that disaster response required a renewed effort to respond to new and emerging risks, adding: ""As everyone knows, we have adopted the Sendai framework, which replaced the 2005-2015 Hyogo Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.

What does it take to make a partnership bold, ambitious, and long-term? How can we strengthen global partnerships—the primary aim of Sustainable Development Goal 17—to create transformational change?

The reality is that true partnerships—ones that are balanced in power and influence, long-term, and far-reaching—are rare and hard to build. Many fail, and many others remain narrow and transactional, with one partner becoming more akin to a supplier than a partner.

The international NGO CARE USA and the global food and agriculture company Cargill have been partnering for more than 50 years—long before any of the authors of this piece began working for our respective organizations. Cargill sponsored its first international food parcels in 1960, and CARE USA did the work of delivering them to hospitals, orphanages, and other locations in some of the poorest regions at the time, inlcuding Iran, Haiti, Greece, Columbia, Korea, and Mexico. The relationship continued along the same philanthropic lines until, in the mid-2000s, former CARE CEO Peter Bell began to ask how the two organizations could better share their capabilities and benefit even more from their relationship, beyond money.

The result was the launch of a focused, strategic partnership in 2008. With an initial 5-year commitment of $10 million from Cargill, the organizations started the Rural Development Initiative to support rural agricultural communities. The commitment was extended in 2013 and 2016, and today the partnership specifically aims to improve food and nutrition security, increase farmer productivity, create greater access to markets, and build local communities’ resilience. The initiative has enabled much progress. For example, farmers in Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua involved in the Nourishing the Future program have increased their household income between 22 and 50 percent. Meanwhile, 2,180 Village Saving and Loans Association members in Ghana have saved more than $112,000 combined, and in India’s Kutch Livelihood and Education Advancement Project, the partnership linking 5,594 milk producers with the formal dairy market has led to a two-fold increase in profit and a 182 percent increase in income. In total, the global partnership has reached 2.2 million people in 10 countries with investments of more than $25 million.

Learning to Be Transformative

Based on more than a dozen in-depth interviews with people from both CARE and Cargill who have been intimately involved in the partnership’s evolution over the past 10 years, we identified a number of factors that commonly led to success. These fell into five main areas of practice. Our recent report shows that convening partners around an ambitious shared purpose in a way that drives mutual value, as well as deliberate, authentic commitment to communication and collaboration can drive sustainable impact, even beyond what partners originally envision.

1. Ambitious Shared Purpose

Having a shared purpose and long-term goals requires that partners take time to establish a deep understanding of each other’s work, but doing so enables them to bring all their expertise to the tasks at hand, to allow for the flexibility and space they need to take advantage of new opportunities, and to commit to a long-term relationship. As Blanca Villela from Cargill’s Central America, Colombia, team explains: “Needs are unlimited, resources are limited; our aim is to find the best ways to leverage our collective resources to amplify and multiply our positive impact.”

2. A Drive for Mutual Value

The strategic shift in Cargill and CARE USA’s partnership—what made it transformational—required that each organization understand the partnership’s value and jointly develop impact measurement and reporting. But determining mutual value is an ongoing process; partners need to continuously look for ways to improve and create longer-lasting, deeper impact—for both themselves and the people they serve. CARE USA and Cargill, for example, have seen increased employee engagement, as well as longer-lasting social impacts in communities.

3. Co-Creation and Continuous Improvement

After more than 50 years of partnering, CARE USA and Cargill have developed a mutual respect for one another’s capabilities and perspectives. The stronger the engagement and commitment between partners, the more resilient and able to manage setbacks and failures they are. When Cargill entered into the strategic phase of the partnership, for example, it determined that it was OK to fail and that if things didn’t work, the company would invest in working with CARE USA on a solution.

4. Authentic Internal Communication

Communication means more than talking to one another or delivering quarterly reports; it’s about honest feedback, and mutual trust, respect, and equality. Partners need space to become friends and trusted advisers. This requires that they invest in the human relationships that underpin the partnership, and take the time to explore opportunities and risks beyond the boundaries of partnership activities. Joan Garvey Lundgren, executive director of strategic partnerships at CARE USA, puts it simply: “Cargill and CARE USA have an open, proactive dialogue.”

5. Shared External Engagement

The power of influence and societal impact that corporates and NGOs can achieve when they publicly join forces—whether through policy change advocacy, joint marketing campaigns, or harnessing brands for social good—is only just coming to the forefront. Cargill was the first company CARE USA reached out to when it launched its advocacy partnership network in the United States. Today they work together on advocating for women’s economic empowerment, and access to food and nutrition.

The depth of the partnership is also enabling Cargill and CARE USA to look beyond short-term, localized social impact, to broader and more-lasting change. Theophilius Nkansah of Ghana CARE USA explains, “The work with Cargill has really challenged us to look at the larger context and engage with multiple partners.”

The Power of Relationships

Of course, the CARE USA and Cargill partnership has faced its fair share of challenges. In the early years, for example, there was insufficient infrastructure to ensure that teams collected impact data consistently across all countries. This made it harder to aggregate the data for further evaluation and analysis.

Other challenges were determining how to leverage the expertise of each organization and prioritize countries for the most significant impact. The partners realized that through collaboration, they could address multiple program objectives, rather than single interventions. For example, Cargill shared its approach to responsible agricultural production and supply chains, and CARE contributed its community empowerment, education, and economic development expertise.

The partnership has persevered, and has continued to adapt and improve. The organizations agreed to invest in a measurement and evaluation expert embedded within CARE. The CARE team proposed a new approach to community engagement—the development of committees drawn from different groups in the community—that is now working well. And although the Brazil program has finished, the partnership has added countries such as Indonesia and Costa Rica to the program.

Transformational partnerships offer the exciting prospect of scale and lasting impact, and the capacity to tackle the complex, global challenges we face today. We are hopeful that what we’ve learned over the past 50 years and, in particular, the last 10 years of strategic partnership between Cargill and CARE USA, will assist others as we strive to realize a long-term, sustainable future.","The result was the launch of a focused, strategic partnership in 2008.

Land O’Lakes is the first partner that will integrate fully with the latest version of Field to Market’s Fieldprint Platform, released this month.

“We are proud to partner with Land O’Lakes to give farmers even greater choice in assessing the sustainability performance of their management practices and respond to growing interest across the value chain in where and how commodity crops are grown,” shared Rod Snyder, president of Field to Market. “This collaboration integrates Field to Market’s sustainability insights alongside the stewardship and agronomic analysis for which Land O’Lakes WinField United ag-retailer owners are known — helping farmers make decisions that benefit the air, soil, water and their business.”

Truterra is an interactive on-farm digital platform that will help farmers advance their stewardship goals and ROI in real time, acre-by-acre — and help food companies measure sustainability progress. Land O’Lakes and Field to Market have a history of working closely together to advance on-farm sustainability. Land O’Lakes, a farmer-owned cooperative, is a longstanding member of the Alliance, and serves on both its Board of Directors and Standing Committees.

“The addition of Fieldprint Platform sustainability metrics to the Truterra Insights Engine is a key asset supporting the agricultural and food supply chain to utilize Truterra for data-driven insights,” said Matt Carstens, SVP of Land O’Lakes SUSTAIN. “This work enhances the ability for farmers and ag retailers to bolster their stewardship reporting across many commodities, crops and commitments — and it cements the Truterra Insights Engine as a go-to, farm-to-fork solution for food companies who turn to the Fieldprint Platform to track sustainability results achieved in the field.”

Available to both commodity producers and their trusted advisors across the LOLS network in mid-December, the common measurement framework offered by Field to Market will offer even greater depth to the Truterra Insights Engine’s ability to assist farmers in documenting their stewardship and exploring opportunities for continuous improvement. By utilizing one of the industry’s most-accepted sustainability framework, the integration of Field to Market’s sustainability metrics provides commodity crop producers and the supply chain with a seamless solution for assessing sustainability performance as well as documenting and demonstrating stewardship at the field and landscape level.

With this week’s announcement, the Fieldprint® Application Programming Interface will connect eight sustainability metrics and associated algorithms from Field to Market’s Fieldprint Platform directly to Truterra, providing farmers with an enhanced tool to assess their management practices against regional, state and national benchmarks for key sustainability indicators.

LOLS has also announced a partnership with global ingredient supplier Tate & Lyle to advance conservation practices on Midwest farms — specifically in sourcing sustainable corn. The relationship enables Tate & Lyle, a significant user of US-grown corn, to enhance sustainable agriculture by helping corn farmers target and measure the impact of their environmental stewardship efforts, using the latest technology.

This collaboration also leverages the Truterra™ Insights Engine, which will allow Tate & Lyle greater visibility into its environmental footprint beyond the factory gates, enabling the company and its customers to make informed decisions about their supply chain environmental strategies.

“This collaboration bolsters Tate & Lyle’s efforts to increase sustainability throughout the value chain, using the industry-leading Truterra Insights Engine,” Carstens said. “Our on-farm conservation practices and technology support a two-pronged approach to sustainability — helping protect natural resources while improving farmer livelihoods. Consumers care deeply about how their food is produced. Land O’Lakes SUSTAIN can aid in implementing specific conservation practices to achieve broader sustainability goals for food companies like Tate & Lyle — and help them demonstrate the results in clear terms.”

“At Tate & Lyle, we recognize our responsibilities when it comes to environmental stewardship and, with this partnership, we are strengthening the sustainability of our agricultural supply chain,” said Jim Stutelberg, President of Primary Products. “By utilizing the expertise and network of Land O’Lakes SUSTAIN and employing the Truterra Insights Engine, we can build on the great work farmers are already doing to care for the air, land and water, and partner and provide greater visibility to drive sustainability in our business.”

Farmers are supported through the LOLS agricultural retailer network in the Midwest, including Ceres Solutions, a leading agricultural retailer in Indiana. Well-known retailers such as these are trusted advisors to farmers and are well positioned to provide insights and information to farmers to enable them to make meaningful changes to their ways of working, spreading best practice throughout the farming community.

“True sustainability starts on the farm,” said Betsy Bower, agronomist at Ceres Solutions. “In order to deliver large-scale corporate sustainability commitments, we need to work with the farmer on every acre in a way that works for them and their business. Utilizing the Truterra Insights Engine through partnerships like this one make scalable impact possible. Together, we continuously adapt to improve the delicate balance between productivity, profit and preservation.”

The Truterra Insights Engine is designed to facilitate collaboration and impact throughout the industry. The full suite of the Truterra offering uses technology and collaboration to advance the food and agricultural industry’s ability to enable conservation at scale across a variety of crops, commodities and commitments.","Land O’Lakes is the first partner that will integrate fully with the latest version of Field to Market’s Fieldprint Platform, released this month.

185,https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/blog/2018/Large-ocean-states-pave-the-way-to-the-2030Agenda.html,"Thu, 01 Nov 2018 07:00:00 GMT",UNDP,"Finance, partnerships and innovation: Large ocean states pave the way to the 2030 Agenda","Small Island Developing States’ (SIDS) communities have long been blessed with vast ocean and island resources, inspiring rich heritages and cultures. But this geography also exposes them to common challenges, vulnerabilities, indebtedness and dependencies that make their paths towards sustainable development even more complex.

For this reason, nations gathered in Samoa at the 2014 International Conference on SIDS reaffirmed commitments to the sustainable development of SIDS, identifying 17 priority action areas to help achieve the 2030 Agenda. These priorities range from climate change, to sustainable and inclusive economic growth, gender equality and partnerships.

This week I joined the implementation progress review of the Samoa pathway, which emphasizes concerted actions at the national, regional and global levels. These action areas mirror the common vulnerabilities and challenges SIDS face and provide guidance for the needed joint actions thereafter.

The landscape of SIDS’ vulnerabilities is constantly changing along with the world’s development dynamics. In the recent special report by the IPCC, the vulnerabilities of SIDS were projected to be significantly exacerbated by a 1.5 C warmer climate - threatening SIDS population’s health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, infrastructure, human security, cultural heritages and economic growth.

The anticipated decline of marine fisheries of 3 million metric tons per degree warming would have serious impacts for the Indo-Pacific region and the Arctic. Yet, simultaneously, various development opportunities are in play to help mitigate vulnerabilities and dependencies. Tourism, one of the world’s fastest growing sectors, is becoming the main economic activity for many SIDS, creating employment and generating income and foreign exchange earnings that are equivalent to over 20 percent of GDP in two fifths of the SIDS (where data is available).

Additional public sources of environmental financing, such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF), are also changing SIDS’ state of affairs. In June 2018, 15 projects totalling $786 million, or 21.4 percent of the total GCF approved funding, began implementation. The projects will increase SIDS’ resilience to the environment and economic shocks and improve the management of their natural resources.

It is critical to recognize that today’s SIDS have evolved away from 2014’s SIDS. Through innovation and the amalgamation of technologies, SIDS are paving a way towards enhanced productivity, resilience and inclusion, by turning some of the challenges they face into opportunities and re-conceptualizing the traditional perceptions of SIDS. The ideas of “smallness” and “remoteness” of SIDS are giving rise to “agility,” “potentiality,” and what we call “large ocean states.”

Utilizing innovative financing mechanisms – Caribbean and Pacific SIDS are leveraging resources from visitor entry fees to safeguard marine protected areas. For example, Belize’s tourism entry fees amount to more than $2 million to fund conservation projects; Palau utilizes fees to improve wastewater management, thereby protecting coral reefs.

The blue economy approach is being tested and implemented across several SIDS, seeking to balance growth with sustainability. The Seychelles launched the ‘Blue Bond’ to leverage capital markets to fund ocean-related environmental projects, moving beyond the usual trade-offs between economy and the environment and strengthening the country’s artisanal fisheries sector to attract new investments.

When taking the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) into account, SIDS’ vast ocean spaces - on average 28 times more than their land space, or in the Cook Islands’ case, 7500 times more than the land space - can bring a significant source of nutrition and revenue from sustainable harvesting of marine resources, thus contributing to inclusive economic growth and development.

With the concept of “smart” taking the world by storm, SIDS are showing initiatives of “smart islands” and “smart nations.” Following Singapore’s example, Mauritius, in early 2018, launched its Smart City Scheme for the Moka region. It offers modern and multicultural living and business facilities and is leading by example on building sustainable, inclusive and resilient cities as well as liveable smart nations.

Regionalism plays an important role in this evolution, as shared responsibilities, challenges, complex vulnerabilities and opportunities within a SIDS region can often foster joint efforts to innovate towards the SAMOA Pathway.

The Pacific SIDS concurrently adhered to the Pacific Roadmap for Sustainable Development as a regional approach to the need to boost partnership and innovation to implement the various global agreements on sustainable development such as the 2030 Agenda and the SAMOA Pathway.

In the Atlantic, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean and South China Sea (AIMS) region, SIDS are looking beyond Overseas Development Aassistance to increase domestic investments, foreign direct investment (FDI) and private sector engagement, while considering influences on debt sustainability.

In the Caribbean region, initiatives to address high debt and fiscal stress, such as debt-for-climate swaps, were welcomed within the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). The CARICOM Strategic Plan 2015-2019 and the business plan for the UN agencies in the Caribbean are fully aligned with the SAMOA Pathway priorities.

Fulfilling the call of the SAMOA Pathway, in the next four years, will require stronger partnerships and a renewed impetus to work together. UNDP has been privileged to be part of the many partnerships working with SIDS – with large coalitions such as the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and the Global Island Partnership (GLISPA), with regional organizations and agencies such as CARICOM and the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, and with funding architectures such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Least Developed Country Fund (LDCF), Adaptation Fund, the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and other multilateral and bilateral donors, to name but a few.

South-South and North-South Partnership will remain crucial for SIDS as we continue to pursue the key tenant of the SAMOA Pathway – Durable Partnership for SIDS. A laudable initiative in this regard is the SIDS Center of Excellence for Sustainable Development of SIDS in Aruba, established in 2015, as a partnership between the Government of Aruba, UNDP and the Kingdom of Netherlands. The Centre of Excellence aims to leverage best practices and provide a platform for strengthening innovation in areas such as energy, public-private partnerships (PPP), water management, environment, tourism and health.

At the global, regional and national levels, UNDP renews its commitment to continue the partnerships and policy and programming support that are instrumental in accelerating progress towards the SAMOA Pathways. We stand ready to continue to work with SIDS to address the structural challenges they face and pave a road towards sustainable development through enhancing resilience, productivity and inclusion.","Small Island Developing States’ (SIDS) communities have long been blessed with vast ocean and island resources, inspiring rich heritages and cultures.

When Marvel’s Black Panther film released to record-setting audiences, the Electoral Justice Project saw an opportunity. Looking to advance its mission of “building black political power,” the organization launched #WakandaTheVote. The campaign built on the film’s powerful themes of community empowerment and cultural celebration, and provided organizers around the United States with tools to reach potential voters at screenings. The result: events everywhere from Dallas to Durham to register thousands of people to vote.

The power of #WakandaTheVote rested not only on using an incredibly entertaining story, but also on smart division of labor. Electoral Justice Project could have spent thousands of dollars producing videos about voting. Instead, it leveraged an existing multi-million-dollar film and invested in the organizing infrastructure around it—ultimately reaching its target audience at scale.

We know that storytelling is one of the most powerful tools we have for activating people. Effective stories transport us into the world of their characters; they leave room for us to insert our own experiences, and can overwrite bias and assumptions with details and counternarratives.

The social sector is investing in storytelling. But just telling stories is not enough. Many organizations struggle to produce compelling stories that actually move people. Meanwhile, many storytellers wrestle with how best to mobilize audiences who are hungry to act. What if we combined the superpowers of these worlds? As we increasingly embrace the power of storytelling, we don’t just need to tell better stories, we need better partnerships.

Step One: Use Science to Inform Strategy

The science of storytelling doesn’t just tell us what makes one story better than the next. It also tells us that to use stories to drive belief and behavior change, we need to bring together the right ingredients, including:

1. Identify a Target Community and Tell Stories That Connect to Who They Are

People consume information that is entertaining, reflects their existing beliefs, or helps them be a better version of themselves. So, if we want to effectively engage people on issues, we must share entertaining stories that connect to what our target community cares about. For example, the soon-to-be-released documentary Game Changers is a fast-paced film following the stories of different elite vegan athletes. By focusing on a shared area of passion, athletic performance, rather than ethical arguments, the film reframes a conversation about veganism to reach a whole new audience.

2. Choose the Right Storytelling

This starts with finding a great story that has the power to hold our target community’s attention. Research tells us that when a story effectively transports us into the world of its characters, it can actually change our beliefs and willingness to act.

When a story effectively transports us into the world of its characters, it can actually change our beliefs and willingness to act.

Furthermore, when selecting the right story, we need to make sure the emotions it elicits connect to our impact goals. Different emotions lead people to do different things. Fear makes people “fight or flee.” Awe makes us self-reflect and open up to new perspectives. It is important that we be intentional about choosing the right emotion, based on the nature of the issue and the intended call to action. For example, we know that humor can close psychological distance on tough issues. A study by Caty Borum Chattoo at American University found that when mobilizing new support to address global poverty, a comedic documentary was more effective than a somber one, because it elicited positive emotions people wanted to feel.

3. Find the Right Messengers for the Story

Research tells us that the messenger is the message. It is not enough to simply create a great story, post it to your website, and wait for the change to begin. We need to go where people are. YouTube’s Creators for Change is putting this principle into practice, supporting popular video content creators to fight hate speech and extremism. These creators are trusted messengers ideally positioned to bring new communities into this movement, and are now integrating messages of tolerance into new videos on topics ranging from makeup to travel.

4. Pair Important Stories With a Clear Call to Action

Calls to action should be specific rather than abstract, allow people to feel like their action will make a real difference, and be something people actually know how to do. #WakandaTheVote was effective because the Electoral Justice Project went to where their target audience was and provided a concrete, meaningful, and actionable call to action: register to vote.

Step Two: Cast the Right Characters

Given all these critical ingredients for building an effective storytelling strategy, it’s not surprising that it is difficult to get it right. It is nearly impossible for any single actor to do all these things well. Should we expect a filmmaker to transform overnight into a world-class coalition builder? Or an advocacy organization to produce awe-inspiring stories? Of course not. Rather than looking to build a storytelling strategy alone, start with the catalyst ingredient: building better partnerships from the beginning.

We can look to film-based advocacy campaigns as bright spots on how to do this work well.

As we start to design campaigns that benefit from the power of stories, we can look to film-based advocacy campaigns as bright spots on how to do this work well. These campaigns show us that we need to include the right partners playing the right roles. This means thoughtfully casting the three leading characters: the storyteller, the strategic convener, and the funder.

The Storyteller

A great storytelling strategy needs a great storyteller. Not all content is created equal. Organizations frequently struggle to tell compelling stories that capture the attention of their target communities. Often when leaders ask teams to “embrace storytelling,” their teams develop new content too quickly, costing the advocacy world millions of dollars to produce stories people barely see.

At the same time, there is a whole industry of artists deeply dedicated to this craft. Documentary filmmakers, in particular, often follow a story and its characters for years at a time. In turn, they end up with a deeply visceral understanding of an issue, and can offer a refreshing perspective to building outreach and capturing the public imagination.

The storyteller role can do many different things. This person or group can identify the right stories, which can include sharing existing films, co-creating new cuts, and even producing new stories altogether. The storyteller can also be an authentic voice to speak to audiences, serve as a magnet to draw people out, and share first-hand testimony about an issue.

For example, Girl Rising is a feature film and global campaign for girls’ education. Playing the storyteller role, the documentary team worked closely with advocacy partners to produce a multi-million-dollar film that could bring different campaigns to life. The team cut shorter versions to highlight particular sub-themes and produced new short-form content featuring local voices to connect hundreds of organizations to beautiful, high-quality storytelling that would typically be out of reach.

The Strategic Convener

Great storytelling needs strategic thinking to know which audiences and which calls to action they can inspire. For example, let’s look at film-advocacy campaigns: With traditional film screening, a group invites their existing supporters to watch a movie. After the film plays, there is a panel discussion. Sometimes there is a call to action, usually to give money or sign something.

Film screenings to offer a new way to organize for impact. They can catalyze social movements and mobilize unlikely audiences to action. They can get the attention of leaders. They can build creative new coalitions, and in so doing, set-up the necessary conditions for political change.

Instead, strategic conveners can host film screenings to offer a new way to organize for impact. They can catalyze social movements and mobilize unlikely audiences to action. They can get the attention of leaders. They can build creative new coalitions, and in so doing, set-up the necessary conditions for political change. In short, they can advance all kinds of different organizing goals by embracing something we all love to do: go to the movies. But to do this well, someone needs to play the essential role of the strategic convener.

The strategic convener must deliberately design a strategy to utilize story to its fullest potential. As Crisis Action Network’s creative coalitions handbook puts it, this is a role where “you are part talent scout, part orchestra conductor, part sports team coach.”

Doing this well requires that the strategic convener identify a very specific change goal, develop meaningful calls to action, and find partners who can agree on this vision for change. The strategic convener must understand the power dynamics in a given issue area and artfully pull together a target community—whether local advocacy groups, lobbyists, community leaders, or media—in the right way.

The team at Participant Media, a social impact media company, often plays this role. It recently ran an impact campaign for its documentary RBG, which tells the origin story of US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. In collaboration with Magnolia Pictures and CNN Films, part of the campaign focused on mobilizing the legal community. Following screenings with law schools and law firms, discussions were held to identify actions the firms could take toward women’s equality, both within the organization and through pro bono work.

The person or group playing the strategic convener can vary, but whether it is a consulting “impact producer, ” an organizer within an advocacy group, or the social impact team at a film company, it is essential to intentionally fill this role from the beginning, at the hub of the effort.

The Funder

This brings us to the last character in our cast: the funder. Building stronger bridges between the art and advocacy worlds requires systems-level investment. Forward-looking funders can help create the time and capacity to develop not only one-off partnerships, but also a robust ecosystem of collaboration. Through smart investments, we can build and hone new creative models of partnership that realize the fullest possibilities of a storytelling strategy.

Lots of different groups can play this role. Philanthropists and foundations can fund campaigns and create expectations around better partnerships. Executive producers and supporters of great films can make sure to allocate funding to the film’s impact campaign. And advocacy organizations can designate funding for story-driven campaigns and events. Doc Society, a nonprofit dedicated to maximizing the impact of documentaries, does a great job of creating systems-level investment in creative coalitions. Through Good Pitch, the organization’s global series of one-day “pitch forums,” it connect storytellers with upcoming films to a network of potential strategic conveners and funders. In so doing, it provides the space for these characters to come together and build better partnerships.

Case Study: Chasing Coral’s #DearLegislator Tour

Casting the right characters was important to setting up the impact campaign for the Emmy-award winning film Chasing Coral (led by a co-author of this article). Using beautiful underwater imagery and a character-driven adventure narrative, the film brings audiences to a world hidden under the waves to make the impacts of climate change feel real and personal. In designing the film’s outreach strategy, the impact team focused on launching pilot campaigns in the US Southeast. As a production company, Exposure Labs plays the role of the storyteller and collaborates closely with the Conservation Voters of South Carolina (CVSC) as the strategic convener. The film’s executive producers—philanthropists looking to mobilize political action—play the role of funder.

The team started by outlining a shared change goal: pressuring state lawmakers to support clean energy policy. Moving toward this goal, CVSC is using the film to mobilize a network of local community partners and trusted messengers across a few target districts under the banner of the “Dear South Carolina” campaign. To support this work, the Chasing Coral team produced new local content and send cast members to events. Post-screening discussions connect the dots to specific local solutions: South Carolina’s own renewable energy possibilities. The call to action is for the audience to show their visible support for clean energy through public posters addressed to their local representative.

With dozens of events hosted by local messengers—including Republican politicians, church leaders, and military veterans—diverse constituents are coming out to watch Chasing Coral across the region. While the campaign is ongoing, it has already captured the attention of state lawmakers. Because they are hearing from atypical constituents not usually tied to environmental movements, these local legislators have attended screenings, and some have shifted their support for solar bills. Excited by the possibilities of a collaborative film-based outreach strategy, CVSC is now expanding outreach to veteran communities using a new film about military leadership in the clean energy transition: The Burden.

To benefit from the power of stories, organizations should look for opportunities to build bridges with unexpected allies in the creative community. We need people driven by the issue at hand to make strategic decisions about campaign goals, target audience, and calls to action. We need great storytellers who know how to craft a compelling and effective story. And, of course, we need better funding for this sort of storytelling innovation, which means an investment in better partnerships.","No single organization or individual can pull off an effective storytelling campaign alone.

Global health partnerships have had a disruptive, but largely positive, influence on global governance. But they are now facing pressure to change—should they stick to the specific causes for which they were established or take on a wider role in promoting healthy lives and wellbeing for all?

Global health partnerships are hybrid organisations in which private entities, civil society representatives, and, in some cases, communities affected by the targeted diseases have an equal say in decision making, alongside governments and international organisations. [1] Roll Back Malaria and Stop Tuberculosis started the trend, but the launch of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, in 2000 and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria in 2002 had the greatest effect.

Their influence is hard to dispute—an estimated 27 million lives have been saved by the Global Fund, halving the number of children missing out on vaccinations in Gavi supported countries. [2,3] The world’s sustained attention to the power of immunisation and the threat of AIDS, TB, and malaria owes a great deal to their advocacy. But how have they made global health governance what it is today?

They have increased the influence of civil society. Earmarked funding has made non-governmental organisations, civil society, and community organisations—and through them equity, gender, and rights—forces to be reckoned with. In addition, they have helped shape markets, reducing the cost of health commodities, although some argue they could have done more, particularly for vaccines. [4] But there is also the disruption that didn’t happen. The idea of creating hybrid funds was to attract more private finance into global health, but despite ventures into innovative financing, most funding for both partnerships still comes from governments.

Their focus on results—lives saved and deaths averted—has been widely influential. It is a major selling point for their own investors, but of more dubious value when adopted uncritically by organisations with a broader repertoire, such as the World Health Organization (WHO).

They have provided a new model welcomed by bilateral donors: major disbursements through single transactions, ample opportunities to claim credit for success, and political distance at the first hint of corruption. And they have changed the balance of power in the multilateral system. Established as financing instruments, the intention was that the global partnerships would depend on partners from the United Nations to support implementation. In practice the reverse is true. UN organisations like Unicef and WHO are increasingly dependent on Gavi and the Global Fund—a strategic risk not dissimilar to their dependence on polio funding.

Lastly, partnerships have often distorted national spending priorities, but this is arguably only because other areas of health remain substantially underfunded. In low income countries grants disbursed on time sometimes give health workers their first experience of actually implementing something they have had a hand in planning. They have contributed to fragmentation. But we mustn’t forget that most government contributors still run separate bilateral programmes, the UN Development System hardly operates as a seamless whole, and a growing number of new donors seek visibility and attribution. The real problem is that donor funding for global health incentivises competition over collaboration.

Looking to the future, partnerships are under pressure to change to support universal health coverage and achievement of the health sustainable development goals, to strengthen health systems, to promote domestic financing for health, to break down disease focused silos, and to avoid duplicative financial replenishments. Some would argue that this calls for greater breadth and consolidation, but this will be resisted by constituencies committed to sustaining the partnerships’ core mission. Multi-stakeholder governance—a key innovation—has brought many benefits, but it risks gridlock and immobility. The key question is whether innovative governance can facilitate long term strategic decision making or whether the availability of donor financing will once again be the deciding factor. It would be sadly ironic if the future of global partnerships was determined by one of the main problems that their founders sought to overcome—the vagaries of donor financing. The fate of repeated attempts to streamline decision making in the Global Fund do not give great cause for optimism.

Evolving every day, strategic partnerships in the cannabis market are helping to shape the industry.

The spreading legalization of both medical and recreational cannabis here in North America and abroad is allowing the cannabis industry to advance both in terms of clinical research and technological innovation, from cultivation practices to cannabinoid delivery systems. At the same time the growing global health and wellness trend is opening up new market segments for downstream cannabis products.

Within this shifting paradigm, licensed producers are partnering with biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and health and wellness companies as well as other cannabis-based companies to develop new cannabis delivery technologies and beneficial cannabis consumer products. For example, Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB,TSX:ACB) recently partnered with Evio Beauty Group to collaboratively develop a line of hempseed oil product formulations and CBD-infused cosmetics. The partnership will give both companies increased brand recognition and cross-selling opportunities.

Licensed producer Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) has partnered with Sandoz Canada, a subsidiary of one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies, Novartis (NYSE:NVS) to produce co-branded cannabis-based medical products such as gel caps and sprays for wholesale distribution to Canadian hospitals and pharmacies. Downstream cannabis extraction company MediPharm Labs (TSXV:LABS) recently entered into a strategic partnership with licensed producer Emerald Health Therapeutics (TSXV:EMH,OTCQX:EMHTF) in which Emerald will provide MediPharm with dried cannabis to create premium quality pharmaceutical grade cannabis oil.

High-margin cannabis consumer product market

Today’s cannabis market is moving well beyond big leafy buds as consumers are increasingly interested in alternative consumption methods to smoking dried flower. Cannabis legalization in Canada and many jurisdictions in the United States has led to growth in not only the medical marijuana and recreational adult-use markets — the health and wellness market now represents a third pillar in the global cannabis industry. The global health and wellness market reached a reported $3.7 trillion in 2016 and is expected to grow by 17 percent over the next five years, and cannabis infused products have the potential to play a significant role in that growth.

Whether medical, recreational or health and wellness, the overall cannabis industry is being shaped in large part by downstream cannabis product developers and consumers looking for new ways to integrate the plant’s many benefits into an active and healthy lifestyle. Cannabis product companies are already leveraging consumer desire for more health-conscious and discrete methods of cannabis consumption by offering an increasingly diverse range of cannabis infused products, including cosmetics, sports-recovery shakes, pet care, pain-relieving patches, sleep-inducing sublingual sprays, THC-loaded gummies, anxiety-relieving CBD oils, sex-enhancing topical creams, cereals and meal-replacement bars, and CBD-infused ice teas.

With the emergence of the legal adult-use market, analysts expect cannabis product innovation to continue on an even larger scale. In the North American cannabis retail market alone, sales of cannabis-based products are forecast to increase to $20.2 billion in 2021 from $6.7 billion last year, according to Arcview Market Research.

Beneficial strategic partnerships in the cannabis market

Cannabis product companies that can supply the medical, recreational and health and wellness markets early on will be strategically positioned as key players in the evolving global cannabis market. As the companies look to better position themselves to take advantage of this opportunity, strategic partnerships in the cannabis market are becoming increasingly popular, and they have many benefits for both partners.

By entering into strategic alliances with licensed producers, downstream cannabis product companies can obtain access to licenses, an established distribution network, as well as the expertise and knowledge of the management team. In over-supplied markets, licensed producers can ensure their flower will not be rotting away waiting for a buyer, but rather go into high margin cannabis consumer products. Brands with marketable cannabis products can partner with licensed producers as a way to enter a new market, either in North America or internationally, which can give both players a lucrative advantage over competitors. These partnerships can provide access to intellectual property and market share, as well as opportunities for further expansion. And product diversification can enhance competitiveness, profitability and brand recognition.

Companies producing downstream cannabis products can vertically-integrate their operations by partnering with a licensed producer on site, cutting costs and controlling product quality. Pharmaceutical company Canntab Therapeutics (CSE:PILL) has a collaborative partnership in place with licensed producer FSD Pharma Inc. (CSE:HUGE). FSD Pharma is providing Canntab with 10,000 square feet of space in its Cobourg facility in return for profit-sharing and the development of a line of cannabis oral dose delivery platforms and other types of cannabis-based products, such as sleep aids and pain relievers. Canntab’s co-location agreement with FSD Pharma also gives them access to the expertise of the World Class Extractions team also onsite as well as their extract products for use in Canntab’s manufacturing process.

“Co-locating with FSD Pharma allows us to differ capital costs but also reduces the footprint of our processes. You can imagine the headache of trying to move large amounts of cannabis material between two locations. Everything under one roof. Costs are minimized as we share space and processes are streamlined as we reduce transportation distances to 0. Having an unbroken chain also helps us satisfy the pharmaceutical standards we must respect,” Canntab CEO Jeff Renwick told Investing News Network. “Once we have the products we can then turn to FSD Pharma to complete the sales, at least until we have our own license application approved which could be as early as mid 2019.”

Canntab has also partnered with another Canadian licensed producer, Emblem Corp (TSXV:EMC,OTCQX:EMMBF), giving Emblem the exclusive right to utilize Canntab’s Extended Release (XR) cannabis tablets in Canada. These proprietary time-released tablets are designed to release a predetermined and consistent dose of cannabinoids over an extended period of time, giving the consumer longer lasting relief while reducing the worry of side effects.

Phivida Holdings Inc (CSE:VIDA,OTCQX:PHVAF) is partnered with WeedMD Inc. (TSXV:WMD,OTCMKTS:WDDMF, FSE:4WE) to develop and operate Cannabis Beverages Inc. (CanBev) at WeedMD’s greenhouse facility in Strathroy, Ontario. The agreement includes product development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of cannabis-infused beverages for Canada and export to licensed international markets. “The Phivida team is excited to contribute our management, expertise and product knowledge to the CanBev joint venture,” said Jim Bailey, CEO and President of Phivida. “WeedMD is an ideal partner for Phivida and we are thrilled to bring our cannabinoid-infused beverages and brands back home to Canada. WeedMD provides CanBev with solid infrastructure, strong management, world-class genetics and proven success in the Canadian healthcare market.”

These strategic partnerships in the cannabis market can also help companies establish a presence in growing global markets. An established player in the US, Nutritional High (CSE:EAT,OTCQB:SPLIF,FWB:2NU) was able to enter the Canadian market via a strategic partnership with licensed producer Canada House (CSE:CHV). Through Canada House, Nutritional High is able to sell it’s FLÏ brand, gaining a foothold in the Canadian market.

MYM Nutraceutical’s (CSE:MYM) deal with Amsterdam-based Dutch Passion Seed Company is another good example of strategic partnership with an international edge. MYM has inked a series of production and distribution deals for Dutch Passion branded products and seed genetics in Canada, Australia and Colombia — benefiting the global expansion goals of both companies. “As legal production of cannabis has been rapidly increasing worldwide, so has the demand for seed genetics,” said Rob Gietl, CEO of MYM. “The Dutch Passion portfolio of seeds will prove to be a very valuable asset to MYM and its shareholders.”

Takeaway

As global demand for cannabis products continues to grow, more companies are pursuing strategic partnerships in the cannabis market which will allow their brands to establish a foothold in fast-growing markets. These relationships have significant benefits for both partners as well as providing their investors with better leverage to a global cannabis market with the potential to reach nearly $194 billion by 2025.

These companies will be able to bid on delivering science and technology payloads for NASA, including payload integration and operations, launching from Earth and landing on the surface of the Moon. NASA expects to be one of many customers that will use these commercial landing services.

“Today’s announcement marks tangible progress in America’s return to the Moon’s surface to stay,” said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. “The innovation of America’s aerospace companies, wedded with our big goals in science and human exploration, are going to help us achieve amazing things on the Moon and feed forward to Mars.”

The selected companies are:

Astrobotic Technology, Inc.: Pittsburgh

Deep Space Systems: Littleton, Colorado

Draper: Cambridge, Massachusetts

Firefly Aerospace, Inc.: Cedar Park, Texas

Intuitive Machines, LLC: Houston

Lockheed Martin Space: Littleton, Colorado

Masten Space Systems, Inc.: Mojave, California

Moon Express: Cape Canaveral, Florida

Orbit Beyond: Edison, New Jersey

NASA’s Science Mission Directorate (SMD) initiated the request for proposals leading to these selections as the first step in achieving a variety of science and technology objectives that could be addressed by regularly sending instruments, experiments and other small payloads to the Moon. SMD serves as the NASA interface between the agency’s mission directorates, the scientific community, and other external stakeholders in developing a strategy to enable an integrated approach for robotic and human exploration within NASA’s Moon to Mars Exploration Campaign.

The Commercial Lunar Payload Services contracts are indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts with a combined maximum contract value of $2.6 billion during the next 10 years. The agency will look at a number of factors when comparing the bids, such as technical feasibility, price and schedule.

Lunar payloads could fly on these contracted missions as early as 2019. In October, NASA issued a call for potential lunar instruments and technologies to study the Moon, with proposals due in January. These early missions will enable important technology demonstrations that will inform the development of future landers and other exploration systems needed for humans to return to the lunar surface, and help prepare the agency to send astronauts to explore Mars.

NASA will re-examine the private market periodically for new and emerging lunar delivery capabilities, and may offer additional companies an opportunity to join Commercial Lunar Payload Services through a contract process called on-ramping.

Many public policy initiatives in recent years have included population health measures as a key component of optimizing the performance of the US health care system. While such traditional, incentive-based government programs have increased awareness of the importance of population health, truly meaningful change to the US health care system will require reorganization of the structures of care across populations. Broad, lasting improvements across the medical, social, and economic determinants of health will require innovative thinking and the formation of nontraditional partnerships. We provide examples of novel and effective partnerships that have recently been established between health care providers, patients, commercial insurance companies, government entities, academic researchers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, local community organizations, and other stakeholders.

The discipline of population health has seen a meteoric rise in popularity and attention in the last 15 years since Kindig and Stoddart sought to clarify the term

in 20031:

We propose that population health as a concept of health be defined as “the health outcomes of

a group of individuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group.” These groups are often geographic populations such as nations

or communities, but can also be other groups such as employees, ethnic groups, disabled persons,

or prisoners.

In 2008, improving population health was identified by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement as part of the Triple Aim for improving the US health care system, along with improving the experience of care and reducing per capita costs of health care.2 Similarly, in 2011, the improvement of population health was included as a key goal of the National Quality Strategy, which was established as a result of the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).3 As the United States grapples with trying to improve our health care system, the solution is founded on reorganizing systems of care for populations.

Population health goes beyond medical care, extending into the nonmedical determinants of health, their impact on health outcomes, and potential interventions to impact them. The key determinants of health are genetics, social circumstances, environmental conditions, behavioral choices, and medical care.4 Because medical care only contributes an estimated 10% to outcomes,4 organizations have begun to think beyond health care delivery to identify ways to improve population health. Additionally, since people spend the majority of their time outside of contact with health care systems, it is imperative to identify opportunities to engage patients between medical care encounters.

Diverse Stakeholder Efforts

Numerous policies and experimental value-based care performance programs have been put into place to align incentives, stimulate new behaviors, and create systems to achieve these goals. For providers, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) brought forward 2 tracks of participation through the Merit-Based Incentive Payments System (MIPS) and alternative payment models (APMs).5 The Medicare Star Ratings program introduced rewards for payers that can provide high-quality care for their populations.6 Both private and public accountable care organization constructs are designed to engage and align health systems around value-based contracts.

Additionally, hospital organizations with 501(c)(3) federal tax exemption status are required to complete a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) as part of the ACA. Aimed at addressing population health challenges, this provision requires such hospitals to assess the social and economic condition of the community and to determine how the community perceives its health status and health care needs.7 This outreach and engagement can enable the identification of the major risk factors and causes of health problems, which can then be used to develop a strategy and an implementation plan to address the identified needs. Finally, CHNAs are publicly reported along with the progress made toward addressing those needs, which provides transparency and accountability.

With each of these programs, systems and incentives have been put in place to align health care stakeholders around value-based care. Providers, health systems, and payers each assume key responsibilities to reorganize care. Robust and monumental change to a complex system requires coordinated effort across broad and diverse stakeholder groups. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states the following about population health, which goes beyond alignment and further specifies partnerships8:

[P]opulation health [is] an interdisciplinary, customizable approach that allows health departments to connect practice to policy for change to happen locally. This approach utilizes non-traditional partnerships among different sectors of the community—public health, industry, academia, healthcare, local government entities, etc.—to achieve positive health outcomes.

Whether health departments or other constituents take the lead, lasting change across health and the social and economic determinants of health represented in broad-based population health will require not only joint effort but also innovation and nontraditional partnerships. It is these interdisciplinary, interconnected partnerships that are the pathway to population health; when all parties can align and contribute, collective organizations are strengthened for improved health care.

What’s more, 61% of businesses can’t say that they have a digital marketing strategy that is aligned to strategic business objectives and supported by their CEO.

This is particularly shocking when compared to the fact that almost four in five UK adults are regular online shoppers, and UK consumers are increasingly turning to digital channels for research and to buy - 49% of consumers are purchasing through social platforms.

The upshot of all of this? If you’re still struggling with your digital plans for 2019 then it’s time to prioritise getting this sorted!

Content is king!

What are you trying to achieve with your digital strategy? The chances are it’s either driving new business, growing overall online revenue, increasing client/customer retention or a combination of all three. In order to deliver on these, you need people to find your brand online, and then you need to deliver value that results in engagement and, hopefully, sales. What is core to all of these – quality content.

We’re seeing major content brands turn to affiliate, but also have seen brands of all strengths and sizes grow their content teams and skill sets. The merge of content production and monetization strategies isn’t new, but the fact that Buzzfeed, Hearst and others have launched affiliate specific brands in 2018, shows how this is taking off in a big way.

Quality content gives your users a reason to come to your site and, crucially, a reason to stay. Whether you’re a brand offering content that sits further up the funnel than product specific info, or a news site looking to offer detailed reviews, solid content can be worth its (virtual) weight in gold. When it comes to your 2019 digital strategy, it’s well worth putting some solid thinking time into your content plan, whether this actually gives users what they want and how this will deliver to your commercial goals.

Partnering for the win

The digital landscape is an increasingly crowded space with thousands of brands competing, often across the same platforms, for the same eyeballs. More than 60% of marketing spend is now digital with brands ploughing £12 billion into their online ad budgets in 2018.

More brands in the space means more competition for the same inventory. Without careful thought, the only people benefitting from this are the Googles and Facebooks of this world (who, for record, are forecast to pocket £5bn and £2.5bn from UK businesses in 2019 respectively).

While I’m not necessarily advocating pulling back from these channels, what I am saying is that a smart strategic play into 2019 might be to look at partnerships. Decision Tech has long been a believer that there is room for several players in any given market, and strategic partnerships can be great for mutual growth. It’s for this reason that we have powered comparison technology for brands like Compare the Market, Go Compare and MSE for the best part of a decade. By looking at synergistic partnerships as part of your digital plan for 2019, you may well be able to grow audiences and digital revenues without a chunky increase in spent to the usual suspects.

192,https://cvilletomorrow.org/articles/county-plans-for-public-private-partnerships-move,"Tue, 06 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Charlottesville Tomorrow,County plans for public-private partnerships move forward,"At a joint meeting Monday, the Albemarle County Board of Supervisors and the county School Board continued their discussion of policy changes that would allow the county to develop school and community facilities through public-private partnerships.

“As we evolve this community, as we entertain economic development, as we encounter more complex projects, [public-private partnerships] really begin to make sense,” said Bill Letteri, the county’s chief finance officer. “Adopting guidelines that set us up to entertain these things, without a commitment, seems to be a prudent way forward.”

Virginia’s Public-Private Education and Infrastructure Act enables the state and local governments to authorize private entities to develop or operate qualifying projects with public funding. It allows projects to be delivered in a “design-build” form that bundles both design and construction into one procurement and contract.

In a traditional “design-bid-build” procurement process, a public entity first engages a design firm to produce construction drawings and technical specifications for a project. After that, the public entity accepts contractors’ bids to build the project for a guaranteed price.

“As you get into these projects, sometimes fingers are pointed — that the design wasn’t right, that the contractor missed this or that,” Letteri said.

Under the PPEA, private developers must submit detailed proposals for projects, with or without a formal solicitation from a government entity.

Letteri said being open to the possibility of unsolicited proposals would invite “creative new ideas and innovation that can come from different design teams.”

Supervisor Ned Gallaway said the county would have to reserve some funding for attractive unsolicited proposals.

“If you have 10 projects planned, … and the 11th one comes in [as a proposal] that everyone thinks is a good idea, how do you fund it?” Gallaway said. “We have to prepare for that kind of scenario.”

The government involved in a PPEA project must provide a public comment period of at least 30 days before entering an agreement. After receiving an unsolicited proposal, the government entity must accept competing proposals for at least 45 days after the original submittal.

Letteri said localities should always be clear about their goals for PPEA projects and how much they are willing to spend. He said it also is important to remember private-sector partners will expect to profit from the arrangement.

“Transparency also is an issue,” Letteri said. “If you have too many closed-door discussions, people will be suspicious of the program or shift their support.”

In order to pursue PPEA projects, local governments and school divisions must adopt their own ordinances with guidelines for public-private partnerships and unsolicited proposals.

Letteri said at least 100 PPEA projects have been completed or are underway statewide. Numerous localities have entered public-private partnerships for school projects, including Stafford and Chesterfield counties and the city of Falls Church.

Roger Johnson, Albemarle’s economic development director, said that some of Albemarle’s land-use plans could be realized through public-private partnerships that allow schools to be built as part of mixed-use developments.

“If the land can have some private uses, it can prevent future sprawl and increase tax revenue,” he said.

Gallaway said Albemarle’s future school buildings could be well-suited for mixed-use developments.

County schools recently leased space in the Seminole Place industrial facility for its new high school student center, Albemarle Tech. The division plans to eventually construct multiple satellite centers devoted to project-based learning and work experiences for high school students.

“We are starting to reconceive what school spaces are,” Gallaway said.

The School Board’s five-year capital improvement program request includes $35.1 million for a 600-student high school center that would open for the 2021-22 school year.

Johnson said it usually takes 4½ to 6 years to see a complex PPEA project to completion, depending on whether the locality owns the project site.

Rosalyn Schmitt, the school division’s chief operating officer, did not recommend pursuing a public-private partnership for the first planned high school center. The school system already has issued a request for proposals to design the center.

“We have too many kids at Albemarle High School,” School Board Chairwoman Kate Acuff said. “If we talk about 55 months, it starts getting quite hairy.”

The School Board members and supervisors briefly discussed the idea of building school facilities in the opportunity zones created by the Republican tax overhaul in 2017.

The opportunity zones and funds allow investors to receive tax benefits on currently unrealized capital gains by investing those gains in specific economically-depressed census tracts.

“If someone wishes to invest in that area with capital gains funds, they can do so and not pay capital gains taxes for 10 years,” Johnson said.

Two opportunity zones are located in Albemarle: one around Fifth Street Extended south of Charlottesville and another in the semicircle created by Hydraulic Road and Rio Road on the western side of U.S. 29.

Supervisor Diantha McKeel recommended adopting a local ordinance for the PPEA by the end of the year. She said this would at least make it possible for the county to receive unsolicited proposals for the first high school center.

“It’s a good thing to try for,” McKeel said. “I think that’s where the opportunity zone plays in.”

The School Board is scheduled to give early input on its budget for the next fiscal year at its regular meeting on Thursday.","At a joint meeting Monday, the Albemarle County Board of Supervisors and the county School Board continued their discussion of policy changes that would allow the county to develop school and community facilities through public-private partnerships.

Discover Financial Services is known to many as a credit card processor, but Roger Hochschild, the new president and CEO, sees the company playing a partnership role to many of the smaller, emerging financial networks. Partnership was a recurring theme as Hochschild shared his vision for the company during the Money20/20 conference in Las Vegas.

Interviewed by Jordan McKee, research director at 451 Research, Hochschild said his vision for the company is to be a leading direct bank and payments processor as banking moves from branches to digital. At a time when fintechs are bringing a lot of innovation to financial services, Hochschild said the company plans to focus on innovation that adds value to both partners and customers.

While Hochschild is excited about many of the innovations taking place today, such as electronic wallets and P2P payments, he sees his company's biggest opportunity in direct banking. While fintechs are bringing new tools to the table, businesses and consumers are still looking for a bank they can trust.

""The winning product is the one that will add value for consumers,"" he said. This is important to keep in mind, he said, as technology continues to offer new capabilities.

Notably missing from Hochschild's remarks was any of the concern Discover Card executives expressed over the summer about industry competition and pricing in the personal loan business. One reason could be the company's track record that gives it a strong competitive standing.

""They are a very well substantiated company and their lending business is doing well,"" Kevin Morrison, a senior analyst at Aite Group, told Mobile Payments Today. ""At the end of the day, it comes down to underwriting and risk, and what kind of margin you need to make on that business. They've been doing it forever, so I think they have a very good model.""

""It makes sense that it's an area of concern,"" Morrison, added. ""Now you have people like SoFi and others who are heavily marketing personal loans.""

While he exuded optimism, Hochschild was quick to note that economies undergo positive and negative cycles, and one of his goals is to make sure that Discover positions itself to weather the next downturn. Companies prepared for downturns are better positioned to invest for the future. On this count, he noted Discover has performed well in the past.

""We do truly have a unique collection of assets,"" Hochschild noted, citing the company's suite of consumer banking products in addition to its credit card services.

Focus on partnerships

Hochschild insisted that Discover's technology ensures its flexibility as a financial partner and its ability to take a customized approach to different markets. The goal of these partnerships, he said, is to pursue mutual success. Discover has for years partnered with merchant acquirers, a focus that Hochschild said will continue.

For example, he said he wants to ""widen the aperture"" of EMVCo, a partnership which also includes American Express, Mastercard, UnionPay Visa and JCB, that facilitates the global interoperability and acceptance of payment systems.

Morrison agrees that Discover has done a good job with partnerships in the payment services side of their business, and he's anxious to see what they do in the direct banking side of the business.

""They have that model that I think sets them apart in the industry,"" he said, referring to the ability to bring direct banking and merchant payment services in one organization. ""I think it will be interesting to see how they leverage that infrastructure and business model going forward.""

""They have room to grow, and I think there are some markets out there that they will be able to invest in,"" he said, adding that he is curious to see whether their next steps are in acquisitions or partnerships.

While he did not wish to reveal a lot about the specific partnerships the company is working on at present, Hochschild pointed to the company's track record.

Apple selected Discover to leverage Apple Pay Cash, which allows consumers to make purchases in stores, in apps and on the web, with merchants, he noted. The Discover Network payment network handles Apple Pay Cash transactions. Discover has also partnered with PayPal, Venmo, Synchrony Bank and SAP, he added.

As financial services become increasingly global, Discover plans to play in a more global economy, Hochschild said, as it looks to work with global merchant acquirers. Here is an area where he sees a role for network-to-network partnerships.

Local payment networks are emerging worldwide, he said. Discover's role will be to enable these local networks to maintain their own brands but provide them with good technology, such as EMV compliant hardware. In many countries, such as India, governments are supporting the development of payment networks.

Hochschild does not downplay the challenges that global networks present. There are cases in which a local network uses a technology that is not compatible with more broadly used networks.

Discover looks for partners that take a long-term perspective on financial services. ""You don't want to work with people that have a short-term technology,"" he said. In addition, it is important to find partners that present a good cultural fit.

Electronic wallets emerge

Hochschild echoed numerous other conference speakers in pointing to the rise of electronic wallets as a major force in financial services. He envisions more merchant-specific wallets.

""It's all about enhancing the functionality beyond the payment,"" Hochschild said. In saying this, he does not discount the contributions of the dominant networks, noting that electronic wallets have been successful leveraging the existing networks.

Not all aspects of electronic wallets are exciting to people, he said, but the wallets are bringing a lot of time saving conveniences. He related the ease he experienced in buying a transit ticket with Apple Pay.

While digital wallets are growing, Hochschild insisted that credit cards aren't going away. He expects P2P tools will find their way into the B2C space, but they won't displace credit and debit cards.

Asked about the secure remote commerce protocol that EMVCo proposed last year for e-commerce, Hochschild said there is a clear consumer benefit. While the SRC has not been supported by all merchants, Hochschild said the protocol is still in its early stage.

Asked what makes Discover a good company to work with, Hochschild pointed to the company's culture, which instills a companywide focus on customer experience. He noted the company pioneered email alerts for payments in the late 1990s and also took a pioneer role in online payments.

Veterans are often ideal Information Technology employees, as they are easily adaptable, very trainable, and bring 'soft' skills to the table, which may be rare among their peers. [Image: K_E_N, iStockPhoto]

Imagine that you’re a college-educated worker with experience in your field, but, once you’re hired, you end up in a position for which you’re overqualified. It’s the story of Dan Montoya, a U.S. Marine and Vietnam veteran, who unknowingly kickstarted his sons’ passion project, VettedHeroes. It’s also the story of many other veterans who are working to rejoin the civilian world.

VettedHeroes, founded by Chris Montoya, is an organization designed to create top-tier employment opportunities for veterans in the process of transitioning back into civilian life.

Montoya is a Dallas-based entrepreneur who leads veteran hiring initiatives at Interstate Batteries. Although he’s not a veteran, Montoya’s dad’s tale of hiring holdups inspired him to create what could be the next big thing in veteran hiring — a digital interface that will better match vets with apprenticeships and jobs that actually meet their needs, desires, and work experiences.

“This is something that is a far greater mission — to honor those who have voluntarily served. They don’t look for handouts and are not looking for charity.”

Chris Montoya

VettedHeroes is a bootstrap startup that emerged from a goal and a partnership between Montoya and then-acquaintance Kristie Whites, who is now VettedHeroes’ COO. With only $1,500 and a little support, both from dad, Montoya began work to make his dream a reality in 2016. And after two years of hard work, his vision is taking shape.

“The goal is to create and cultivate a corporate community and have [veterans and corporations] connect with one another to extend trainings, jobs, blogs, and more information,” Montoya said. “He has a resource that he can actually go to and get more than just a job description or job posting.”

VettedHeroes’ digital interface won’t look like the average job board, a decision Montoya said is intentional. In designing the platform, Montoya collaborated with HireVue, a hiring organization that incorporates artificial intelligence technologies into VettedHeroes’ website.

His goal is to use the technologies to overcome the challenges of hiring — such as the flawed resume review process and fruitless searches through job boards — and allow machine learning technology to identify top candidates based on their digital profiles.

From there, virtual reality technology could be used to conduct interviews, give workplace tours, or deliver training curricula.

In addition, through a Department of Labor collaboration, VettedHeroes works to match vets with educational apprenticeships, including those in white-collar, technological fields.

“The IT industry needs qualified individuals, as so much of what we do is reliant on technology; yet pulling that talent off the street is not easy, so if you can’t find it, build it,” said Roxann Griffith, a National Strategic Outreach Specialist at the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Strategic Outreach. “This model allows the employer to not only train but retain the talent. The veterans benefit, as they are easily adaptable, very trainable, and usually bring a lot of the ‘soft’ skills to the table, which may be rare among their peers.”

Montoya describes the apprenticeships as long-term training programs (sometimes up to two years) with a dedicated curriculum that takes veterans from novices to industry professionals with real world experience.

The Department of Labor’s Veterans Employment and Training Services division focuses on four “P” items when it comes to veterans’ training and hiring:

Preparing America’s veterans, service members, and their spouses for meaningful careers,

Providing them with employment resources and expertise,

Promoting their employment opportunities, and

Protecting their employment rights.



So far, Griffith said, the partnership between the Department of Labor and VettedHeroes has taught some 300 organizations about hiring and retaining veteran talent, and the entities have collaborated to create 10 registered apprenticeships. The department also offers several educational apprenticeships to veterans outside of VettedHeroes.

But, there’s work yet to be done. Even as unemployment rates drop for veterans (only 2.9 percent are unemployed), their spouses struggle to find fulfilling employment.

Somewhere between 10.2 and 16 percent of military spouses are unemployed, the White House reported in 2017, citing two studies. So Montoya, in effort to tackle spouse unemployment, also offers employment services to the spouses of military members and veterans.

“The difficulty with military spouses is that they look like job hoppers,” Montoya said. “They follow their spouse… from location to location. A lot of the challenge is that if they self-identify, a company will, in some cases, think, ‘Oh, they’re going to be gone and there’s no point in hiring them.'”

VettedHeroes is slated to roll out its interface in January, with a pilot testing in March during a hiring fair in Puerto Rico. Montoya, in the meantime, holds true to his original goals.

“This is something that is a far greater mission — to honor those who have voluntarily served. They don’t look for handouts and are not looking for charity,” Montoya said. “That you give them an opportunity … They don’t want [a handout]. What they want is an actual opportunity, a job.”

195,https://www2.lehigh.edu/news/lehigh-looks-to-expand-opportunities-partnerships-in-china,"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Lehigh University News,"Lehigh Looks to Expand Opportunities, Partnerships in China","Lehigh’s connection to China dates back nearly 140 years. In fact, the first Chinese students enrolled at Lehigh in 1879—just 14 years after its founding—and over the course of its history, more than 3,000 Chinese undergraduate and graduate students have attended the university.

Now, as it continues to expand its global footprint and international impact, Lehigh is pushing forward on several initiatives to strengthen its relationship with its current stakeholders in China—and develop new ones, too.

Earlier this month, members of Lehigh’s senior leadership team, led by President John D. Simon, traveled to China for a week-long trip that saw them engage with Lehigh’s substantial and growing Chinese alumni base and meet with top officials from some of the leading universities in China.

Simon says he expects the trip, which saw Lehigh establish a new partnership with Tongji University in Shanghai, will eventually lead to several additional initiatives with institutions throughout China, a country that is quickly establishing itself as a major center for higher education leadership.

“Our international strategies are central to the goals contained in the Path to Prominence,” Simon said. “We believe that a Lehigh education should prepare students for the increasingly global and complex world they will navigate, and we are proud to say Lehigh is now a more global campus than it has ever been. Our ever-expanding efforts in China are emblematic of our broader focus on creating a university of truly global impact.”

Cheryl Matherly, Vice President and Vice Provost of International Affairs, added: “The purpose for the trip was to evaluate Lehigh’s long-term China strategy. This is important because China is a significant player in global higher education, and we have some long-standing, significant relationships.”

Joining Simon and Matherly in China were Stacy Burger, Director of Global Partnerships and Strategic Initiatives, and Yuliang (Oliver) Yao, the George N. Beckwith ’32 Professor of Information Systems and Associate Dean for Graduate Programs in the College of Business and Economics. The group spent a busy week in China, including stops at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, the East China University of Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Renmin University and Peking University, along with Tongji.

At Tongji, the Lehigh group formalized a new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that will create a dual-degree master’s program between Tongji and CBE. That initiative builds on Lehigh’s existing partnerships in China, which include student exchange programs, travel grant programs, study-abroad/internship programs and a visiting scholars program. These initiatives extend to fields and disciplines across the university—from chemical and civil and environmental engineering to modern languages and literatures and earth and environmental sciences, among others.

“In terms of global economics and politics, China is extremely important, so creating opportunities for our students to learn more about China is an important area for us to focus on,” Matherly said. “Also, you cannot lose sight of the fact that China is now where some of the best universities in the world are located. The investments being made by the Chinese government into growing world-class institutions are substantial, and this means that on the global stage, Chinese universities have a lot of influence.”

Matherly said the creation of new partnerships, study-abroad programs and other agreements will continue to be an essential part of Lehigh’s China strategy going forward. But she added that one of the most heartening aspects of the trip was the strong turnout the Lehigh group saw for a series of three alumni events—one each in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing. In all, the events drew more than 250 Lehigh alumni, a testament not only to the university’s extensive history in the country but also the strong connection those alums continue to have with Lehigh.

Speaking to the alumni groups, Simon said he was deeply appreciative of their ongoing loyalty to their alma mater. He noted that the university is in the midst of a major growth initiative, the Path to Prominence, and has also just launched GO: The Campaign for Lehigh. Alumni support will be essential to the success of both initiatives, Simon said—and that includes overseas alumni.

“We would not be able to move forward on our shared goal of creating a more dynamic and impactful university without the engagement of our proud Lehigh alumni,” Simon said. “We are excited to be building the Lehigh of tomorrow, but that vision will only come to fruition if we can harness the pride, loyalty and ambition of everyone in the Lehigh family—from our alumni making an impact in the Lehigh Valley to those serving as brand ambassadors for our university in every corner of the globe.”

Matherly echoed Simon’s comments, and said Lehigh would continue to find new ways to engage with its Chinese alumni, parents and students.

“We have a lot of people in the Lehigh network over there, and it’s a group that is really looking for ways to engage with the university. So one of the things we’ll be looking at is being much more intentional about how we can be involved with our Chinese alums,” she said. “It’s much the same with our Chinese families—we have over 650 students here from China right now, but we also know that these families, for the most part, have not been able to come here to campus. But the students are here because their families know Lehigh is a great place to send their sons and daughters. So we have an obligation to support those families.”","The group spent a busy week in China, including stops at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, the East China University of Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Renmin University and Peking University, along with Tongji.

Each year U of T Engineering partners with more than 400 external companies and organizations through strategic research collaborations in areas from quantum-inspired computing to sustainable infrastructure.

Allison Brown, director of corporate & foundation partnerships, and Adriano Vissa, associate director of corporate partnerships, help to foster and grow these important connections with industry. They recently sat down with Tyler Irving to discuss how the nature of partnerships is evolving at U of T Engineering.

[wc_divider style=”solid” line=”single” margin_top=”” margin_bottom=”” class=””][/wc_divider]

What makes a successful partnership?

AB: The goals of the researchers and the external collaborators need to be well aligned. That means finding a challenge that is important to a company’s business model, but that also hinges on some fundamental principle in science, engineering or technology.

Addressing this kind of challenge usually requires a time horizon of about three to four years, which lines up pretty well with what a typical graduate student would be able to take on. Often, partners are interested in addressing more complex challenges that would involve multiple students, or multiple research teams. This expands the time horizon and mores the partnership toward a more long-term, strategic approach.

AV: Our job is to be a little bit like sports agents, bringing together the interests of two or more parties and making sure the partnership can deliver value for all involved. We want to address challenges, but we also play a role in terms of strengthening the bench — that is, nurturing talent with the skill set needed to address future challenges.

Can you give an example of a strategic partnership?

AB: Right now, our Faculty is working with Fujitsu on advancing their digital annealer, which is a quantum-inspired computing hardware technology. This is something that could have commercial applications in a number of areas, but it’s unclear which ones will be the most impactful at the start. So, they’ve tapped into our experts in financial technology, health care, and smart cities. They are the ones who can test the digital annealer and determine which challenges it is best suited to address. Those are the avenues that Fujitsu will pursue in the future.

What makes U of T Engineering’s approach unique?

AV: I would say it’s the combination of breadth and depth in research. We’re strong in many different areas, including advanced manufacturing, robotics, autonomous systems, artificial intelligence (AI) and tissue engineering. That’s appealing to many partners, who see us as a one-stop shop for engineering excellence.

What current trends are influencing industry partnerships at U of T Engineering?

AB: One area that’s getting a lot of attention right now is AI. There have been a lot of advances lately, and investment from government and industry is increasing. Engineers are well positioned to apply AI techniques to practical challenges. For example, if you want to use AI to build a smart city, you need someone with the relevant civil engineering expertise, someone that can develop the computer architecture to ensure that the AI algorithms can operate at the right speed, and someone with a strong theoretical understanding of AI. This is what I call “full-stack AI capability.”

Another trend is simply strong growth. The amount of direct industry funding we receive increased by more than a third over the past year, and it’s even higher when you count federal or provincial matching programs. It’s a very exciting time.

What do you expect to see in the next few years?

AB: I think we’ll see a shift toward what we call strategic or comprehensive partnership models. Instead of a one-off project, we’re seeing companies come to us with a much more holistic perspective, with numerous related challenges that extend across multiple departments. Some are establishing innovation funds, which issue calls for proposals on an annual basis. Others have signed co-location agreements, enabling academic and industrial researchers to share space on campus.

AV: We’re also excited about continuing to expand our range of sectors. For example, our Lassonde Institute of Mining is developing a new partnership strategy, and there is lots of interesting work going on in biomedical engineering, which is my own background. I think we have some really unique value to offer potential partners.

AB: More companies are attracted to Toronto as an innovation hub than ever before, and U of T is a key anchor of that reputation. In Thomson Reuters annual rankings of the World’s Most Innovative Universities, we’ve jumped 22 spots in the last two years. I’m excited to see that needle continue to move higher.","Allison Brown, director of corporate & foundation partnerships, and Adriano Vissa, associate director of corporate partnerships, help to foster and grow these important connections with industry.

199,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/unsolicited-proposals-for-public-30086/,"Fri, 02 Nov 2018 07:00:00 GMT",JD Supra,Unsolicited Proposals for Public-Private Partnerships,"We have previously discussed the State of Florida’s P3 law, which broadly authorizes private firms to submit unsolicited proposals to state and local agencies for a wide variety of public services and facilities. The concept behind an unsolicited proposal is simple enough. The private sector is constantly innovating. As a result, the government may not have enough information to draft a request for proposals and solicit offers for a particular solution. Essentially, the government cannot ask for what it cannot describe. In those situations, the private sector can jumpstart the process by submitting a unsolicited proposal that informs the government of its innovative solution. Ordinarily, if the government likes the new idea, it must then conduct a competitive process that permits other firms to submit alternative proposals.

Every jurisdiction has its own procedures for accepting and processing unsolicited proposals. Although the Florida P3 law provides certain default procedures, individual jurisdictions can also adopt their own, more specific procedures. Miami-Dade County, for example, has recently adopted its own process for accepting unsolicited proposals. Outside of Florida, there is remarkable diversity in how unsolicited proposals are accepted and treated. In some cases, unsolicited proposals are only accepted during certain windows of time and for certain types of projects—essentially, a solicitation of unsolicited proposals. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation utilizes this type of procedure and recently opened a submission window for unsolicited proposals. And some jurisdictions incentivize the submission of new ideas by giving the unsolicited proposer extra points in the competitive process, a right of first refusal—sometimes called a “Swiss Challenge” , or agreeing to pay the unsolicited proposer its preparation costs if the contract is ultimately awarded to a competitor. Florida does not provide incentives of this type, but Florida does exempt unsolicited proposals from public-records laws to ensure that competitors are not able to steal the innovative idea when preparing their own competing proposals.

When establishing procedures for accepting unsolicited proposals, a government must balance many different public policies. Because there are many different ways to balance those policies, it is unsurprising that procedures vary from one jurisdiction to another. On one hand, unsolicited proposals are often very expensive to produce—for complex projects, the cost can easily exceed one million dollars, and the procedures must take that expense into account. Before undertaking the expense of preparing an unsolicited proposal, a firm will generally want some comfort that the government will actually take the time to review its proposal and that its competitors won’t be able to obtain the benefit of its ideas. On the other hand, the government may wish to limit the resources it must spend reviewing something it did not ask for, and it must also take measures to ensure that it gets the benefit of open competition. Florida currently splits the difference between those competing goals by requiring a competitive process, but protecting the unsolicited proposal from disclosure as a public record. Florida also authorizes the submission of unsolicited proposals for any project at any time, but requires that the proposer pay the government’s review costs. Thus far, that approach has resulted in the submission of several unsolicited proposals throughout the state.","Miami-Dade County, for example, has recently adopted its own process for accepting unsolicited proposals.

November 3, 2018

The candidates in Tuesday's general election are Andy Storm, Laura Mitchell, Ken Stahl, Sean Hickman, Kara Totaro, and Angela Krebs. The top three vote-getters will be elected to four-year terms. Today’s profile is on Andy Storm, who lives in Brighton Twp. with his wife, Amy, and their eight children, all of whom are students in Brighton Area Schools.



Storm, who was born and raised in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, is the President & CEO of Eckhart, Inc., a Michigan-based Industry 4.0 advanced manufacturing solutions provider. He also serves as Chairman of the Capital Area Manufacturing Council, the Lansing Community College Center for Manufacturing Excellence Advisory Board, the MIT Leaders for Global Operations Alumni Council and the Michigan Tech Industry Advisory Board.



Storm earned Bachelor of Science degrees in business administration and Mechanical Engineering Technology from Michigan Technological University in Houghton, MI, an MBA from MIT’s Sloan School of Management and an MS degree in Engineering Systems from the MIT School of Engineering.



At Eckhart, Storm is responsible for accelerating the development and adoption of Eckhart’s Industry 4.0 advanced manufacturing solutions that include autonomous guided vehicles, collaborative robots, additive manufacturing, micro sensor/spatial positioning systems, and ergonomic lift-assist & secure tools. Eckhart customers include many of the leading companies in the aerospace, medical, food industry, and engineering fields.



Storm says if elected, his goal as a board of education member would be for the Brighton Area Schools to partner with other schools in select regional locations around the state, and partner with corporations with foundations such as those at GM, Ford and other companies, to help grow STEM-based curricula and solicit donations from the foundations. The goal is to build regional brick-and-mortar, advanced manufacturing centers affiliated with high schools in Brighton, the Grand Rapids area, the Northern Lower Peninsula and the UP so that students could collaborate with the corporations and be exposed to all of the technological and manufacturing advancements in such high-tech industries.



Although he says it is not the reason for his running for the school board, another issue Storm is passionate about is some of the literary materials that are getting into the Brighton Area Schools. At a school board meeting last April, Storm complained about a novel that had been suggested for his then-13-year-old daughter by an employee in the high school media center for a school assignment. The novel, Grasshopper Jungle by Andrew A. Smith, follows the life of two young high school boys who fight for their lives during an apocalypse. It won the Boston Globe-Horne Book Award for Fiction. Calling it the, “demented writing of a pervert,” Storm complained that it contained sexually explicit references and other questionable material involving adolescents. Storm told the board that such books should not be on the shelves or otherwise available for students.



Nonetheless, Storm says he is a strong supporter of the Brighton Area Schools and says the district is providing an excellent education for his children and the other 6,000 students. If elected, Storm says he would promote accelerated STEM-based learning in the elementary schools, more hands-on early stage reading, and an active “earn by doing” middle school and high school class environment that promotes teamwork, leadership, and diversity of thought among the student population.

Where advanced TV goes in the next five years is one of the topics of conversation in this Beet.TV interview with Scoles at the recent WideOrbit Connect conference.

At its core, advanced TV connects advertisers’ marketing goals to the way they buy media on television, according to Scoles. Regardless of their target audience and beyond being “hyper focused” on the ideal consumer, “it really has to dovetail on their overall sales strategy.

“You can take what you’re trying to do from your corporate marketing strategy writ large and have it reflect in the way that you buy media.”

Identifying consumers of interest cherry picking media by viewership patterns drives efficiency. “And that’s probably the most similar concept to how digital targeting is thought about,” Scoles says.

But with the way that linear TV schedules are made, audiences can be measured across long periods of time, for example a three-month campaign. “You also have a lot more flexibility to change the definition of targeting to go beyond touching as many of these important consumers as possible to a multifaceted strategy.”

One campaign phase could focus on reach, another on driving frequency, “and at the end of it we want to see how it all compiles back together to fit overall brand strategy,” says Scoles.

Using data and consumer targeting is hardly new to marketing, so what might seem like new conversations aren’t. “You’re tapping the conversations that are already happening. These are part of the marketing departments. In the past, they could do a bunch of great work to understand who our ideal consumer segment is, and then there was not a ton you could do about it, especially on linear TV.

“The way the conversation has shifted is now you can bring those people into a meeting that involves talking about a media buy and say, ‘all the work that you’ve been doing, we can talk about that with you now as well and we can help you activate against that.’”

Over next five years, trends and conversations will center on being more transparent marketing strategy from the advertiser’s perspective, according to Scoles. “Be more adaptable to snapping towards those strategies on a publisher and agency side. That’s where I think we’re going to continue to see a lot of growth. The more transparent you are, the more people can partner with you and help drive your end goals.”

203,https://www.mtairynews.com/news/67278/osburn-chandler-partnerships-key-for-county,"Thu, 01 Nov 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Mount Airy News,Osburn-Chandler: Partnerships key for county,"DOBSON — Surry County electrical customers usually don’t have a choice about their service provider — yet the spirit of competition isn’t necessarily a good thing, either, based on an unusual situation surrounding a jail planned in Dobson.

Faced with a choice of awarding a contract to power the new detention facility to Duke Energy or Surry-Yadkin Electric Membership Corp., the Surry Board of Commissioners chose the latter, but in a split decision.

That outcome reflects concerns by some commissioners that while the electric co-op will offer lower costs in the short run due to what one dissenter calls “teaser rates,” county taxpayers could face much higher expenses long-range by not picking Duke.

“I’m not interested in teaser rates,” Commissioner Eddie Harris said of a special economic-development charge offered by Surry-Yadkin for seven years, calling it “immaterial” and adding that he is more focused on the decades to come.

“Perpetuity is a long time — that’s forever.”

“Both are great companies, it’s not about that,” said Commissioner Van Tucker, who voted against using Surry-Yadkin during a meeting when Harris was absent, being outvoted by fellow commissioners Bill Goins, Larry Johnson and Mark Marion.

In a later meeting, Tucker sided with Harris on the losing end of a motion attempting to undo that action which produced a 3-2 vote.

“I think it’s about the best business deal for the taxpayer,” Tucker added Wednesday afternoon.

Based on figures assembled by Harris, he believes the average cost of using Surry-Yadkin service — after the seven years — would be $103,170 annually compared to $93,579 for Duke Energy.

Marion, the board’s chairman, does not subscribe to that scenario, saying he is choosing to go with guaranteed savings in the short term vs. gambling on possible lower rates by Duke down the road.

“That was a no-brainer for me, because nobody can foretell the future,” Marion explained Wednesday afternoon.

“The first year it saves us $8,000,” and so on through the special period, he said of the agreement that calls for Surry-Yadkin to re-evaluate the rate situation after it ends.

Marion indicated that market conditions make it difficult to predict the energy price outlook seven years from now, with what Duke might charge then an uncertainty today.

“Nobody knows,” the board chairman said. “If the power rate (in general) goes up, Duke’s going to be going up, also.”

“No Man’s Land”

The unusual situation allowing such a debate involves the location for the new jail on property adjacent to the existing detention facility near the center of Dobson.

“It’s just right behind it,” Harris said earlier this week.

Although each electrical provider has a distinct presence in different areas of the county, the new jail site is said to be in a “No Man’s Land,” meaning county officials had a choice between the two.

In March, the commissioners approved the issuance of up to $50 million in limited-obligation bonds in Fiscal Year 2021-22 to construct the jail and fund another project for Elkin City Schools. The detention facility makes up the bulk of that.

“It’s a $40 million project,” Harris said.

Most everything else in town is served by Duke Energy, according to the commissioner from the State Road community, who acknowledged that the co-op does provide power for some facilities including Surry County Health and Nutrition Center near U.S. 601.

Duke Energy already has infrastructure at the new jail site, including a substation “right there at the judicial center” nearby, which Harris says points to another factor in Duke’s favor: reliability.

“In doesn’t get any more reliable than that,” Harris said of the substation’s proximity in particular.

Meanwhile, the nearest Surry-Yadkin Electric Membership Corp. substation is at Salem Fork, about four miles away as the crow flies.

The co-op initially offered its discount rate for a five-year period, but apparently got wind that at least some on the board were leaning toward Duke Energy, Harris said. Surry-Yadkin then extended that two more years and also said it will sell the county government a generator at cost.

Harris says he has thoroughly researched the issue, navigating through a maze of websites detailing kilowatt hour charges and other complexities, and says it is obvious Duke Energy will be “a lot cheaper” option after seven years. “I have spent quite a lot of time on this.”

Duke can’t offer teaser rates because under the laws it is governed by, which are unlike those of the co-op, it must treat all customers equally, Harris mentioned.

“By anyone’s analysis, Surry-Yadkin Electric Membership Corp. is more expensive electricity and it will cost the taxpayers tens if not hundreds of dollars over the long run,” he said. “What you really need to do is compare apples to apples.”

Process questioned

In addition to the financial implications of the electrical contract, Harris and Tucker have issues with how the decision went down.

During a commissioners meeting on April 5, the county board voted 3-1 to award the electrical contract to the co-op, a decision highlighting the fact one of its five members was absent.

“I buried my mother that day,” Harris disclosed.

Another bone of contention concerns the board discussing the matter beforehand in a closed session, which is usually reserved for highly sensitive matters regarding personnel or economic incentives for a new industry, among others.

County Attorney Ed Woltz, in a letter later in the month, defended that discussion based on one provision of the North Carolina Open Meetings Law pertaining to bid information submitted by the electrical suppliers. The attorney’s position is that this did not become public until the contract was awarded.

The law states that an elected body “may” hold a closed session on even the most-sensitive matters, not that it must do so.

“I think it was a big enough deal for the taxpayers that we should have had an open discussion,” Commissioner Tucker said Wednesday. “I think it’s about the best deal for the taxpayer.”

At another meeting on April 19, Harris spoke at length against the action taken earlier in the month due to not being present then.

There was also an attempt on April 19 to rescind the contract award to Surry-Yadkin, mirroring a desire by Harris and Tucker to have further study. It failed in a 3-2 vote.

In the wake of that action it has been learned that Commissioner Marion’s father has had a long association with Surry-Yadkin Electric Membership Corp., which is based in Dobson.

“I will just say that Surry-Yadkin has always been a good company for the community,” Marion responded Wednesday when asked about that relationship.

“My dad working there for 43 years didn’t have any bearing on how I voted.”

Not a done deal?

Despite two votes being taken on the issue, it still might not be set in stone, according to Tucker.

“It is a done deal once you vote and sign a contract.”

Tucker said that had not occurred as of earlier this week.

“I don’t think it is too late,” he observed regarding being able to alter the present course of action, which Commissioner Harris agrees is in order.

“On its face it’s just really wrong,” he said of the electrical-service decision.

“This was wrong for a lot of reasons.”","Meanwhile, the nearest Surry-Yadkin Electric Membership Corp. substation is at Salem Fork, about four miles away as the crow flies.

Fueled by the push to value-based care and population health management, payer-provider partnerships -- untraditional collaborations between healthcare providers and health benefit planners -- are gaining momentum.

Instead of payers independently bearing most of the patient-care risks, some providers are now encouraged to collaborate with payers throughout treatment plans, creating a win-win situation that achieves quality-based care and meets Affordable Care Act requirements. For example, under the risk-sharing model, there ideally is less runaround between providers and insurance carriers when a patient is admitted to a hospital.

The gist of the convergence is sharing and analyzing data based on the existing operations and technology infrastructures on the payer's end. Effective communication between the two parties also plays an essential role in making the partnership sustainable.

The path forward for payer-provider partnerships is not clear-cut financially based on recent evidence. For example, since 2010, 37 provider-sponsored health plans have been established, but only four were profitable in 2015, according to a report released last year by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.","Taking an untraditional route to value-based care, payer-and-provider partnerships highlight the collaborations between benefit planners and healthcare systems.

Many blockchain projects have launched, relaunched, added staff, partnered with other companies (and projects), acquired other companies, made changes to align with regulations, and further developed their blockchain solution.

From these Q1 and Q2 2018 analyses of the crypto market, the rate of overall development in the industry is progressive, although quite slow. Regulations have admittedly slowed the pace of ICOs, but it is a good thing that the industry is getting regulated. This is because institutional funds cannot flow into the crypto industry until it is truly and fully regulated.

Partnerships form a vital part of the achievement of any blockchain project. This is because a solution that does not have a place of application is useless. Partnerships are formed by blockchain projects to seal a platform of application for the blockchain solution.

Partnerships made by blockchain entities vary by purpose. While the underlying goal is to create a use case for the solution, the specific purpose can vary from future applications to present experimental applications.

10 of the top partnerships made this year by blockchain and cryptocurrency entities are listed below. The list is in no particular order.

10 Best Cryptocurrency Partnerships in 2018

IBM and Stellar

The relationship between IBM and Stellar dates as far back as October 2017. IBM considered partnering with Bitcoin, Ripple, and Stellar before ultimately deciding on Stellar. Stellar was chosen over the other candidates for its nonprofit status, transparency, and scalability.

IBM runs a distributed ledger solution for institutions who outsource their technological integrations. While they implement Hyperledger for private networks, Stellar is their choice for public networks. IBM currently run 9 validators on the Stellar network.

IBM’s Universal Payment Solution currently uses Stellar Lumen (XLM) as a bridge asset for cross-border transaction. However, IBM is not limited to this and are open to additional assets being deployed on the platform. IBM is currently considering a stablecoin to edge through the volatility of the cryptomarket.

Recently, IBM released the Blockchain World Wire with the vision of making cross-border payments happen in seconds rather than days, using the Stellar protocol. Also, IBM revealed a partnership with Veridium Labs to tokenize Carbon credits on the Stellar blockchain.

Litecoin and TokenPay

On July 10, 2018, decentralized payment platform TokenPay acquired 9.9% of WEG Bank in Germany, along with the option to purchase the remaining 90% (approximately), subject to the customary regulatory approval.

This 9.9% stake in the bank is already transferred to the benefit of the Litecoin Foundation.

Litecoin would aid TokenPay in the development of its own blockchain, ensuring its stability and future success. TokenPay would, in turn, integrate Litecoin into the WEG Bank and into their merchant services platform.

Binance and Malta Stock Exchange

On September 11, 2018, Binance signed an MOU with Malta Stock Exchange (MSX) to launch a new security token digital exchange. This implies that Binance will probably launch the world’s first security token trading platform in Malta.

Malta is often referred to as the blockchain island because it is very pro-crypto and Binance has enjoyed a good relationship with the government, after moving its operations to the island earlier in the year.

Malta has committed its best legal minds to create an appropriate regulatory framework for the crypto industry. The MSX PLC is newly established by Malta to explore financial technology and digital assets for the benefit of the blockchain island.

AWS and Qtum

Qtum announced a partnership with the China division of Amazon Web Services (AWS) on October 17, 2018. This partnership is in the bid to develop Blockchain-as-a-Aervice solutions for enterprises and developers. Qtum will be providing a smart contract development platform on AWS.

Through Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that contains Qtum Core, Solidity, and Qmix web IDE, developers and users can create and launch smart contracts efficiently.

Miguel Palencia, CIO of the Qtum Foundation, stated:

“Qtum’s launch on the AWS marketplace provides an easy-to-use and powerful cloud-based solution for end users and enterprise. Anyone who wants to develop and build dapps on the Qtum platform or use it as a staking node will benefit from this.”

Dow Jones Media Group and Brave Browser

The Brave browser and its cryptocurrency BAT has been making a lot of strides in 2018. In December 2017, the browser recorded about 1 million active users. Meanwhile, 2018 is not over yet, and the platform has over 4 million active users and more than 10 million downloads.

In April 2018, the Dow Jones Media Group announced a partnership with Brave to bring premium content to users and test the blockchain payment technology. The available publications include Barrons.com (full access) and MarketWatch (premium access). Both publications are verified publishers on the BAT platform, according to the partnership agreement.

ICON and Line

ICON is a blockchain project that focuses on the interoperability of blockchains. Line is a social media platform with over 200 million monthly active users.

On May 15, 2018, ICON made an announcement that they will be collaborating with Line to develop their own blockchain network. This joint venture is known as Unchain. Unchain will be the developer organization of the blockchain ecosystem for Line.

The joint venture between Line and Icon is expected to connect more dapps and users to the Icon network, as Icon will look to leverage on the over 200 million users of Line.

Wanchain and MakerDAO

Wanchain is a blockchain project that focuses on the interoperability (or interaction and communication) of blockchains.

MakerDAO is a project that produces a stablecoin known as Dai, soft-pegged to the USD on a 1:1 ratio. Instead of having a dollar equivalent of all Dai in a bank account as Tether does, MakerDAO uses a system of collateralized debt, held only in Ethereum, to maintain the value of the Dai to 1 USD.

On October 11, 2018, Wanchain announced the Dai as the first ever cross-chain ERC-20 token. Thanks to its cross-functionality, Dai can be exchanged for Bitcoin in a decentralized way. On the other hand, this makes it a possible potential for Bitcoin to be added to Dai’s collateralized debt position alongside Ether.

This 2-way relationship between Wanchain and MakerDAO is expected to add great value to both platforms and their respective coins.

Coinbase and Circle

By now, you would’ve heard that Coinbase has listed a new stablecoin on its platform known as USDC. USDC is a product of the partnership between Coinbase, the renowned cryptocurrency wallet and exchange, and Circle, the Goldman Sachs-backed tech company.

The partnership created the Centre consortium, which is the initiative that brought about USDC. This partnership is expected to continue producing more stablecoins of fiat currencies, connecting everyone to financial services.

Centre plans to produce stablecoins for British Pounds, Japanese Yen, and the Euro. They are each expected to be listed on Coinbase when available.

Binance and Tron

Binance is arguably the largest crypto exchange in the world, and the platform has been vigorously expanding in 2018.

On October 4, 2018, Binance announced the Binance Blockchain Charity Foundation and their charge to facilitate Sustainable Development Goals, supporting the UNDP. The Blockchain Charity Foundation was created by Binance to explore the use of blockchain technology for social good.

Tron jumped on the same wagon with a donation and a commitment to the development of the nonprofit sector along with Binance.

The partnership was shared in a tweet by TRON:

TRON is proud to join @binance in discussing the implementation of blockchain innovation to the non-profit sector at the #WIF2018. Leaders @cz_binance and @justinsuntron are paving the way to utilize tech for social good. @UNDP #TRX https://t.co/7mqVvS7Tsf pic.twitter.com/9gDzufkVRx — TRON Foundation (@Tronfoundation) October 24, 2018

Blockchain.com and Ledger

Finally, Blockchain.com, one of the earliest web wallet providers for cryptocurrency, partnered with Ledger to produce a new hardware wallet called the Lockbox.

This device is compatible with the Blockchain.com wallet. It is expected to give Blockchain.com users the flexibility of keeping (at least) a portion of their funds in a cold wallet while keeping the option of the web wallet for ease of accessibility.

Lockbox is compatible with Windows 7 or higher, MacOS version 10.9 or higher, Linux, and Chrome OS. Lockbox is not compatible with other Ledger products, as it runs on the custom Blockchain.com firmware.

The device is valued at $99.99 and is expected to start shipping in mid-November.

Final Thoughts



These are just a handful of the top partnerships that have taken place in the crypto world in 2018. The majority of these partnerships are experimental and futuristic, as many of the organizations outside the blockchain world are still awaiting validation of the blockchain industry.

While some partnerships directly affect the token price of the crypto project, others are just a proof of progress. But in every case, these partnerships serve as a way to measure the effort of the blockchain project towards distinguishing their solution from others in the marketplace.

Are there any other partnerships inked in 2018 that could have massive impact on the industry? Let us know in the comments!

The Northern Illinois Regional P-20 Network was founded in 2014 with a mission to improve college and career readiness through regional collaboration. Initially funded by a grant from the Illinois Board of Higher Education, the Northern Illinois P-20 Network is facilitated by the NIU Center for P-20 Engagement at NIU as part of its college readiness activities.

Gina Caronna, who has been the director of the P-20 Network since February 2018, was excited to bring together representatives from K-12 and post-secondary institutions to do the difficult and important work of aligning high-school and college courses and career pathways to promote student achievement.

“The misalignment of secondary and post-secondary education is often cited as a reason for students’ lack of retention in college,” she says. “The P-20 Network promotes a platform that encourages dialogue around bridging gaps and paving the way for students to be successful in college and career preparation.”

The recent October meeting consisted of panel presentations from different working groups who are creating new college and career pathways for students, developing dual credit programs and working to develop curriculum to meet competency-based standards, which better prepare students for the next stage in their education. Each panel included participants from at least two different institutions, representing both K-12 and college/university perspectives. The participants shared stories of their ongoing collaborations to facilitate student success and prepare them for rewarding careers.

Caronna says, “The meeting highlighted the journeys that several groups are taking to align programs and policies for students. Programs have been designed, course sequences have been created, but implementing them takes a high level of collaboration and innovation. I wanted people to talk about what they have encountered along their journey to promote alignment, how they have worked through issues and what they’ve done to ‘stay at the table’.”

The participants appreciated the candid discussions, as well as the chance to reconnect with current and potential partners, an opportunity the network regularly offers.

A particularly important topic for many was the development of career pathways, which guide students through courses and internship experiences beginning in high school and continuing through certificate or degree programs that will prepare them for rewarding, in-demand careers.

Douglas Jensen, president of Rock Valley College, appreciated the chance to broaden networking opportunities with local and statewide K-12 partners, as well as to expand relationships with NIU staff. He says these relationships are particularly valuable because they have allowed Rock Valley College to create a number of career pathways that allow students to seamlessly pursue degrees in fields such as public safety, computer science and networking, coding and mobile apps development and mechanical engineering, beginning in high school.

“Creating pathways for our high school students allows the students and parents to offset some of the future cost of higher education and decrease time to graduation,” he says. “In addition, the development of pathways has brought the college in closer communication with the private sector as well as governmental leaders to show how the investment in education is related to economic growth.”

Nik Butenhoff, director of career readiness for Belvidere School District, is also working to develop a number of career pathways with P-20 Network partners.

He says, “The P-20 network helps connect people who are working to achieve similar goals. I have found that often the network provides that little push we need to accomplish things. I think about my youngest daughter who tries to climb onto the couch to sit by her brothers. She tries and tries but can’t quite make it. Then my son offers his hand to give that little extra support. She grabs a hold and finally is able to make it. I think of the P-20 Network in the same way. They are consistently reaching out their ‘hands’ and helping districts achieve their goals.”

Stephanie Bernoteit, deputy director for Academic Affairs of the Illinois Board of Higher Education, appreciated how many educational leaders took the time to participate in the P-20 Network meeting.

“It was exciting and energizing to see educational leaders from school districts and institutions of higher education come together as part of the Northern Illinois Regional P-20 Network,” she says. “This regional meeting was a great example of leaders doing the hard work of developing regional solutions to solving regional problems in order to support all learners from early childhood to young and working adults in successfully taking the next steps in their educational journeys. The commitment of these leaders in devoting time out of their busy schedules to this effort is a sign of how valuable regional networks like this can be.”

ITV has been outlining its future advertising strategy and it includes a promise to engage more with agencies and also to work more directly with clients – ideally with the agency in the same room.

The company is de-prioritising broadcast linear addressable TV after its test-and-learn initiative with Sorenson Media hit the buffers, and all addressable efforts are currently focused on ITV Hub, the broadcaster’s streaming service.

Enabled by existing targeting capabilities on ITV Hub, the company is going to pursue the small-medium enterprise market, believing it can bring new advertisers to TV, including companies who currently advertise on Facebook. Bakers and florists are good examples of the kinds of potential advertiser the UK broadcaster will be chasing.

Perhaps most significantly, and probably taking onboard what brand executives say they like about Google and Facebook, ITV is determined that it will evolve “from being a media partner to a valuable business partner”. Jason Spencer, business development director at ITV, says investments in data and tech and the current restructuring of agency/client facing teams means the broadcaster will be able to have new types of conversations.

“We will be talking about outcomes and working with clients and agency partners to see how we can drive the bottom line for a business,” he said.

Speaking at Future TV Advertising Forum Manchester this week, Spencer revealed that ITV will invest to ensure it has “more bandwidth” for working with agency planners, too.

“Planners seem to have less time than ever [to do their job]. It does strike me that agency planners are under relentless pressure. Anything that broadcasters like ITV can do to support them is good.”

Referring to research by Enders Analysis that was outlined at the same conference, and which highlighted the challenges for senior marketers at brands, including short-term corporate goals and lack of board representation, Spencer declared: “We need to support marketers more.”

“There is a generation of marketers coming through who are more digital-first and there is a big job for us, Channel 4 and Sky (the three largest television ad-sales houses in the UK) to help educate them about the power of TV.”

There is no sign that ITV is going to provide broadcast addressable TV anytime soon. ITV did not explicitly rule out a deal with Sky but what Spencer did say was telling: “The choices are either to invest in technology or build it ourselves, so we are looking at the options around those.”

Spencer told the audience, which contained a large number of advertising clients and agencies from across the northern regions of the UK, that ITV has serious intentions in the ad-tech market: the company bid for Videology before it was sold to Singtel-owned Amobee, for example.

Spencer believes TV is currently being taken for granted as a medium and hailed the ongoing innovation in the industry and the attractiveness of the product offered to consumers. He also wanted this on the record: audiences are not down at ITV.

“Audiences have not left ITV, but they are watching in different ways, like across the [ITV] Hub.”

ITV Hub now has 27 million users, generating basic demographic and geographic data (via user registration and sign-ins) to drive targeting. Notably, 75% of all 16-24 year-olds in the UK are registered to use the service. This impressive figure has been helped by the huge success of ‘Love Island’, the powerhouse reality TV contest that stretched over weeks during the summer and draws a strong youth and streaming/on-demand following. ITV Hub is now available on 33 platforms to ensure wide reach, and the service includes live/linear as well as catch-up content.

Demonstrating how the confidence has returned to the broadcast industry in the UK, partly driven by its own ongoing transformation and the increasing evidence that we have passed the high-water mark for pro-digital sentiment on the buy-side, Spencer suggested that commercial TV should take a “sunny-side up” view of life.

“There is a huge amount of evidence for the power of TV and we have been too defensive for too long. There are a lot of reasons to be cheerful,"" he said.

One of the reasons to be cheerful is the influx of digital brands to television, as advertisers. “We have seen a seismic shift – emerging brands that did not exist 5-10 years ago who see the power of TV advertising. They are driving website visits or other immediate response from campaigns and building brands in the medium and long-term.”

He picked up on the short-term objectives of some TV campaigns. In a view echoed elsewhere at the Manchester conference, Spencer declared: “We need to bang the drum about the short-term effectiveness of this media. We often talk about brand building and long-term effectiveness. We should also focus on the short-term uplift from TV advertising.”

Spencer reiterated the new three-pronged strategy that ITV revealed this summer under the banner of ‘More than TV’. It means combining mass-reach television with more targeting to provide what he calls the best of both worlds, and the expansion of creative brand partnerships.

The third element focuses on how ITV can create a stronger emotional connection between itself, brands and the nation as the means to drive behavioural change and action.

Spencer highlighted ITV’s campaign to raise awareness about male suicide as an example. Called Project 84 to reflect the 84 men who kill themselves in Britain every week, this initiative ran across ITV shows and even featured 84 real-life sculptures, representing real people, standing on top of ITV studio buildings.

You can see how chillingly poignant that was, here. ITV worked with the male suicide prevention charity CALM on this project and was supported by the male grooming brand Harry’s.

Enabled by existing targeting capabilities on ITV Hub, the company is going to pursue the small-medium enterprise market, believing it can bring new advertisers to TV, including companies who currently advertise on Facebook.
Speaking at Future TV Advertising Forum Manchester this week, Spencer revealed that ITV will invest to ensure it has “more bandwidth” for working with agency planners, too.
ITV Hub is now available on 33 platforms to ensure wide reach, and the service includes live/linear as well as catch-up content.

Partnering gives each party access to the others' skill sets and resources, which can greatly expand their individual capabilities.

For a partnership to succeed, each of the businesses involved must be fully committed and should understand their respective responsibilities. We asked a panel of Forbes Business Development Council members for their advice on creating a successful business partnership. Here are their must-have partnership characteristics — and some of the benefits these elements could bring to your collaborative efforts.

1. One Proactive ""Owner"" Per Partner

One person from each side of the partnership needs to ""own"" that partnership. The two partnership leads on either side need to check in weekly and represent their teams. As a business development professional, I have served in this role many times. It requires being proactive, communicative, organized, clear on both sides' goals and progress, and a good relationship builder. - Robin Farmanfarmaian, Actavalon

2. Mutual Accountability

In a lot of partnerships, both teams are so excited about the upsides of doing business together that they miss the step of determining accountability, which they would take in their own organizations. There should be a discussion up front about where the accountability for results falls and what the consequences will be if goals aren’t met. - Brandon Ficara, Toco Warranty

3. True Commitment

In my experience, partnerships fail because one party isn't prepared to fully commit. From the beginning of the relationship, both sides need to be willing to put skin into the game — both financially and resource-wise. The success of one is tightly intertwined with the success of the other. This way, objectives will always stay aligned because both parties are equally committed to the partnership. - Christian Valiulis, Automatic Payroll System

4. Focus On A Shared Goal

When companies or individuals partner to create new solutions, the only way things will stay on track is if both parties have a shared goal. If one party is only interested in serving a personal interest, then the joint effort will be one-sided. There must be a genuine mutual interest in seeing the creation thrive, and then the rest — communication, focus, and so on — will fall into place more naturally. - Ashley Cheeks, MBA, Written Success

5. Clear, Measured Expectations

Setting expectations from the beginning is key. Being direct and outlining what the expected outcomes from the partnership for both parties will look like at the beginning of the project will help determine if the partnership will be successful. The key is defining what success looks like first and then working your way back from there. - Lisa Box, WP Engine, Inc.

6. Balanced Rewards

Partnerships often dissolve over time due to the fact that one party benefits more from the partnership than the other. Over the course of time, if the party that isn't benefiting as much isn't finding value or reward, the effort they put toward the partnership could lessen and eventually dissolve altogether. The key to making partnerships work is to agree upon the inputs and outputs from both parties up front. - Jen Tadin, Gallagher

7. A Continuous Action Plan

The first and foremost step for teaming up to create dynamic new products or services in a joint partnership model is to come up with success criteria jointly and have a continuous action plan attached to it. Track the plan and make people accountable. Jumping right into the strategy to create the products or services, or actually creating the products or services, may not get the desired results for the partnership. - Mehul Agarwal, WinWire

8. Comparable Reputations

When you're building a partnership, always aim to work with companies who offer the same level of service and quality reputation as yours. In my field (trucking), we partner with other companies throughout the U.S. to offer better pricing and service than we could if we had to dispatch the trailers from our home base. Having good communication and a trusting relationship is key for this to be successful. - Craig McGraw, Trans American Trucking & Warehouse","One of the best ways to grow a business and gain attention for your brand is to team up with another company.

As 2018 draws to a close, many are looking to the future and considering the action needed to create a better world in 2019 and beyond.

Next year will mark four years since the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were agreed by governments across the globe. In the EU, concerns on how to achieve these goals have been a key part of heated discussions on how to spend EU institutions’ resources between 2021 and 2027.

In the course of 2018, many large financing institutions such the World Bank and the EU’s own European Investment Bank (EIB) continued to push Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) as a way to finance development projects. They have continued to advise and finance governments and companies to implement PPP projects.

RELATED CONTENT

But for many politicians, civil society organisations and communities affected by PPPs across the world, this is a deeply worrying trend.

PPPs are long-term contractual arrangements where the private sector provides infrastructure and services that have traditionally been provided by the public sector, such as hospitals, schools, roads, water and sanitation.

Last week in the European Parliament, we held an event in which we heard from development finance experts about the failings of many PPPs across four continents.

The European Network on Debt and Development (Eurodad) presented a joint civil society report entitled ""History RePPPeated"", which takes an in-depth look into ten projects across the fields of education, energy, health, justice, transport, and water and sanitation.

They include the case of Lesotho, where a PPP was launched to build a national hospital. Latest figures indicate that the hospital will cost twice the so-called ""affordability threshold"" set by the government and the World Bank at the outset of the project.

""PPPs come with a high cost for the public purse, an excessive level of risk for the public sector and, therefore, a heavy burden for citizens""

Closer to home, we heard about the Offshore Gas Castor Project in Spain, financed by the EIB, which was beset by poor planning and caused more than 1,000 earthquakes in the area. Despite never having been used it has so far cost the public €3.28bn.

We also heard from the authors of a new report on PPPs in Southeastern Europe. This included a waste management PPP in Belgrade, Serbia, slated for financing by the EIB, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation.

This project exposes serious failures, including a lack of transparency and public accountability to ensure proper contract implementation and improvement of public services. It also poses a threat to the environment, a risk of serious increase of public debt and increased financial burden on citizens.

These new findings add to a growing body of evidence which includes reports by the European Court of Auditors (ECA), and the UK's Public Accounts Committee.

The ECA's report, entitled ""Public-Private Partnerships in the EU: Widespread shortcomings and limited beliefs"", criticised the performance records of PPPs in several EU countries, stating that they were ""not always effectively managed and did not provide adequate value-for-money.""

The resounding message from all of this is that PPPs come with a high cost for the public purse, an excessive level of risk for the public sector and, therefore, a heavy burden for citizens. Every single PPP studied in ""History RePPPeated"" was riskier for the state than for the private companies involved.

PPPs also tend to lack transparency and are so complex that some governments have claimed that they will shift course.

The needs of people – living inside and outside Europe – have to be placed centre stage. Instead of promoting PPPs as the default option, EU institutions, development banks, and individual Member States should evaluate all options and choose financing methods that are responsible, accountable, financially, socially and environmentally sustainable, and in line with human rights obligations.

The European Parliament has a key role to play in monitoring EU institutions' work to deliver positive development outcomes.

As the debates on both the EU budget and the delivery of the SDGs progress, we urge all players to ensure that the needs of citizens, and not that of big business, come first.

This article was written in collaboration with Cecilia Gondard of the European Network on Debt and Development (Eurodad) and Zvezdan Kalamar of Serbian ecology and sustainable development campaign group, CEKOR","Public-Private Partnerships are a deeply worrying trend and carry far more risk for the state than for the private companies involved, writes Enrique Guerrero Salom.

While new companies are always looking for ways to grow quickly, in reality, it can take a significant amount of time before you see the fruits of your labor. But a quick way to grow your customer base is to tap into the reach that larger companies already have.

Other companies in your industry don’t always have to be seen as solely your competition, they can also be allies in growing your business if you have a similar target market. I spoke with numerous entrepreneurs who have had success building their startup through partnerships with larger businesses and they shared the strategies that worked for them.

Network, Network, Network - Both Online And Offline

Preparation is key to maximizing the results you can get from networking. “Research brands and people before attending conferences and events, and put them into a Twitter list so you can follow their tweets,” says Kelly Ann Collins, Founder & CEO, of Vult Lab, a social media agency. She recommends engaging with them on the social platform by liking, commenting, and sharing their posts, prior to the event to help make a connection.

Collins has previously partnered with Wix in Tel Aviv, a web development platform with 110 million users, using this exact strategy. She advises that not only are Twitter lists a great way to keep tabs on the people you want to collaborate with, but also a great way to learn more about their likes and dislikes, making your in-person meeting more advantageous. “A pre-event tweet to someone is a great way to break the ice in real life,” says Collins.

Highlight The Benefits You Bring To The Table

“Use your networks and target people or businesses with shared goals and demographics,” says Jarra Campbell, Founder and Creative Director of The Bondi Alchemist, a sustainable and ethical swimwear company. Campbell, who used to work on corporate partnerships for Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH), says it’s important to make sure your collaboration idea is a win-win for all parties involved.

“Look for possible challenges the other company may have and propose a solution. Highlight the benefits for everyone involved and keep it simple by making sure it will bring them money, not more work,” she adds.

Reach Out To Brands Who Have A Similar Message

A partnership between Reebok and findSisterhood, an anonymous social network for women, came about because of a mutual goal. Reebok launched their #BeMoreHuman campaign weeks before findSisterhood launched their new app, making it the perfect time for a collaboration between the two companies since both brands focus on empowering women and showcasing their strengths. Reebok’s campaign slogan says “we’re celebrating women who are transforming themselves and the world around them”, which aligns perfectly with findSisterhood’s company mission.

CEO and Founder of findSisterhood, Ana Pompa Alarcon Rawls, received a warm introduction to Reebok’s team which led to the partnership. “I’d recommend asking your friends, investors, or mentors if they know someone they can introduce you to, and check LinkedIn to see if you have any connections to the company you’re seeking a partnership with,” says Rawls.

Research Pitch Competitions Or Incubators

“It can take a long time to get visibility with large companies, so look and see if the company has any pitch competitions, incubators, or investment opportunities for startups,” advises Allison Monaghan McGuire, Founder & CEO of Walc, a walking navigation app based on visual cues such as landmarks or popular destinations, rather than the four cardinal directions: north, south, east and west.

The company won McDonald's Innovation in Transportation Competition at SXSW 2015 and BMW's Future of Mobility Challenge, opening the door to collaborating with these larger businesses. McGuire shares that these wins immediately put the company on the corporations’ map and then she looked for an internal advocate to further build the relationship. “Single out one person who is most excited about the partnership and let them lead internally. Give them everything they need to look good to their team and boss,” shares McGuire. “Then, wait. Wait a long, long time. Possibly six to ten months. In the startup world, this is an eternity - for some, a lifetime. But for corporations, this is standard. Once you've partnered, though, you have the benefit of having a big name behind you, which lends credibility.”

No matter how you make the connection with a larger business, it’s important to clearly outline the benefits you bring to the table as a startup. “Ensure values align. Research the other company’s products and their competitors, then offer value and know exactly what the value or offer is for them,” says Campbell.

Key factors that can give startups some negotiating power are the fact that small and newer businesses tend to be more nimble and most innovative ideas come from startups rather than from large corporations. Also, smaller companies can be much more in tune with the needs of their target consumer and quick to act on those needs.","Increasing visibility for your startup requires growth tactics and typically, a significant amount of time.

The company expects to continue expanding its use of recycled materials to reach 50% recycled plastic by 2025.

Nestle Waters says it is working with its suppliers, particularly key supplier Plastrec, to help it reach its goals. This follows last month’s announcement that Nestle Waters had expanded its partnership with rPET supplier CarbonLITE, which is building a third facility in Pennsylvania.

Fernando Mercé, president and CEO of Nestle Waters NA, says the company is helping to “stimulate a more robust recycling market and unlock the potential of a circular economy” in the US. In addition to its commitments to increase the amount of rPET it uses, Nestle Waters also invested $6 million in the Closed Loop Fund in 2017. In municipalities such as Waterbury, Connecticut, the investment fund is supporting enhanced recycling programs with a goal of increasing the current city recycling rate from 6% to 25% by 2020. Just recently, Closed Loop Fund announced a $1.5 million investment in rPlanet Earth, the world’s first completely vertically integrated manufacturer of post-consumer rPET.

In its 2016 report, The New Plastics Economy: Rethinking the Future of Plastics, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation found that most plastic packaging is used only once, and that 95% of the value of plastic packaging material is lost – an $80 to $120 billion loss to the economy. Nestle Waters says by treating plastic as a resource rather than a waste product, the company can reap the full economic and environmental benefits of plastic packaging.

UNITED STATES Saudi partnerships too valuable to give up – MIT report Tweet



[This is an article from The Chronicle of Higher Education, America’s leading higher education publication. It is presented here under an agreement with University World News.]



Months later Mutreb was in the Washington Post columnist, according to accounts from the news media and Turkish and United States officials. He is now one of 17 Saudi officials under sanction by the US government.



The ‘disturbing’ visit to the MIT campus is one of many facts laid out in a



But Lester, despite acknowledging that taking money from agencies affiliated with the Saudi government raises ethical issues, ended up recommending that MIT not sever those ties.



In short, Lester reasoned, no evidence has surfaced tying any of the organisations that MIT deals with – the state oil company, Saudi Aramco, for example – to the assassination. And, he wrote, cutting ties with them would probably do little to make Saudi Arabia less repressive.



“On the positive side,” he concluded, “these organisations are supporting important research and activities at MIT on terms that honour our principles and comply with our policies.”



MIT is just one of many colleges with financial ties to Saudi Arabia, but it was among the first to publicly re-examine its Saudi partnerships in October, when L Rafael Reif, its president, asked Lester to compile a report. MIT released Lester’s preliminary findings on 6 December.



The report provides an uncommonly candid argument in favour of maintaining ties with an autocratic state caught at the centre of an international furor. And it may dismay activists who have pressed MIT and



The Khashoggi crisis broke out as MIT was considering a ‘significant expansion’ of its relationships with Saudi Arabia, according to the report. Despite the country’s illiberal domestic policies and involvement in the Yemeni civil war, MIT officials hoped to be a part of what they saw as the kingdom’s steps toward reform. “The Khashoggi murder has deflated many of those hopes,” Lester wrote.



Nevertheless, he recommended maintaining MIT’s ties to the kingdom. Saudi donors, state agencies, companies and state-owned enterprises have spent millions of dollars to sponsor research, scholarships and academic programmes.



Saudi Aramco, for instance, the largest Saudi funder of MIT’s sponsored research, has contributed about US$5 million to MIT per year for the past five years, according to The Tech, the student newspaper.



Just over half of that overall Saudi spending in the past three years, from Saudi agencies, state-owned enterprises and universities, has funded research projects at MIT, according to the report. Lester emphasised that donors do not control the research they fund.



Gifts from Saudi donors accounted for 44% of overall spending, funding scholarships, fellowships and programmes. Many of those gifts came from Mohammed Abdul Latif Jameel, a Saudi businessman and MIT alumnus who has



The rest came from a smattering of affiliations in MIT’s corporate relations programme, its executive education programmes, and its alumni club in Saudi Arabia.



‘Difficult judgments’



Lester’s report broadly echoes the reasoning that



Some activities could bring “significant societal benefits”, he wrote. “Yet the partners and sponsors of these activities may simultaneously exhibit values in other domains that our institute does not share, or they may conduct other activities whose methods or goals are actively opposed by members of the MIT community.”



“Difficult judgments balancing the benefits, costs and potential risks to MIT’s reputation often need to be made,” the report continues. “Whatever the conclusion, it is unlikely that all members of the MIT community will agree with it.”



That much is clear. If MIT was among the first to comment on the Khashoggi crisis, that was partly because students and others in the MIT community had put sustained pressure on the administration since the prince’s March visit, said Lukas Wolters, a doctoral student in political science.



Wolters was disappointed at the report’s recommendations, he said, but not surprised. He was one of more than 20 political science graduate students who in October wrote an



“The values that they sort of ignored in this report, in part, are respect for human individuality, for human dignity,” Wolters said. While hopes of furthering science “might align” with Saudi partnerships, he said, those core issues of non-discrimination and individual human rights “are incredibly at odds with collaborating with Saudi Arabia”.



“The recommendations are basically ‘Let’s do nothing’,” Wolters said. Where the report appears to make the greatest concession – recommending that the college avoid future “large overseas engagements that require the physical presence” of many people from MIT over time – seems to be in fact a practical acknowledgment that those people wouldn’t be safe there, Wolters said.



MIT did not respond to requests for an interview on Thursday.



Two professors withdraw



Most difficult to consider, the report suggested, are MIT’s relationships with state agencies and state-owned enterprises like Saudi Aramco, the oil giant. While those organisations are part of a government that has been ‘implicated’ in Khashoggi’s murder, as well as repressive domestic policies and the war in Yemen, they don’t appear directly linked to those government actions, Lester wrote. He recommended maintaining ties.



Faculty members leading Saudi-sponsored projects may still decide for themselves whether to remain affiliated, Lester added.



The report’s recommendations largely align with



In one case at MIT, after Khashoggi’s disappearance came to light, two faculty members withdrew as advisers to NEOM, the kingdom’s half-trillion-dollar smart-city project.



That project’s advisory board had included Ernest J Moniz, a former US secretary of energy and a professor emeritus and special adviser to the MIT president, and Carlo Ratti, an urban planning professor who directs MIT’s SENSEable City Lab. Moniz was among the first public figures to cut ties with a Saudi project in October. Ratti followed later.



MIT’s report is open for comment until 15 January, when it will be forwarded to President Reif for a final decision.

Last March the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) welcomed Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, to its campus. Nearby, and captured in a photograph of the occasion, was Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, reportedly an intelligence officer who is often seen in the prince’s company.The Chronicle of Higher EducationUniversity World NewsMonths later Mutreb was in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul , allegedly helping oversee the murder and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi exile andcolumnist, according to accounts from the news media and Turkish and United States officials.

There’s no doubt that both of this year’s groundbreaking recipients have had a profound impact on the community, but their life-changing influence goes much deeper than that. All of the people whose lives have been transformed through one of these programs have their own distinct story to tell.

B Sharp

CSU’s innovative B Sharp program delivers the gift of live classical music to people with dementia, and it has been shown to have a strikingly positive effect on mood, cognitive function and relationships. The program is a cross-university partnership among several colleges and the Fort Collins Symphony,

During CSU’s first year of B Sharp, people with dementia and their caregivers were given passes to concerts during the Fort Collins Symphony’s 2015-16 season. Hal Squier and his wife and caregiver, Sue, have been a part of the program since its beginning.

“It’s something that we can do together,” said Sue. “Since we’ve participated from the beginning, I enjoy seeing other people involved with the program and their caregivers. It’s nice to have somebody who is in the same boat.”

B Sharp not only provides a “normal” evening out for the couple, but Sue notices that it’s an activity that Hal enjoys and benefits from.

Improved cognitive performance

“During the concert, he’s more alert, and he often leans over to tell me how good they are,” said Sue. “I notice the next day he’s more invigorated.”

Sue observes that with other social activities, Hal often wants to leave shortly after they arrive, but has a different reaction to the concerts.

“That doesn’t happen at the concert,” said Sue. “He enjoys the entire concert and doesn’t want to leave. At the symphony, he can just concentrate on the music.”

“We found that engagement in the B Sharp program resulted in improved performance on a series of cognitive tests after a nine-month period,” said Deana Davalos, associate professor in the Department of Psychology and the director of CSU’s Aging Clinic of the Rockies. “This happened in spite of including participants with a neurodegenerative disorder.”

Sue believes the B Sharp program is very important to the community.","Colorado State awards ceremony, two unique CSU community-based programs were honored with the inaugural Community Engagement Scholarship Awards, and nominations for new winners are now being accepted.

215,https://www.chronicle.com/article/saudi-partnerships-are-too-valuable-to-give-up-mit-report-concludes/,"Thu, 06 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",The Chronicle of Higher Education,"Saudi Partnerships Are Too Valuable to Give Up, MIT Report Concludes","Bandar Algaloud, Getty Images Mohammed bin Salman (left), crown prince of Saudi Arabia, greets the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Rafael Reif (right), during a visit to the campus in March 2018. Standing at the far right is Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, widely believed to be a key member of the crew that killed Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul’s Saudi Arabian consulate.

Last March the Massachusetts Institute of Technology welcomed Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, to its campus. Nearby, and captured in a photograph of the occasion, was Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, reportedly an intelligence officer who is often seen in the prince’s company.

Months later Mutreb was in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, allegedly helping oversee the murder and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi exile and Washington Post columnist, according to accounts from the news media and Turkish and U.S. officials. He is now one of 17 Saudi officials under sanction by the U.S. government.

The “disturbing” visit to the MIT campus is one of many facts laid out in a new report, by Richard K. Lester, MIT’s associate provost for international activities, that seeks to re-examine the university’s relationship with Saudi Arabia in the aftermath of Khashoggi’s killing. But Lester, despite acknowledging that taking money from agencies affiliated with the Saudi government raises ethical issues, ended up recommending that MIT not sever those ties.

In short, Lester reasoned, no evidence has surfaced tying any of the organizations that MIT deals with — the state oil company, Saudi Aramco, for example — to the assassination. And, he wrote, cutting ties with them would probably do little to make Saudi Arabia less repressive. “On the positive side,” he concluded, “these organizations are supporting important research and activities at MIT on terms that honor our principles and comply with our policies.”

MIT is just one of many colleges with financial ties to Saudi Arabia, but it was among the first to publicly re-examine its Saudi partnerships in October, when L. Rafael Reif, its president, asked Lester to compile a report. MIT released Lester’s preliminary findings on Thursday.

The report provides an uncommonly candid argument in favor of maintaining ties with an autocratic state caught at the center of an international furor. And it may dismay activists who have pressed MIT and other colleges to forgo the millions they reap from the regime and its affiliates.

The Khashoggi crisis broke out as MIT was considering a “significant expansion” of its relationships with Saudi Arabia, according to the report. Despite the country’s illiberal domestic policies and involvement in the Yemeni civil war, MIT officials hoped to be a part of what they saw as the kingdom’s steps toward reform. “The Khashoggi murder has deflated many of those hopes,” Lester wrote.

Nevertheless, he recommended maintaining MIT’s ties to the kingdom. Saudi donors, state agencies, companies, and state-owned enterprises have spent millions of dollars to sponsor research, scholarships, and academic programs. Saudi Aramco, for instance, the largest Saudi funder of MIT’s sponsored research, has contributed about $5 million to MIT per year for the past five years, according to an interview Lester gave to The Tech, the student newspaper.

Just over half of that overall Saudi spending in the past three years, from Saudi agencies, state-owned enterprises, and universities, has funded research projects at MIT, according to the report. Lester emphasized that donors do not control the research they fund.

Gifts from Saudi donors accounted for 44 percent of overall spending, funding scholarships, fellowships, and programs. Many of those gifts came from Mohammed Abdul Latif Jameel, a Saudi businessman and MIT alumnus who has donated $73 million to the college over the last decade, according to the Associated Press.

The rest came from a smattering of affiliations in MIT’s corporate-relations program, its executive-education programs, and its alumni club in Saudi Arabia.

‘Difficult Judgments’

Lester’s report broadly echoes the reasoning that Reif offered to critics earlier this year. The most basic standards for establishing partnerships — keeping research independent and students safe, for example — aren’t enough to determine which partnerships to actually pursue, Lester wrote.

Some activities could bring “significant societal benefits,” he wrote. “Yet the partners and sponsors of these activities may simultaneously exhibit values in other domains that our institute does not share, or they may conduct other activities whose methods or goals are actively opposed by members of the MIT community.”

“Difficult judgments balancing the benefits, costs, and potential risks to MIT’s reputation often need to be made,” the report continues. “Whatever the conclusion, it is unlikely that all members of the MIT community will agree with it.”

Whatever the conclusion, it is unlikely that all members of the MIT community will agree with it.

That much is clear. If MIT was among the first to comment on the Khashoggi crisis, that was partly because students and others in the MIT community had put sustained pressure on the administration since the prince’s March visit, said Lukas Wolters, a doctoral student in political science.

Wolters was disappointed at the report’s recommendations, he said, but not surprised. He was one of more than 20 political-science graduate students who in October wrote an op-ed urging MIT to end its relationships with the Saudi government.

“The values that they sort of ignored in this report, in part, are respect for human individuality, for human dignity,” Wolters said. While hopes of furthering science “might align” with Saudi partnerships, he said, those core issues of nondiscrimination and individual human rights “are incredibly at odds with collaborating with Saudi Arabia.”

“The recommendations are basically ‘Let’s do nothing,’” Wolters said. Where the report appears to make the greatest concession — recommending that the college avoid future “large overseas engagements that require the physical presence” of many people from MIT over time — seems to be in fact a practical acknowledgment that those people wouldn’t be safe there, Wolters said.

MIT did not respond to requests for an interview on Thursday.

2 Professors Withdraw

Most difficult to consider, the report suggested, are MIT’s relationships with state agencies and state-owned enterprises like Saudi Aramco, the oil giant. While those organizations are part of a government that has been “implicated” in Khashoggi’s murder, as well as repressive domestic policies and the war in Yemen, they don’t appear directly linked to those government actions, Lester wrote. He recommended maintaining ties.

Faculty members leading Saudi-sponsored projects may still decide for themselves whether to remain affiliated, Lester added.

The report’s recommendations largely align with other colleges’ decisions to preserve most agreements already underway and to withdraw from or reconsider only some projects that have not yet begun.

In one case at MIT, after Khashoggi’s disappearance came to light, two faculty members withdrew as advisers to NEOM, the kingdom’s half-trillion-dollar smart-city project.

That project’s advisory board had included Ernest J. Moniz, a former U.S. secretary of energy and a professor emeritus and special adviser to the MIT president, and Carlo Ratti, an urban-planning professor who directs MIT’s SENSEable City Lab. Moniz was among the first public figures to cut ties with a Saudi project in October. Ratti followed later.

MIT’s report is open for comment through January 15, when it will be forwarded to President Reif for a final decision.

216,https://www.glossy.co/new-face-of-beauty/how-erno-laszlo-is-modernizing-through-standalone-stores-and-increased-retail-partnerships/,"Wed, 05 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Glossy,How Erno Laszlo is modernizing through standalone stores and increased retail partnerships – Glossy,"Ninety-one-year-old skin-care brand Erno Laszlo continues to shape shift. The heritage company, which is after a millennial shopper, has made more standalone stores and retail partnerships its focus for 2019.

In the first quarter of next year, Erno Laszlo will be opening its first store in Shenzhen, followed by New York and Shanghai locations in the third quarter of 2019. Three more standalone stores will open by the end of the year, said chairman and CEO Charles Denton, who came to the company in 2011 after a long-term stint at Molton Brown.

“We want to create the ultimate space where our customers can engage, from product to education to experiential,” he said. “Shopping online is like sending someone your resume — it is 2D, but coming into a physical store is coming to the interview and experiencing someone or something on a human level. I would much rather do that.”

This is a stark departure from other legacy skin-care brands like La Prairie, which recently saw growth through influencer marketing and pop-up activations.

Revisiting the branded physical experience

This marks Denton’s second attempt at revitalizing Erno Laszlo’s store footprint since it was acquired seven years ago. He had previously opened a revamped “Institute” concept in 2012 in Soho that drew upon the brand’s flagship New York Institute, which originally opened in 1939 and closed in 1973 when founder Dr. Erno Laszlo passed away. The latest locale, which required customers to pay a $6,000 yearly membership fee for spa-like treatments like facials and peels closed last summer. “We continue to evolve, and we see the physical space as the largest data point for the brand,” he said.

This time around, each new location will not rely so heavily on past brand perception and will have its own store DNA, according to Erno Laszlo — the Shenzhen store will be designed to mimic New York’s Museum of Modern Art and touch on the city’s growing art scene. Additionally, the new stores will not subscribe to a membership model, said Denton.

Banking on Asia

That Erno Laszlo, which was reported to have reached $100 million in sales earlier this year, is focusing on China as its updated store stomping ground speaks to its growing presence in the region. Thirty percent of its business now comes from Asia (the U.S. accounts for 40 percent of sales, with the rest of the world making up the other 30 percent), and its Asian customer is younger than its U.S. shopper — 32 years old, versus 37. The company is fueling this Asian customer interest not only with standalone stores but also by opening up to eight more department store beauty counters in China in 2019 (Erno Laszlo is currently in nine), as well as creating non-selling experiential events in Shanghai via counters and with T-Mall once a quarter.

“It cannot solely be about selling products when you are trying to grow a new market,” said Denton. Chief marketing officer Kristy Watson agreed, saying the Erno Laszlo Asian customer research plan has been largely informed by these “qualitative experiences” to understand how this woman discovers product and, subsequently, shops. For now, Denton added that all of its upcoming 2019 stores, in the U.S. and China, will not have revenue goals to hit as he sees the physical locations as “a necessary investment.”

Doubling down on department stores

In many ways, Erno Laszlo’s Asia strategy replicates what is working in the U.S., as well. The brand, which is in 200 specialty stores domestically and in Europe, will be opening in 10 more department doors via Nordstrom next year. Erno Laszlo has invested heavily in the retailer, as well as in Holt Renfrew’s eight doors that sell beauty in Canada. (Between 2011 and 2016, the brand pulled out of other traditional department stores like Dillard’s, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman because they were declining as sales channels). For its part, 60 percent of Erno Laszlo’s retail sales still happen offline, down from 90 percent in 2011. (Its online sales are growing by 40 percent year over year, according to the company, and Erno Laszlo will re-platform its site in the first quarter of next year to facilitate an easier user experience.)

At Nordstrom specifically, Erno Laszlo has seen 30 percent year-over-year growth after cutting 15 products from its assortment in 2017 and focusing on best sellers like its Sea Mud Soap and Detoxifying Cleansing Oil. Events at Nordstrom have also been a boon for the brand, as they have been in Asia. In the last two months, Erno Laszlo hosted 28 events across the U.S. with the retailer around its Pore Refining Detox Double Cleanse, which debuted in September. Watson said that drove a 30 percent lift in retail sales. “Some department stores have a better, clearer point of view, which makes it easier for a shopper to navigate,” she added.

While stores and retail accounts may seem like traditional levers for Erno Laszlo to be pulling, Denton does not see it as an old way of thinking. “There is little crossover between consumers within each of our different channels,” he said. “We need be where our customer wants us to be and let her guide that. That is the only way for a heritage company like ours to stay relevant.”","Ninety-one-year-old skin-care brand Erno Laszlo continues to shape shift.

218,https://azjewishpost.com/2018/israeli-educators-visit-strengthens-classroom-partnerships-with-tucson/,"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Jewish Post,Israeli educators’ visit strengthens classroom partnerships with Tucson,"Visiting Tucson during the week of Hanukkah, four Israeli teachers and three school principals from the Partnership2Gether region were most surprised by the effort local community members invest in maintaining their Jewish identity. “It was a very powerful experience,” says Ravit Gedanken, a principal at Netzach Israel school in Kiryat Malachi. “It was a privilege to see how different and special this Jewish community is, compared to Israel. Understanding that here they work so hard to have a Jewish life makes my connection to Tucson even stronger.”

The visiting group members were fellows of the Jewish Federation of Southern Arizona’s Weintraub Israel Center and the Tucson Jewish Community Center’s Partnership2Gether’s school twinning program. This curriculum connects classrooms at preschools, elementary schools and high schools in Hof Ashkelon and Kiryat Malachi with local counterparts at Tucson Hebrew Academy, and synagogue religious schools in Tucson.

“The most meaningful thing was meeting the teacher I’ve been working with the last five years,” says Nesia Regev Livne, a first-grade teacher at Hofim Elementary in Yad Mordechai. “It has real significance when you can meet people face to face. I also felt connected to the values of the Tucson Jewish Community Center, seeing how they practice Jewish values in a secular environment.”

During their visit, the delegation shadowed teachers at the Tucson J’s early education center and visited THA, Sky Island Public Charter High School, and Canyon View Elementary School in the Catalina Foothills Unified School District.

“We were really surprised that the public schools are so excellent,” says Gedanken. “I was very impressed with how professional the teachers, schools and synagogues work from the educational side. And, how much effort is put into children’s Sunday schools to keep their Jewish identity. With all this effort, they looked really happy to be engaged.”

Nili Cohen Hammer, a second-grade teacher from Nitzanim School, was struck by the order and rules in local schools. “This is very opposite with what we are used to. They show a lot of respect for the teachers and rabbis. When I return to my school, I would like to talk to students about how the system works here.”

The delegation expressed interest in class structures and school procedures, says Canyon View Elementary principal Robert Henikman. “Lining up and not running in the hallways are things we take for granted.” On the other hand, Henikman was excited to hear that Israeli schools practice things like inclusion models in their classrooms. “Some things I thought were unique to the U.S. system. It is interesting to see that although we are thousands of miles apart, the similarity we have in values and goals for getting kids through the system is the same.”

The delegation also learned about the Tucson Jewish community through visits to the Jewish History Museum and synagogues. They enjoyed local attractions, hiking in Sabino Canyon and touring the Winterhaven festival of lights. A unique opportunity came to attend the Phoenix Suns Jewish Heritage Night in Phoenix and to join in various community holiday celebrations. Hammer said the group was shocked by the size and diversity of the Tucson Jewish community.

Daniealla Cohen and Ofra Gueta summed up their experience in a joint response. “We must say, this is something that makes a true connection between our communities. Now, we have a better understanding of the importance of the partnership relationship. It enriched our own Jewish identities to experience this, as well,” they wrote.

Cohen, Hofim School’s principal, and Gueta, a kindergarten teacher Aviv School in Talmei Yaffe, parted with a Mahatma Gandhi quote: “Be the change that you wish to see in the world,” saying they now feel this encapsulates the partnership program.

Also joining the delegation were Avi Hadad, Hirael School principal from Kiryat Malachi, and Adi Shacham, the Partnership2gether coordinator.

Local community members opening their homes to host the delegation included Kim Spitzer, Allie Silber, Emily and Max Ellentuck, Gila Silverman, Tamar and Yoni Green, Danielle and Paz Sharian, Rabbi Samuel M. Cohon and Rabbi Ruven Barkan.

“One of the things we liked most was the people, the way they welcomed us and their true willingness to know each one of us as individuals,” says Cohen. “Even as different countries, we are all in the same humanity boat.”

Henikman summed up the visit nicely. “In the end, we’re all about the children and their future.”","“It was a privilege to see how different and special this Jewish community is, compared to Israel.

Under the new PPP framework, the prime minister said sectors being targeted are electricity generation and distribution, renewable energy sources in the Family Islands, ports, airports, roads and bridges, urban renewal, information and communication technology and government buildings.

The nation’s chief was giving his keynote address at the Caribbean Infrastructure Forum held yesterday at Baha Mar.

Back in October, the government released a formal policy for public-private partnerships which Dr. Minnis said articulated a comprehensive, transparent framework that deals successively with the management, development and maintenance of public infrastructure.

“In these instances, the private sector’s partner skills, knowledge, technology and capital must be assessed adequately to assume the project’s risk and deliver high-quality design, instruction and performance-based services,” the prime minister said, adding that the key aim is to ensure that the government obtains value for money in these relationships.

The prime minister noted that over ten years ago, airport development and management was one of the areas in PPPs that could be pursued in achieving better management results.

He said the government is therefore presently seeking to capitalize on its favourable experience with this model used for the country’s main aviation gateway by exploring similar arrangements for other airport facilities.

Minnis admitted, however, that the government still has some ground to cover.

“The government also recognizes that it must strengthen its knowledge and capacity in the area of project preparation, procurement and monitoring to support investment planning and a stepped-up engagement in the private sector,” he said.

He added that many of these areas are being addressed by the government with the assistance of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), geared towards modernization and improving the capacity for program delivery in the area of national statistics, production and business processes.","NASSAU, BAHAMAS – The government is looking to solidify more Public Private Partnerships as a means of implementing priority investment and infrastructure projects that are aligned with its development objectives, said Prime Minister Dr. Hubert Minnis on Tuesday.
