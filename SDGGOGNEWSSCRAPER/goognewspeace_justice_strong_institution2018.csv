Lajcak plans to provide more detail on priorities for the resumed 72nd session in January 2018.

Addressing reporters on 20 December 2017, Lajcak said the remainder of the 72nd session will have a focus on migration, with intergovernmental negotiations beginning in February 2018 on the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. In parallel to the negotiations, Lajcak plans to hold at least two multi-stakeholder meetings to ensure a “whole-of-society” approach and ownership for the process. When asked about the impact of the US’ withdrawal from the preparatory process, he said it “will not endanger the process as such.”

The second priority Lajcak highlighted for 2018 is the high-level event on sustaining peace, to be convened in April 2018. He recalled that the event is mandated by the 2016 resolutions on sustaining peace adopted by the UNGA and Security Council. A number of events are planned for the lead-up to the April meeting, comprising a “road map” launched by Lajcak in November.

Lajcak hopes to use the April event to discuss the UN’s “ability or lack of it” to prevent conflicts.

Lajcak said he hopes to use the event to have a political discussion about the UN’s “ability or lack of it” to prevent conflicts and address existing ones. The discussion should elicit the experiences of leaders from different countries and regions regarding the UN’s performance, reviewing both good and bad practices and debating the UN’s abilities in conflict prevention. His aim, he noted, is for the UN to gain respect in conflict prevention and sustaining peace, “the same way the United Nations is a leader when it comes to the development agenda or the climate change agenda.”

On the SDGs, Lajcak said he will contribute to their implementation by holding three events: the launch of the International Decade of Water for Sustainable Development, on 22 March; an event on youth education, employment, and prevention of radicalization, in May; and a high-level event on financing for development (FfD), in June, to address the “substantial financial gap” for implementing the SDGs. He stressed that with the current budget and pace, “we will not deliver on the SDGs by 2030,” and noted the need for financial resources from the private sector.

The remainder of the 72nd session also will focus on several reform processes currently underway. These include: restructuring the UN’s peace and security architecture, on which the UN Secretary-General has been asked to provide a detailed report; reforms to the UN development system, on which Lajcak said the Secretary-General’s second report will be discussed in both the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and the UNGA; and management reform. Components of the UN Secretary-General’s proposed management reform were approved by the UNGA just before concluding the main part of its 72nd session, on 24 December.

Lajcak also recalled that he has appointed co-facilitators for intergovernmental consultations on the review of the 2013 reforms to ECOSOC (Iceland and Qatar), and for the alignment of the 2030 Agenda and the UNGA’s work (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Belgium), among other sets of co-facilitators he has appointed. In all of these appointments, he said, “there is always one man and one woman. So we have maintained gender balance… in these processes.” [Press Conference Transcript] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on Sustaining Peace Roadmap] [Sustaining Peace Roadmap] [Second Report of Secretary-General on UNDS Reforms] [UNGA President’s Comments at Closing Plenary of Main Part of 72nd UNGA] [All SDG Knowledge Hub Coverage of Migration Process] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on UNGA Adoption of Parts of Management Reform] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on Second Report of UN Secretary-General on UN Development System Reforms]","20 December 2017: The UN General Assembly’s (UNGA) main priorities for the next several months relate to migration, sustaining peace, SDG implementation, and reform processes, according to a statement by President Miroslav Lajcak during a press conference at the end of 2017.

This paper examines the history of antitrust legislation in the U.S., discusses the longstanding debate around its purpose, and offers data to demonstrate that, in recent years, it has failed to stem the tide of corporate concentration or decreased competition—with serious consequences. The authors conclude by recommending four reforms to antitrust enforcement that should enjoy consensus.

The past few years have witnessed an upsurge of interest in antitrust issues. Research centers and policy-oriented journals have released a slew of briefings and symposia focused on the topic. But antitrust is not merely an object of scholarly concern; it has also become an important political talking point. During the 2016 U.S. presidential race, both candidates called for strengthening antitrust enforcement on the campaign trail.

Events over the past year have also inspired renewed attention. In July, the Democratic Party released an economic agenda that included an entire section devoted to reinvigorating antitrust enforcement. In November 2017, to the surprise of many, the new head of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division intervened to block the planned merger between AT&T and Time-Warner. Since then, other deals have threatened further consolidation. In the month of December alone, plans for two megamergers were underway. CVS Health Corp., the drugstore retailer and pharmacy benefit manager, agreed to buy the health insurance company Aetna for $69 billion. Days later, a $52.4 billion deal between TV entertainment giants Disney and 21st Century Fox was announced.

As these dominant players take steps that would entrench their market position, recent developments on Capitol Hill suggest a serious re-evaluation of the purposes and powers of antitrust law and enforcement has begun. Bills seeking to bolster antitrust enforcement have been introduced in both chambers. Several members of Congress have even come together to form a Monopoly Caucus. And just this past December, the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition and Consumer Rights of the Senate Judiciary Committee convened a hearing to probe the adequacy of the “consumer welfare” standard that has guided antitrust enforcement and the judiciary for the past four decades.

In 1954, the top 60 firms accounted for less than 20 percent of GDP. Now, just the top 20 firms account for more than 20 percent.

A glance at history helps explain why this is happening. During the past 125 years, there have been three great waves of mergers and corporate concentration, each followed by a burst of political and legislative activity.

The emergence of the corporate-industrial economy: According to a study by law professor Carl Bogus, “In just a nine-year period beginning in 1895, more than 1,800 companies were eliminated through mergers and acquisitions. That mergers wave created scores of firms with more than forty percent of their respective markets, and forty-two firms with more than seventy percent of their markets.”1 This evoked a response by the federal government: stepped-up enforcement of the Sherman Antitrust Act—the first major piece of antitrust legislation—during the presidencies of Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft. This was followed by the passage of the Clayton Antitrust Act, which strengthened Sherman Act provisions and introduced merger controls, as well as the creation of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) under Woodrow Wilson.

World War II and its aftermath: Between 1940 and 1947, more than 2,450 manufacturing and mining firms were swallowed up by mergers and acquisitions. By the end of that period, the nation’s 78 largest firms held enough cash and government securities to purchase 90 percent of all the manufacturing firms in the country.2 This second wave of concentration also produced a governmental response: an expansive interpretation of key antitrust statutes by the Supreme Court as well as the Celler-Kefauver Act in 1950 and the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in 1976, which both increased government powers to review and block mergers.

Post-1980: Since 1980, we have witnessed a surge of consolidation. In the past two decades, the pace of concentration has been accelerating. The Fortune 500’s revenue as a share of GDP has increased from 58 percent to 73 percent. The share commanded by the largest firms—the Fortune 100—has risen from 33 percent to 46 percent. The Fortune 100/500 ratio went up from 57 percent to 63 percent. In 1954, the top 60 firms accounted for less than 20 percent of GDP. Now, just the top 20 firms account for more than 20 percent.

Over the last two decades, over 75 percent of U.S. industries have seen an increase in concentration, with the number of firms competing against one another in precipitous decline.

A sectoral analysis confirms this trend. During the past decade, the chemical company Monsanto purchased more than 30 companies, Oracle more than 80, and Google more than 120. Between 1994 and 2000, more than 80 aerospace-defense firms merged into four dominant firms. In a field once densely populated with independent publishers, just five conglomerates now account for two-thirds of all the books published in the United States. After a flood of mergers and acquisitions, Anheuser-Busch Inbev and South African Breweries today control 80 percent of the domestic beer market.3 Between 1980 and 1994, there were more than 6,000 bank mergers. In the decade from 1988 to 1997, the share of nationwide assets held by the eight largest firms surged from 22.3 percent to 35.5 percent. And then, in 1988, eight of the largest firms consolidated into just four megabanks.4 Pull back the camera and take a long view: In 1984, the 10 largest banks in the country held less than 30 percent of total financial assets. By 2012, that figure had swelled to 54 percent.5

These startling figures speak for themselves, but multiple analyses, using a variety of measurements, reveal that rising market concentration is a troubling, economy wide phenomenon.

In March 2016, The Economist released a feature story on rising concentration in the U.S. The cover captured America’s “monopoly moment,” depicting an anxious crew of businessmen fighting to preserve their territory on an overflowing pile of moneybags surrounded by a barbed wire fence. Atop the pile, one man stands above the rest, holding an American flag. The caption reads, “Winners take all: Why high profits are a problem for America.”

The story contains an Economist analysis of 893 industries and identifies the market share held by the four largest firms within each.6 It finds that between 1997 and 2012, two-thirds of industries became more concentrated.7 During this period, the weighted average share of the top four firms in each sector rose from 26 percent to 32 percent.

Research led by MIT economist David Autor confirms this trend. Between 1982 and 2012, the top four firms in the six major sectors of the U.S. economy became steadily and significantly more concentrated.8 In the manufacturing sector, the sales concentration ratio of the top four firms increased from 38 percent to 43 percent. Retail trade saw its sales concentration double to 30 percent from 15 percent, wholesale trade a change from 22 percent to 28 percent, services a rise from 11 percent to 15 percent, finance a substantial increase from 24 percent to 35 percent, and utilities and transportation a bump from 29 percent to 37 percent. Conducting this analysis for the same sectors looking at the sales concentration ratio of the top 20 firms in each sector yields similar results.

Studies relying on a different measure of concentration, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), reach the same conclusion—the American economy has become increasingly consolidated. Over the last two decades, over 75 percent of U.S. industries have seen an increase in concentration, with HHI rising across industries and the number of firms competing against one another in precipitous decline.9

Looking at sector-specific increases in HHI, research shows economy wide increases in concentration between 1982 and 2012.10 HHI in manufacturing rose from 800 to 875. In finance, HHI rose from 300 to 700, services 950 to 1,375, utilities and transportation 525 to 725, retail trade 125 to 625, and wholesale trade 325 to 350.

The fact that concentration is rising throughout the economy—and does not merely reflect the peculiarities of some markets—should give reason to pause.

Although these studies suggest the American economy is plagued by rising market concentration, Carl Shapiro, a former Deputy Assistant Attorney General for economics at the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, has urged caution. “I very much doubt that many antitrust economists would be concerned to learn that a market had experienced these types of increases in the … HHI,” he recently wrote in a paper entitled “Antitrust in a Time of Populism.”11 It’s true: The current Horizontal Merger Guidelines classify markets as highly concentrated if they reach above a 2,500 HHI threshold.12 Nevertheless, the fact that concentration is rising throughout the economy—and does not merely reflect the peculiarities of some markets—should give reason to pause. The problem may not lie in documented HHI levels failing to breach the point at which antitrust scrutiny is triggered, but in a threshold insufficiently concerned with the threat posed by concentration levels below those identified by current agency guidelines. Research suggests the latter.

John Kwoka’s comprehensive study of merger activity finds that in narrowly focusing on the highest concentration cases, antitrust enforcement has failed to capture the anti-competitive effects of allowing mergers at the enforcement margin to proceed. This permissive approach, he concludes, has directly contributed to rising concentration.13

And while enforcement against mergers at the margin could use strengthening, other studies find that concentration levels that would ordinarily trigger antitrust scrutiny haven’t. A Wall Street Journal analysis identifies several markets whose concentration levels now stand above the 2,500 HHI level deemed “highly concentrated” by the 2010 Horizontal Merger Guidelines.14 In the food and staples retail industry, HHI stood at 2,000 in 1996, and by 2013, the number rose to 3,000. The internet software industry saw an even more dramatic surge, from 750 HHI in 1996 to 2,500 HHI in 2013. The Federal Communications Commission finds the wireless market has also seen a dramatic rise in concentration. In 2008, HHI stood below 2,700, but by 2013, it had risen above 3,000 HHI.15

But rising concentration is only the first half of the story. The other half tells how the competition so fundamental to our dynamic, free market system is now under threat.

Several trends indicate competition across the economy is in decline. Taken individually, each trend might not elicit serious concern, but taken together as pieces of the same puzzle, they paint a troubling picture.

Today’s firms are astoundingly profitable. Corporate profits as a share of GDP have been rising steadily over the last 30 years. While in the mid-1980s, corporate profits made up seven-to-eight percent of GDP, today that share has risen dramatically to 11-12 percent of GDP.16 One could read this surge as a sign of healthy corporate success that antitrust policy should not punish. However, the trend also suggests firms may be earning returns above competitive levels. In this case, weakened competition has yielded supra-normal profits. Additional evidence bolsters this suspicion.

Not only are profits on the rise, but American firms today are persistently profitable. While a profitable American firm in the 1990s had a 50 percent chance of finding itself similarly successful 10 years on, a very profitable American firm today enjoys over an 80 percent chance.17 When the forces of competition are at work, rivals regularly displace incumbents. That persistently high profits remain unchallenged suggests many firms may be receiving a return on market power.

Rising concentration is only the first half of the story. The other half tells how the competition so fundamental to our dynamic, free market system is now under threat.

Declining competition is also evidenced by labor’s falling share of GDP. While many assume the decline in labor’s share has been offset by an increase in capital share, University of Chicago’s Simcha Barkai clarifies that the labor and capital share have been declining simultaneously between 1984 and 2014, offset by rising profits in the non-financial corporate sector.18 This is a set of trends for which declining competition is the most plausible explanation.

A breakdown in the competitive process is also demonstrated by today’s lackluster start up activity. U.S. startup formation rates have fallen dramatically over the last thirty years and among startups that are formed, more are failing compared to previous decades. This shift suggests start ups today are encountering barriers to entry and researchers find that consolidation helps explain the widespread fall in firm formation rates across economic sectors and geographic areas.19 The mechanisms of creative destruction are breaking down, with today’s start ups failing to displace incumbents and the market position of dominant firms becoming more entrenched.

Lastly, a paper by Germán Gutiérrez and Thomas Philippon finds a causal relationship between competition and investment. Today’s business sector underinvestment indicates insufficient competition.20

Taken in its entirety, evidence of rising concentration and declining competition suggests the time has come to reinvigorate antitrust law and its enforcement. The need to correct course becomes particularly clear in light of the economy wide consequences that have resulted from under-enforcement.



Consumer harm

In a comprehensive study, John Kwoka examined the price changes of 119 products before and after mergers and the establishment of joint ventures.21 He found that for nearly two-thirds of products, prices rose. In nearly one-third of cases, the price increase was equal to or greater than 10 percent, and in one-fifth of cases, the price increase was equal to or greater than 20 percent. Among the cases studied, the antitrust agencies only pursued action against 38 percent of them. Unless consumer welfare is simply equated with GDP maximization, an assumption that undercuts the basic motivation for antitrust enforcement, these price increases suggest that under-enforcement has had negative consequences that should corrected.

Economic inequality

Declining competition has also resulted in rising income inequality. Consolidation in the health-care industry, for instance, has meant that for some patients, the cost of routine health services have increased by as much as several hundred percent.22 Facing few competitors, today’s cable providers have raised the price of subscriptions.23 Concentration in the airline industry has led to fare surges for some routes. These kinds of price increases for routine expenses are particularly burdensome for individuals and families on the lower end of the income distribution.

But rising concentration does not merely hurt consumers at the bottom, it is further increasing the economic disparity among workers.

For all Occupy Wall Street did to place income inequality at the center of the national conversation, its focus on CEO versus typical worker compensation missed the even starker disparity between similarly positioned workers earning different incomes based on where they work. As multiple studies show, earnings inequality occurs largely between firms rather than within firms.24 What’s behind this trend? Former Council of Economic Advisers Chair Jason Furman and former Director of the Office of Management and Budget Peter Orszag find that, because today’s top firms enjoy super-normal returns to capital, workers employed by top firms often benefit from the higher wages that result from increased economic rents. This inter-firm inequality is widening the earnings disparities among workers.25

Declining startup formation, corporate ossification, and underinvestment

Declining dynamism has stark implications for the labor market, with a 30 percent drop in the share of U.S. employment accounted for by young firms over the last 30 years.26 With dominant firms taking in a greater share of total revenue, today’s employers tend to be large, national firms. This consolidation threatens potential competitors that have historically served as a major source of job creation.

From the beginning, the purpose of antitrust has been subject to multiple interpretations. The language of the Sherman Act is rightly described as quasi-constitutional, and its meaning was to be clarified through a common-law process of adjudication. The floor debate on the Sherman Act offered a stew of economic, political, and moral aims that individual supporters hoped it would promote. In the course of the debate, Sen. John Sherman, the bill’s lead sponsor, had this to say:

The popular mind is agitated with problems that may disturb social order, and among them none is more threatening than the inequality of condition, of wealth, and opportunity that has grown within a single generation out of the concentration of capital into vast combinations to control production and trade and to break down competition. If the concentrated powers of [a] combination are intrusted to a single man, it is a kingly prerogative, inconsistent with our form of government. … If we will not endure a king as a political power, we should not endure a king over the production, transportation, and sale of the necessities of life.

Sherman objected to excessive economic concentration, both on principle and for what he saw as its negative consequences. Others emphasized the importance of preserving local businesses, protecting consumers (and small producers) against the superior market power of large corporations, and safeguarding the competitive process.

For decades, the language of court decisions reflected this mix of public purposes.

When the Supreme Court banned the proposed merger between the Great Northern and Northern Pacific railroad companies, Justice John Marshall Harlan argued: “The mere existence of such a combination, and the power acquired by the holding company as its trustee, constitute a menace to, and a restraint upon, that freedom of commerce which Congress intended to recognize and protect.”27

Siding with the Justice Department’s Sherman Section 2 suit against the Aluminum Company of America for unlawful monopolization, Judge Learned Hand argued that the purpose of antitrust law was not merely to preserve the freedom of commerce but to encourage a particular form of industrial organization. In the Second Circuit’s decision, he wrote:

We have been speaking only of the economic reasons which forbid monopoly; but … there are others, based on the belief that great industrial consolidations are inherently undesirable, regardless of their economic results. … Throughout the history [of the Sherman Act and other antitrust laws] it has constantly been assumed that one of their purposes was to perpetuate and preserve, for its own sake and in spite of possible cost, an organization of industry in small units which can effectively compete with each other.28

Echoing this argument, Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote that antitrust should prioritize maintaining a decentralized economy over achieving cost and price efficiencies. Delivering the majority opinion for the 1961 Brown Shoe Company case, which prevented a vertical merger between a shoe manufacturer and retailer on the grounds that such a combination would threaten competition in the industry, Chief Justice Warren wrote:

Throughout the recorded discussion [of the Celler-Kefauver Act of 1950] may be found examples of Congress’ fear not only of accelerated concentration of economic power on economic grounds, but also of the threat to other values a trend toward concentration was thought to pose. It is competition, not competitors, which the Act protects. But we cannot fail to recognize Congress’ desire to promote competition through the protection of viable, small, locally owned businesses. Congress appreciated that occasional higher costs and prices might result from the maintenance of fragmented industries and markets. It resolved these competing considerations in favor of decentralization (authors’ italics).29

Finally, in the Supreme Court’s opinion in U.S. v. Von’s Grocery, Justice Hugo Black went even further, arguing that antitrust laws are meant specifically keep small competitors in business:

The basic purpose of the 1950 Celler-Kefauver Act was to prevent economic concentration in the American economy by keeping a large number of small competitors in business. [Congress sought to do this] by arresting a trend toward concentration in its incipiency before that trend developed to a point that a market was left in the grip of a few big companies.30

Until nearly the end of the 1970s, in sum, court decisions reflected two basic principles: first, that antitrust enforcement was designed to serve multiple purposes, political as well as economic; and second, that it was the courts’ responsibility to balance these purposes in light of the facts in particular cases.

Starting in the 1960s, however, a counter-movement developed, based on the proposition that law should reflect, and should be interpreted in light of, economic theory. This burgeoning Law and Economics movement challenged the underpinnings of many areas of law.

Rising concentration and declining competition suggests the time has come to reinvigorate antitrust law and its enforcement. The need to correct course becomes particularly clear in light of the economy wide consequences that have resulted from under-enforcement.

Robert Bork’s 1978 book, “The Antitrust Paradox: A Policy at War with Itself,” crystallized the Law and Economics-inspired revolt against decades of antitrust jurisprudence. “Certain of its doctrines preserve competition,” Bork argued, “while others suppress it, resulting in a policy at war with itself.”31 Multiple and incompatible goals, moreover, opened the door to judicial activism untethered from principle, leading to the acceleration of what he termed the “protectionist, anticompetitive strain in the law.”32

To remedy these ills, Bork proposed to eliminate the qualitative and pluralist dimensions of antitrust enforcement. “The only legitimate goal of American antitrust law,” he famously declared, is the “maximization of consumer welfare.”33 But “consumer welfare” is not a self-explicating concept, and Bork advanced an additional specification: “Consumer welfare … is merely another term for the wealth of the nation.”34 So, if a proposed economic arrangement maximizes total output, it meets the standard—even if it ends up transferring wealth from consumers to producers.

It will be observed that this thesis stood at some remove from most people’s intuitive understanding of what antitrust laws were designed to promote—or prevent. Bork had an explanation for this discrepancy. “Antitrust is a subset of ideology,” he asserted at the beginning of his book.35 He returned to this theme at the end: “To claim, as I have, that antitrust is a subcategory of ideology is necessarily to assert that it connects with the central political and social concerns of our time.”36

In hindsight, we can see that Bork’s “time” represented a hinge moment in post-war history when U.S. business felt increasingly beleaguered by foreign competition. Business leaders concluded that they could no longer afford the accommodations they had made, either to the interests of workers and local communities or to the interests served by laws and regulations that imposed additional costs on the private sector. The post-war system of trilateral accommodation among business, labor, and government weakened, business resistance to labor intensified, and conservative political leaders promised a better business climate, including less resort to antitrust action against mergers and acquisitions.

That was then. In the four decades since the publication of Bork’s book, new concerns have arisen about the consequences of growing corporate concentration, which include not only increased inequality and decreased entrepreneurship, but also the concentration of economic growth into a small number of geographical areas. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won just 472 counties, but they represented 64 percent of the GDP, compared to 36 percent for the 2,584 counties that Donald Trump carried.37 In many small towns and rural counties, a single “big box” store owned by a national firm has replaced a multiplicity of locally owned small businesses. As was the case a century ago, scholars and community leaders worry about the civic consequences of concentration, both for localities and for national governance.

It is hard to miss the references to the civic and political consequences of economic concentration that suffused congressional debates over antitrust legislation, but in our deeply polarized circumstances, the need to make political judgments could tie administrations in knots.

These developments have led to a division of expert opinion that Diana Moss, the president of the American Antitrust Institute, described lucidly in her recent testimony before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights. Until recently, she observed, there were two major camps. Conservatives invoke Bork’s total welfare standard and regard efficiency-enhancing mergers as presumptively legitimate, even if they involve anti-competitive conduct. For their part, progressives employ a consumer welfare standard broad enough to encompass “non-price dimensions of competition such as quality and innovation.” Progressives also back the “structural presumption” that mergers combining players with large market shares are presumptively illegal.

Conservatives are sensitive to the charge that the total welfare standard fails to distinguish between static and dynamic analysis—that is, between the short-term and long-term effects of mergers and sectoral concentration. In his testimony at the Senate hearing, Abbott Lipsky Jr. from George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School addressed this issue directly. “Given the absolutely critical role of innovation in improving our economic well-being,” he declared, the resolution of difficult antitrust issues must take into account “their long-run effect on economic productivity, including most specifically the possible effects on innovation, as well as output, product quality, and other key economic variables.”

This proposal moves the conservative position toward the dynamic realities of the modern economy, at the cost of reducing the enforcement clarity and predictability that conservatives have always highlighted as a key advantage of their position. In principle, it also opens conservative antitrust enforcement to the possibility of predatory pricing, when deep-pocketed firms lower prices to drive small competitors out of business, allowing them to raise prices later.

Recently, Moss observes, a third position—populism—has re-entered the fray. Contemporary populists regard the consumer welfare standard as inadequate, not only because it fails to deal with the modern internet-driven marketplace and the buyer power it creates, but also—and mainly—because it pays no attention to the political dimension of antitrust. If antitrust laws were designed to prevent the conversion of concentrated economic power into concentrated political power, then their enforcement should do so directly, as distinguished judges and justices had done for many decades.

Conservatives have long objected to the use of political standards in antitrust, on the grounds that they opened the door to arbitrary rulings based on the preferences of administrators and judges. Political standards are inherently unpredictable, conservatives argue, and do not give businesses the certainty they need to make long-term plans.

Progressives have their own objections to the populist proposal. They fear that replacing the consumer welfare standard would throw enforcement into disarray. Besides, they argue, firming up the consumer welfare standard, enforcing it vigorously, codifying the structural presumption, and requiring merging parties to justify their consumer welfare claims both before and after mergers take place would accomplish much of what populists seek at a fraction of the political and administrative costs the populist program would entail.

The populists offer a plausible account of the historical record, we believe. It is hard to miss the references to the civic and political consequences of economic concentration that suffused congressional debates over antitrust legislation—and decades of subsequent court decisions. At the same time, we share the progressives’ doubts about the wisdom of explicitly bringing political considerations back into antitrust enforcement. In our deeply polarized circumstances, the need to make political judgments could tie administrators in knots. As Carl Shapiro observed in his Senate testimony, “The core mission of antitrust, to promote competition, could easily be undermined if we ask antitrust to solve problems unrelated to competition.”

We cannot expect antitrust enforcement to do everything needed to rein in the political power of corporations. As Shapiro observed, agencies other than the Department of Justice and the FTC—such as the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the Department of Transportation—are responsible for ensuring competition in many sectors of the economy. Nor can antitrust enforcement bring about a society in which opportunity is available to all. Those who want a more progressive tax system or campaign finance reform cannot hope to attain their goals through indirection. Only legislation explicitly focused on these issues can get the job done. Effective antitrust enforcement based on sound standards and solid evidence is a big enough task to occupy reformers for years to come.

Before turning to specific proposals, we offer some general remarks about the perspective that guides our recommendations.

First: Although economic analysis is central to antitrust enforcement, economic theory is no substitute for empirical evidence about real-world behavior and consequences. Institutions matter—so do non-economic motives for business choices—and so do the kinds of cognitive distortions that the behavioral economics movement has highlighted. For decades, economic theory led former Federal Reserve Board Chair Alan Greenspan to excessive confidence in financial self-regulation. Greenspan’s rueful post-hoc reflections should serve as the epitaph for an era where theory blinded regulators and policymakers to facts on the ground.

The problems of today’s increasingly globalized, concentrated, and unequal economy are very different from those of the late 1970s, when the broad outlines of today’s antitrust regime took shape.

Second: As national circumstances change, antitrust enforcement must evolve. The problems of today’s increasingly globalized, concentrated, and unequal economy are very different from those of the late 1970s, when the broad outlines of today’s antitrust regime took shape.

Third: In practice, antitrust enforcement reflects basic presumptions. In recent decades, for example, administrators and courts have been driven by the fear of “false positives”—of actions that inadvertently sanction behavior that undermines neither competition nor the interests of consumers. In the process, enforcement has tolerated “false negatives”—instances of anti-competitive, anti-consumer behavior that should have been sanctioned but was not. The system has lurched from one extreme to the other and requires recalibration.

Fourth: In current circumstances where the evidence of increasing sectoral concentration is persuasive, prospective mergers and acquisitions should bear a higher burden of proof than they now do. Firms should be required to demonstrate how their proposed action will serve the interests of consumers, broadly understood, not just tomorrow but for the reasonably foreseeable future.

Below are four reform proposals for reinvigorating antitrust enforcement that should garner broad support.

Reinvigorate the structural presumption and tighten enforcement standards for horizontal mergers.

The current Horizontal Merger Guidelines state, “Mergers that cause a significant increase in concentration and result in highly concentrated markets are presumed to be likely to enhance market power.” In principle, this presumption places the burden of proof where it belongs, on firms whose proposed action would significantly increase concentration. The guidelines go on to state that only “persuasive evidence” will suffice to rebut this presumption.

The issue is whether these facially sensible guidelines lead in practice to effective enforcement. The evidence suggests that they do not, for two reasons. First, the FTC has focused its efforts on the highest concentration industries—those with four or fewer competitors—while other enforcement actions have all but disappeared. But recent research has shown that mergers below the four-firm level have led to increased market power and higher consumer prices.38 Similarly, FTC enforcement has shifted to focus on cases creating the greatest change in HHI, even though cases at the margin have had anti-competitive effects. This suggests that antitrust enforcers should lower the threshold at which prospective mergers are subject to rigorous scrutiny. It is possible to reduce false negatives without significantly increasing the number of false positives.39

The second problem with current horizontal merger enforcement: The standard for “persuasive evidence” sufficient to rebut the structural presumption has been set too low. Because much of this evidence involves the future effects of actions taken or not taken, it will always involve an element of speculation and will rarely if ever be conclusive. The best remedy for this problem, we believe, is to make merger approvals conditional and reversible if evidence emerges, within a reasonable period, of anticompetitive effects that harm consumers through higher prices, lower quality, or slower innovation. As former FTC head Robert Pitofsky has stated, this “look-back” authority has been used in the past and seems especially well suited to dynamic markets in fast-changing industries.

Update the Non-Horizontal Merger Guidelines

As we indicated earlier in this policy brief, the Non-Horizontal Merger Guidelines have not been updated and reissued since 1984. This reflects, in part, economic theory that minimizes the incidence and impact of anti-competitive effects from non-horizontal mergers. But here as elsewhere, theory and evidence diverge. Vertical integration can have anti-competitive effects, and the guidelines should be revised to reflect this reality in its standards and practices.

The Justice Department’s recent move to block the AT&T/Time-Warner merger underscores the urgency of updating the guidelines to reflect changes in markets over the past 33 years.

We are hardly the first to make this proposal. In 2007, the Antitrust Modernization Commission recommended updating the guidelines, as did the American Bar Association’s Section of Antitrust in 2013. The Justice Department’s recent move to block the AT&T/Time-Warner merger underscores the urgency of updating the guidelines to reflect changes in markets over the past 33 years.

Although it is beyond the scope of this brief to offer a comprehensive revision of the guidelines, we can summarize relevant considerations that experts have identified. Among their recommendations:

Do not rely on the presumption that non-horizontal mergers are pro-competitive, but rather base decisions on the facts and evidence of specific cases.

Give more weight to potential harms, using a sliding scale for mergers that raise more significant concerns.

Pay special attention to acquisitions by dominant firms.

Place the burden of proof on the merging parties to demonstrate pro-consumer effects.

Take barriers to entry into account in assessing the likely effects.

Assess the merged firm’s incentive to raise prices on “downstream” rivals.

Establish a clear process for post-merger review.

We note, in addition, a broad consensus on the skepticism that the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust has recently expressed about the adequacy of “behavioral” remedies for the anticipated anti-competitive effects of proposed non-horizontal mergers. To pre-empt these effects, structural remedies are the preferred strategy, even—or perhaps especially—if they lead merging parties to walk away from the deal.

Institute an enforcement regime to deal with predatory pricing

Oligopolies and monopolies can engage in two different forms of anti-competitive activities. “Exclusionary” conduct prevents new competitors from entering a market, while “exploitative” conduct allows dominant parties to take advantage of their market power. Most countries have regimes addressing both kinds of abusive behavior. By contrast, the United States has few tools to wield against exploitation. When episodes such as Mylan’s 400 percent price hikes for its EpiPen product evoke public outrage, the government is forced to rely on hearings and public shaming to induce corporations to lower monopoly pricing, a strategy that often fails.

As John DeQ. Briggs argues, the government could seek expanded authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act to go to after firms that exploit their market power against the welfare of consumers. What many critics viewed as overly aggressive application of Section 5 during the Carter administration has chilled enforcement ever since. But here as elsewhere, the pendulum has swung from one extreme to the other while real-world circumstances have changed dramatically, warranting a renewed look at this potential tool for protecting consumers.

Most countries have regimes addressing a range of abusive, anti-competitive corporate behavior. By contrast, the United States has few tools to wield against exploitation.

Exploitation can also take a subtler form, known as “predatory pricing,” in which a strong firm will cut prices temporarily to force weaker parties to accept takeover bids or exit the market altogether, after which the firm uses its increased dominance to raise prices. Over the past 25 years, in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision in Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown and Williamson Tobacco, antitrust actions against predatory pricing have halted. In this case, the Supreme Court required plaintiffs to show that the firm both set its price below cost and had a substantial likelihood of recovering its losses once its actions had altered the market advantageously.

Relying on Chicago School economic theory, the Supreme Court also argued that because predatory pricing rarely occurs, an anti-predation regime would generate false positives, preventing price cuts that are good for consumers. The Supreme Court acknowledged that its framework would also yield false negatives, because price cuts that remain above the cost of production can also have anti-competitive effects. But its aversion to false positives, which would chill “legitimate price-cutting,” trumped its concern about permitting some anti-competitive practices.

As C. Scott Hemphill and Philip Weiser point out, action against predation remains possible to a greater extent than many practitioners and public officials realize.40 The Brooke Group framework is flexible enough to permit case-specific evidence and more modern forms of economic analysis to prevail against offending firms. It would be useful, however, to bring a case that challenges the framework directly, especially the requirement that the contested pricing must be below cost. As Amazon’s acquisition of Quidsi shows, price cuts that reduce but do not eliminate a dominant actor’s profit margin can force weaker actors to capitulate, rendering the market less competitive.41

Reduce the costs of antitrust enforcement

Enforcing antitrust laws is typically slow and expensive. Individual cases, such as the Justice Department’s Microsoft and AT&T investigations, can last for a decade and consume an outsize share of an agency’s resources. In these circumstances, the government is understandably reluctant to initiate actions against large firms with deep pockets.

Prior to 1974, the rules allowed automatic appeals of district courts’ antitrust decisions to the Supreme Court, bypassing an entire level of appellate review. In light of the enforcement experience since this rule was repealed in 1974, the case for legislation that reinstates this rule is strong. This is particularly true for anti-monopoly cases arising under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. The longer monopoly abuses are allowed to persist, the more entrenched offenders become, and the more unlawful rents they can extract from consumers. Forcing firms to disgorge these ill-gotten gains after the fact is difficult at best, and there is no way of compensating potential entrepreneurs whom monopolistic firms deterred from starting new businesses.42

A fair reading of the historical record, we believe, will find both economic and civic/political motivations for the development and enforcement of antitrust legislation. It was perfectly reasonable to worry about the effect of interstate banking on the availability of credit to localities, and about the effect of large retail enterprises on the local businesses that bolstered the social capital of small communities. In light of this history, our focus on consumer welfare, broadly construed, may appear arbitrary.

But we are guided, in part, by the desire to craft a usable reform agenda. Working to improve a regime that enjoys considerable support across partisan and ideological lines is more likely to be effective than seeking to place the system on a new and highly controversial foundation.

Working to improve a regime that enjoys considerable support across partisan and ideological lines is more likely to be effective than seeking to place the system on a new and highly controversial foundation.

The Celler-Kefauver Act is still on the books. So is the Robinson-Patman Act. Still, we wonder whether it would be possible to reinvigorate the enforcement of national antitrust laws that reflect legitimate civic concerns without excessively impeding economic dynamism. That said, we reject national-level measures to pre-empt such actions at other levels of government. Nothing should prevent local communities from using zoning laws to prevent the construction of big box stores within their borders. Citizens should decide for themselves whether they are willing to pay somewhat higher prices to keep locally owned stores in business.

Federalism is the most practical means of balancing the often-competing claims of citizens, consumers, workers, and producers. But this is not always an easy course. Despite the long-term effects on local businesses and economic self-determination, hard-pressed communities will be tempted by the up-front jobs and revenues large firms can offer. There is no perfect solution for the asymmetrical bargaining power large firms often enjoy.","The authors conclude by recommending four reforms to antitrust enforcement that should enjoy consensus.
During the 2016 U.S. presidential race, both candidates called for strengthening antitrust enforcement on the campaign trail.
Nor can antitrust enforcement bring about a society in which opportunity is available to all.
Effective antitrust enforcement based on sound standards and solid evidence is a big enough task to occupy reformers for years to come.
First: Although economic analysis is central to antitrust enforcement, economic theory is no substitute for empirical evidence about real-world behavior and consequences."

In 2017, UN Secretary General António Guterres stepped up efforts to promote sustaining peace, a vision for a more preventive and effective approach to international peace and security. The concept calls for greater linkages between the three pillars of the UN—security, development and human rights—so as to address not only imminent and ongoing conflict, but also the root causes of instability and war. From a historical perspective, sustaining peace represents an effort to bring back the UN to the original purpose behind it creation: the prevention of conflict.

Since 2016, when the UN General Assembly and the Security Council issued twin resolutions on sustaining peace, discussions around this vision have advanced not only at the UN, but also through a series of regional consultations led by civil society entities. These meetings are designed not only to foment discussion around sustaining peace, but also to gather inputs from national and subnational actors, as well as international organizations, on how this vision may apply to particular settings. Lastly, these consultations represent opportunities to identify sensitivities and challenges ahead.

The Latin American peace and conflict landscape looks dramatically different from other regions. Although the risk of open conflict in Latin America is far from non-existent, the region has proven highly successful in the prevention and peaceful resolution of wars. The last open conflict, according to the definition provided by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP), ended when the Colombian government signed peace agreements with the FARC guerrilla, in December 2016. Moreover, the region has successfully become a zone free of nuclear non-proliferation as well as chemical and biological weapons. Latin America’s multi-layered architecture for resolution of disputes and promotion of democracy includes a wide gamut of bilateral arrangements, as well as a variety of regional organizations that range from the Organization of American States (OAE) to Mercosur and the Union of South American States (UNASUR), alongside more ad hoc arrangements for conflict resolution, such as the use of guarantor states in peace processes.

Despite these successes, it can hardly be said that Latin Americans live peacefully. Violent crime, including homicide and gender-based violence, has skyrocketed. Some of the region’s cities are listed among the most violent in the worlds, and rural areas see land-based disputes spiral into violence. Organized crime has taken root in parts of the region, in turn fomenting the illegal flow of arms and other illegal activities. Local gangs and transnational criminal networks present particular challenges for sustaining peace that merit local, national, and regional solutions. Inequality and poverty persist, and recent gains in these areas are imperiled by the precariousness of social mobility that is consumption-driven and unaccompanied by adequate education, health, and other social services. Alongside urban and rural violence, natural disasters and large-scale infrastructure projects that displace large populations trigger major migratory flows, both internally and across boundaries. And political unrest, especially around electoral periods, has led to recurring turbulence in many parts of the region. Institutions set up to address these issues are undermined by systemic and large-scale corruption that undermines trust in democratic processes.

Moreover, new factors of uncertainty are emerging. Structural changes in the world economy and in the global distribution of power, with the emergence of an asymmetrical multipolar world order, generate new risks (and poorly distributed opportunities) within the region. Emerging technologies and artificial intelligence will certainly have a disruptive impact on Latin American labor markets. As a result, even with the absence of traditional war, the region faces numerous challenges for sustaining peace.

On the positive side, most Latin American states possess high capacity and relatively robust institutions compared to other developing areas of the world. Coupled with a historical dislike for heavy-handed interventionism, this means that the concept of conflict prevention is often met with suspicion by local and national stakeholders. The idea of external actors stepping in to prevent conflict can be interpreted as offensive, and it can trigger longstanding concerns about threats to national sovereignty.

Given these sensitivities, how can the sustaining peace vision be promoted in Latin America? The basic toolkit is already available: the 2030 Agenda offers a strategic entry point for promoting this vision in Latin America, particularly among middle income countries (MICs). The set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), covering 169 targets, comprise an ambitious global agenda, but they were based on a combination of consensus and respect for national sovereignty. In contrast to their predecessor, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the SDGs are universal and therefore provide a strong rallying ground and a common purpose. Moreover, because the 2030 Agenda leaves it up to each country to decide how to achieve the goals, it leaves space for sovereignty in policymaking. In other words, even where external support plays a role, the SDGs allow for local leadership.

During the 2030 Agenda negotiations, SDG 16—“Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels—“ became especially salient for Latin America. This goal creates a space in which elements such as strength of institutions, rule of law, and access to justice can be addressed. Yet other SDGs are also relevant to sustaining peace, especially by underscoring the need for inclusive social policies in areas such as education, health, and gender equality. In addition, the SDGs address many of the most common structural causes of instability and unrest, including inequality, poverty, social and political exclusion. Focusing on the SDGs thus offers a focused, measurable, and politically palatable way for pushing for sustaining peace in Latin America.

At the same time, a cookie-cutter approach will not suffice. Implementation of the SDGs and, more broadly, of sustaining peace should be tailored to national and local context. The causes and dynamics of violence in Central America are somewhat different from patterns seen in South America or from challenges observed in the Caribbean. The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, CEPAL, has carried out diagnostics that point to fundamental drivers of social conflict, such as inequality, and these can also provide a starting point for identifying the most strategic responses for promoting sustaining peace in the region.

At the same time, the idea of sustaining peace should be coterminous with Agenda 2030, both because there are elements that may not be adequately captured by the SDGs (such as the role of youth in conflict prevention) and because certain goals may have to be prioritized. Making the 2030 agenda “fit for purpose” for promoting sustainable development is thus paramount. Moreover, stakeholders should ensure that pursuit of the sustaining peace vision does not lead to duplication or contradiction of the implementation of the SDGs. Moreover, the dovetailing of these two agendas represents an opportunity to innovate in the ways the UN supports Latin American states. By increasing coherence (for instance, through joint analysis and planning) and pushing for more localized and inclusive initiatives, the UN system may come to play the role it should in Latin America: that of a credible and welcomed high-level dialogue partner and supporter of effective solutions, whether nationally or through promotion of South-South cooperation.

The recent election violence in Kenya and Honduras reveals a pattern that’s all too familiar: An incumbent campaigns on a platform of law and order and declares victory after a contested election. The opposition then cries foul, mobilizes its supporters, and nonviolent street protests turn deadly after clashes with police. Regional powers and local brokers might try to reduce tensions by bringing the main candidates together, but society is split between calls for peace and demands for justice.

Election violence is costly–not just in lives, but in the damage it does to democracy by undermining the public’s trust in government.

The most effective way to prevent an election from spiraling into violence is by supporting strong national institutions and the ability of local leaders and civil society to address community grievances nonviolently. Unfortunately, prevention efforts failed in Kenya and Honduras

Recipe for Violence: Flawed Elections, Excessive Police Force

In Kenya, opposition leader Raila Odinga rejected the victory of President Uhuru Kenyatta on August 8, claiming there was widespread fraud after a tense and violent election campaign. Public statements by Odinga triggered anti-fraud protests in his strongholds, followed by a heavy-handed police response.

In Honduras, a flawed election process led to the country’s worst crisis in nearly a decade. It began with a questionable Supreme Court ruling allowing President Juan Orlando Hernandez from the National Party to run for a second term. The vote itself was marked by an electronic system failure and, when the opposition Alianza frontrunner Salvador Nasrallah took a surprise lead, the counting process mysteriously slowed down, during which time momentum shifted and Hernandez retook the lead.

Subsequent allegations of fraud by the opposition and irregularities noted by international observers helped mobilize a peaceful protest movement, but sharp-shooting police overreacted and killed about 14 people in armed clashes according to Amnesty International.

Peace through Integrity

There are ways to avoid this kind of election violence. One of the best guarantors of peace and justice are independent institutions. In Kenya, the Supreme Court initially demonstrated its independence by annulling a problematic election. In crime-ridden Honduras, specialized police forces usually guarantee election security, turning election day into one of the safest days of the year.

But, in both places, human rights organizations accused police of using excessive force and detaining protestors unlawfully. The Tribunal Supremo Electoral and courts in Honduras are staffed by political appointees. In Kenya, the presidential candidates undermined the election commission and Supreme Court by criticizing their work and threatening its staff.

An effective election commission should bolster confidence – politicized or toothless commissions raise suspicion and frustration.

“Cacerolazos” and Police Disobedience

Local civic leaders and organized collective action help ensure that election-related disputes do not escalate into violence. In Honduras, thousands took to the streets in nonviolent protests following suspicions of vote tampering. After President Hernandez called for a curfew, those confined to their homes banged pots and pans – a classic Latin American protest tactic known as “cacerolazos.”

The national police refused orders to enforce the curfew at first. Some officers said they feared shooting their mothers or sisters. However, clashes did eventually break out between protestors and police, resulting in about a dozen deaths. To discourage further violent escalation, the opposition should emphatically insist on nonviolent means, and introduce new tactics, such as tension-defusing humor. And security forces should be trained in effective crowd control allowing space for peaceful protest.

After the Kenyan Supreme Court deemed the presidential election invalid and ordered a new vote, opposition leader Raila Odinga and his National Super Alliance called for a boycott of the new election since there were no guarantees the ballot would be free and fair. The opposition did not call for protests, likely to avoid the types of clashes that resulted in 1200 deaths after the contested 2007 elections. Instead, Odinga called for a campaign of resistance and civil disobedience. While a polarized protest campaign risks violent escalation, a broad-based peaceful movement that transcends ethnic lines could help ensure accountability and electoral reform.

The international community can help

While national institutions, politicians and civil society hold the key to just and peaceful elections, there are several things the international community can do to support their efforts.

They can deploy observers to monitor technical deficiencies and identify intimidation, hate speech and other forms of election violence. International diplomats can also coordinate with regional leaders and encourage candidates to call for restraint, and make the necessary reforms.

On the security front, the international community can support security coordination and training programs to strengthen the independence and professionalism of police officers, ensuring they respect the rights of peaceful assembly. And donors should invest in inclusive movement-building skills and strategies. It is especially important to amplify the voices of civil society leaders working to prevent election violence, and nonviolently address the exclusionary practices that gave rise to it in the first place.

Elections are rarely perfect, and there are limits to internal involvement given the sensitivities about foreign meddling. The perception of picking sides can quickly backfire and limit future access. But, nonviolent action in support of an independent election commission, a professional police force, and a civil society capable of dialogue and disciplined collective action would go a long way to ensuring that elections are free, fair, and peaceful.

In The Name of Allah, The Most Beneficent, The Most Merciful

All thanks and praises are due to Allah. We seek His help and forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allah from the evil within ourselves and the consequences of our evil deeds. Whoever Allah guides will never be led astray, and whoever Allah leads astray will never find guidance.

I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, He is alone without any partners, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His Servant and His Messenger.

“O you who have believed, fear Allah as He should be feared and do not die except as Muslims in submission to Him.” [Quran, 3:102]

“O mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from one soul and created from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many men and women. And fear Allah, through whom you ask one another, and the wombs. Verily, Allah is ever watching over you.” [Quran, 4:1]

“O you who have believed, fear Allah and speak words of appropriate justice. He will then amend for you your deeds and forgive your sins, and whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly attained a great attainment.” [Quran, 33:70-71]

Verily, the most truthful speech is the Book of Allah, the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad, and the worst affairs are newly invented matters (in the religion of Allah). Every newly invented matter is a religious innovation, and every religious innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.

Dear Brothers and Sisters! Know that, in the atmosphere of distrust around the world, the mankind could not stand with clash. During world wars humanity witnessed a lot of bloodshed, massacre and distrust. The Cold War brought the struggle over ideologies (Capitalism/Communism) and in the Post-cold war world, the consistent use of the terms, “terrorism” and “extremism” at the political level and the backlash it faced in the name of “war against terror” or “operation desert fox” or some other operations has put a big question mark on the peace process at the global level. The adherents of one ideology are scared of some different ideology. The man of one thought is not in a position to believe the man of a different thought. Finally, the man of one faith or a religion gets irritated with a man possessing a different faith. At the end of the day, we can say that human beings are becoming “intolerant.” The process of intolerance has been growing in each and every community of human beings. We all know about our intolerance, but unfortunately we could not recognise the faults in one’s own community. To blame the “other” community is very easy because we have chosen the “other” as our enemy. This is a sad slogan of the new era. This sort of mental outlook of the people of the new era is well expressed by Samuel P. Huntington, while interpreting a paragraph of the Michael Dibdin’s novel, Dead Lagoon, that:

“There can be no true friends without true enemies. Unless we hate what we are not we cannot love what we are. These are old truths we are painfully rediscovering after a century….Those who deny them deny their family, their heritage, their culture, their birthright, and their very selves! They will not lightly be forgiven.” (See Clash of civilisations and Remaking of the World Order, by Samuel P. Huntington, page 20]

Are these truths truly reinvented by our statesmen and scholars? Can we identify ourselves only through knowing our enemies? Are enemies essential in this new era of global politics? Does religion help us to identify the “other”?

These are some of the important questions discovered in today’s politics.

For seeking identity and reinventing ethnicity, enemies are essential and the potentially most dangerous hatred and animosity can be found within the men possessing different religions, ethnicities, cultures or civilisations.

People who possess different ideologies and unfortunately share a border have the maximum chances of creating a fault-line. Most of these fault-lines are said to exist between Muslims and non-Muslims. Hence the biggest enemies to each other are Muslims and non-Muslims. In this way scholars, politicians and academicians who carry such a view point, unite the whole world against Islam. If we put it straight, this is biased study towards the knowledge of a civilisation. There are people who loath upon others’ religions and civilisations with a vested interest.

Dear Brothers and Sisters! Today, the Fulani herdsman has become the proxy unit for aggression and the expression of hate against Northern Muslims in Nigeria. And this is part of the strategy to contain, clip, cull and further weaken Muslims within the Nigerian community.

The onslaught is from all angles. Particularly noticeable is the glee with which some Igbos have found the opportunity to turn the tables against what they consider humiliating repression of the recent Kanu/IPOB uprising. This is matched and partnered by some Northern Christians political ebullience to reassert itself, against the background of recent marginalisation by the Buhari government. These two are powerfully aided and abetted by some South-Western ethnic politicians, with their powerful press – both the traditional and social media. Powerful elements outside power, especially those under the threat of corruption charges, have been providing some of the financial muscle and energy.

In all of this, religion is the main lever of manipulation. With history clearly being rewritten and Nigeria being misrepresented. An often told lie can begin to look like the truth, after all, especially to the vulnerable young, who know little or no history.

Today, the agenda has been set, of a Christian Nigeria, more than half the population in their claims, fighting a murderous and insidious “Islamist and Muslim design” to conquer Christians and deprive them of their ancestral lands. This is the false and insidious narrative, everywhere. And that this government is using state apparatus to aid this purported Fulani Islamic jihad. Foreign countries, especially in the West, are inundated with this false and dangerous propaganda.

They also disingenuously claim that this jihad is a continuation of the 1804 Shehu Usman Danfodio Jihad, which, itself, has now thoroughly been misrepresented by all sorts of ignorant opinion writers and speakers.

Respected Servants of Allah! What is actually facing us today is a political rivalry whereby some powerful Christian politicians have chosen religion as their main weapon of fighting not only the Buhari regime, which we all knows, witnessed and agreed has its many mistakes, shortcomings, failings and failures, but to, majorly fight Northern Muslims for political power. And the Fulani herdsman has unfortunately become the proxy for this hate and enmity, and for this fight against Northern Muslims. This strategy to leverage religion to force political advantage, and to possibly wrest political control, has been made inevitable by the complete ineffectiveness of political parties today.

The danger is that this creates more violence in a country already severely challenged and weakened by terrorism, insurgency and violence everywhere.

Respected Servants of Allah! We are living in a world where there could obviously be more peace. As Muslims, we realise this fact more than most people, as the peace of many of our brothers and sisters in various parts of the globe has been tragically disrupted: Nigeria, Palestine, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Chechnya, Afghanistan, Kashmir, Libya and other locales. Similarly, we are living in a world where there could be more justice. We read almost daily of killing and assassinations in various parts of the world where terrorist groups, militias, military forces, or intelligence services, oftentimes in summary fashion, declare victims guilty and then proceed to execute them. Unfortunately, such unprincipled political behaviour has become increasingly common in both the foreign and domestic policies of many countries, causing untold damage to their image and credibility abroad.

Respected Brothers and Sisters! These two issues, peace and justice, are joined in the slogans we hear from many activists, in the world and especially here in Nigeria, “No Justice, No Peace!” This linkage is logical, as justice must be considered one of the indispensable prerequisites of any lasting peace. This article intends to briefly look at the ideas of peace and justice in Islam and explore their deeper significance in the life of a Muslim and his neighbour.

My Respected people! In the Arabic language, the word peace is derived from the radicals S-L-M. The scholars of language mention four closely related terms that can be derived from this origin: Salam, Salamah, Silm, and Salm. Imam Raghib al-Isfahani says in his lexicon of Qur’anic terms:

“As-Salm and as-Salamah mean freedom from any external or internal ruination.”

Based on that, he mentions that true peace will only exist in Paradise, for only there will there be perpetuity with no end, complete satisfaction with no need, perfect honour with no humiliation, and perfect health with no disease. In this regard, Allah is known as As-Salam, because He alone is described as being totally free from any defects or flaws. This understanding of true peace being a reality associated with a transformed world is also understood in both Jewish and Christian theology.

At the level of interstate relations, if we ponder the above definition, we can consider peaceful relations between nations as a condition where violence, a state inevitably involving both internal and external ruination, is absent. In this sense, war can be viewed as an aberrational state. The aberrational nature of war is made clearer if we consider that murder, the ultimate consequence of war, is considered an innovation that destroyed the peace formerly existing among the human family. It is stated in a Prophetic Hadith that:

“No soul is killed unjustly, except that the elder son of Adam (Cain) shares in the stain of the crime. That is because he was the first to innovate murder [in the human family].”

At the individual level, peace can be viewed as an absence of the ruinations of the heart. One free from such ruinations will succeed, Allah-willing, when he/she meets his/her Lord. Therefore, he/she will enter safely into the Abode of Peace (Dar as-Salam). Allah says in that regard:

“[On] the day no amount of wealth or children will be of any benefit. [The only one benefited] will be one who comes before Allah with a sound (salim) heart.” [Quran, 26:89]

If one reflects on these meanings, it should be clear that the wars that Muslims have been involved in throughout our long history do not nullify the validity of the statement:

“Islam is the religion of peace.”

What is meant by that expression, and Allah knows best, is that Islam provides a path for the human being to enter Paradise (Dar as-Salam), and there he/she will know true peace.

Respected Servants of Allah! Peace has meanings wider than those mentioned above. One of the loftier objectives of our religion is to introduce into the world an ethos that facilitates the spreading of peace at every level. Our personal relations with our fellow Muslims should begin with the implementation of the Prophetic order:

“Spread peace between you all.”

This order is so pressing that the Beloved Prophet – advised its indiscriminate implementation. He said at the end of a Hadith in which he described one of the best forms of Islam:

“Extend the greeting of peace, to those you know and those you know not.”

This is a very weighty matter that calls for our deeper reflection. Its weightiness is illustrated by the fact that it is mentioned as being one of the things that completes our faith. The Prophet said in that regard:

“You will not enter Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one another. Shall I indicate to you something that will surely lead to your mutual love? Spread the greeting and spirit of peace between yourselves.”

Our relations with our spouses should also be characterized by peace. Allah admonishes us concerning those relations:

“And peace is best.” [Quran, 4:128]

Similarly, in our relations with other warring nations, Allah commands us:

“If they (the enemy) incline towards peace, then you should similarly incline, and place your trust in Allah.” [Quran, 8:61]

As mentioned above, peace is the original state that prevailed in relations between individuals and societies. This opinion is based, among other narrations, on the saying of the Prophet that Jesus:

“Will return the world to a state of peace” (Yurji’ as-Salim) after his appearance at the end of time.”

Dear Brothers and Sisters! Our lexicographers define justice, variously, as:

“To rule and to judge based on that contained in the Book of Allah and the tradition (Sunnah) of His Messenger and refraining from ruling and judging based on empty opinion.”

It is also defined as:

“Extending inherent rights [to their possessors] equitably.”

This latter definition emphasizes the importance of equity as an essential aspect of distributive justice.

The concept of justice is one of the essential pillars in the maintenance of both the natural and social orders. Allah, be He Exalted, has said:

“He has established the scale, therefore, do not transgress in the scale [of justice]. Undertake the measuring with justice and do not cheat concerning the scale.” [Quran, 55:7-8]

Justice, as many of our scholars point out, is one of the underpinnings of the order that has been established by Allah. This reality is also a foundation of a healthy social order. Allah says in that regard:

“O You who believe! Be upright for Allah, witnesses to justice; and do not let your hatred of a people move you to a position where you are unjust. Be just, that is closer to piety. Be mindful of Allah! Verily Allah is well informed concerning all that you do.” [Quran, 4:135]

This social aspect of justice has been beautifully summarized by Imam al-Qurtubi. He says, discussing the relationship between two words that are usually translated as justice (al-Adl), and distributive justice (al-Qist):

“Justice is the basis of all human relations and a foundation of Islamic rule.”

This saying is illustrative of the meaning conveyed by the saying of Allah:

“Verily, we have sent Our Messengers with clear proofs, and we have revealed unto them the Scripture and the Balance in order that they lead people with justice…” [Quran, 57:25]

Imam al-Mawardi has summarized the social implications of distributive justice in the following way:

“One of the things that reforms worldly affairs is the principle of distributive justice. It facilitates amicable relations between people, engenders obedience to the Divine Law, and brings about the prosperity, progress and development of countries. It is the basis of a thriving economy, strong families, and stable government. Nothing devastates the land nor corrupts the mind as quickly as tyranny. That is because there are no acceptable limits [to regulate tyranny].” [Ahkam al-Sultaniyyah of Imam al-Mawardi]

For this reason, Imam Ibn Taymiyya sees the responsibilities of Islamic government emanating from a single verse in the Qur’an:

“Allah enjoins that you deliver the Trusts to their rightful possessors. And when you rule over [or judge between] people, that you do so with justice…” [Quran, 4:58]

The Noble Prophet has said in this context:

“Surely the most beloved of people with Allah and the closest to Him on the Day of Resurrection will be a just leader. And the most hated of people and the furthest removed from Him will be a tyrannical leader.”

Clearing himself from even an inadvertent association with oppressive, unjust acts, our beloved Prophet is reported to have said:

“You bring your disputes to me for adjudication; perhaps one of you is less eloquent than another, and I rule against the wronged party on the basis of what I have heard. Therefore, if I inadvertently grant one of you something owed to his brother do not take it, for I am granting him something that constitutes a piece of Hellfire.”

Our impeccably just Khalifa Umar bin al-Khattab uttered the following penetrating words:

“Verily, Allah sets forth parables for you, and He directs admonition towards you in order that hearts will be quickened. Surely, the hearts are dead until Allah quickens them. Justice has signs and portents. As for its signs, they are shyness, generosity, humility, and gentleness. As for its portents, they are embodied in mercy. He has [likewise] made for every affair a gate, and He has made that gate accessible by providing a key. The gate of justice is a deep consideration of consequences, and its key is otherworldliness. Consideration of consequences ultimately involves remembering death and preparing for it by freely parting from one’s wealth. Otherworldliness involves dealing justly with everyone and being satisfied with what suffices. If one is not satisfied with what suffices him, no abundance will ever enrich him.”

Much of this discussion has focused on distributive justice. However, the Qur’an also places great emphasis on commutative justice. Allah commands us:

“Do not be moved by partiality to discriminate in meting out divinely legislated punishments.” [Quran, 24:2]

The Prophet Muhammad mentioned that one of the reasons behind the ruination of a nation is a lack of commutative justice. In this context, he mentioned that even if his very daughter were to steal, he would not hesitate to punish her to the full extent of the law.

In summary, this brief discussion should make it clear to any Muslim and non Muslim that peace and justice are comprehensive concepts with deep implications and we have to be people committed to peace and justice. We must clearly illustrate to the world that our religions are indeed the religions of peace. However, our striving for peace must never allow us to be unjust, nor should it allow us to passively accept injustices. We must take a stand for justice, as we are ordered in the Qur’an:

“Be you upright supporters of justice…” [Quran, 4:135]

However, that stand must go far beyond slogans, such as the one mentioned at the beginning of this article, and move into the realm of positive action; action inspired by the Qur’an and the words and deeds of our illustrious Prophet (Peace be upon him).

Respected Brothers and Sisters! Allah is our witness, we warned those state governments who want to ban the cattle rearing in their states, that the law will plunge their states into a war, but they refused to listen to us and went ahead to ban it. We also warned that the Fulani’s patience and silence over recent killings of their kinsmen in Adamawa, Taraba etc, should not be misconstrued for fear or weakness. We also called for thorough investigation into the recent killings in four Numan villages. We also warned about the massacre of the dozens of women and children of fulanis in Shaforon, Kikem and Kodemti villages. We warned that government and other relevant security authorities should thoroughly investigate those involved and bring the perpetrators to book for fear of reprisal attacks and for peace to reign.

Dear Brothers and Sisters! For Allah’s sake What happened to Fulanis in Mambilla, Sardauna, in Taraba State? What happened to them in Numan? And what is happening to them of killing, raping their wives and children, and stealing their cows in many states and many places in Nigeria? Why if the fulani man have been killed in Nigeria nobody will say anything? Why denying them freedom and justice in their own country? Why all this hate, hatred and enmity towards the fulanis? Are they not Nigerians? Are they strangers? Are they not human being like all of us? Why, why, why please? Haba! Let us fear Allah!! You see, at many points in our history, we make mistakes of confusing patience for fear or weakness. I hope, we would not make that mistake this time; what happened in Adamawa, Taraba, etc, to fulanis, would not go unpunished, let us be just, because in the absence of justice there must be a problem.

Respected Brothers and Sisters! We must come together and rise above ethnicities and religious bigotry for us to live peacefully with one another, and to know that Allah created us in different so that we may know and understand one another. Attacking, Killing, maiming and destroying each other or our property does not make us better than one another. We all are guilty and must repent and learn to live with one another as provided by our Constitution. We, as Muslims and Christians are a prayerful people, so please we should continue praying and resolving our differences in a civilised ways. May Almighty Allah help us in this direction. Ameen Ya Rabb!

All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the worlds. May the peace, blessings and salutations of Allah be upon our Noble Messenger, Muhammad, and upon his family, his Companions and his true followers.

May the peace, blessings and mercy of Allah be upon you all.

Your Brother:

Imam Murtadha Muhammad Gusau, from Okene, Kogi State, Nigeria. He can be reached through: gusaumurtada@gmail.com or +2348038289761.","Verily, Allah is ever watching over you.” [Quran, 4:1]“O you who have believed, fear Allah and speak words of appropriate justice.

(Yes, It’s Possible)","A man reacts as he removes debris in front of his house, which was damaged by recent shelling, in the government-held village of Novoluhanske, Ukraine, December 19, 2017.

Last month Vladimir Putin reopened the door to the creation of a peacekeeping force in Eastern Ukraine. Deploying such a force, if done properly, could bring peace to a conflict that has dragged on for nearly four years. Without it, the conflict could return to a boil, jeopardizing Ukraine’s stability and destroying any basis for reducing tensions between Russia and the West.

This is not the first time Putin has suggested a peacekeeping force. His original proposal in September was insufficient; the force would have been confined to the line of contact separating Ukraine from the occupied territories and limited to protecting the unarmed monitors of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Most experts view the proposal as largely a public-relations exercise. As written, the force would more likely freeze the conflict than end it.

Skepticism about Putin’s intentions is justified. The Russians have been disingenuous about everything they have been doing to destabilize Ukraine since 2013, including denying the fact that Russian troops in the Donbas command and control the so-called separatist forces.

Putin may see prolonging the status quo in the Donbas—with persistent ceasefire violations and low-level violence provoked mostly by Russian-led forces—as the safest option for now, with the Russian presidential election approaching in March and renewed turmoil in Kyiv. After all, occupying the Donbas is a means to an end: destabilizing Ukraine and undermining its chances for a European future. Although Russia has other forms of leverage it can use against Ukraine, keeping the conflict going while Ukrainians fight among themselves may be the easiest choice in the short term.

Putin’s calculus may change after the election, however, as the financial and political costs of the occupation continue to rise. Increased Western pressure, including the threat of additional sanctions and the delivery of new lethal weapons to Ukraine, could convince Putin that time is not on Russia’s side and that he should give back the Donbas. In that event, a robust UN peacekeeping force will be essential.

A robust mandate does not mean peace enforcement. Peace depends on Russian agreement to implement the Minsk agreements, which call for the restoration of Ukrainian sovereignty over the entire Donbas, including the international border, and set key political and military milestones toward these ends. But Minsk lacks the implementation mechanisms needed to ensure a smooth and orderly transition back to Ukrainian sovereignty, with safety for the population on both sides. That’s where a UN peacekeeping force comes into play.

With the entry of a robust peacekeeping force, Russia could withdraw its thousands of officers and soldiers who are operating in Donbas without insignias, disband the illegal militias of the two self-declared republics, and remove Moscow’s massive arsenal of heavy weapons. Once in place along the international border, the peacekeeping force would ensure that Russian forces and weapons were no longer able to enter the Donbas with impunity.

The peacekeeping force should ideally comprise both military and police forces with the capacity to maintain security along the line of contact and the international border, establish public order across the Donbas, and deal with “spoilers” on either side. By postponing the entry of Ukrainian armed forces and police until the end of a transition period, the peacekeeping force would respond to Putin’s oft-repeated concern about “reprisals” against the local population, however exaggerated that concern may be.

The arrival of UN peacekeepers would encourage internally displaced persons to return to their homes in the Donbas and the restoration of industrial and agricultural production. A separate international initiative for the reconstruction of the Donbas—possibly led by the European Union—will be needed to jumpstart the economy. The peacekeeping force could carry out demining as an early priority in the reconstruction effort.

Establishing an interim civilian administration, as has been the case in previous UN operations, is also important. The administration would restore competent governance and criminal justice following the disbandment of the self-declared people’s republics. This could allow a more gradual return of Ukrainian political and judicial institutions, which may not be immediately welcome.

Creating secure conditions to hold elections is pivotal. Internationally-certified elections would unlock other aspects of Minsk, including implementation of the law on special status for the Donbas and amnesty, and open the way for Ukraine to reestablish control over the international border. Having a peacekeeping force and international administration in place for several months prior to elections could create the stability needed for campaigning and voting to occur in an atmosphere free of intimidation. Reestablishing access for Ukrainian political parties, NGOs, and news media are essential preconditions for free and fair elections.

The peacekeeping force will need to deploy rapidly in order to take the place of Russian and Russian-led forces and minimize the period in which the peacekeepers and the illegal militias would operate alongside each other. Rapid deployment is not the UN’s forte, however. For this reason, there may be advantages to delegating execution of the UN mandate to a multinational coalition of the willing, under the political direction of a strong special representative of the secretary general, who would report to the UN Security Council.

Troop-contributing nations could include non-NATO European countries (such as Austria, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland), a few CIS countries acceptable to Ukraine and Russia (such as Armenia and Kazakhstan), along with militarily capable countries from outside Europe.

Other questions that would need to be considered include the size of the force (estimates range from 20,000 to 50,000), the relationship between the peacekeeping force and the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, and the duration of the operation. Especially tricky will be how to deal with the “local militias” that can be maintained under Minsk even after the restoration of Ukrainian sovereignty.

Experts usually focus on how to convince Putin to implement Minsk, but we shouldn’t underestimate the difficulty of getting the Ukrainians to deliver. The Minsk agreements have become increasingly unpopular among Ukrainian elites. Critics rightfully claim that the terms were imposed on Ukraine. They argue that, even if Russia withdrew and the agreements were fully implemented, the reintegrated Donbas would serve as a destabilizing “Trojan Horse.” Moreover, they suspect Russia would use ambiguities in the UN mandate to suspend implementation before full Ukrainian sovereignty had been restored—turning the Donbas into a UN-enforced frozen conflict, similar to what happened in the occupied regions of Georgia in the 1990s. Some suspect that is Putin’s real objective, and they may be right.

In sum, there are many challenges in defining the mandate for a UN peacekeeping force in the Donbas and ensuring it succeeds. It would still leave unresolved Russia’s illegal annexation and occupation of Crimea, which the West should never recognize. But full implementation of the Minsk agreements is the only way to begin the process of restoring Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity, and would be a first step toward rebuilding the European rules-based order. It should be one of our highest priorities in 2018.

“An Israeli father of six was killed last night in cold blood by Palestinian terrorists. Hamas praises the killers and PA laws will provide them financial rewards,” Friedman said in a statement posted to Twitter in response to the killing of Rabbi Raziel Shevach in a drive-by shooting attack Tuesday night.

“Look no further to why there is no peace. Praying for the bereaved Shevach family,” he added, echoing accusations leveled by Israeli officials in the wake of the terror attack.

Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely issued a statement thanking Friedman for his remarks. “Dear Ambassador Friedman, we deeply appreciate your solidarity with Israel. We value your partnership in the fight against terror and your understanding that the Palestinian Authority’s support of terrorists lies at the root of the problem,” she tweeted.

The Palestinian Authority, which has expressed a refusal to engage in peace talks with Israel unless the Trump administration walks back the US president’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, has issued no statement on the killing.

MK Ahmad Tibi of the Joint (Arab) List faction blasted Friedman’s tweet, accusing the US envoy of “hypocrisy” for failing to condemn incidents in which Palestinian protesters were shot by Israeli forces.

“Ambassador Friedman is shocked by death? I didn’t hear him when an Israeli sniper killed double amputee Ibrahim Abu Thurayeh or when the kid Muhammad Tamimi was shot in the head and wounded. Because of this hypocrisy and double standard, and because of the Trump administration’s positions, the conflict is going on and blood is being shed. And when these are the representatives of the administration, don’t ask why there is no peace.”

The United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East Peace process, Nickolay Mladenov, also appeared to accuse the Palestinians of inciting violence and hindering the peace process, albeit indirectly. “There is no justification for terror and those who condone it, praise it or glorify it. This is not the path to peace! The perpetrators of yesterday’s attack must be brought to justice,” he tweeted.

The German foreign ministry condemned the attack and called on “all parties to act to calm the situation.”

“The deadly attack in which a resident of an Israeli outpost in the West Bank was murdered yesterday is most regrettable. We strongly condemn this execrable murder,” a spokesman said. “We would like to express our sincere condolences to the family and to relatives of the murder victim.

“All those who bear responsibility for this attack or welcome it inflame the violence that makes it difficult to find a solution to the Middle East conflict through negotiation,” the spokesperson continued. “We expect all parties to act to calm the situation.”

Other international condemnations included statements from Martin Weiss, the Austrian ambassador to Israel, who said Raziel was “cowardly murdered,” and US Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who called the attack “horrific” and offered his “profound condolences” and prayers.

Unlike previous US envoys, Friedman was known as a strong supporter of Israeli settlements before he took office, serving as president of American Friends of Bet El Institutions, an organization that supports the large West Bank settlement near Ramallah.

That support has continued since his appointment as ambassador. In September, Friedman said that settlements “are part of Israel.”

In November, he canceled an appearance at a memorial ceremony for slain American teen Ezra Schwartz in the wake of a media report that it would be taking place at an illegal West Bank outpost.

Last week, Friedman paid a condolence visit at the home of Likud MK Yehudah Glick in the settlement of Otniel, following the death of his wife.

Two weeks ago, Israel’s Kan public broadcaster reported that Friedman had asked the US State Department to stop calling Israel’s presence in the West Bank an “occupation” in official documents. He reportedly recommended using the term “West Bank territory” instead of the “occupied territories.”

The State Department rejected the request, according to the report, but agreed to take up the subject again in the future. A State Department official later called the report “twisted and misleading” when asked for comment.","The US ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, launched a scathing attack on the Palestinians and their leadership on Wednesday, blaming them squarely for the lack of peace with Israel.

Sparked by a 2013 political dispute between President Salva Kiir and his deputy, Riek Machar, the crisis has since taken on the explosive overtones of ethnic tribalism to morph into a contest between Dinka-dominated government forces and a range of increasingly fragmented ethnic militias. To date, over 60,000 lives have been claimed by the war while four million have been displaced by fighting and famine. Meanwhile, half of those displaced have spilled over South Sudan’s borders into neighboring Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Sudan, threatening further regional strife. In the wake of the failed 2015 Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (ARCSS), and in the face of deepening refugee and food security crises, it’s clear that future peacemaking efforts must draw upon the influence of regional and international actors while incorporating incentives for all sides of the conflict to come to the table in search of nonviolent solutions.

According to Payton Knopf of the United States Institute of Peace, there are currently five civil wars unfolding within South Sudan’s broader conflict: (1) a war of resistance against President Kiir’s regime in Juba by the population of the surrounding Greater Equatoria region; (2) a land contest between the Dinka and the Shilluk in the Upper Nile; (3) an intra-Nuer war in Unity State; (4) a drive to establish Dinka primacy in Greater Bahr el Ghazal; and (5) diversionary “crises of convenience” in Lakes and Jonglei that have been exploited by Kiir and his allies. Such varied and widespread conflict, which includes the destruction or takeover of key infrastructure elements, has sent South Sudan into an economic spiral, with hyperinflation, a weak exchange rate, and soaring food prices dimming an already bleak humanitarian picture. Stripped of more conventional means of livelihood, many South Sudanese have turned to petty theft or gang activity to survive. Yet despite a surge in crime, law enforcement salaries have all but ground to a halt, setting off a vicious cycle. Without strong financial incentives for officers to enforce the rule of law – and often without the necessary equipment or fuel needed to do so – a vital civic institution has been compromised, promising a further cascade of criminal activity and fewer means of combating it.

A similarly vicious cycle has emerged in the realm of humanitarian aid. As the most vulnerable areas of the country have been thrown into varying states of lawlessness, humanitarian organizations have begun to reconsider operations in parts of South Sudan. This has been especially true following incidents of violence against aid workers, the most notable of which involved the death of three World Food Programme porters in April 2017. Without the aid and protection provided by such groups, those in the most devastated parts of the country have suffered increasing human rights abuses.

The delivery of consistent and comprehensive aid has also been complicated by the splintering of opposition forces. The World Food Programme’s convoys to the city of Yambio, which once lasted two days but now require 13 separate permissions from armed groups along the route from North Sudan, provide a window into such difficulties.

Meanwhile, a host of competing or inconsistent interests outside of South Sudan have only prolonged the conflict. Some, such as Ugandan president Yoweri Musevni, have sought to profit from the fighting by supplying troops, arms, and other forms of aid to government forces in Juba. Others, including most east African leaders, have called for a recommitment to 2015’s ARCSS peace accord, urging all warring parties to come to the table. Yet many Western donors have frozen their support for the peace process, and a December 2017 ceasefire sponsored by the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development has been repeatedly violated. For the foreseeable future, while facing little external consensus or pressure, President Kiir’s forces can be expected to continue making significant strides on the battlefield, leaving little incentive to seek peace.

The way forward

While many paths to peace have been suggested, experts caution against some of the most popular strategies. One common appeal involves the holding of general elections this year, a provision contained in 2015’s ARCSS. Such an election would likely end in failure, considering that key metrics of the ARCSS that would ensure the proper institutional foundations required to conduct democratic elections have not been met. Moreover, an election held in South Sudan’s current political climate would almost certainly emerge as a fresh channel of conflict, widening the chasm between the country’s warring factions. A second option calls for the establishment of a “hybrid court,” another ARCSS proviso, in order to investigate and prosecute those involved in the war’s human rights violations. Yet considering that those guilty of war crimes stand to benefit more from victory, entrenchment, or hiding rather than from a cease-fire, the pursuit of justice at this stage of the conflict is seen by most observers as a counterproductive one.

Beyond those already mentioned, a variety of factors currently stand in the way of a successful domestic peacemaking process, or National Dialogue. Most significantly, insufficient trust between the Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLA) – headed by President Kiir – and the Machar-led Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-in-Opposition (SPLM-IO) has kept the conflict’s two primary combatants from entering peace talks despite repeated invitations to the latter. Meanwhile, President Kiir has removed himself as patron of the National Dialogue process, allowing “the South Sudanese people to take the lead.” Yet with so many displaced and starving, and with the country’s vast restrictions to freedom of the press, such a shift is more likely to be a step backward than forward.

With these caveats in mind, experts have urged regional and international actors to pursue a number of concurrent strategies. First, mediators must harness South Sudan’s rich heritage of peacebuilding in the organization of talks and other peace initiatives. Central to this tradition is the establishment of trust between interlocutors, an element which could be incorporated by inviting a broad cross-section of South Sudanese society into the dialogue process. In view of current divisions, it is vital that this cross-section – including tribal elders, local bishops, respected religious groups, and all shades of political opposition – be represented in future talks. The inclusion of women may also be pivotal, a theory supported by an International Peace Institute analysis suggesting that when women are included in peace processes, there is a 20 percent increase in the probability of an agreement lasting at least two years and a 35 percent increase in the probability of one lasting at least 15 years. Such findings are supported by the South Sudanese people’s own history: at the successful Wunlit Dinka-Nuer Peace Conference of 1999, a third of the delegates were women.

Mobilizing young people to join the peacemaking process may also prove worthwhile. One asset furnished by young people, as Catholic bishop Edward Hiiboro Kussala of Tombura-Yambio notes, is a shift in perspective. “Unlike you, we [elders] are entrenched in our old habits, prejudices, hate, injustices, and even pettiness,” Bishop Kussala wrote in a recent statement. “It is not easy to let go of our selfishness, for it is how we have been able to survive and preserve ourselves in these dark times.” Beyond lending this healthier perspective, the bishop’s September 2017 statement called on the young to initiate grassroots peace efforts through social media and other forms of communication, a niche that “your bright creative minds are so agile at” exploiting.

As a third pillar of the peace process, experts have called for the proper application of regional and international pressure on the conflict’s primary drivers. Most urgently, the UN Security Council and the African Union Peace and Security Council must continue striving for a comprehensive arms embargo in South Sudan, the successful imposition of which would outlaw the material support of regional governments and build momentum for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

Absent immediate multilateral solutions, however, the United States can draw on several forms of financial and diplomatic leverage in order to hamper the Kiir regime. On the question of weapons flows, the United States is in a unique position to alter the shape of South Sudan’s conflict given that Uganda, a main transit point of arms and ammunition to Kiir’s forces, is also the largest recipient of U.S. military assistance in sub-Saharan Africa. Obviously, the United States could threaten to withdraw this support if Uganda continues its attempts to profit from South Sudan’s conflict. Targeting Kiir’s government more directly, the United States could draw on its influence among global financial bodies (such as the IMF and the World Bank) to block South Sudan’s access to channels of international aid. On a more individual level, the U.S. could impose targeted sanctions, asset freezes, or anti-money laundering provisions on top South Sudanese officials who have profited from the conflict.

Finally, the United States has the option of downgrading or severing its diplomatic relationship with South Sudan on the grounds of Kiir’s questionable political legitimacy. As a party to the Geneva Conventions since 2012, South Sudan remains bound to the conventions’ human rights provisions. Yet there is ample evidence to suggest that the current government has perpetrated both war crimes and crimes against humanity, offenses which have delegitimized regimes in the past. As a sitting head of state, President Kiir’s privileges and immunities are likely to absolve him of most wrongdoing over the course of South Sudan’s civil war. But if the United States were to question his government’s validity, thus jeopardizing such immunities, perhaps Kiir would be more receptive to U.S. peace proposals.

An important consideration in the peace process is the uncertain status of the South Sudanese church, perhaps the country’s only remaining institution with the means to broker a dialogue-driven solution to the conflict. In February 2017, a band of government troops ransacked a church bookstore, confiscating titles deemed to be written by government critics. Some months later, Bishop Santo Loku Pio Doggale of Juba received multiple threatening phone calls, including one in which he was told by an anonymous individual that “Your days are numbered.” The Kiir government has been known to falsely accuse the church of working for regime change, and although a Catholic himself, Kiir has called the church “pro-rebel.”

The time for action is now



South Sudan, the world’s youngest country, has shouldered the burden of war for over 60 percent of its short history. Every day, more of its citizens die while fewer devices for breaking the cycle of violence and vengeance remain on the table.

The time for facilitating peace – a mandate of every nation – is now, and not just for humanitarian reasons. As the country’s infrastructure and institutions crumble, instability will inevitably seep into the rest of Africa’s volatile peripheries. Such a development threatens to coincide with the political implosion of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a perennially conflict-ridden region currently witnessing a face-off between its longtime dictator, Joseph Kabila, and his opponents. If presidential elections are not held by December of this year, the country could suffer its bloodiest bout of violence in decades.

Coupled with impending drama in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the current outpouring of refugees from South Sudan has the potential to spark a larger regional war, as occurred when a broader conflict involving nine African governments erupted in the aftermath of 1994’s Rwandan genocide. The international community has therefore not only a clear moral reason to invest in ending South Sudan’s war, but an urgent security interest in doing so.

A month before leaving office, US president Barack Obama lamented his administration’s insufficient response to South Sudan’s unfolding conflict.

Michael Adams

Simon & Schuster Canada (2017)

“Could it,” we ask ourselves in dog parks, at dinner parties, or in the stands of local hockey arenas, “happen here?” Will we “catch Trumpism,” that storm of angry, isolationist and frequently nativist populism that has swept through not only the United States but also the United Kingdom in the Brexit era, Germany, France, Hungary, Poland and even redoubts of progressivism like the Netherlands?

There are Canadians who want “it” — or some version of “it” — to happen here. Jean-François Lisée won the Parti Québécois leadership in the fall of 2016 by promising to reduce immigration and ban the burka in public. Even the ruling Quebec Liberals held hearings on a proposed law that would make it illegal for anyone with her face covered to give or obtain public services.

Some Canadians have lost confidence in federal institutions and believe that we are admitting too many refugees from the Muslim-majority countries that produce fundamentalists and terrorists. There are clear parallels between readers of Breitbart News in the United States and devotees of Ezra Levant’s Rebel Media, a hard-right Internet news service that calls out political correctness and baits progressives. (“Racist university apartheid,” headlines a Rebel report on postsecondary institutions that offer “scholarships for refugees, not whites.”)

Analysts love to point out that many Canadians — especially those who live in large, dense cities with diverse populations — are living in a progressive bubble or fantasy land which allows them to assume that their benign views of newcomers, trans people or mixed-race couples are widely shared across society, when in fact many parts of Canada have little exposure to social diversity and are less favourably disposed to it.

There are dangers associated with this disconnect. In March 2017, veteran political journalist Michael Valpy noted that “persistent and deepening” economic pessimism was inflected with racism and xenophobia. He used the findings from an EKOS poll to offer up a stern reminder about how American pollsters and pundits so dramatically misread the American mood in 2016. Valpy noted that the political and media establishment should be wary of ignoring populist anger among those Canadians, especially on the right, who express fear or resentment about how the country is run.

“Those supporters are real people — and there are a lot of them,” Valpy wrote. “Dismissing them and their concerns, however crudely they may be stated at times — as the U.S. media did with Americans who flocked to Mr. Trump’s standard — is frankly more likely to increase their numbers and more deeply entrench their anger and their (justifiable) sense of being held in contempt by the mainstream media and political establishment.”

Political sentiments travel easily, like dandelion spores, across borders, oceans and even linguistic divides. The angry populist mood in the U.K. and the U.S. has emboldened anti-immigrant, isolationist politicians and right-wing parties in many parts of Europe, and visa versa. Canadians are no more immune to those trends than anyone else. We’re in a moment when simmering populist discontent, which never really goes away, has been given a voice and a standard-bearer and a whole lot of raw energy that can be used to embolden disgruntled nativists and recruit voters.

But those ideas land or take root in societies with their own distinctive strengths and weaknesses, histories, geographies, demographics, economies and value systems. Some countries drawn to xenophobic nationalism have generally happier citizens (e.g., Denmark and Switzerland); others are home to angrier residents who are attracted to authoritarian figures and tolerate inequality or higher levels of violence (such as the U.S.).

Is Donald Trump a Sociopath? read more

Consequently, any discussion about whether “it” could happen here demands that we move beyond the churn of public opinion polls and partisan punditry, and look instead at underlying measures of civic or social health: Can we passionately debate issues of great public interest without lapsing into gridlock or discourse poisoned by accusations? Can we ground our debates in some kind of common understanding of the pertinent facts? Do we have faith in our democracy and shared institutions, or do we hanker to destroy them? Can we recognize “outsiders” — whether recent immigrants, refugees, trans folk, Muslims or anyone else — as individuals or do we see them as targets for hatred?

One important answer to this question is, “Of course, it can happen here!” You needn’t look too far into the history books to find examples of societies that abruptly pivoted away from rights, democratic governance and religious tolerance. Sometimes, plain old bad luck intervenes and changes the course of the plot. But countries that have managed — either by intention or good fortune — to foster social resilience, reduce inequality and provide collective tax-supported government insurance against ill health or unemployment are more likely to be able to withstand the clarion calls from the Trumps of this world. Canada, as it turns out, is one such nation, although not the only one.

This isn’t a smug assertion of Canadian exceptionalism so much as an acknowledgement of our own recent political history. After episodes of raucous populism, surging anti-immigrant sentiment and even the rise (and subsequent fall) of socially conservative governments in some western provinces, Canadians already know what “it” looks like. In some sense, parts of Canada have been there and done that. The appetite for that form of politics is limited. After all, there are less raucous ways to achieve peace, order and good government.","There are Canadians who want “it” — or some version of “it” — to happen here.

General Assembly High-Level Meeting on Peacebuilding and Sustaining Peace to be held April 24-25 2018 in New York, in accordance with the U.N. General Assembly and Security Council “peacebuilding resolutions” (A/RES/70/262 and S/RES/ 2282). Breaking new ground conceptually, these April 2016 resolutions focused on sustaining peace “at all stages of conflict and in all its dimensions” and on the imperative to prevent “the outbreak, escalation, continuation and recurrence of conflict”, in response to worrying trends such as the spike in violent conflict worldwide and unparalleled levels of forced displacement. The Secretary-General, in turn, has sought to forge a more coherent vision and to offer new tools and approaches to help the U.N. system better support both Member States and civil society in building more just and peaceful societies.

Especially if its recommendations are skillfully rolled out, the Secretary-General’s Report on Peacebuilding and Sustaining Peace can be the start of a policy breakthrough that contributes, over time, to significant positive change in how the U.N. approaches, manages, innovates, and resources its peacebuilding work. The Secretary-General’s team, led by the Peacebuilding Support Office (PBSO), Department of Political Affairs (DPA), and U.N. Development Program (UNDP), has moved the needle toward forging a new consensus among the world body’s 193 Member States. In particular, the Report advances a more integrated and coherent framework for global conflict management in four concrete ways:

First, it elevates the role of civil society (including women’s and youth groups), the private sector, and regional organizations in sustaining peace. Rather than just paying lip service to these less visible peacebuilding actors, the Secretary-General offers examples of productive U.N. partnerships with them through new platforms (e.g., the U.N. Global Compact’s Business for Peace network) and tools (e.g., the Joint UN-African Union Framework for Enhanced Partnership in Peace and Security and the Department of Peacekeeping Operation’s [DPKO] new community-engagement framework) that harness their capabilities and financial resources to create or sustain peace. And it stresses the need to scale-up these innovations not only in U.N. peace operations but across of the U.N.’s resident country teams.

Second, the Report highlights recent advances in joint assessment, planning, and programming, including the tripartite U.N., World Bank, and European Union Recovery and Peacebuilding Assessment in Liberia, the UNDP-DPKO Global Focal Point for police, justice, and corrections, and the field focused UNDP-DPA Peace and Development Advisers. Importantly, the Secretary-General also calls for ensuring that the U.N. Country Team can handle peacebuilding priorities that will fall in its lap when a peacekeeping mission draws down, and for triple-hatted support across development, humanitarian, and peacebuilding entities for the deputy heads of peace operations who are now routinely responsible for all three areas of activity, but with scattered or uneven support.

Third, the Secretary-General buttresses the case for “more predictable and sustained financing” for civilian-led peacebuilding through a proposed Funding Compact with Member States, against the backdrop of declining development assistance to conflict-affected countries as a share of global aid (from 40% in 2005 to 28% in 2015). He astutely underscores the billions in potential savings from effective conflict prevention, while calling for a “quantum leap” in un-earmarked and multi-year contributions to the U.N.’s Peacebuilding Fund (PBF). However, despite the recent progress in now allocating—as one positive illustration—approximately $250 million annually from UN peacekeeping missions’ assessed budgets for mandated peacebuilding programmatic activities, this amount (alongside proposed PBF and other funding stream increases) is still insufficient given the scale of the challenge—and compared to the annual peacekeeping budget, which continues to hover around $7.5B per annum. With the Trump Administration once again calling for severe cuts in the U.S. financial contribution to the U.N. (including a proposed 37 percent cut to peacekeeping from FY’17 enacted levels and the complete defunding of UNDP, UNICEF, and other agencies), it is critical that both old and new donors prepare to step-in and fill the potential gap.

Fourth and finally, the Report stresses up front that the UN development system and development practitioners in general are central to conflict prevention and sustaining peace. Given continued worries about “the securitization of development”, it strikes a balance between development and security tools and approaches in efforts to build a durable, just peace and to prevent the outbreak of deadly violence, reflecting the U.N.’s evolution in this complex space since the end of the Cold War. The Report will also accelerate efforts to put into practice—across the U.N.’s development programs, funds, and agencies—proposals recently introduced in the more comprehensive United Nations-World Bank conflict prevention study, Pathways for Peace, including its emphasis on improving upstream and downstream peacebuilding programming to restore citizens’ confidence in state leadership.

Missing Elements: Striving for Broader Peace & Security Management and Institutional Reforms

U.N. Member States have opted to slow down adoption of the Secretary-General’s proposed, mutually reinforcing 2017 reforms for the peace and security pillar of the secretariat, development system, and management system (what a co-author and I recently referred to as track I _operational _reforms, as opposed to more ambitious track II institutional reform and track III Security Council expansion). Fortunately, the Report on Peacebuilding and Sustaining Peace adds a sense of urgency, by stepping up political pressure on international policy-makers to support the Secretary-General’s operational reform package too. If successful on these “track I” reforms in 2018, the Secretariat’s 38th Floor can shift attention to nurturing the multi-stakeholder coalitions necessary to push through more ambitious institutional (including Security Council) innovations in the run-up to the U.N.’s 75thanniversary in 2020. A revitalized and renovated world body would help to ensure that U.N. conflict management capabilities stay relevant to global efforts to counter violent extremism and stabilize conflict-ravaged societies.

For instance, the Peacebuilding Commission’s recent flexibility and innovation toward advancing intergovernmental coherence on regional issues (Great Lakes, Sahel) and select countries merits the praise exhibited in the Secretary-General’s Report. But with an eye towards the expected 2020 UN Summit, serious consideration should be given—far beyond the S-G’s current operational recommendations—to elevating this Security Council-General Assembly advisory body into a more authoritative Council with significant new coordination and resource mobilization competencies, and having it replace the all-but-defunct Trusteeship Council as recommended by the Albright-Gambari Commission on Global Security, Justice & Governance. The proposed Peacebuilding Council could learn from the 2005/6 upgrade of the Human Rights Commission into a Council with a new Universal Periodic Review mechanism that could, in effect, inform a newly agreed preventive action tool. This would equip the PBC to better help countries counter violent extremism and prevent the recurrence of conflict so essential to effective stabilization and sustaining peace.

The Report of the Secretary-General is also missing at least one major new flagship reform initiative with the potential to capture the imagination of both governments and global civil society. At the start of Secretary-General Guterres’ first year in office, there was talk of some kind of new “U.N. Prevention Platform” (perhaps absorbed, in part, by his promising new High-Level Advisory Board on Mediation introduced in mid-2017). One promising idea discussed at a recent sustaining peace experts dialogue is to develop a new roster and regular training for around fifty top-flight mediators and experienced diplomats in the latest negotiation techniques, who can step in at short notice as U.N. Special Envoys and provide leadership for a new, rapid-response U.N. Civilian Response Capability of up to five hundred personnel. The need for such capability is clear from the lengthy recruitment cycles of months to years needed to field more than a handful of new U.N. personnel for even the most urgent of field-related tasks. A backup system enrolling up to 2000 U.N. system staff (including from the international financial institutions, as well as a select number of municipal administrators, engineers, lawyers, and others with specialized skills) could also receive training as part of a major reserve component of this new set of capacities that would operate nimbly alongside Blue Berets and U.N. Police.

In sum, by placing preventive action and post-conflict peacebuilding on par with peacemaking and peacekeeping, the concept of and report on sustaining peace by the Secretary-General has laid the groundwork for an important policy-breakthrough, empowering civilians with new tools, better management practices, and hopefully new financial resources to contribute to a more integrated and coherent framework for global conflict management. With this progress has come expanded possibilities and political pressures for more ambitious, overdue peace and security management and institutional reforms. By positioning this April’s High-Level Event on Peacebuilding and Sustaining Peace as a springboard for forging a strong consensus on a renewed, innovated, and reformed U.N. peace and security architecture by 2020, the world body will be better equipped to help fragile and war-torn nations and their citizens avert future deadly violence and build a more durable and just peace.","Fourth and finally, the Report stresses up front that the UN development system and development practitioners in general are central to conflict prevention and sustaining peace.

Greetings to the citizens of Mineral County. My name is Mike James, and I am pleased to announce my candidacy for the Hawthorne Justice of the Peace.

From a very young age I have worked hard to be a competent, honest and reliable citizen. Growing up, I was actively involved in my community, spending countless hours volunteering at my church and participating in outreach and service projects to improve and beautify my home town. At the age of 12, I was honored to earn my Eagle Scout rank in the Boy Scouts of America. My passion for public service drove me to become one of the youngest boys ever in my district council to be awarded the Eagle Ribbon. To achieve this, I took on a project to initiate curbside recycling in my community. I worked diligently with town departments and the federal and state government to acquire funding for equipment necessary to complete this laborious task. Along with the help of my fellow scouts and several other town residents we were able to divert millions of tons of solid municipal waste from the local landfill. The recycling program I initiated still thrives nearly 27 years later.

I carried this passion for service with me when I moved to Hawthorne in 2005. Over the past 12 to 13 years I have devoted myself to helping our wonderful community, focusing primarily on disadvantaged individuals that otherwise would have fallen through the cracks. I started working at the Mineral County Care and Share Senior Center in 2008 as the senior advocate, and then later as the program director. In those roles, I helped our county’s senior citizens gain access to services and benefits that they otherwise would have not received. In these positions, I forged great relationships with folks that have lived in Mineral County for far longer than myself. This helped me gain a unique perspective on our local history far beyond my relative newness to Mineral County.

In my current position I act as a court appointed surrogate decision maker for mentally and physically incapacitated individuals. This role has allowed me to take a more direct approach in helping people that do not have the ability to help themselves. Our department has worked with the state legislature and courts to reform the guardianship process, ensuring that guardianships are administered ethically and honestly. Working in the district court has been a great experience for me, and has helped kindle my enthusiasm for the legal process. Through my integrity-driven hard work in local government I have established excellent relationships with local and state agencies. I have been honored to be able to meet and help so many great people through my roles at the Senior Center and in local government.

It is with this passion for identifying and fulfilling a need that I enter into the race for Justice of the Peace. As a dedicated public servant, I have been honored and humbled to work alongside the people of this great community for several years. In addition to my experience in the fields of civil and probate law, my impartial nature and temperament make me ideally suited for the role of Justice of the Peace. I look forward to speaking with all of you about my goals, values, and experience, so please, don’t hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions. I am very excited to continue to serve my friends and neighbors in Mineral County.

Breanna Hatfield

I, Breanna Hatfield, long time Nevada resident, wife and mother of soon to be three children, filed for the running of Justice of the Peace for Hawthorne Township. I have always exemplified the qualities of what it means to be a public official by taking part in my community whether I am spearheading fundraising for the middle school Dream Team or pushing to get extra donations for other local charities.

I am a recent business owner that knows how to balance a life of strong commitment to both my career and family commitments. I know the long hours and hard work that goes into holding such a position and the levels of commitment that is going to be needed to bring positive change to the community. Also I want to bring my years of education and experience within the criminal justice system to the justice court if elected. Along with being a graduate of Kaplan Universities Criminal Justice Program with a bachelor’s degree, I have also had career paths that have given me work experience within both the juvenile and adult criminal justice system. Criminal Justice was something I have been passionate about and have worked in different areas to narrow down exactly where I want to be within that field. I have always taken an interest in law and I believe the position of Justice of the Peace is a perfect fit.

This job is very important to our community and its primary role should be holding those people who choose to break the law accountable for their actions. This community needs someone who can toe the line and be a role model citizen for all ages of people, especially our youth. This is not an easy job; it is not a cushy job, but a position within our community that should be held to higher standards than most. I am ready and willing to set those standards, practice them and apply them not only in the community but the court room as well. No victims should be without justice, and justice does not have a last name. I look forward to meeting more of the great folks of Mineral County throughout this campaign process and earning your vote.

James Kenner

James Kenner, candidate for Justice of the Peace biography: Being a native Nevadan born in Winnemucca, I moved to Hawthorne in 1983 when my family relocated to Mineral County. I attended Mineral County High School. During high school I started working at the El Capitan as well as a part time dishwasher in 1985. At 16, the best chef I ever worked for asked me to take a shot at line cooking, to which as it turned out I had a knack for and enjoyed. I never looked back and continued my studies and practice at preparing meals and banquets at the El Capitan. After high school I continued cooking at the El Capitan until November of 1993 I started cooking at Maggie’s Restaurant. I would continue cooking for the next 16 years. Many of you I’m sure still remember my days there, after which I was recruited to go back to the El Capitan as executive chef. After three years Maggie’s requested to have my services back. I accepted and continued to work there until the establishment was sold and became The Refinery. During 1998 I continued my education as well, and attended the University of Phoenix online studying business. An education that has helped me through the years to this day.

My wife Meredith and I have been together for ten years in May. Absolutely one of the best choices that I have made in my life. I have three children ages 22, 21, and 17. While they are just beginning their life away from home I’m sure that there will be trials and tribulations along the way.

In the spring of 2011, I decided that it was time to return the favor to Mineral County Fire Department for saving my home when I had an electrical fire, and rescuing my mother when she had a stroke. I decided to study and learn to become an emergency medical technician. In August of 2011 I also joined the Hawthorne Volunteer Fire Department.

In 2012 I accepted employment as the full time admin/EMT for the Mineral County Fire Department. Granted that is not the way I liked to meet people, however over the years I have met some of the most wonderful citizens of Mineral County through our shared experiences at that time. Many of whom I had known from my days of cooking at Maggie’s. In July of 2013 I was able to become the first official advanced emergency medical technician of Mineral County. It was a very daunting task I will say, but one of the most rewarding experiences I have had in my life. It has allowed me to expand on the services we could provide to our people of Mineral County.

In 2016 I was asked to join the staff at the Mineral County Sheriff’s Department. I have learned so much about law and people over the last two years. During this time I have become aware of several issues that are plaguing our justice system that could use some review and revamping to provide better service to our citizens. I still enjoy helping and assisting our community from the Fire/EMS service as well. I still take pride every time I am able to assist one of our citizens in need.

Last year I decided that I would like to expand on my service to Mineral County by running for Justice of the Peace. Through all my experiences in public service I have learned to take a fair and unbiased approach to assessing situations. I have been studying the NRS codes, and the required classes to be certified as Justice of the Peace. I look forward to earning the respect and votes of the citizens of Mineral County. Together let us “Be the Choice” and work to improve communication and efficiency of our Justice System.

I, Paula Joe Reed, a sound, civic minded person. Born and raised here in Hawthorne and attended Cosmetology school in the State of Idaho and chose to come home with dreams and goals in mind. I am a wife, a mother of three and two step children and a grandmother of five and 3/4.

I have been a business owner here in Hawthorne 28 years come this March, and a friend of the working man and career employees. It has not always been easy and is ever changing but worth every minute. With 35 years in the industry I have seen a lot coming and going on in our small town and serving is what I know how to do. Not everyone is going to like you or the decisions made but for the citizens of Hawthorne the best decisions will be made with the best interest in mind. I love Hawthorne and I am ready to step out and into the eye of the community and into the Justice of the Peace Township of Hawthorne with the help of your vote. We have a great town with great people in this community who have chosen to live here, Yes, some have left, but some have came back. We have broken pieces in the system that need repaired and followed.

I feel strongly that I can help the Justice of the Peace become fair and trusted again.","My name is Mike James, and I am pleased to announce my candidacy for the Hawthorne Justice of the Peace.

After containing the Soviet threat for four decades (and intervening in two World Wars before that), the United States and its allies focused on enlarging the community of market democracies eastward to eliminate sources of conflict that had bedeviled Western leaders throughout the 20th century.

In November 1999, when President Bill Clinton spoke at Georgetown University to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, it seemed the United States and its allies were well on their way to accomplishing these goals. America began the decade supporting Germany’s unification, with a united Germany remaining fully in NATO. In the mid-1990s, the United States began pushing for NATO to include a first wave of new members from the East and supported the European Union’s steps toward enlargement. The United States, bilaterally and multilaterally through international financial institutions, provided Russia billions of dollars in the 1990s, as Clinton’s top adviser, Strobe Talbott, put it, “to help Russia complete the destruction of one system and the building, virtually de novo, of a new one.” Although Russian President Boris Yeltsin made clear that NATO expansion created political headaches for him at home, he had sought integration with the West from the start of his presidency. In 1997, he went along with plans to create a formal NATO-Russia framework (the Permanent Joint Council) for dialogue with the West. The Group of Seven advanced industrialized countries added Russia to their membership roster in 1998 to further enhance relations. NATO conducted airstrikes that paved the way for the Dayton Accords to end the war in Bosnia in 1995 and engaged in a 78-day bombing campaign in 1999 against Slobodan Milošević’s Serbia without suffering any NATO combat casualties. And as concerns emerged about the threat from radical Islamic extremists, the United States pushed Europe to take more seriously the idea of Turkish membership in the European Union in the hopes that the country could set an example for the Middle East as a secular Islamic democracy.

It was not an understatement when Clinton remarked in 1999, “Now we are at the height of our power and prosperity.” After 40 years of containing communism during the Cold War, it seemed the first ten years after communist regimes began collapsing in Eastern Europe had gone about as well as they could. The idea that any country could challenge America’s global leadership was laughable. Europe seemed on its way to overcoming its historic divisions.

Since then, however, America’s ability to promote the idea of a Europe whole, free, and at peace has eroded considerably. After the Iraq war and the global financial crisis, the United States lost not only its standing but also its self-confidence as global leader. Although the Eurozone economies are growing again, structural problems continue to cast doubt on the Euro’s future. The United Kingdom is negotiating its exit from the European Union, and authoritarian populism has surged in Central Europe. Russia has emerged as a power intent on undermining the Western order: It invaded Ukraine in 2014 and has launched information operations designed to disrupt electoral democracy across Europe and in the United States. And then came the election of Donald Trump, whose attitudes toward Europe have created tremendous uncertainty since he entered office.

With the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Brexit vote, the rise of authoritarianism in Central Europe, and the continuing challenges of maintaining the Eurozone, the vision of a Europe whole, free, and at peace no longer serves meaningfully as a framework for America’s Europe policy. The optimism underpinning the 1989 strategy — that the West won the Cold War and could set the terms for the integration of the East, including Russia — has given way to pessimism now that Russia is bent on undermining Western institutions and populist politicians in Europe are doing the same.

Formulating a new U.S. strategy for Europe takes place in a Washington much less Euro-centric than it was during the 20th century. That was a time when the United States viewed Europe — the source of conflict in World War I, World War II, and the Cold War — as the region most vital to American strategy.

But it would be wrong to believe Europe is no longer central to American prosperity and security. The United States should reconceptualize its strategy for and with Europe along two tracks. The first has formed the core of its approach since 2014 and echoes America’s Cold War strategy: working with European allies once again to contain Russian aggression. This cannot consist of only reassuring NATO allies they will be protected against military attack, but should also include the development of serious U.S.-European collaboration in the face of Russian propaganda operations.

The second requires a true understanding of America’s foreign policy needs as it looks toward Asia. Under President Barack Obama, the United States rightly sought to respond effectively to the rise of China, the greatest geostrategic challenge facing the United States in the coming decades. But the more time, energy, and resources America focuses on the China challenge, the more it requires a Europe capable of managing threats and challenges in its own neighborhood. The new transatlantic agenda’s second track, therefore, should focus on developing a collaborative division of labor that allows the United States to continue turning its attention toward Asia. Europe, under the leadership of France and Germany and with the participation of the United Kingdom, should develop greater capacity to respond to challenges in Eastern Europe and the Middle East and North Africa region, all the while cementing the transatlantic alliance through a strong NATO.

A Spent Strategy

It was on a visit to Mainz, West Germany, in May 1989 that George H.W. Bush articulated the strategy to promote a “Europe whole and free.” Communist regimes were beginning to collapse in Eastern Europe and Cold War-style containment of the Soviet Union was no longer necessary. The goal of overcoming Europe’s historic divisions and conflicts was not only for the continent’s benefit but to enhance American national security. U.S. strategists had learned from two world wars and a Cold War that the United States should actively promote European unity. As Bush put it in Mainz, “The Cold War began with the division of Europe. It can only end when Europe is whole.”

The Clinton team evolved that approach to promoting “a Europe whole, free and at peace,” primarily (but not only, as noted above) through the enlargement of NATO. George W. Bush continued his predecessor’s policies, bringing much of the rest of Central and Eastern Europe into NATO, but it was crystal clear that Western policy was in trouble with the 2008 Russia-Georgia war. The Obama administration put on hold the idea of promoting NATO membership to Ukraine and Georgia in the hopes of resetting the relationship with Russia, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and the imposition of Western sanctions in response spelled clear doom for the post-Cold War hopes for an undivided continent.

The enlargement of Western institutions in the immediate aftermath of the Cold War was made possible due to four key features of that era. First, the United States enjoyed complete global military and political superiority in the wake of the Soviet collapse, and the George H.W. Bush and Clinton administrations viewed NATO as the primary instrument for maintaining U.S. dominance of European security affairs after the Cold War ended. Second, in a period of uncertainty, Western European countries believed in the importance of ongoing U.S. commitment to their security through NATO and established processes to enlarge the European Union to the east to promote greater European unity. Third, for the first time in centuries, Russia was unable to shape events in Europe. Finally, Central and Eastern European nations sought protection from the United States in case the Russian (or German) threat reemerged and committed themselves to implementing political and economic reforms in order to join NATO and the European Union.

The United States undermined its global standing and legitimacy as the world’s leading power by shooting itself in the foot going to war in Iraq in 2003 and creating a global financial crisis in 2008. Russia, disillusioned and resentful over the direction of American leadership and what it saw as offenses against its core interests, began to push back on many fronts. Britain voted to leave the European Union. Poland and Hungary, two countries that had entered the Western fold, began to take on an authoritarian character. NATO and E.U. enlargement have run their course, and those countries in the gray zone between the West and Russia, such as Georgia and Ukraine, have no foreseeable prospect for membership. Nor are good relations with Russia on the horizon.

The Steady Decline of American Influence and Russian Opportunism

With the 9/11 attacks, the world and American power entered a new era. The conventional wisdom at the time was that it would be defined by the “War on Terror,” but looking back, an important part of the story was the clear erosion in America’s ability to sustain its post-Cold War vision with its European allies. A variety of factors contributed to this. First, the United States undermined its own standing and legitimacy with the invasion of Iraq and the associated chaos and human rights abuses associated with it. Second, the “own goal” of the U.S. financial crisis, which eventually afflicted the whole world, left many disillusioned with American leadership, undermining the “Washington consensus .” The financial crisis also exposed longstanding problems with the Eurozone and a debt crisis flowered throughout southern Europe. Third, Moscow became more and more angry over Washington’s leadership of the international order. The Kremlin was especially displeased by Russia’s place in the global pecking order as well as what Russian leaders saw as a disregard of their country’s interests and its status as a great power. Russian President Vladimir Putin came into office determined to reverse the humiliation of the 1990s and set about ensuring that Russia had the ability to prevent Western institutions from penetrating into the non-Baltic territory of the former Soviet Union.

There is no small irony that Iraq, where America displayed its unrivaled hegemony in defeating Saddam Hussein in 1991, became the symbol, over a decade later, of America’s eroding power. After Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, the United States and its partners under U.N. authorization responded in 1991 with a spectacular show of military power demonstrating American domination of the global stage. For the next dozen years, U.S.-led patrols of no-fly zones over Iraq kept Saddam contained.

But in the aftermath of 9/11, those in the George W. Bush administration who had long argued for regime change in Iraq seized the chance to promote their agenda. The Bush administration took America to war without an international consensus to eliminate what turned out to be a nonexistent weapons of mass destruction program. France and Germany, two staunch American allies, vocally opposed this use of American power.

Coming just four years after NATO’s bombing campaign in the Balkans that — in Moscow’s view — encroached on Russian interests, Vladimir Putin was enraged at what he saw as the U.S. effort to unilaterally force its will onto the rest of the world.

America’s standing took a big hit not just with Russia but globally when the Iraq War turned into a quagmire. The world was aghast when photos were released of the torture that took place at Abu Ghraib, and Europeans argued vociferously that the U.S. facility at Guantanamo Bay should be closed. America lost tremendous credibility through both its incompetent occupation and its defense of waterboarding.

Meanwhile, Russian grievances against the United States and NATO grew increasingly bitter. They were rooted in a certain narrative of the 1990s. Many Russians (and many American scholars) believed the West had provided assurances to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev during the discussions over German unification in 1990 that NATO would not take advantage of Soviet weakness to expand into Central and Eastern Europe. Since the late 1990s, Moscow saw Washington doing exactly that. In 1999, the United States led the NATO air war against Serbia. It was fought without U.N. authorization since the Clinton team knew Russia would veto the operation. Fearing NATO might send ground troops, Yeltsin warned of another possible world war.

Putin turned his anger at the ties between Western institutions like the U.S. Agency for International Development and domestic civil society groups that, in his mind, fomented the so-called “color revolutions” that ousted pro-Russian governments in Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan from 2003 to 2005. While he exaggerated the amount of outside influence on these domestic events, Putin feared the West was further encroaching on what he deemed Russia’s sphere of influence and even had designs on regime change in Russia.

At the 2007 Munich Conference on Security Policy, Putin made clear his unhappiness with U.S. global dominance, arguing that a unipolar world, a “world in which there is one master, one sovereign…is pernicious not only for all those within this system, but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within.” And he expressed particular ire for NATO:

I think it is obvious that NATO expansion does not have any relation with the modernization of the Alliance itself or with ensuring security in Europe. On the contrary, it represents a serious provocation that reduces the level of mutual trust. And we have the right to ask: against whom is this expansion intended?

Then came the 2008 financial crisis, which began in the U.S. housing and banking sectors. The world had come to expect the United States to solve financial crises, not start them. In the winter of 1994-95, the Clinton administration intervened to stave off a currency crisis in Mexico. At the end of the decade, Time’s Feb. 15, 1999, cover dubbed Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, and Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers as the “Committee that Saved the World” for their role in managing the financial crisis that began in Asia in 1997 and soon engulfed countries across the globe. In the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States had developed what was known as the “Washington consensus” — prescriptions for building a successful market economy. Now, given the U.S. role in creating the financial crisis (in large measure a result of the deregulation policies promoted by the “Committee that Saved the World” — Greenspan, Rubin and Summers), along with the continued economic rise of China, the United States no longer seemed to have all the answers.

Although the Iraq War and the financial crisis weakened U.S. standing, America in the Bush years did not give up on a Europe whole, free, and at peace. In advance of NATO’s 2008 Bucharest summit, Washington even lobbied its allies to provide Membership Action Plans (established for earlier NATO aspirants) to Ukraine and Georgia. But too many allies feared Russia’s reaction, particularly given Putin’s angry, headline grabbing remarks at the previous year’s Munich Conference on Security Policy regarding NATO expansion. Failing to achieve its objective, the Bush administration successfully fought to include in the summit declaration a statement that Ukraine and Georgia would become members someday. As Ivo Daalder and I argued at the time, stating that countries would become members before they showed they could fulfill a Membership Action Plan made a mockery of the enlargement process. Even more importantly, it signaled to Putin that he had to act.

In August of that year, Russia went to war with Georgia and recognized two breakaway provinces, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Putin had enforced a red line with respect to the non-Baltic former Soviet countries joining Western institutions.

When Putin returned to the Russian presidency in 2012 after a term as prime minister, he was obsessed with what he believed was an American effort to foster regime change in Russia. He blamed the United States, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in particular, for fomenting street protests during Russia’s parliamentary elections in 2011. But unlike the closing years of the George W. Bush presidency, Putin was now dealing with a U.S. president who sought a “reset” with Russia amid a broader effort to emulate the realism of George H.W. Bush rather than the more expansive interventionism of his son. Barack Obama made clear in his first year in office that NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia was off the table, and relations were much improved during his first term. By the start of his second term, however, the relationship was headed into a downward spiral once again.

Beginning in 2013, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, a Putin ally, tried playing the European Union and Russia off one another, but after raising hopes at home and in the West that he was flirting with closer ties to Europe, he reneged under pressure from the Kremlin, leading to street protests that toppled him from power. Russia moved quickly, invading Ukraine, annexing Crimea, and supporting the Russian-speaking population of Eastern Ukraine in what became a bloody civil war.

Cold War containment was born of necessity in the face of the Soviet threat, and the idea of a Europe whole, free, and at peace was a response to the opportunity provided by the Soviet collapse. Yet by 2014 the United States and its allies were no longer thinking about expanding the zone of European democracy and once again refocused on containing the threat from Moscow. The West imposed economic sanctions on Moscow elites close to Putin, and NATO began increasing its capabilities in the East, first by stepping up air and sea patrols in the Baltic and Black Sea regions, later deploying troops on a rotating basis to the territory of NATO’s eastern members, and ultimately creating a European Deterrence Initiative.

Europe’s Internal Fracturing: Less Whole and Less Free

A Europe whole, free, and at peace never depended on the United States alone, even if it was the lone superpower, and neither was it simply about America’s relationship with Russia. The strategy depended on Europe’s own success in promoting a more unified continent to create greater peace and prosperity and potentially to develop a common foreign and security policy. While tremendous progress was made, inspiring heady rhetoric, dreams for what Europe could achieve faltered early in the 21st century due to the Eurozone debt crisis; the emergence of authoritarianism in Poland, Hungary, and Turkey; and Britain’s decision to leave the European Union.

In the early 1990s, France and Germany led the way in transforming the European Economic Community into a closer European Union, and Central and Eastern Europeans responded to Western incentives to foster democracy, the rule of law, and market economics hoping to join not just NATO but the European Union.

From the start, there were signs that the path ahead might not be so easy. To calm fears over German unification, Chancellor Helmut Kohl embraced the creation of a common currency for Europe. But as economists feared at the time, without a European finance ministry to set fiscal policy across the continent and thus lacking the ability to implement necessary redistributive policies, problems were bound to emerge.

By 2010 a full-blown crisis had erupted, as southern European countries demonstrated the system’s vulnerabilities to overloading on debt. The Euro crisis was exacerbated in 2015 as Greece missed a payment due to the International Monetary Fund and found itself in a showdown with its major creditor, Germany. The austerity programs the European Union imposed on debtors like Greece hammered their populations, increasing anti-E.U. populism, which threatened to undermine the European project.

After the Soviet Union collapsed, populist politicians in Central and Eastern Europe complained that newly liberated states were preparing to trade one form of imperial control (the Soviet military) for another (the European Union bureaucracy). Slovakia took a non-democratic, anti-E.U. turn under Vladimir Meciar as early as the mid-1990s, causing a delay in its accession to NATO and almost derailing its bid for E.U. membership before it returned to a democratic path. More recently, populist sentiment across the continent has been fueled by politicians seeking to take advantage of the refugee crisis that emerged from the wars in Libya and Syria. While Germany initially welcomed these individuals with open arms, others in Central Europe were not as hospitable, and politicians have used the threat of immigration effectively to stoke fears of loss of identity and to clamp down on democratic institutions.

Viktor Orbán returned as prime minister of Hungary in 2010 openly touting his goal of creating an illiberal state despite his country’s membership in NATO and the European Union. Orbán shut down the main opposition newspaper and targeted the Central European University, which received its initial funding from George Soros and symbolized the West’s embrace of the former Soviet bloc countries. In Poland, the Law and Justice Party came to power in 2015, seeking to restrict press freedoms and taking an attitude toward the constitution and judicial system that belied the party’s name. Recent elections in the Czech Republic and Austria have brought to power governments that, like those in Poland and Hungary, are stoking anti-immigrant sentiment and undermining the European Union’s democratic values. The growing success of nationalist politicians makes it far easier for Putin to make mischief in the heart of the European Union.

Turkey, the object of America’s dream in the 1990s to showcase a secular Muslim democracy, is under the boot of an authoritarian leader, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. While not an E.U. member, Turkey is a NATO ally. Its clampdown on the media, jailing of university leaders, and government purge in the wake of the failed 2016 coup are leading many to wonder if the alliance needs a provision for expelling a member country to complement its provisions for including new ones.

Finally, in 2016, Britain voted to leave the European Union. The loss of sovereignty inherent in E.U. membership had long been a political issue in the United Kingdom, which never joined the Euro, and pro-Brexit politicians used the migrant issue to convince a majority of voters that their country should set a new course. But the Brexit vote also highlighted another new feature of European politics: Russia’s use of information warfare to undermine democratic institutions. Since Brexit, there has been more and more evidence of Russia’s brazen interference in Western elections, from France and Germany to Catalonia. And of course, Moscow’s efforts on behalf of Donald Trump created an explosive political issue in the United States.

The Trump Effect

Trump himself does not seem to care whether Europe is whole and free. At the time he was elected, Europe was already becoming less whole, less free and had a war in the East. His electoral victory meant a new presidential attitude that strikes at the heart of the European Union’s efforts to unify the continent. During his presidential campaign, he supported the British referendum to leave the European Union. Early in his presidency, Trump had kind words for French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, who sought a similar path for her country. Speaking in Poland in July 2016, despite paying lip service to the notion of a “Europe strong, whole and free,” Trump put forth a vision for Europe consistent with what he has long favored for the United States — an approach that emphasizes the divisive nationalism the European Union was founded to overcome.

Since Trump’s inauguration a year ago, European Council President Donald Tusk has called the United States a threat to Europe, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel has argued that Europe can no longer rely on the United States. For the first time since the development of its Cold War containment policy in 1947, the United States has no clear strategy for what it wants in Europe and with Europe.

How has the Kremlin seen all this? Putin likely hoped Trump’s election would signal greater accommodation in U.S. policy toward Russia. With respect to the U.S. response to Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. elections, Trump has given the Russian president what he wanted. While Congress overwhelmingly passed legislation in 2017 to impose new sanctions, Trump has stalled on implementation. On Ukraine, however, while Trump appointed a special representative for Ukraine negotiations, Washington’s terms for solving the crisis have not changed. Furthermore, the president signed off on the sale of lethal military assistance to Ukraine, something Obama was reluctant to do over fears that it might only lead to an escalation of the war in that country. The United States has continued to stand firmly with its NATO allies to counter the threat of aggression from Russia, and the sanctions regime already in place remains so.

Overall, though, Trump’s foreign policy attitude is a radical departure from his post-World War II predecessors. Frustration with the bureaucratic, often sclerotic, European Union is nothing new for American elites. But actively seeking to undermine European unity is. Speaking in Warsaw, Trump did refer to the importance of a Europe whole and free, but it was overshadowed by his broader articulation of the nationalist vision Stephen Bannon helped him promote — a vision Trump adhered to again when laying out his National Security Strategy in December. The president has similarly undermined European unity in favor of nationalism, arguing that the United Kingdom and United States would emerge with a stronger relationship once Britain left the European Union, and praising Le Pen, who campaigned on an anti-E.U. platform for France.

Regarding Russia, Trump has often spoken of his admiration for Putin’s strongman tactics at home, and has sought publicly to downplay the threat Putin poses to the United States and Europe. Trump accepts the Russian leader’s denials of meddling in the U.S. election and rejects any effort to cast doubt on the legitimacy of his own victory, including the work of the U.S. intelligence community to expose the danger of Moscow’s information warfare operation.

Concerns existed before Trump entered office. But now the United States has a president who has made clear he does not believe in the value of the liberal world order Washington created, sustained, and then enlarged after the Cold War — an order that the Europe whole, free, and at peace strategy rested on.

Was There Another Way?

Was this all an inevitable result of overly ambitious U.S. policy, and particularly the effort to bring Central and Eastern Europe into NATO, as some have argued? A number of Western analysts, led by legendary diplomat George F. Kennan, opposed NATO enlargement from the start, and critics such as John Mearsheimer have argued that the policy is the root cause of the breakdown of relations with Russia over Ukraine. Enlargement certainly created tradeoffs: Using NATO to promote greater stability in Central and Eastern Europe made any cooperation with Moscow that much more difficult. But a failure to enlarge would have come with its own costs, something critics of enlargement generally do not address. Most notably, Russia, which has defined its security through the insecurity of its neighbors, would have been tempted over time to interfere in the affairs of Central and Eastern Europe, particularly in the Baltics, as it has in Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine, creating instability and insecurity across a wider swath of Europe.

As I have previously argued, Russia’s self-image since the end of the Cold War and particularly since the rise of Putin has played a key role in the tensions that have emerged. From the days of Gorbachev’s notion of a “Common European Home ,” Russia has envisioned itself playing a co-equal role to that of the United States in managing European security. But the Central and Eastern Europeans were looking for protection, not renewed influence, from Russia, and the United States, viewing itself as the Cold War victor, was not prepared to treat Russia as an equal. As Kimberly Marten has stated:

Russia mourned its lost status more than it feared a new security danger, and no realistic alternative to NATO’s geographic enlargement would have restored Russia’s status in the system, especially given the expansion of NATO’s mandates and the growth of US unilateralism….As long as Russia was not getting into Western security institutions, as long as those institutions were not subsuming themselves to the CSCE/OSCE or the UN, and as long as Russia was denied the right to veto the use of US and NATO force, Russian elites would not be satisfied.

The United States in the Clinton years believed it could use NATO as the primary driver of its European agenda while still maintaining good relations with Russia. Yeltsin seemed to go along with enlargement even while making clear it was hurting him at home. In May 1995, eight months after explaining to Yeltsin that NATO would be moving forward with enlargement (after the Russian elections in 1996), Clinton convinced the Russian president to join NATO’s Partnership for Peace program and the following year, Russian forces served alongside NATO forces in the military implementation force in Bosnia.

The United States was right to be ambitious for Europe, and with Europe, after the Cold War ended. Bringing Central and Eastern Europe into Western institutions in order to provide opportunities for those populations to live in peace and prosperity was a worthwhile goal after decades in which security eluded large parts of Europe due first to German and then to Soviet military invasion and occupation. The problem was less the strategy for countries like Poland and Hungary, but rather the lack of a meaningful plan for including countries like Russia, Ukraine and Georgia in the European security framework. Clinton and his top advisers spoke to Yeltsin about the possibility of Russia joining NATO someday and sought to ease Russia’s pain regarding enlargement through invitations to join the World Trade Organization, the Paris Club of Creditors, the OECD, and the G-7 (which became the G-8). At the end of the day, however, neither the United States nor the Europeans nor Russia figured out how to create an acceptable place for the latter in the post-Cold War European security framework. Partnership for Peace proved short-lived as a solution. Enlargement provided security for most of Central and Eastern Europe, but the NATO-Russia Founding Act (and its successor, the NATO-Russia Council) were insufficient mechanisms for cooperation between the West and Moscow. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe was too weak, and once it began serious election monitoring and oversight of human rights abuses, it clashed with Moscow’s interests.

While the United States had a stake in promoting a united Europe (one that included Russia), and still has a stake in promoting a strong and democratic Europe, the future of the continent will be defined by Europeans. Some of the seeds of Europe’s current challenges were sown in the 1990s, such as the creation of a common currency absent a European finance ministry. Others arose more recently, such as the failure to recognize soon enough the impact of the war in Syria on European security. The United States has little role to play in helping Europe solve its internal problems, but it can at least refrain from fostering further divisions within the European Union.

A New Strategy Based on a Transatlantic Division of Labor

Containment as an organizing principle for American strategy arose after World War II as a response to the threat posed by European weakness and potential Soviet aggression against Western Europe. By 1989, a stronger Europe and a weaker Soviet Union offered an opportunity to pursue a Europe whole, free, and at peace. Now, America has come full circle, responding once again to the threat posed by renewed Russian aggression. In a December 2017 speech on “The U.S. and Europe: Strengthening Western Alliances,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson focused almost exclusively on the threat posed by a “recently resurgent Russia.” He reminded his audience that NATO was defending its eastern members against Russia as it did during the Cold War.

Responding to Russian aggression, while a necessary pillar, is not a comprehensive Europe strategy, and it does not provide the kind of positive vision that fostering a Europe whole and free did in the heady days after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The United States needs to recognize that Europe, for so many decades an object in itself for U.S. strategists, can serve as a means to enable the continued rebalancing of American foreign policy.

And while containing Russian military aggression is important, the United States and its European allies should focus far more on thwarting Russia’s non-military means of realizing its aims and specifically Moscow’s efforts to sow chaos among Western democracies. Russian information operations aimed at undermining Western democracies and transatlantic unity should be galvanizing more cooperation amongst allies to enact real and resourced policies that can protect foundational democratic institutions. To date, this has not occurred. Obama largely ignored the threat in his last year in office, and Trump does not even want to admit the threat exists.

Mustering the political will to counter Russian behavior in the information warfare space will be hard, particularly given Trump’s aversion to confronting the facts and the difficulties of finding meaningful ways to respond. But even so, building a Europe strategy around countering Russian aggression is insufficient. The greatest geopolitical challenge the United States will face in the coming decades is the rise of China, which is the only country that could threaten the United States as a peer competitor in that timeframe. And America’s ability to focus more resources and attention on the rise of China depends on Europe taking on a larger role vis-à-vis Eastern Europe and the Middle East and North Africa.

The United States and Europe have a stake in a rule-based democratic order that limits the ability of countries like China and Russia to undermine that order. A greater division of labor between the two, with the United States focusing more of its attention on Asia, while Europe steps up to manage places like Ukraine and Syria, would be in the interests of both sides of the Atlantic.

America’s unipolar moment has passed, in part because of self-inflicted wounds and in part from the natural rise of the rest. A forward-looking strategy would recognize that the United States needs to work with Europe to maintain and strengthen a liberal order built on a belief in the importance of democracy, markets, and respect for the rule of law. Over the long run, the more significant challenge to this order will come from an illiberal China rather than from an illiberal Russia given the former’s likelihood of becoming a competitive global power.

Though most associate the “Asia pivot” with the Obama administration, the effort to rebalance U.S. foreign policy toward Asia began long before. Clinton came into office believing in the need to do so, but he became embroiled in the Balkans. Bush and his team entered office recognizing the need to respond to China’s rise, but Sept. 11, 2001 forever changed their focus. Obama recognized that U.S. foreign policy was weighted too heavily toward Europe and the Middle East and publicly promoted a rebalancing, but Russia’s actions in Ukraine and the rise of ISIL led him to increase America’s commitment in Eastern Europe, including the deployment of additional troops and more training exercises, and to return to Iraq after believing the United States had accomplished its mission there.

An underappreciated reality about the long-sought Asia rebalance is that it will be much more successful if the United States can coordinate a division of labor with a stronger Europe that can better address the challenges to its East and South. As the name implies, rebalancing means shifting some time, energy, and resources away from areas America has heavily invested in previously toward new challenges. If the United States has to lead the response to Russia in Ukraine while also serving as the primary country investing in Middle East stability, it will be less able to devote time and resources to the Asia-Pacific region.

America’s new long-term Europe strategy should seek a strengthening of relations with a more capable Europe to support a division of labor that upholds the liberal order (a strategy consistent with that called for by a group of German security analysts in a “Transatlantic Manifesto”). The United States would continue to rebalance toward Asia to counter the threat from China, while Europe develops the capacity to better manage the conflicts arising with Russia and to help stabilize the Middle East. This does not mean the United States would “leave” Europe but would rather seek to work with a more capable Europe to uphold an order that serves common Transatlantic interests. Several colleagues and I provided an example of this “division-of-labor” approach in a 2011 report for the Transatlantic Academy:

The division of labor will entail a new pattern of commitments. …[T]he EU should assume the leading role in engaging Russia to resolve conflicts in its neighborhood. In pursuing these objectives, Europe should employ and enhance a full panoply of instruments, ranging from economic associations and assistance for the development of civil society and democracy to peacekeeping forces. Europe should also build on its Mediterranean presence and past efforts in places such as Cyprus and Lebanon to advance economic, political, and social development in societies undergoing rapid transformation.

The United States will remain NATO’s leading military power, and there will be times when those capabilities are required. But as Daniel Hamilton and Stefan Meister have suggested, the European Union has a variety of institutional mechanisms to foster stability and peace to the East and South. They note that this could include a revamped Eastern Partnership that, for example, invests in institution-building efforts such as border management to address separatist conflicts.

A division-of-labor strategy depends above all not on America, but on Europe. We have seen Europe work toward this in recent years: The United Kingdom and France took the lead in the war in Libya (although unfortunately no one took the lead after the war ended), while France and Germany have been key players in attempting to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. The President of France Emmanuel Macron has sought greater involvement in the Middle East, and his government has announced its ambition to develop the capabilities to play a more important role in the region. The German Transatlantic Manifesto is a healthy sign that security analysts in that country are thinking along these lines. Though Merkel emerged from Germany’s recent elections in a weaker position than many had hoped, she remains a formidable force in shaping the future of her country and the continent. The recent coalition agreement forged with the Social Democrats, suggests former German government official Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, “signals to President Macron in France that we are ready” to tackle the kinds of E.U. reform necessary to rejuvenate the institution.

A more proactive Europe is not simply about spending more on defense, but rather about formulating the common foreign and security policy that has eluded it over the past two decades. The beginnings of another such effort has emerged recently through the European Union’s Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), as well as Macron’s proposed European Intervention Initiative, which would include the United Kingdom. Europe will not replace the U.S. militarily, but it doesn’t need to. The European Union should continue to build the capacity for small-scale operations and can use its leverage as an economic institution to invest in stability in fragile states along its periphery. Any efforts the European Union undertakes should complement what NATO does, and allies should make this a central feature of the July 2018 NATO summit agenda.

The European Union will have to sort out its relationship with the United Kingdom and manage the authoritarianism, secessionism, and backsliding emerging across the continent. The United States should encourage Macron and Merkel as they pursue the reforms necessary to address Europe’s political and economic challenges. And when America encourages more European defense spending, it should do so not, as Trump often argues, to get allies to pay back the United States but to more proactively promote European efforts to provide stability and security in the broader region.

While it may be hard to imagine Europe being more able to step into this role in the face of many internal challenges, Charles Grant and his colleagues at the Centre for European Reform argue that this is in fact a propitious moment for European reform. They suggest that continental European solidarity is more likely to finally emerge with the Eurozone in its current period of overall economic growth and because of the reaction to the illiberal policies of Trump, Putin, and Erdoğan. In this scenario, the United Kingdom and the European Union will manage to reach a satisfactory agreement on the terms of Britain’s departure, and Macron and Merkel will successfully work together to move Europe forward, including making the necessary adjustments for the Eurozone. Critical to the success of European reform, however, will be the ability of France and Germany to stem the tide of rising authoritarianism in countries like Poland and Hungary. And while a serious European effort to build greater capacity could be a positive result of the Trump presidency, a coordinated division of labor to manage global challenges is preferable to the two sides of the Atlantic pulling away from one another.

A 21st Century Case for a Strong Europe

The United States needs a stronger Europe not for 20th century reasons of preventing conflict arising in the center of the continent, but for 21st century reasons of managing the threat posed by a rising China. The Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations all sought to focus on the challenge from Asia but they continued to get dragged into (or in one disastrous instance, initiated) conflicts in Europe and the Middle East. While the United States will always play a key role in those traditional areas of American interest, a stronger Europe can and should take on more of the load in its neighborhood. The United States and Europe both have a stake in a rule-based democratic international order. A greater coordinated division of labor would enable the West to continue to promote its common interests in the face of the illiberal challenges arrayed against it.

Nearly 30 years after George H.W. Bush spoke at Mainz, the European project of the last several decades appears to be faltering. The continent today is in many ways neither whole, nor free, nor at peace.

This is no time for the United States to encourage Europe’s divisions. The United States should hope that Brexit is managed in a way that does as little damage to the United Kingdom and Europe as possible, and that France and Germany are more successful promoting European democratic values than Poland and Hungary are in espousing illiberalism. It’s sad to see the West back to containing Russia after the high hopes of the early 1990s, but the United States still has a stake in a strong Europe successfully limiting its internal fracturing and taking on more burdens to its East and South, so that the United States can turn more of its attention toward China and the rest of Asia over the course of the 21st century.

13,https://reason.com/2018/02/18/peace-through-strength-is-a-racket/,"Sun, 18 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Reason,'Peace Through Strength' Is a Racket,"Donald Trump has embraced the popular ""peace through strength"" doctrine (PTSD) with his characteristic panache: ""I'm going to make our military so big, so powerful, so strong, that nobody—absolutely nobody—is gonna to mess with us,"" Trump has said.

On other occasions he's said similar things: ""We want to defer, avoid and prevent conflict through our unquestioned military strength"" (same link) and, a year ago, ""Nobody is going to mess with us. Nobody. It will be one of the greatest military build-ups in American history.""

I will acknowledge that the PTSD has surface appeal. Why not show the world the United States is so awesomely powerful that no one in his right mind would even think to get on its wrong side? It seems to make sense in a practical sort of way.

Once people believe that, of course, they are softened up to accept unlimited military spending and the concomitant deficits and debt. As John T. Flynn used to say, military spending is a favorite of big-government types precisely because the conservatives won't object. Conservatives rail against even small amounts of so-called foreign aid and welfare, but they drool over monstrous sums for the armed forces and spy agencies. (Thankfully, some conservatives don't.)

Progressives, by the way, are not immune to the allure of military spending. When a Pentagon budget cap was debated a few years ago, Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-South Carolina), a leading progressive and a Black Caucus leader, opposed it because he feared losing jobs in his district.

Military spending thus has something for nearly everybody: strength for conservatives; economic stimulus for progressives. The conservative Keynesians like both justifications.

It takes only a few minutes to see that the ""peace through strength"" doctrine is a racket intended (by some of its advocates at least) to gull the unsuspecting populace into supporting whatever the war party and the Pentagon want. It is handy for parrying the antimilitarist' charge that its espousers are dangerously reckless, if not outright warmongers. ""We're not warmongers,"" they can reply. ""A military second to none will prevent war and promote peace. We're the peaceniks. You doves are the promoters of war."" They are also likely to quote (without knowing the source) Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus's De re militari, ""If you want peace, prepare for war.""

Brilliant!—but the doctrine encases a racket just the same, much as ""war is a racket,"" as the highly decorated U.S. Marine Maj. Gen Smedley Butler put it. I'd like to meet the grifter who thought it up.

At least one thick book could be written on the flaws in the doctrine. I can sum them up by invoking the law of unintended consequences and the law of perverse incentives, by which I mean the well-established public-choice problems regarding policymaking and voter interest. People may have the best intentions in supporting the PTSD, but they have absolutely no reason to believe the policy would be carried out as they envision. We must expect the worse, or as David Hume charmingly wrote, ""Political writers have established it as a maxim, that, in contriving any system of government, … every man ought to be supposed a knave."" Had we listened to Hume, many fewer things would have gone awry.

Trump's deployment of the PTSD suggests that the U.S. military isn't already powerful enough to deter an attack. But that is balderdash. The government now spends more on the military than the next 12 countries combined. The recent increase alone was bigger than Russia's entire military budget.

But that is an understatement because the Pentagon budget is far from the total amount the U.S. government spends on ""national security."" Robert Higgs wrote in 2007:

Hardly anyone appreciates that the total amount of all defense-related spending greatly exceeds the amount budgeted for the Department of Defense. Indeed, it is roughly almost twice as large…. Lodged elsewhere in the budget, however, other lines identify funding that serves defense purposes just as surely as—sometimes even more surely than—the money allocated to the Department of Defense. On occasion, commentators take note of some of these additional defense-related budget items, such as the Department of Energy's nuclear-weapons programs, but many such items, including some extremely large ones, remain generally unrecognized.

Thus when George W. Bush formally proposed to spend $583 billion on the military in fiscal 2008, Higgs calculated the real tab at $934.9 billion. The story is the same today. We may reasonably ask: how can Trump know the military isn't already powerful enough to deter any would-be attacker and how can he know that spending less would make Americans less safe? What we have here is a knowledge problem, which politicians and bureaucrats are likely to exploit in favor of more spending.

By PTSD standards, no amount of spending is enough: ""If I'm wrong,"" the militarist will say, ""we'll blow a few bucks. If you're wrong, we'll be speaking Russian, Chinese, Arabic, or Farsi.""

The war party tries to bolster its case by claiming the U.S. military was hollowed out by Barack Obama; thus we must rebuild. Bullfeathers! As Nick Gillespie of Reason pointed out a year ago:

There's little doubt that the military is exhausted. Since 2001, we've been waging endless wars, including in countries against whom we've never officially declared war. We're still in Afghanistan and Iraq, of course, and all signs point to boots on the ground in Syria sooner or later. War footing isn't simply expensive (even if we're spending less on ""overseas contingency operations"" that we did in the mid-Aughts), it introduces incredible strain and stress throughout the military and society at home. But depleted, underfunded, undersized, unready? Please. Defense spending ratcheted up during the Bush years in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the invasion of Afghanistan, and the war in Iraq. It hasn't come close to coming back down. In a nation that has supposedly wound down two of its longest wars and where the principal threat to the homeland is a group of religious extremists who live thousands of miles away (and are, lest we forget, a byproduct of our own failed occupation of the Middle East), we always need more money for defense, right?

To be sure, Trump has doubled down on all the Bush-Obama wars, but those have nothing to do with the safety of Americans. Therefore the personnel could be brought home and the military budget cut.

To put things into perspective, when Dwight Eisenhower was president, at the start of the Cold War, his annual military budgets for seven out of his eight years were under $400 billion (in 2012 dollars)—less than Harry Truman bequeathed him. So why does Trump need $716 billion today (to use the official but incomplete figure) when the Soviet Union is long gone, Russia's military gets only $47 billion, and China, which spends $192.5, is a major trading partner? (We'll get to Iran and North Korea shortly.)

Another objection to the PTSD is the temptation the overgrown military establishment presents to policymakers. This was best articulated by Bill Clinton's secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, who recounts in her memoir how—in the late 1990s, as Clinton was looking to intervene against Serbia—she asked Joint Chiefs Chairman Colin Powell, ""What's the point of having this superb military that you're always talking about if we can't use it?"" Here was the supposed chief diplomat more or less saying, ""We've got this big hammer, so why not see every problem as a nail.""

Government officials, hiding behind classified material, can easily inflate and even create so-called threats, and they have an obvious incentive to do so. Moreover, a big military is going to be a menacing military because it will conduct war games close to other countries; when governments respond, they can be accused of provocation and aggression. (In contrast, American moves are never provocative.) And yes, politicians and bureaucrats lie, especially in foreign policy. War is a lie, to appropriate David Swanson's book title. Post-Vietnam, we should not have needed to be reminded of this danger, but we sure got a reminder with Iraq in 2002-03.

Who do the PSDT advocates think would attack the United States unless it has a bigger military? Who presents an existential threat? Some will say we no longer need to fear a conventional attack or invasion by a nation-state. What then? Terrorists? What is more ridiculous than the contention that a terrorist organization would be deterred by an even more powerful U.S. military? Osama bin Laden hoped the U.S. government would respond to 9/11 by invading the Muslim world and spending itself into bankruptcy. And does anyone seriously believe a domestic lone wolf, having been ""radicalized"" after looking at al-Qaeda websites or seeing news accounts of U.S. atrocities in the Middle East, would take the size of the U.S. military into account when plotting retaliation?

Perhaps before we dismiss the nation-state threat we ought to ask if Iran and North Korea are special cases. The leaders of Iran have been called ""mad mullahs,"" and Kim-Jong Un has been described as insane. But this poses a problem for the PTSD. If those rulers are indeed mad, how can we expect them to be rational enough to do calculate the costs and benefits of an attack?

On the other hand, if they are not mad—and we have no reason to believe they are—we may reasonably assume they know they would gain nothing from an attack. A larger U.S. military would not change that; neither would a dramatically scaled-back military. But the large national-security apparatus the United States already has is a daily threat to Iran and North Korea. These so-called threats have been manufactured in Washington, D.C.

For the record, Trump's military brain trust says the biggest national-security challenges come from Russia and China, not terrorism. ""Inter-state strategic competition, not terrorism, is now the primary concern in U.S. national security,"" the new National Defense Strategy's unclassified summary states.

Finally, military spending takes money out of the pockets of taxpayers, who, it's safe to say, have personally important uses for that money. Instead of labor and resources flowing into industries that make consumers better off, they go to politicians, bureaucrats, and all the businesses that long to sell things to the government. This is the infamous military-industrial complex, which is far more pervasive than anything Eisenhower ever had nightmares about. The deep distortion of economic activity is part of the incalculable cost of the national-security state. We literally don't know what we're missing because of it.

The way to achieve peace is not to prepare for war but to reject militarism and empire, and embrace nonintervention. Prophecies of war are too easily self-fulfilling. Thus, as a pioneer of modern libertarianism, F. A. Harper, put it many years ago, ""It is now urgent in the interest of liberty that many persons become 'peace-mongers.'""

This piece was originally published by The Libertarian Institute.","Once people believe that, of course, they are softened up to accept unlimited military spending and the concomitant deficits and debt.
As John T. Flynn used to say, military spending is a favorite of big-government types precisely because the conservatives won't object.

Because Palestinian elites have no interest in doing so,"This article is excerpted from Ben-Dror Yemini’s new book, Industry of Lies: Media, Academia, and the Israeli-Arab Conflict, published by ISGAP.

We must admit that there is no chance for peace in the foreseeable future.

It’s not that the solution is complicated. Despite the disagreements, despite the fantasy of mass Return, and despite the isolated settlements, there are clear parameters for peace. Bill Clinton presented them in late 2000; the Geneva plan presented a similar plan in 2002; Ehud Olmert repeated it, with semantic changes, in 2008; John Kerry introduced two versions with almost the same parameters in 2014. Even the Arab initiative, if we take away the fantasy of mass Return, could have been the basis for an agreement.

Although the parameters are known, peace cannot be achieved.

In the past century there have been many conflicts. Almost every actualization of the right to self-determination created a bloody conflict, years of struggle, and the expulsion of populations. Yet, eventually, agreements were reached. Enemies have become neighbors. Peace agreements have also been signed between Israel and two Arab states — Egypt and Jordan, and Israel maintains cooperation with many other Arab states.

So why this should not have happened in the Israeli Palestinian conflict? Because it has another dimension, which was absent in other conflicts. The Palestinian elites have reached a status that no elite had before. The Palestinian struggle is not one more struggle.

It became the most famous, most celebrated, and the most prestigious of all — the crown jewel of causes. The Palestinian refusal to accept any peace proposal is not only due to historical reasons or a sense of injustice. It is not about more or less concessions. It stems from the fact that the Palestinian elites only benefit from the continuation of the conflict. The Palestinians have become not only the ultimate global symbol of a “victim” and an “oppressed people,” who are supposedly fighting against colonialism and occupation. They have become global celebrities.

On the one hand, members of the Palestinian elite come and leave the capitals of the world dressed in the most tailored and fashionable of men’s apparel. They enjoy the good life. On the other hand, they succeed in creating a misrepresentation of “the wretched on earth.”

According to any objective measure of life expectancy, infant mortality, natural increase, education, and so forth, the Palestinians are not in the worst shape among the world’s needy populations. Just the opposite. Most people in the world live in much worse circumstances. But they are not in the headlines. No one is demonstrating for them. The claim that those who identify with the Palestinians are concerned with human rights is one of the most ridiculous claims of the present era; supporters of the Palestinian struggle are, after all, not bothered by the tens of millions who suffer from internal or external oppression.

* * *

Let’s imagine a student from northern Nigeria on an American campus. He represents one of the most miserable communities in the world, suffering from non-stop Jihadist terrorism of Boko Haram: thousands have been massacred; 1.4 million children have become refugees, 100,000 of them on the verge of starvation. But nobody cares about them. There are no demonstrations. No global protest. No conferences. Nigeria is not included in the latest buzz words about oppression. Yet, for many, Israel has become representative of all other injustices in the world, in addition to one’s own as an African-American, woman, or homosexual, as illustrated by the phenomenon of intersectionality.

In any case, the world stage is dominated by the Palestinians. Couple this with intersectionality, and it ensures that countless opponents of injustice half way across the world will be aligning themselves against “the oppressor Israel.” It doesn’t help that “colonialism,” one of the magic words in post modern discourse, can, through selective interpretation and a web of lies, be used to tag Israel as an oppressor. It is a little difficult to use the word “colonialist” against the Jihadists even if they have extreme imperialist ambitions.

Not only is there no worldwide protest against the Jihad affiliates, there is even support for those who champion an anti-Semitic, fascist, and murderous ideology. Italian philosopher Gianni Vattimo displayed his stripes in the middle of the 2014 Gaza War, declaring “shoot those bastard Zionists,” encouraging the Europeans to buy weapons for Hamas, and arguing that “Israel is worse than the Nazis.” The feminist organization Code Pink organized no less than seven solidarity missions to Gaza, meeting with Hamas members (never mind that the mufti of Gaza tells male viewers how to beat their wives without leaving scars that would make them ugly or alert the police).

Then there are high-profile entertainers, such as the aging British rocker and lead singer from Pink Floyd, Roger Waters, who compares Israel to Nazi Germany and supports BDS, or British film director Ken Loach, who called for a cultural boycott of Israel. Even if they don’t convince their fellow artists, who keep on coming to Israel, they still encourage the Palestinian elites to keep on with the struggle against Israel instead of fighting for peace.

There is a whole chapter in the work at hand about major producers in the industry of lies, such as academic Noam Chomsky, who made a pilgrimage to visit Hezbollah leader Nasrallah in Lebanon; UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who embraced Hamas and Hezbollah as his “friends”; Judith Butler, who turned them into progressive bodies; and Canadian writer Naomi Klein, who cuts Hamas out of the equation when attacking Israel as the aggressor in the 2014 Gaza War.

There are even some academics who have turned their anti Israel positions into a career— such as Norman Finkelstein, a highly visible figure on the lecture circuit, as well as a talented and highly entertaining speaker who attracts droves of students on campuses around the world, and elsewhere.

Individual academics are not the only ones who participate in the industry of lies, and MESA (the Middle East Studies Association in the United States) presidents are not the only supporters of BDS. The same evil spirit extends to campus life — awash in anti Israel “academic gatherings.”

With all the big bucks flowing in, with no strings attached, what are the chances that Palestinian activists will give up this abundance of status, honor, prestige and jobs?

For example, at University College Cork Ireland in April 2017, a three-day academic conference was held under the heading “International Law and the State of Israel: Legitimacy Exceptionalism and Responsibility.” Speakers pilloried Israel as an exception to the world order (as if it was the only nation state) in order to deliberate whether Israel could legitimately exist as such an exception. The keynote speaker was Richard Falk, who used the occasion to charge that the foundation of Israel was “the most successful terror campaign in history.” There was actually a conference slated to take place in the UK at the University of Southampton (but prohibited at the last-minute by campus authorities on “health and safety concerns”) devoted to the question “does Israel have the right to exist.” No such conference was contemplated to discuss England’s right to exist, of course.

Some Israel bashing gatherings take place under a cloak of polite respectability such as a July 2017 two-day conference at the University of Sydney in Australia, called “BDS: Driving Global Justice for Palestine,” hosted by none other than the Department for Peace and Conflict Studies. The use of benign language is disarming: the objective of the gathering was to promote “greater public understanding of the BDS campaign,” which, the organizers stressed, would be devoted to “harness rational argument to support a more peaceful and more just world.” (One needs to understand the subtext of “a just world”: it includes a Palestinian right of return, demanded by Students for Justice in Palestine, in order to rectify Israel’s alleged ethnic cleansing.)

This intellectual disease extends to the American political arena, where anti Israel currents have gained a foothold within the Democratic Party, reflected in a one-sided amendment to the Middle East plank of the Democratic platform, suggested by Bernie Sanders’ people, that was rejected by a narrow margin of 95 to 73, as well as the rising popularity of movers and shakers with strong anti Israel orientations, such as Keith Ellison and Linda Sarsour.

The problem is that the Palestinians read such undercurrents as proof that they are on a winning streak, at least in terms of the Democratic Party, giving them no reason to rethink their positions or seek reconciliation.

The limelight as a livelihood

Palestinians are riding a wave of support from celebrities in a host of professions, including academia, with few, if any, strings attached.

It is not only the Palestinian leadership that enjoys ideological and moral support. Dozens of Palestinian or pro Palestinian organizations receive extensive financial support from dozens of celebrated foundations and political structures: the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Open Society Foundation (George Soros), the European Union, individual European countries, and church funds. Then, of course, there is UNRWA and other United Nations funding entities.

With all the big bucks flowing in, with no strings attached, what are the chances that Palestinian activists will give up this abundance of status, honor, prestige and jobs? Is it at all surprising that Palestinian activists of such well-funded NGOs are against reconciliation and peace?

The Palestinians’ special status as the blue-eyed boy everyone embraces creates some very strange anomalies. Palestinian activists stand shoulder to shoulder with LGBT activists, although everyone knows — or should know — that members of the LGBT community in the Palestinian territories are at severe risk, facing persecution and often mortal danger. As a result, many prefer to flee to Israel.

Too many Palestinians have a huge vested interest in intransigence and violence

These are the facts, but anti Israel demonstrations are also held under the charge of “pink washing” — the idiotic theory stating that Israel grants freedom and rights to people of different sexual orientations only as a mask to conceal the horrors of the occupation. Thus, members of the Palestinian and anti Israel elites have succeed not only in disseminating ridiculous theories, but also in obtaining an exemption from violations of basic human rights for Palestinian authorities. This is another expression of racism of low expectations.

There are Palestinians who suffer. These are mainly those in Lebanon, who experience apartheid (subject to separate laws) with all its implications, or those in Syria who suffer, together with the rest of the Syrian population, from terrible bloodshed. They can only dream to live under Israeli rule. Yet, they do not interest anyone because they are not under Israeli control.

Under Israeli rule, on the other hand, the Palestinians in the territories enjoy the highest rate of higher education in the Arab world. In fact, the rise in the level of education has led to the emigration of tens of thousands of young Palestinians to Europe and the United States, subsequently eligible for graduate studies in the most prestigious universities (hundreds of them subsequently became faculty).

In an era dominated by a postcolonial school of thought, the Palestinians have become the icon for struggle against colonialism. If the symbol in the 1960s was Che Guevara, the contemporary symbol is to sport a Palestinian keffiyeh scarf.

There are a thousand and one rivalries between student organizations that represent different groups, but they are united about one subject: their support for the Palestinians, with no knowledge about the conflict. Instead of focusing their efforts on the rights of African-Americans, the Black Lives Matter movement has become fixated on Israel, even accusing the Jewish state of the events in Ferguson. There will always be Jews and Israelis to tell them that Israel is the source of their troubles. In the past, it was said that Jews were the source of global evil. Today, it is said that Zionists are the source of every evil.

This is the madness consuming the free and academic world. This distortion does not support peace, reconciliation, or compromise. The common denominator of these bodies, which are supported by academia and funded by the EU and various other foreign governments, is usually their opposition to the very existence of Israel. It is doubtful whether there is one body among them that supports peace and reconciliation and that is funded by the same sources.

Does this encourage the Palestinian elites towards reconciliation with Israel, or does it encourage them to perpetuate the struggle? And if this is the position of the progressive elites of the free world, why would a rational Palestinian change direction and support reconciliation and compromise? Why should any of the Palestinians give up the special status they now enjoy that bundles together victimhood, prestige, legitimacy for all their actions, economic benefit and a comfortable livelihood?

A peace agreement would undermine this special status. Instead of talking about racism and colonialism, instead of being the stars of academia and the darlings of the progressive elites, and instead of enjoying generous funding as activists against oppression, the Palestinians will have to worry about welfare, sewage systems, and building a state. They will have to take responsibility for themselves and their fate. They will stop receiving tens of millions of dollars each year for political struggle. They will not be the stars of the campuses. That is the last thing they want.

They have succeeded in convincing many intellectual circles in the world that BDS is a “nonviolent movement” against racism and for equal rights. There is no greater lie than that. The BDS movement is fighting to deny the right of self-determination of one state among all the countries of the world: Israel.

What should rational and decent people do?

What can rational and decent people do against this mind-boggling phenomenon?

First, expose the absurdities. Do not give in to the thought police. Maintain independent and critical thinking, connected to reality. Make a hierarchy of global injustices. The Alice in Wonderland-like lunacy that is taking place in significant sectors of the academic and media elites is not a problem for Israel. It is a problem of the free world. This is fake knowledge that produces fake realities.

The attention, top priority, aide and grants underwrites an entire sector of the economy and society that “makes a living from the conflict” — from elite Palestinian leaders flying around the world in first class and elegant suits to academics paid to write a flood of studies on the feasibility of the right of return, to tunnel operators in Gaza, and families who depend on stipends for sons killed in terrorist attacks (shahids).

The Palestinian public sector is gigantic, and the bonanza of cheap money as the world’s favorite humanitarian cause is reflected on the landscape in the West Bank — glass clad skyscrapers and public institutions, private villas, and virtual mansions that Westerners rarely see. The Pan-Arab paper Asharq al Awsat in London investigated the phenomenon and concluded that there are 600 millionaires in Gaza! Too many Palestinians have a huge vested interest in intransigence and violence.

There is a conflict of interest between rewarded Palestinian elites who want to perpetuate the conflict, and the Palestinian masses who suffer from the conflict. Reaching a peace agreement would lead, for example, to reducing the distress of the Palestinians in Lebanon who are legally, socially and geographically marginalized. They will not be able to return to Israel because Israel has no plans to commit demographic suicide, but they will receive new options, such as an international compensation fund, naturalization in some countries, options for returning to the Palestinian entity, and more. When the elites perpetuate the fantasy of the right of return, they perpetuate the continuation of suffering and plight.

It is possible and necessary to resolve the Israeli Palestinian conflict. The outlines are known. There is not much to innovate. For this to happen, it is permissible and, indeed, necessary to criticize Israeli policy. But this will not happen as long as a widespread and well oiled academic and political apparatus provides the Palestinian elites with honor, money and prestige that perpetuate the conflict.

This march of folly must be stopped. Not to harm the Palestinians, but to give them hope and to save them.

Council,

Takes note of the comprehensive and valuable briefing by the Chairperson of the AUHIP on the activities of the Panel in fulfillment of its mandate, particularly: its engagements in support to the Sudanese and South Sudanese Parties on the implementation of the Cooperation Agreement, 2012; its support for the negotiations to end conflict in Darfur and the Two Areas of Blue Nile and South Kordofan, as well as national political processes to resolve Sudan’s challenges; and on its efforts, working with IGAD, to deepen collective analysis of the challenges facing the Horn of Africa. Council further takes note of the statements made by the Permanent Representatives of Sudan and South Sudan, as well as Ethiopia in its capacity as the Chair of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and African Member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), and by Cote d’Ivoire, in its capacity as an African member of the UNSC; Commends the work of the Panel and pays tribute to its members, namely former President Thabo Mbeki of South African; former President Abdulsalami Abubakar of Nigeria; and former President Pierre Buyoya of Burundi, and their support staff for their unwavering commitment and untiring efforts towards achieving peace in Sudan and South Sudan, as well as in the promotion of peace, security and stability in the Horn of Africa. Council also commends the Chair of IGAD, Prime Minister Haile Mariam Desalegn of Ethiopia, for his continued engagement and support to the efforts of the Panel; Welcomes the appointment of the AU High Representative for Silencing the Guns, Ambassador Ramtane Lamamra, former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Algeria, as a new member of the AUHIP. Council recognizes the significant experience, knowledge and skills that Mr. Lamamra will bring to the discharge of the Panel's mandate; Expresses its appreciation for the role of the Special Envoy of the UN Secretary-General, Nicholas Haysom, in support to the AU; the Joint Special Representative, for the United Nations and AU Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID), Jeremiah Kingsley Mamabolo; and the Special Envoy of IGAD, Lissane Yohannes, for their active support for the work of the Panel. Council also expresses deep appreciation for the generous support and assistance being extended to the AUHIP by the AU's bilateral and multilateral partners; Notes, in relation to Sudan, that there have been several developments that have impacted on the situation in that country, including the completion of the first phase of the Sudanese National Dialogue, albeit without the participation of some opposition groups. Council also notes the lifting of economic sanctions by the United States, following progress by Sudan in its cooperation with the United States on key areas of mutual interest, and the improvement in Sudan’s relations with the international community; Welcomes the unilateral declaration of a ceasefire and cessation of hostilities respectively by the Government of Sudan and the armed movements, namely the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N), in respect of the Two Areas, and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and the Sudan Liberation Movement- Minni Minawi (SLM-MM) in respect of Darfur; Further welcomes the Joint Statement on Unilateral Ceasefire, Cessation of Hostilities and Completion of Negotiations, signed on 4 February 2018, jointly by the Government of Sudan and the SPLM-N, committing themselves to sustain their unilateral ceasefire and cessation of hostilities, which have brought significant benefits to the people of the Two Areas; continue their efforts to resolve the outstanding issues that prevented completion of the Cessation of Hostilities; and reconvene at the invitation of the Panel to complete the negotiations on a formal Cessation of Hostilities. Council strongly urges the Parties to indeed continue their search for the necessary compromises and flexibility that will enable them to reach agreement at the next round of negotiations, to permit formalization of an agreement and allow the delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in need; Recalls that the Sudan National Dialogue called by President Omar Hassan Al'Bashir in January 2014, was concluded in Khartoum on 10 October 2016—albeit without the participation of key opposition entities—with the adoption a National Document of recommendations, and the establishment of a High Implementation Committee (HIC) to oversee the next phases of the Dialogue, most notably, the preparations for elections, and the making of a new Constitution for the Republic of Sudan; Reiterates its conviction that the principles of the Roadmap Agreement, which require the Sudanese Parties to pursue inclusive processes for designing the next phases of the political processes in Sudan, especially to oversee the electoral processes in Sudan and the critical task of drafting a new constitution for Sudan, remain relevant for the democratic transformation of Sudan; Notes with concern that the Sudanese economy is facing serious structural challenges which the Government has sought to address through remedial economic policies. Council further notes that the measures taken by the Government of Sudan have triggered public protests, particularly since January 2018, to which the authorities have responded by arresting some leaders and journalists, a number of whom continue to be detained. Welcomes the improvement of the situation in the Abyei area thanks to the continued deployment of the UN Interim Force for Abyei (UNISFA). Council commends the Governments of Sudan and South Sudan for the implementation of previous decisions of the PSC concerning their cooperation on security issues. Council recalls the UN Security Council resolutions 2352 (2017) and 2386 (2017) of 15 May 2017 and 15 November 2017, respectively. In this regard, Council also welcomes the convening on 4 February 2018, in Addis Ababa, of the Extraordinary meeting of the Joint Political and Security Mechanism (JPSM), facilitated by the AUHIP, during which key decisions have been reached to address all concerned expressed by the UN Security Council; Acknowledges the significant improvement in the relations between the Ngok Dinka and Misseriya communities in Abyei. Council takes note of the extraordinary meeting of the Abyei Joint Oversight Committee (AJOC) that took place from 14 to 15 November 2017, alongside a meeting of traditional leaders of Ngok Dinka and Misseriya communities. Council underscores that while the AJOC meeting discussed the Abyei Area interim institutions, created by the Agreement on Temporary Administrative and Security Arrangements for the Abyei Area of June 2011, the meeting was not able to reach agreement on the establishment of the interim institutions. Notes that no progress have been made in resolving the final status of Abyei. In this context, Council recalls the communique PSC/MIN/COMM/1(CCCXXXIX) of its 339th meeting held at Ministerial level, on 24 October 2012, which accepted the AUHIP’s Proposal on the Final Status of Abyei Area of 21 September 2012, and requested the Presidents of Sudan and South Sudan to continue their discussion on the Final Status of Abyei on the basis of the Panel's Proposal; Further recalls the previous engagement of the AUHIP in the situation in South Sudan and encourages the Panel to extend its support to AU engagement in complementing IGAD efforts towards the resolution of the conflict in South Sudan, including the vital task of nation building; Congratulates the AUHIP for convening a strategic consultation on the Horn of Africa which took place in Khartoum, from 8 to 10 October 2017, and brought together a diverse group of stakeholders, including senior policymakers from the states of the region and beyond, scholars, thought leaders and civil society representatives, to assist the Panel in developing a regional and holistic approach to the challenges of peace, security, stability and development in the Horn of Africa; in collaboration with IGAD.

Strong indications have emerged that the Nigeria Police may bow to the Federal high courts in Abuja which restrained it from further sealing up the corporate head office of the Peace Corps of Nigeria (PCN) in Abuja.



The House of Representatives had on Monday directed the Police authorities to unseal the office within 48 hours in compliance with the judgments of Justices’ Gabriel Kolawole and John Isoho on the office sealed up since February 28, 2017.

Based on the House directive, officers and men of the Corps led by the National Commandant, Ambassador Dickson Akoh had stormed the office located at 57, Iya Abubakar Crescent, Jabi, Abuja to take over possession of the office from police in line with the directive of the lower chamber of the National Assembly.

However, the policemen met at the gate of the two-storey building claimed ignorance of the directive to vacate the office and instead alerted their superior officers on the development through phone calls and radio messages.

A detachment of police led by Assistant Commissioner of police, Mr. Okafor Mathew later arrived at the scene and was briefed by the policemen keeping vigil on the office.

The ACP later spoke with Peace Corps Commandant and thereafter put phone calls to other superior officers who requested to speak with the Peace Corps boss.

In the conversation that followed, the police pleaded with the Peace Corps to give them one week to comply with orders of the courts on the sealed house.

The Commandant was informed that the Inspector General of Police Ibrahim Idris was away to Lagos to attend a National Programme and that he will give final order in respect of the count judgments next week.

After much pleading, Akoh and his officers and men agreed to leave the place till next week to await the final decision of the police on the orders of court.

The Peace Corps boss while briefing ACP Okafor Mathew said that they were at the office to resume work in line with the directive of the House of Representatives issued on Monday.

He reiterated the commitment of his organization to be peaceful in the resolution of the log jam arising from the unlawful sealing of the office since last year.

Akoh explained that the office was rented at a fee of N13.5M per year adding that a year had gone without accessing the office.

The police team leader however counseled that the Peace Corps men to give police one week to resolve all issues that informed the action of police.

Earlier, an Abuja based lawyer Mr. Edward Omega had condemned police for the consistent disregard to lawful orders of courts.

He said that executive lawlessness and recklessness are unknown to law under democracy and pleaded with President Muhammadu Buhari and well-meaning Nigeria to prevail on police to always obey laws so as to avoid anarchy.

18,https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/blog/2018/violent-extremism-reopens-the-conversation-about-women-and-peace.html,"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",UNDP,Violent extremism reopens the conversation about women and peace,"“No peace without women,” is a statement we are all eager to agree with. But what are the nuances of women’s participation in peace, conflict and extremism today, and how can understanding women’s roles help us better support them - not only at the national peace table, but also as agents of change in their communities?

In broad lines, peace is understood today as inextricably linked with gender equality and women’s leadership in prevention, protection and peacebuilding efforts. This consensus was first articulated 18 years ago by the adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325, and reaffirmed in the women, peace and security resolutions that followed.

However, much has changed in the world since 2000, in particular the rise in violent extremist activity. Unlike traditional conflict, extremist violence is not confined by borders and directly impacts both the Global South and North. The challenge of addressing extremist ideology has demanded a shift of our attention back to the human beings behind the extreme violence and the aspirations, motivations and identities that drive them. When seeking to mitigate extremism, it becomes abundantly clear that our goal should not just to end conflict; instead we should strive to contribute to build and sustain peaceful and tolerant, resilient societies.

For these reasons, violent extremism has re-opened the conversation around women, conflict and peace. Although the Secretary-General’s Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism acknowledges the needs of women and girls, traditional counter-terrorism and Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) tactics are too often gender-blind. Too often they fail to build on the framework of the women, peace and security agenda or the lessons learned from gender in disaster risk reduction. While the perception may have moved away from viewing women solely as perpetual victims, classifying them binarily as either “victims” or “combatants” obscures the nuance of their roles in extremist conflict.

In reality, the roles of women in extremist settings are complex. Women may perpetuate extremism, either because they joined extremist movements voluntarily, or because they were forced to do so. Women may also be associated with male fighters as wives, mothers, daughters and community members. Women may act as peacebuilders, including through women’s organizations, using their influence in families and communities to deploy unique solutions to support prevention, de-radicalization, psychosocial support and rehabilitation from extremism. Finally women may move between these roles, depending on the situation they find themselves in and the opportunities they are given.

When we talk about “women,” we should be careful not to consider them a homogeneous group: women in extremist contexts vary widely in terms of their age, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, disability, migration status and so forth. Painting with a broad brush is counter-productive; we need information that can help us and our partners make targeted, gender-sensitive and intersectional decisions when designing programmes and policies.

Research helps us discern the particulars of understanding and addressing the complex needs of women in the prevention of violent extremism. It is a critical tool for filling data and knowledge gaps and for designing evidence-based programming. Under the umbrella of our four-year Global Programme “Development solutions for the prevention of violent extremism,” UNDP supports research initiatives and evidence-based dialogue at global and regional levels. We examine the factors that fuel radicalization and violent extremism as well as the drivers of peace. Our research agenda is steered by the Oslo Governance Centre , conducted in collaboration with UNDP regional hubs, and in partnership with academic and research institutions. To review progress made, and knowledge generated on gender-responsive violent extremism research, UNDP is organizing a second conference in Oslo (“Oslo II”) in May.

We prioritize research that elevates the voices and experiences of local women peacebuilders and women’s organizations. One of our current, on-going research initiatives, entitled The Role of Women in Violent Extremism as Perpetrators, Returnees and Peacebuilders, is carried out in partnership with the International Civil Society Action Network to bring to light the experiences of women in de-radicalization processes and document the strategies and approaches of women’s organizations that support returnees.

Taking a closer look at women’s roles in violent extremism reveals women’s flexibility, their resilience, and their potential to act as agents of change. While some women may indeed be perpetrators of extremism they are typically in the minority, and women even may exhibit a more socially cohesive tendency: UNDP’s recent report Journey to Extremism in Africa found that women were more likely than men to agree that people belonging to different religions should be treated equally.

Local women’s connections in their communities, understanding of culturally specific issues, and skill at mobilizing social capital positions them as strong interlocutors for peace. UNDP has previously highlighted the potential of grassroots women to lead resilience-building in their communities in the face of disasters – it is time to do the same for extremist contexts. If we aim to work towards a positive peace that is inclusive and sustainable, we will need to carry forth the work of Resolution 1325 and with that, we will need the help of women.","For these reasons, violent extremism has re-opened the conversation around women, conflict and peace.

Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, Good Morning.

The United Nations Development Programme is honoured to join the Permanent Missions of Norway and the International Civil Society Action Network (ICAN) in hosting this discussion. I am particularly pleased to welcome Jens Frølich Holte, State Secretary at the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Ms. Sanam Anderlini, Co-Founder & Executive Director, International Civil Society Action Network(ICAN); Ms. Nada Darwezeh, Chief of the Gender Equality Section at the Center for Women at the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia; as well as Ms. Visaka Dharmadasa, Founder and Chair of the Association of War Affected Women (AWAW) in Sri Lanka, and Ms. Avazkan Ormonova, Director of the Public Fund ""Business Initiative Women"" in Kyrgyzstan.

The 62nd CSW focuses on the challenges and opportunities in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of rural women and girls. It is often women in rural areas who are most affected by conflict and insecurity. Rural livelihoods can be shattered by the damaging impacts of violent conflict, and the distance from centrally-headquartered law enforcement and peacekeeping services can put rural women and girls at particular physical risk.

The vital role of women in achieving peace and development – which has been recognised in a series of UN Resolutions on women, peace and security starting in 2000 with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 - has now been reaffirmed in both the Sustaining Peace Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals.

The 2015 Global Study on the Implementation of resolution 1325 revealed that the resolution should be regarded as one of the crowning achievements of the global women’s movement, and one of the most inspired decisions of the United Nations Security Council. The recognition that peace is inextricably linked with gender equality and women’s leadership was a radical step for the highest body tasked with the maintenance of international peace and security.

And yet, there remains a gap between the ambition of our commitments and actual political will and financial support. While the WPS agenda has contributed to significant changes in international norms surrounding women’s political leadership and decision-making on peace and security, its national implementation has remained slow and patchy at best.

Analysis shows that while 73 UN Member States have UNSCR 1325 National Action Plans, only 17 of them have allocated budgets for their implementation.

On average, every year, UNDP implements programs to support the more effective functioning of some 70 parliaments around the world. Over the past few years, we have sought to re-orient this support toward capacitation of parliaments and parliamentarians to be fit for purpose as actors in the 2030 Agenda. An integral aspect of our efforts focuses on women parliamentarians, and on advocating for a greater role for parliaments and parliamentarians in peace and security.

Let me give you an example on how parliaments can make an impact in supporting infrastructure for peace:

Ghana’s national peace architecture, particularly its National Peace Council, has been recognized as an important emerging model for developing state capacity to protect civilians and prevent conflict. In November 2010, the National Peace Council Bill was presented to Parliament and in March 2011, was unanimously adopted by Parliament. The enactment of the Bill formally constituted the Commission and empowered it to begin its duties, to coordinate conflict prevention, management, and resolution, and build sustainable peace through networking and coordination. Parliament approves the annual budget for the Council and takes a close interest in its activities.

Members of national parliaments are uniquely positioned to promote peace and pluralism, in their role as elected representatives of the people.

Parliamentarians can also be critical players in ensuring the needs of rural women are properly addressed. As local representatives, members of Parliament can carry specific stories of hardship back to the capital and lobby for action.

Parliamentarians, through their law-making and oversight functions, can ensure that government institutions promote peace, security and gender equality by guaranteeing that all laws – in their intent and in their application - promote and protect human rights, inclusive governance and accountability. This is of particular importance in the law and justice sectors.

Parliamentarians have other relevant tools at their disposal. They can use Question Time or interpellations to ask the Government what actions they are taking to address rural women’s needs. In committees, they can propose the initiation of specific parliamentary inquiries into critical issues, including whether the WPS agenda is being implemented to address rural women’s specific needs. They can encourage targeted budgeting to ensure women are included in peacebuilding and economic development efforts, and they can support funding of National Action Plans on Women, Peace, and Security.

Greater engagement between parliaments and civil society can also be a powerful way of promoting participation of women and girls in all aspects of peace and security, including in rural areas. UNDP recognises that systematic and structured engagement between civil society, government, parliaments and the UN system is truly vital. Civil society groups – alone or in coalition (such as the members of the International Civil Society Action Network) can act as intermediaries to support women – helping to bring issues that are of particular importance to them to the national and even international stage.

I am very pleased to use this forum to announce a new UNDP project to support legislatures to domesticate the WPS agenda through parliamentary action. With the generous support of the Government of Norway, UNDP will work with three parliaments in 2018 –including that of Kyrgyzstan– to specifically reflect upon their current WPS National Action Plans and develop parliamentary action plans to support of them. Drawing on their input and feedback, as well as other contributions from parliaments around the world, we will then produce a Handbook for Parliaments on WPS Implementation.

Many people in this room today – not least our panellists - have rich personal experiences to draw upon, and I greatly look forward to the coming exchange of views, both today and as this programme of work moves forward.

I now pass the floor to Mr Jens Frølich Holte, State Secretary, Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, once again with an acknowledgement of Norway’s leadership in this important area of work.","The 62nd CSW focuses on the challenges and opportunities in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of rural women and girls.

Pamela Makanjera

Economist

Zimbabweans have probably never had this kind of media freedom and freedom of speech in a very long time, although it isstill too early to celebrate. One of the issues that was a bit like walking on a plank of nails was that of peace and peacebuilding by private entities in Zimbabwe. Apart from the fact that this is a hot issue where you could “burn” your hands, there is also the issue of the private sector not taking time to fully comprehend and unpack the fundamentals of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 16 — promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. Peace, justice and strong institutions can be coined to be the backbone of any society.

According to a survey of over 2 000 companies done by The Guardian (2016) many businesses have come out to support SDGs, but goal 16 is not the most popular. The survey revealed that SDG 13 (climate change) was the most popular followed by SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth). Private sector players have left SDG 16 to NGOs and governments. But the truth of the matter is that SDG16 affects everyone more so business as peace, justice and strong institutions are a precursor to a sustainable business operating environment thus invariably contributing to the profitability of private sector entities.

There are many ways in which the private sector can promote peace, justice and strong institutions. The United Nations Global Compact 2015 Report outlines some of the initiatives that the private sector can take to promote SDG16. At a micro level, these include corporate governance and responsibility aimed at increasing transparency and accountability.

In Zimbabwe, these micro level process have always been ongoing with promotion of corporate governance being spearheaded by professional organisations such as The Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators in Zimbabwe (Icsaz) and the Institute of Directors, among others.

At a macro level, the private sector’s approach to SDG16 can be aligned to the rule of law, human rights, labour rights, environmental issues and anti-corruption initiative.

However, macro level interventions are easier said than done, especially with peace and peacebuilding issues mentioned above generally deemed political and most private sector entities would rather not be involved in such with the fear of being viewed as politically incorrect by the powers that be.

The new dispensation provides an opportunity for the private sector to understand the importance of their contribution to SDG16 and start initiatives to contribute meaningfully. The constitution of Zimbabwe is very clear that issues to do with peace, unity and stability are the prerogative of all stakeholders, “the state and every person, including juristic persons, and every institution and agency of government at every level, must promote national unity, peace and stability” Chapter 2:10 of the constitution.

The January 5 2018 gazetted National Peace and Reconciliation Commission (NPRC) Act allow the commission to receive funds and “any donations, grants or bequests made by any person or organisation or any government of any country …” (Chapter 10:32 part IV). This indicates the Government of Zimbabwe is warming up to other players, including private sector to contribute financially or otherwise to national peace and peacebuilding processes.

Apart from this move addressing long term financial sustainability issues (because the NPRC will not only be relying on government’s limited funding) it also addresses issues to do with locals taking an active role in nation building and national identity rather waiting for external donors who most of the time have their own agenda (as they are advancing their country’s foreign policy) which sometimes is not congruent to local peace building objectives.

Peacebuilding processes and spaces in Zimbabwe and Africa generally need the private sector to be more active and be involved. Creating private sector and civil society platforms for dialogue, engagements and partnerships alongside the relevant government institutions must be promoted to take collective and sustainable action for conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peacebuilding.

As the discussion on the involvement of the private sector in peacebuilding gathers momentum, the notion that big corporates and multinational companies are the only ones being referred to must be addressed as well.

In the context of Zimbabwe, where small companies and informal businesses are thriving, all facets of the private sector need to be active in peacebuilding processes. Once all stakeholders have an interest the culture of nation-building, and unity of purpose is fostered among our communities.

At a global level, the UN has an initiative called the United Nations Global Compact which seeks to encourage businesses worldwide to invest in supporting broader UN Goals such as the SDGs. The Global Compact is not a regulatory instrument, but a forum for discussion, networking, learning exchanges, working groups around SDGs at a local context. The global reach, though commendable, is yet to have impact on the African soil with few African countries like Kenya and Uganda among a few others having shown interest and initiative.

Zimbabwe’s new dispensation, which is seemingly tolerant to diverse progressive views and inputs presents an opportunity and creates a platform to start serious discussions with stakeholders in the private sector who were previously victimised for adding their voice to seemingly hot SDG16- of promoting peace, justice and strong institutions.

The more private business players start contributing financially or otherwise to peacebuilding processes and initiatives through NPRC or other institutions within our country, the greater the positive impact we realise on society and business.

Violence is manifested in so many different ways, from intimate partner violence, domestic violence, rape, honour killing to dowry and to sexual harassment and exploitation – the topic at the centre of this campaign. The #MeToo campaign has taken us toward reducing the stigma of sexual violence survivors, which exists in all corners of the world and to addressing the impunity of perpetrators. But what it has also done is to forcefully spotlight attention on gender issues.

On this International Women’s Day as we reflect on gender issues, women’s rights and equal access to opportunities we must not only reflect on the progress that has been made but also on how much more needs to be done and how to achieve gender equality in societal life and in all sectors.

It has been more than 17 years since the international community passed the first landmark resolution on Women, Peace and Security (WPS), which came to be known as the United Nations Security Council Resolution (SCR) 1325.

there is still an alarming lack of female participation in formal peace processes around the world

One of the most important outcomes of this and subsequent resolutions has been the growing global recognition and increased understanding of the different ways in which conflict affects women and men, their potential to build recovery and peace and how they can complement each other in peacebuilding efforts. In addition, these resolutions spotlighted attention on women as multi-faceted actors in conflict and post-conflict situations, while promoting women’s participation at all stages.

Peacebuilding efforts however continue to ignore the potential role of women even though past experiences have shown that the real sustainability of interventions is heavily dependent on the equal involvement of women alongside men. For example, earlier empirical studies and analysis of peace processes have revealed that peace agreements reached with strong involvement of women have a higher probability of lasting longer. Despite this, there is still an alarming lack of female participation in formal peace processes around the world. Although women have participated in peacebuilding, their role is often at an informal level and rarely visible to formal peacemakers (UN Women 2015c).

The Security Council resolutions on WPS specify the importance of women’s participation in conflict prevention, mitigation, management, resolution and recovery. That participation includes activities such as peacekeeping operations, security sector reform, transitional justice and negotiation of peace agreements.

Women’s effective participation in conflict prevention and peacebuilding is also at the heart of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and in particular Goal 16 on building peaceful, just and inclusive societies. SDG 16 reinforces this importance of participation. In particular target 16.7, calls for “responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels.”

It goes some way to addressing the participation pillar of the WPS agenda. The indicators for that target count positions held in public institutions, disaggregated by age, sex, disability and population group; as well as perceptions of inclusive decision making. However, it doesn’t count participation in security institutions such as the police and the military, and data on this remains difficult to attain.

across all regions, women’s representation falls greatly behind the global 30 percent target established in the Beijing Platform for Action

Women’s employment in the public administration remains also highly variable – from 15 percent in some countries to over 70 percent in others. More revealing and consistent, however, is women’s representation in decision-making positions – across all regions, women’s representation falls greatly behind the global 30 percent target established in the Beijing Platform for Action. Preliminary data shows that less than 10 percent of countries have reached gender parity in decision-making positions of the public administration. In four out of five conflict-affected countries studied, women held 18 percent or less of the decision-making roles (UNDP GEPA). The global average of women in parliament remains below 25 percent (as of June 2016) and women comprise only 18.3 percent of government ministers (as of January 2017). Women’s political participation is nowhere near where it needs to be. Hence a lot more needs to be done.

In many developing countries, women are denied equal access to resources, rights and services, including basic healthcare, education and justice. The UN World Food Programme estimated that 60 percent of chronically hungry people are women and girls. Also, UN Women reveals that while women make up about 43 percent of the agricultural labour force in developing countries they constitute less than 20 percent of the world’s landholders. Of this, women represent fewer than 5 percent of all agricultural landholders in North Africa and West Asia, while in sub-Saharan Africa they make up an average of 15 percent.

In societies affected by violence, women and girls are often the most vulnerable. While conflict affects all sections of society including men and children, women in particular are at risk of violence (including sexual), forced displacement, trafficking and conscription into combatant roles. Interestingly, even in the face of this dismal reality, conflict affected contexts can open up spaces for women’s empowerment.

Recognising that we need to understand better what works in this field, UNDP’s Oslo Governance Centre (OGC) and the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) are currently hosting a Fellowship Programme for highly experienced gender and peacebuilding practitioners. The Fellows are engaging with the Oslo based research community to better understand complex gender and peacebuilding related issues and contributing field perspectives to research.

It is symbolically significant that this year’s International Women’s Day will be commemorated during this Fellowship Programme. Celebrated annually on March 8 to recognize women’s achievements throughout history and across nations, International Women’s Day will focus our attention even further on the importance and complexities of gender responsive peacebuilding.

This article originally appeared in Dagsavisen. You can read it in Norwegian here.","In addition, these resolutions spotlighted attention on women as multi-faceted actors in conflict and post-conflict situations, while promoting women’s participation at all stages.
For example, earlier empirical studies and analysis of peace processes have revealed that peace agreements reached with strong involvement of women have a higher probability of lasting longer.
Although women have participated in peacebuilding, their role is often at an informal level and rarely visible to formal peacemakers (UN Women 2015c).
The Security Council resolutions on WPS specify the importance of women’s participation in conflict prevention, mitigation, management, resolution and recovery.
In societies affected by violence, women and girls are often the most vulnerable."

I AM honored to have been invited to address you and to officially launch this new peacebuilding programme supported by the UN Peacebuilding Fund.

Sustaining peace and stability is the priority of my government hence the Government of Solomon Islands welcomes the support of the United Nations.

Through this programme and other government programmes, we will work towards achieving lasting peace and stability in our country.

I am very encouraged by the strong partnership the Solomon Islands has with the UN family of agencies, more especially the UNDP and the UN Women.

To that end I would like to take this opportunity to thank the UN peacebuilding team in Solomon Islands who have worked very hard to provide support under the first peacebuilding programme for the last 18 months.

The team has been working closely with relevant ministries including the Office of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Ministry of National Unity, Peace and Reconciliation, and the Ministry of Women, Youth, Children and Family Affairs.

The cooperation that exists between these agencies is an affirmation of that commitment.

Be assured the Government will on its part work towards cementing this partnership.

Role UNPBF

The UN peacebuilding programme is important for two reasons. Firstly, RAMSI left Solomon Islands last year and we need to sustain many gains and achievements in the country, deepening of the peacebuilding through accelerating development and reform.

Secondly, we are preparing for the election next year and it is important to ensure the integrity of the process and a peaceful election outcome.

But equally important the UN peacebuilding programme is looking at peace in the broader sense.

The program is about accelerating development, inclusive participation, and nation building.

In addition, the current UN programme design should allow for open dialogues on key development issues connecting to peace and stability in the country.

This is also my Government’s commitment, but all of us have to work harder to deliver development and peace in our communities. Development of the Solomon Islands as a whole is essential to building long lasting peace in our communities.

We surely cannot have peace at the national level if some of our communities are left behind.

Nobody should be left behind.

This is our international commitment and it is our governments commitment.

In fact it is SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) which we will continue to work towards achieving.

Let me take this opportunity to commend the role of UN Peacebuilding Fund, and Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) which are firm supporters of our efforts to building peace globally.

I am particularly grateful to the Secretary General of the UN and Chairman of PBC for this gesture of goodwill to bring peace in our country.

Government Policies to Sustaining Peace

Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to speak briefly about sustaining peace and what it means in practice from the Solomon Islands Democratic Coalition for Change Government stand point.

The new Government’s efforts to sustaining peace are on four broad categories.

First, we know that the Government ought to have an explicit and deliberate peace building policy for all our citizens irrespective of where they reside, and whether or not they are affected by conflict.

Our development agenda is in terms of public investments in the productive sector, initiatives to improve the quality of governance, and taking initiatives to hasten development in the rural areas. These are all geared to induce sustainable economic growth.

Development is at the heart of attaining lasting peace and it is for that reason that our development policies must be geared towards benefiting everybody.

Second, the Government is of the firm belief that peace building initiatives must be continuous and well grounded in Government existing capacities for peace development.

To this end let me state unequivocally that my Government endorses the communique from the national dialogue last year.

We also support the resolutions from the provincial dialogue, Women Summit and Youth forums.

This is in addition to the TRC recommendations. We are adopting key resolutions from the communique in the SIDCCG policy programme, especially in the interest of accelerating inclusive development and maintaining stability.

The development of the peacebuilding strategy will be critical for purposes of implementing our peace building initiatives.

As well, the implementation of the TRC report, the finding from public consultations and the outcome of national and provincial dialogues last year will all contribute to the development of the peacebuilding strategy in the future and peacebuilding programme in the present.

It is important to recognize however that we do not have the capacity to implement essential peace building initiatives.

Besides, we do not have the resources or experience to develop and implement such programs ourselves.

It is precisely for that reason that the partnership the Solomon Islands Government has established with the UN Peace Building Fund and Peace Building Commission is so vital.

Through this partnership Solomon Islands may have access to assistance from our development partners.

Third, the SIDCCG wants the peace building agenda to be an endogenous process.

This requires strong and inclusive national ownership and leadership.

The commitment of our Government can best be exemplified by the leadership of the Ministry of National National Unity Peace and Reconciliation, and the Office of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in spearheading the implementation of the peacebuilding initiative.

Needless to say, Solomon Islands is one of a few countries that has a ministry dedicated for peacebuilding and reconciliation.

The launching of the UN peacebuilding support programme today will contribute to the work on our peace building initiatives.

This programme should not be a stand-alone like many other programmes in the country.

It is important to have strong coordination on peacebuilding work and make this a collective effort.

Fourthly, SIDCCG is cognizant of the fact that peace policy is a multi-sectoral, all-encompassing policy deserving attention at the highest levels of national government.

In this respect I am sure I will be speaking for all of us to say that “We will never allow our country to slide back to our darkest days of ethnic conflict we have experienced between1998-2003.”

But we all need to continue working to maintain this.

The Ministry of Peace, Ministry of Women and Youth, and Prime Minister’s Office, will help guide our coordination work in this endeavor and everyone’s participating in maintaining peace.

As well, these agencies are busy assisting and preparing for a peaceful election next year.

My message on “Sustaining Peace and Stability”

Ladies and gentlemen, let me now turn to the theme for this peacebuilding program, “Sustaining Peace and Stability”.

The relevance of this theme cannot be over-stated. In any society the need to sustain peace is important for its betterment and advancement.

Without peace, development cannot take place.

Without peace, children cannot go to school.

Without peace we cannot realize our full potentials, and without peace, our aspirations will remain dreams.

The nexus of peace and development, therefore, cannot be exaggerated.

We need peace in order to have optimal and sustainable development.

The inverse is equally true in that we have to have development in order to have peace in our communities throughout the country.

But development is not just about achieving and sustaining a high economic growth rate.

It is not only about employment opportunities, or strong per capita incomes.

It is also about engineering a development pathway that will allow growth to take place but, at the same time, for people in our far-flung villages and communities to be empowered.

It is about creating the enabling environment; a development pathway that empowers women and youth, harness comparative advantages in their localities.

It is about remaining engaged and having the feeling of worth and a sense of making a contribution to the welfare and betterment of the country as whole.

On integrity or anti-corruption

The SIDCCG is fully committed to improving the level of accountability and transparency on many fronts.

We are committed to fighting the cancer of corruption.

So after their final revisions the Anti-Corruption Bill and the Whistle Blower Bill will be reintroduced into Parliament for enactment soon.

And in terms of the National Anti-Corruption strategy, I welcome the UN peacebuilding programme which is also looking at anti-corruption issues by supporting public education and civic awareness.

On Land and Natural Resource management

Solomon Islands is a natural resource rich-country, but after many years, natural resource management is still a challenge.

I think among the many causes for this problem is that resources owners have become spectators.

There is no sense of a difference between living on handouts and staying on a sustainable development pathway.

We must therefore find ways to ensure community, and resources owners are directly involved in the development process.

Land owners and communities must not be spectators or remain by-standers.

They must become active participants to support and facilitate development.

Local government for local development

Ladies and gentlemen, I am informed that one of the issues highlighted during the national dialogue was financing for local development.

I acknowledge that issues surrounding financing for local development and small enterprises still need serious attention.

But it is true that rural development is slow mostly due to inefficiencies in the delivery mechanisms, for example the Provincial Government system.

So in our search for better and workable mechanisms we now have the Constituency Office as a channel to ensure rural development is realized.

TRC and Reparation work

We will continue to work on addressing issues from the past.

However, with a focus on the future, I would like to ask the Ministry of National Unity, Reconciliation and Peace to take a lead on finalizing the reparation framework, and create a basis for the establishment of the National Reparation Commission to look at these issues more comprehensively.

We will also need to focus on collective reparations and reconciliations promoted through communities own initiatives.

The government cannot afford and does not have the resources for supporting financial compensation.

But we will use every resource available for development, to rebuild communities and the country as a whole.

Women and Youth

I am informed that Solomon Islands is the first country in the Pacific to adopt a Women Peace Security strategy in our national action plan.

But we still need to strengthen women’s participation at all level’s of decision-making, including in the National Parliament.

Let us encourage political parties to include and promote women candidates in the upcoming national general elections.

The Ministry of Women and Youth will also launch the national youth policy this year.

We need to bring our youth into our development discussions and participation. Let’s all work together on this.

Conclusion

Ladies and Gentlemen, in conclusion, as all of you are aware, security and the general environment has remained largely stable and governance has improved. This does not excuse us from working harder. In fact we must all work together in order to maintain our peaceful coexistence. All of us must be instruments of peace.

I appeal for unity amongst all our people and all public officers. I appeal for everyone to work together to make a peaceful future for our country. You are all the leaders of this country. Sometimes, it falls upon a generation to be great. We can be that generation.

Ladies and Gentlemen with that I now have the pleasure and honour to formally launch the new UN peacebuilding in Solomon Islands.","Sustaining peace and stability is the priority of my government hence the Government of Solomon Islands welcomes the support of the United Nations.

Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. – – A peace activist is fighting for her life after falling victim to the very kind of crime she’s trying to stop.

Choosey Parker was shot March 18 near the Purple Haze nightclub downtown.

Two men have been charged in the incident, according to police records.

Alan Neal, 27, of West Memphis faces aggravated assault and weapons charges. Frank Tuggle, 43, of Memphis also is charged with aggravated assault.

Neal told police that Tuggle, who was at the club with Parker, attacked him armed with a handgun.

Witnesses told police they saw Neal and Tuggle in a confrontation outside the club and heard multiple gunshots, but could not determine who fired first. Police said shell casings from two different weapons were found at the scene.

Tuggle was shot in the leg, while Parker was shot in the abdomen and taken to a hospital in extremely critical condition.

Parker works with a number of anti-gun violence organizations in town.

She’s a member of “Ride of Tears.”

They use mock funeral processions as a symbol that gun violence can lead to someone’s final ride.

They did one in July and now, they’re doing one for Parker, who is still alive.

Stevie Moore supports “Ride of Tears” and runs his own anti-gun violence organization.

He says Parker films his events.

“It’s an energetic young lady that’s trying so hard to be a part of something positive, save our community,” Moore says.

He’s confident she’ll pull through and says he needs her back.

“I am convinced that she will shoot another film for me as soon as she’s out and able to hold that camera and point it at me and what I’m doing,” Moore says.

He says what happened to her is another argument for stricter gun control.

“A lot of people say guns don’t kill, people kill. That’s true, but if they didn’t have no gun they’d have to kill ’em with ink pen, a ball bat. They couldn’t just take a life that easy,” Moore says.

A family friend says Parker had a major operation Monday and was doing a little better.

No date for that ride has been set.","MEMPHIS, Tenn. – – A peace activist is fighting for her life after falling victim to the very kind of crime she’s trying to stop.

The foundation runs 11 schools in Kerala, Karnataka and Lakshadweep. According to Akbar, it caters to over 6,000 students, mostly Muslims, while non-Muslims constitute 60% of its teachers.

On October 8, 2016, the Kerala Police had raided the foundation’s school in Chakkarapparambu in Kochi, Ernakulam district, and confiscated the Class 2 Islamic Studies textbook, alleging it had “objectionable content”. Fearing arrest, Akbar had shifted his base to Doha, the capital of Qatar.

He was travelling to Doha from Melbourne on Sunday when his flight made an immigration transit in Hyderabad, the police said. “Kerala Police had issued a lookout notice against Akbar in February 2017,” Inspector General of Police (Kochi Range) Vijay Sakhare said. “The immigration officials [at Hyderabad] detained him because of that.”

Akbar was brought to Kochi on Sunday night and produced before the Ernakulam First Class Judicial Magistrate Court on Monday. The court remanded him to police custody till March 3.

“A first information report was registered against him under 153 (a) of Indian Penal Code for promoting enmity between religions in October 2016,” Sakhare said.

The charge against Akbar

Fifty-year-old Akbar is the founder of Niche of Truth, an Islamic missionary organisation based in Kerala. A powerful orator who has written many books, he is a regular figure in inter-religious conferences. He set up the Peace Educational Foundation in 2006 with the support of wealthy Muslim businessmen in Kerala. The foundation started its first school in Mangaluru in Dakshina Kannada district of Karnataka in 2007, following it up with a school in Kozhikode in Kerala in 2008. Of the 11 schools it currently runs, nine are in Kerala.

The media often describes Akbar as “Kerala’s Zakir Naik”, referring to the Islamic preacher from Mumbai who moved to Malaysia after a series of police investigations were launched against him on terrorism and money laundering charges. However, Mohammed Ameer, operations manager of the Peace Educational Foundation, said Akbar does not have any connection with Naik or his institutions. “People become confused as Naik’s television channel is known as Peace TV,” he said.

Before the textbook controversy, the Peace Educational Foundation had come in the spotlight in July 2016 when media reports suggested that four of the 21 people from Kerala who had allegedly joined the Islamic State terrorist group – Abdul Rashid, his wife Ayisha, Shiraz Rahman and Mohammed Marwan – had worked with the Peace School in Trikkarippur in Kasargod district. The foundation confirmed the reports but said all four had resigned before their disappearance.

The raid at the foundation’s school in Kochi came three months later. Acting on a complaint filed by the Ernakulam district education officer, the police seized a Class 2 textbook containing material that purportedly promoted enmity between religions.

The officer did not provide Scroll.in with a copy of the complaint. But a state government order issued on January 4 this year to close down the school revealed the education officer had filed the complaint against the institution “for teaching objectionable contents and for following text books and syllabus which contained material violating the existing laws of the country”. It went on to say the district collector had reported that the allegation against the management was true, and that the “decision to stop the operation of such institutions was taken to prevent Muslims from joining the activities of the Islamic State”.

The first information report filed after the raid in October 2016 charged the publishers of the book – Mumbai-based Burooj Realization – and school officials, including Akbar, with promoting enmity between religions. The police also arrested three owners of Burooj Realization. All of them were later released on bail. Akbar, meanwhile, moved to Doha and managed to evade arrest.

Inspector General Vijay Sakhare told Scroll.in on Monday that Akbar had been absconding since the first information report was filed.

Media reports cited a question in the Class 2 textbook containing a reference to Shahada – a declaration for Muslims affirming belief in the oneness of god and acceptance of Muhammad as god’s prophet.

The question was: “Suppose your friend Adam / Suzanne has decided to become a Muslim, among the choices what advice will you give?”

The answer choices were:

a. He/she has to change her name to Ahmed / Sara immediately

b. He/she is wearing a chain and will need to remove it

c. Learn the Shahada

d. Runaway from home as parents are not Muslims

e. Eat halal chicken

Akbar’s defence

After the government ordered the closure of the school in Kochi, Scroll.in spoke to Akbar on phone. He denied all charges against him. About the textbook, he said: “Burooj Realization’s books were used in many schools and madrassas across the state. I don’t know why we are being targeted.”

He claimed the only reason the book had been introduced in the classroom was to cut costs. “We replaced the highly priced Islamic Studies books from Saudi Arabia-based Darussalam Publishers with the low-cost books from Burooj Realization in 2013,” he explained.

He also said he had instructed teachers to skip the controversial portions in the textbook. “We even recalled the book immediately after the police raid,” he added.

Akbar claimed his school did not discriminate against non-Muslims, or advocate hatred against them. “As many as 6,000 students study in nine schools in Kerala and 98% of them are Muslims,” he said. But the composition of the teachers is different. “We appoint people with a passion for teaching,” he said. Religion is not a major selection criterion. We have 460 teachers on our rolls and 276 of them, or 60%, are non-Muslims.”

The school’s curriculum



In 2016, soon after the police had raided the foundation’s school and confiscated textbooks, a report appeared in The New Indian Express. Quoting anonymous police officials, the report said: “There was nothing in the syllabus to teach about India or nationalism. Islamic study was the main subject from Class 1 to 8. Other subjects like mathematics, social science and science are elementary. The students were not having any biology lessons as they have been considered unnecessary.”

The newspaper followed up with another report that claimed the school had converted students to Islam and radicalised non-Muslim staff.

Scroll.in contacted the families of students enrolled in the Peace Educational Foundation’s schools and reviewed their textbooks. Between Classes 1 and 8, the schools teach English, Hindi, Malayalam, science, mathematics, social science, computer science and emotional intelligence.

For Classes 1 to 8, books from the Cambridge University Press are used to teach science, mathematics and English. Social science is taught on the basis of textbooks of the National Council of Education Research and Training, the country’s top advisory body on curriculum. Malayalam students study textbooks of the Kerala State Council for Education Research and Training. Hindi is taught with the help of books from Sargam Publication.

Scroll.in was unable to review the Islamic Studies textbooks used by the Kochi school before it was raided. The foundation’s employees said that after Burooj Realization’s textbooks were discontinued, no new textbooks had been introduced in their place.

Producing Akbar in court, the Kerala Police sought a seven-day remand to investigate his financial dealings and alleged links with terror outfits, but were granted five days.

Weeks before he was arrested, Akbar had denied these allegations. “You check my background,” he said. “I always denounced religious terrorism through speeches and writings.” He added that he had full faith in the judiciary: “I am confident that we will get justice from the courts.”

The Peace Educational Foundation runs 11 Peace Schools, including this one in Kozhikode.

Today, Liberians and the international community came together to recognize the contributions made by UNMIL to Liberia’s peace and security, acknowledging the progress of Liberia’s quest to entrench its democracy, and evaluating lessons learned and steps forward as the new Government charts a path to a future of sustaining peace and sustainable development.

The Liberia Moment was a time to reflect on not only the achievements of UNMIL’s efforts, but the people behind the Mission, both civilian and uniformed, particularly those who gave their lives in the line of United Nations duty while serving in Liberia. Over its 14 years, UNMIL became a trusted and reliable partner to the people of Liberia.

As UNMIL draws to a close and officially ends its mandate 30 March 2018, the Government and the people of Liberia, and the international community commend the contributions UNMIL made to this country.

While UNMIL’s departure is an important milestone signifying the country’s post-civil war progress, the United Nations reassures Liberians that it is still here to accompany the effort to transform Liberia. Maintaining a strong presence in the country, sixteen United Nations Agencies, Funds and Programmes will remain engaged in Liberia and as One UN, will all co-locate at the United Nations House, the former UNMIL Headquarters, on Tubman Boulevard.

The United Nations Deputy Secretary-General, H.E. Amina J. Mohammed said, “The launch of this extensive consultation process is a very promising start. I call upon all the people of Liberia to seize this opportunity to express their needs and voice their views and concerns and help define the future they want for Liberia.

I also urge donor countries to continue to invest in Liberia and to stand by this country as it lifts itself out of conflict and poverty into a brighter day. The international community must continue to demonstrate its commitment to Liberians who have done so much to help themselves over the past fifteen years.”

In his address, President George Weah recommitted to good governance, fighting corruption, promoting transparency and encouraging an investment climate that welcomes new entrants, foreign and domestic. The administration’s pro-poor growth will seek to benefit the vulnerable, promote inclusion and will be inspired by the Sustainable Development Goals. Looking forward, the President proposed holding a series of stakeholder consultations to finalize his Government’s vision for a National Development Agenda addressing poverty in Liberia and aiming to uplift the economic status of the poor and vulnerable, most notably the women and the youth.

Participants stressed that a conscientious application of a gender perspective unlocking the capacity of the entire population, men and women alike, is not only fair, it also makes profound economic sense. Delegations attending the event affirmed their commitment to stay the course and continue the journey alongside the Liberian people and Government as the country moves to consolidate its democracy, pursue prosperity for all, and protect the environment through the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals.

Robert Langlands speaks to officials following word he has been named the Abel Prize Laureate for 2018. (Youtube screenshot)

Robert Langlands, according to his sister, had a rather “ordinary and uneventful” childhood in White Rock, where his family ran Langlands Millwork & Builders’ Supplies.

Other than his knack for math, that is.

It was these “God-given talents” that a high school teacher encouraged him to pursue more than six decades ago, Mary Fran McArthur recalled this week, following news her brother had been named the Abel Prize Laureate for 2018, a distinction bestowed for “outstanding scientific work in the field of mathematics.”

“He has used those talents well. The Abel Award is the culmination of many years work and of many prestigious awards which he has received,” McArthur told Peace Arch News Wednesday, in a statement she prepared alongside former Semiahmoo Secondary classmate Ed Fader.

“I have to say that although I have read many description(s) of his work, I have no idea of what he really does. Obviously, the mathematical community does.”

The world became acutely aware of Langlands’ proclivity for mathematics in 1967, when he suggested connections between two distinctly different fields: harmonic analysis and number theory.

Last week, more than 50 years later, the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) professor was described as “introducing a theory that created a completely new way of thinking about mathematics.”

The Abel Prize has been described as the Nobel Prize for mathematics. Named after Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel, it comes with a cash award of six million kroner, equivalent to nearly $1 million.

Langlands, 81, could not be reached for comment Wednesday. (An official at his office at the IAS, located in Princeton, N.J. – which it can be noted is the same office once occupied by Albert Einstein – told PAN Langlands “comes in as he pleases.”)

However, in the video of the award announcement posted March 20 to the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters website, Langlands tells broadcaster Alex Bellos he was surprised by news of the award, which he only learned about shortly before the announcement was made.

“I didn’t have an immediate reaction,” he said. “What I wanted to do was think it over.”

Asked how surprised he has been by the growth of his initial conjectures into a “program of such depth and scope,” Langlands said he has been concerned about the “tendency to take the easy road.”

“I think there are strange and real questions right at the core, that have been there… since the time of Gauss, and that have been advanced, but I guess because they’re so rich… in relation to other matters, have often been left aside, perhaps because people just didn’t know how to think about them,” he said.

Ole M. Sejersted, president of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, described the Langlands program as “visionary.”

In a congratulatory statement, Kenneth A. Ribet, president of the American Mathematical Society, said Langlands is “one of the most distinguished mathematicians alive today and a towering figure in the history of modern mathematics.”

“His insights, which grew out of penetrating technical work early in his career, have transformed and enriched both number theory and representation theory. The deep relations between the two subjects that he predicted and probed have guided the work of countless mathematicians over the last 50 years,” Ribet states.

Fader, 80, told PAN he and other former classmates of Langlands’ are proud of his accomplishments.

“He’s done quite well,” Fader said Wednesday. “Some of my classmates (think) we should have a Bob Langlands Day in White Rock, just for him.”

Langlands told Bellos he plans to share the prize money with various institutions and groups he already supports, “that… are in some way useful to the world.”

“And (US)$800,000 will help.”

Peace activist and Civil Rights leader, Dr. King chanted this statement outside a California prison, which was holding Vietnam War protesters on December 14, 1967. In his commitment and passion for justice, and in his inimical and profound way, he understood several connecting strands: “I see these two struggles as one struggle.”

By fighting a war “against the self-determination of the Vietnamese people,” he realized that his country, the United States of America, had been proliferating injustice. While fighting for the civil and human rights of people in his home nation without opposing what King believed to be the clear exploitation of the Vietnamese people would have contradicted his declaration that “injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”

Throughout his life, he invoked his vibrant image of the “inescapable network of mutuality” that links all of humanity.

Dr. King is one of literally countless social justice worriers, known and unrecognized throughout the ages across our remarkable planet. They have placed their values and their very lives on the line to ensure a better, more peaceful, and equitable world for themselves and their descendants, a world highlighted by a more level playing field between people of every identity and background, and one where a safety net catches people who have hit tough times and people with limited abilities to meet their needs.

Because of their courageous dedication to the concept of fairness and justice in the relationship between the individual and the state and between states, in their devotion to obliterating the barriers of social mobility by working actively for equality of opportunity and economic justice, they have given us so much. But as we know, the struggle for social justice is ongoing, for the journey must continue before we collectively reach our ultimate destination.

As we commemorate and celebrate the life and legacy of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the 50th anniversary of his tragic murder, I am reminded once again of his vibrant image of the “inescapable network of mutuality” that links humanity. Dr. King envisioned an inclusive model of social justice because he believed that “Nobody’s free until everybody’s free.”

Though our society has traveled forward on a path toward King’s goal of peace with justice, glaring and deep potholes and trenches remain, which continually inhibit our progress.

Recently we witnessed the fatal police shooting of an unarmed young black man, Stephon Clark, in his grandmother’s backyard in Sacramento. Police officers shot 20 bullets in his direction, with eight hitting their target – all but one entering his body from behind. Clark’s death adds to a growing list of police shooting of black and brown men and women overtaking the country.

For example, we saw the brutal police chokehold death of Eric Garner, the multiple-bullet police killings of Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Alton Sterling, and many others.

Though the U.S. Congress passed on January 31, 1865 and the President signed into law on December 6, 1865 the 13th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution abolishing slavery, black and brown lives continue not to matter relative to white lives through Reconstruction, the Jim Crow South, into the 20th century CE, and beyond as we have clearly observed in the current spate of murders of black and brown people by police officers.

Black people in the United States coined in the 1960s the battle cries “Black is Beautiful” and “Black Power” as counter hegemonic narratives in a nation that viewed skin with greater amounts of melanin as ugly and where white people fought ruthlessly to preserve supremacy over all people of color. Recently black people coined the rallying cry and organization “Black Lives Matter” in a country where historically black lives have not mattered much relative to white lives.

The concept of “Social Reproduction” (originally proposed by Karl Marx, 1867) asserts that social institutions, including schools, reproduce social inequities, especially in terms of socioeconomic class and race, which exist in the larger society.

For example, the prison industrial complex within the United States (the country with the highest rate of 716 inmates per 100,000 of the population) disproportionately incarcerates and for longer terms people of color over white people for similar crimes (Black people are 13% of the overall population, but represent 40% of the prison population). Though the U.S. represents 4.4% of the world’s population, it houses 22% of the world prison inmates.

While most police officers enter law enforcement with completely good intentions to serve and assist the public and to support their own families, they bring with them their past socialization sometimes aided and abetted by members of their departments. Tough often subtle, the process by which systemic racism reproduces itself into law enforcement and other social institutions can also at times express itself quite blatantly.

Researchers Charles and Massey interviewed 3,924 undergraduate students at 28 selective colleges and universities on their perceptions of various racial and ethnic groups. Results indicated that

“…black people are rated most negatively on traits that are consistent with American racial ideology. White, Latino, and Asian students are all likely to perceive blacks as violence-prone and poor. They also rate black people more negatively than themselves in traits like lazy, unintelligent, and preferring welfare dependence.”

These students represent the very types of people who eventually enter police training academies and take their place patrolling the streets. These are the very types of people who eventually enter the classroom and instruct our children. These are the very types of people who eventually enter politics. These are our future and current leaders.

Other researchers, Artiles, Harry, Reschly, and Chinn contend that “bias is more than the personal decisions and acts of individuals. Rather, bias against minorities should also be thought of in terms of historical residua that are layered in social structures and that may lead to various forms of institutional discrimination.”

So, where did they (we) learn these attitudes that they (we) are reproducing? They most certainly did not invent or create these negative belief systems. Rather, we all are born into a society that teaches us these biases. These systemic inequities are pervasive throughout the society. They are encoded into the individual’s consciousness and woven into the fabric of our social institutions, resulting in a stratified social order privileging dominant groups while restricting and disempowering marginalized groups.

Racism (and all other forms of oppression) remains the problem: the systematic and hierarchical ideology of white superiority and white privilege. We much look into the mirror at ourselves as well. Especially for us white people, we must come to consciousness of our social conditioning and the ways we have internalized notions of “race.”

With the increased visibility of specific police officers killing unarmed black and brown people, the wide-scale demonstrations of outrage and protest traveling throughout the country, and past investigations by the Justice Department into allegations of racial bias in policing, some law enforcement agencies are assessing procedures while attempting to improve relations with the communities in which they are meant serve.

The Dallas Police Department, for example, for many years has undertaken steps to improve its community relations with remarkable results.

Allegations of racism in the hiring practices, policies, and attitudes in police departments, however, represent in microcosm much larger forces evident in our country. We must not and cannot dismiss police killings of black and brown people as simply the actions of a few individuals or “bad cops,” for oppression exists on multiple levels in multiple forms.

These officers live in a society that subtly and not-so-subtly promotes intolerance, imposes stigma, and perpetuates violence. The incidents must be seen as symptoms of larger systemic national problems.

By our challenging social institutions such as law enforcement agencies, we are taking a necessary step in reducing and one day eliminating cultural bias to ensure that these institutions work for everyone regardless of race and other social identities. But this is surely not enough.

I leaned about the tragic death of Dr. King on that early Spring evening in 1968 when I was a 20-year-old junior at San José State University. Before and ever since, I have been continually inspired by his words and his deeds.

Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated just two months later, spoke about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Cleveland, Ohio one day after he was killed. In that speech, Kennedy placed gun violence into a larger perspective:

“For there is another kind of violence, slower but just as deadly, destructive as the shot or the bomb in the night. This is the violence of institutions; indifference and inaction and slow decay. This is the violence that afflicts the poor, that poisons relations between men because their skin has different colors. This is a slow destruction of a child by hunger, and schools without books, and homes without heat in the winter.”

At this crossroads in our collective national consciousness, we have an opportunity to address the legacy of racism and poverty, the divides on which this country was founded. If we do not, we will never move forward out from the abyss of our past to a better future. If we do not, we will continue to remain on the endangered nations list.

GENERAL ASSEMBLY PLENARY

86TH MEETING (AM)

The General Assembly capped its high-level debate on peacebuilding and sustaining peace today with a consensus resolution welcoming the Secretary-General’s January 2018 report on those activities and deciding to further discuss his recommendations to address existing gaps.

Adoption of the text, titled “Follow-up to the report of the Secretary-General on peacebuilding and sustaining peace”, coincides with the passage of a similar one in the Security Council (please see Press Release SC/13319), both encouraging action by Member States and the United Nations to implement the “twin” sustaining peace resolutions of 2016.

By its terms, the Assembly invited the relevant United Nations bodies and organs — including the Peacebuilding Commission — to further advance, explore and consider implementation of the report’s recommendations and options during its current and upcoming sessions.

By other terms, the 193-member body requested the Secretary-General to present, during its seventy-third session, an interim report elaborating on his recommendations and options, including for financing United Nations peacebuilding activities.

During the seventy-fourth session, he was requested to submit a report in connection with the next comprehensive review of the United Nations peacebuilding architecture, focusing on continued implementation of resolution 70/262 and progress in the implementation of his recommendations and options contained in his report (document A/72/707-S/2018/43).

Throughout the day, delegates commended United Nations peacebuilding assistance as an important instrument for helping States overcome conflict and preventing its recurrence, while calling for more coordinated efforts among United Nations agencies and structures. Expressing concerns about sovereignty, several speakers called for interventions to be carried out in line with the United Nations Charter and according to the desires of Member States.

Calling for more national ownership, several underscored that peacebuilding and sustaining peace were the primary responsibility of Governments. Among them was Indonesia’s representative, who said that if the affected countries did not take charge of their destiny, lasting peace could not be achieved on the ground. The international community must listen to those countries, especially as they transitioned into the post-conflict phase.

Other speakers said national efforts would only succeed with predictable and sustained financing. Calling for increased contributions to help countries with capacity-building, several delegates underscored the importance of aligning resources and working effectively with regional and local partners.

In that context, Sudan’s representative called for structural changes to humanitarian assistance and a new generation of peacekeeping, with a view of boosting development. Noting that the lack of development was a main reason behind the conflict in his country, he said investment was needed to help achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adding that the transfer of peacekeeping assistance towards that agenda would have a major impact on States.

Trinidad and Tobago’s delegate highlighted the unique security concerns of small island developing States, which must rely on the rule of law, strict observance of the Charter, and collective security mechanisms to guarantee their right to a secure, sovereign and peaceful existence. In her country, sustainable development was intricately linked to the safety and security of its people.

Meanwhile, the speaker from the University for Peace stressed that without education, societies would be condemned to repeating cycles of conflict and violence. That involved education for non-violence, for social inclusion and for the rule of law, with a focus on promoting skills, values and behaviours.

Reflecting on the success of the high-level meeting, Miroslav Lajčák (Slovakia), President of the General Assembly, said the international community had recognized that holistic approaches and a culture of peace were needed for sustaining peace. While that goal was a difficult task, the international community had not shied away. Indeed, amid conflict and crises, it had a shared responsibility to bring sustaining peace to the people on the ground.

In other matters, the Assembly adopted a draft decision titled “United Nations high-level international conference on nuclear disarmament”, postponing the conference and its one-day organizational meeting to a date to be determined.

Subsequently, the Assembly elected Chad and Italy as members of the Committee for Programme and Coordination for a term beginning on the date of election and expiring on 31 December 2020.

Also speaking were representatives of Burkina Faso, Kazakhstan, Russian Federation, Serbia, Angola, Namibia, Ethiopia, Andorra, United States, Bahrain, Tunisia, Algeria, Belarus and Syria, as well as the Permanent Observers of the Holy See and the State of Palestine.

Speakers from the Inter-Parliamentary Union and International Development Law Organization also addressed the Assembly.

The representatives of Iran, Turkey and Syria spoke in exercise of the right of reply.

The Assembly will reconvene at 3 p.m. on Monday, 30 April, for the International Law Commission.

Statements

YEMDAOGO ERIC TIARE (Burkina Faso) said conflicts costs a lot more to States than prevention. Prevention must therefore be at the heart of peacebuilding. Peacebuilding and sustaining peace were the responsibility of Governments, as was involving all sectors of society. Such efforts would only succeed with predictable and sustained financing. Nevertheless, there was still some way to go on that front, he said, appealing for greater contributions to the Peacebuilding Fund. It was important to both channel and align regional resources for peace. Without security, there could be no development, and without development, there could be no peace, he said. Indeed, this was a priority for Burkina Faso, which had experienced an uprising in 2015. Expressing support for the Secretary-General’s recommendations, he said a holistic approach must be taken towards reforms.

DIAN TRIANSYAH DJANI (Indonesia), associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement, the MIKTA countries (Mexico, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Turkey and Australia), and the Group of Friends of Sustaining Peace, said his country had witnessed various challenges and opportunities in building peace. Indonesia had learned that while achieving peace was difficult, sustaining it was even more so. If the affected countries did not take charge of their destiny, lasting peace could not be brought about on the ground. The international community must listen to those countries, especially as they transitioned into the post-conflict phase. He went on to note that no one organ of the United Nations could itself promote peacebuilding, sustaining peace, or the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. As such, he called for stronger and inclusive partnerships with regional organizations to establish good governance and economic policies, with economic incentives as tools for prevention.

KAIRAT UMAROV (Kazakhstan) said, in these times of turbulence, the imperative for peace was growing, and the people looked to the United Nations for vision, leadership and action. Recalling Kazakhstan’s nuclear disarmament efforts, he said conflicts should be addressed with a strengthened security-development nexus, a regional approach and coordinated efforts among United Nations agencies and structures. Confidence-building measures were a powerful tool for peacebuilding, while diplomatic engagement and constructive negotiations should be the main means to resolve and prevent conflicts, he said, noting Kazakhstan’s role in hosting talks on Syria and the Iran nuclear deal. He went on to underscore the primary responsibility of Member States in implementing peacebuilding strategies, with inclusiveness being at the core.

VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), expressing regret that some delegations had used the high-level meeting for political public relations, said United Nations peacebuilding assistance was an important instrument for helping States overcome conflict and preventing its recurrence, subject to regular review by Member States in light of changing realities. The Russian Federation fully supported strengthening United Nations work in preventing conflict, but that must be carried out in line with the United Nations Charter and relevant decisions of Member States. With every conflict having its own unique set of causes, a delicate and unbiased approach would be required. Member States must act on the basis of the Charter rather than on controversial concepts such as humanitarian intervention and the responsibility to protect. He went on to say that human rights were too often politicized, and that interference in domestic affairs was the most common source of conflict. The United Nations should not be part of that. Relevant United Nations system bodies must adhere strictly to their mandates, and the parameters of peacebuilding assistance should be defined by the priorities of host country. He agreed on the need for adequate, predictable and sustainable financing, adding that the Secretary-General had the necessary powers in that regard. Concluding, he underscored the importance of an unbiased, unpoliticized and transparent approach to sustaining peace that would, without mentoring, support beneficiary countries.

MAGDI AHMED MOFADAL ELNOUR (Sudan), associating with the “Group of 77” developing countries and China and the Non-Aligned Movement, said the lack of development often led to armed conflict, which in turn prevented sustainable development. The General Assembly and Security Council resolutions of 2016 had reasserted that peace was indispensable for development. Assistance should be directed to countries facing internal conflicts since it would be tantamount to sustaining peace, without which economic, social or environmental development could not be achieved. He called for structural changes to humanitarian assistance, allowing people to gain a decent livelihood in a manner that preserved their dignity and become producers than receivers. A new generation of peacekeeping was also needed with a view to boosting development and establishing communications with country teams, while paying greater attention to construction and engineering assistance. Meanwhile, he highlighted the need to strengthen the United Nations role in conflict settlement and its partnerships with regional organizations. At the same time, it was important to tailor responses with local Governments, while increasing contributions to the Peacebuilding Fund. The lack of development was a main reason behind the conflict in Sudan. Investment was needed to help countries achieve the 2030 Agenda, and the transfer of peacekeeping assistance towards development would have a major impact on States. There was a golden opportunity for the international community to build peace in Sudan.

PENNELOPE ALTHEA BECKLES (Trinidad and Tobago) said the inclusive and ambitious 2030 Agenda must not be lost in rhetoric. The challenge was to make the world peaceful and secure. That was especially true for small States that must rely on the rule of law, strict observance of the Charter, and collective security mechanisms to guarantee their right to a secure, sovereign and peaceful existence. For Trinidad and Tobago, sustainable development was intricately linked to the safety and security of its people. While her country was in a region that had not been affected by armed conflict, it was impacted by armed violence. Indeed, transnational organized crime posed a daunting challenge to the security of small island developing States. At the same time, lasting peace could only be achieved if women were more involved in decision-making for peacebuilding and post-conflict development, she said.

MILAN MILANOVIĆ (Serbia), associating himself with the European Union, and emphasizing the link between peace, stability, growth, development and respect for human rights, said that as a host country to several international and regional organizations, Serbia understood the need to work closely with such bodies. In that regard, the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) was of paramount importance for stability and creating the conditions conducive for a lasting solution to the question of Kosovo and Methohija. On the European Union-facilitated dialogue between Belgrade and Priština, he said the Serbian side had confirmed time and again its readiness to compromise in the quest to find mutually acceptable solutions. “Only through a committed dialogue will it be possible to resolve all outstanding issues and build a stable region,” he said.

JOÃO IAMBENO GIMOLIECA (Angola), associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement, said conflict prevention and peace processes must be rooted in national leadership and inclusive ownership. Achieving peace and sustainable development required strong collective actions, enhanced collaboration and partnerships, including with the private sector, civil society and regional and subregional organizations. After a long war, Angola now lived in peace and was making bold efforts towards economic and social development, while deepening its democracy. Indeed, Angola was a success story that should make all nations proud. He rhetorically asked whether it made sense to discuss the preservation of peace, while creating tensions in parts of the world.

NEVILLE MELVIN GERTZE (Namibia), associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement, said that although his country had been independent for 28 years, obstacles remained from its long war, violence and deprivation of the apartheid system. Yet, Namibians were determined to implement a policy of reconciliation. And while that policy had not been without its tests and tribulations, it had succeeded in bringing people together. Policies of reconciliation had also resulted in better services, such as electricity and education, and had significantly reduced maternal and infant mortality and HIV deaths. “We remain steadfast in our resolve to overcome these challenges and to ensure that in our struggle to lift people from poverty and hunger through economic emancipation, no one is left behind,” he said.

MAHLET HAILU GUADEY (Ethiopia) said conflict prevention and sustaining peace must be at the heart of the United Nations work, but that could not be achieved without fully realizing the potential of the Peacebuilding Commission, whose convening, bridging and advisory role must be scaled up. At the same time, the Organization could not address the myriad international challenges alone. Partnerships with regional and subregional organizations, international financial institutions, Governments, civil society and the private sector must therefore be enhanced. She voiced hope that the Joint United Nations-African Union Framework and the Memorandum of Understanding between the Peacebuilding Commission and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) would strengthen cooperation in peacebuilding and sustaining peace in Africa.

Joan Josep López Lavado (Andorra), expressing support for the Secretary-General’s proposals to focus on better conflict prevention, cited the role that institutions had played in maintaining peace in his country for centuries. However, peace could never be taken for granted. Rather, it should be seen as an end and as a bedrock. He emphasized the role of education, which in Andorra focused on creating a global citizenry, as well as respect for diversity and human rights. He went on to convey support for the Secretary-General’s proposals for a more effective and accountable United Nations development system.

KELLEY A. ECKELS-CURRIE (United States) said peace “is not merely the silencing of guns. Peace is built over time, forged through trust, openness, and goodwill between a Government and its citizens.” While peacekeeping missions could help create space for peace, they must be a part of a larger strategy. Most critically, Governments must also uphold their end of the deal, by seeking political solutions and commitments on the ground. The United Nations must change how it did business and she voiced support for the Secretary General’s reforms. However, the United States did not believe that throwing money at a conflict would result in peace as it would not fix the fundamental obstacle to effective peacebuilding. As a newer United Nations initiative still trying to prove itself, peacebuilding should be voluntarily funded and not tied to the peacekeeping budget. Nevertheless, the operational ties between those two areas should be strengthened.

JAMAL FARES ALROWAIEI (Bahrain) said peacebuilding and sustaining peace required mechanisms on human rights, development and the rule of law. He stressed the importance of the role of women and youth in building peace. More broadly, there was a need to mainstream practices so that the United Nations could prove its ability to face challenges. Indeed, political will was needed to ensure stability and security around the world, especially at the same time when terrorism had become a tool used by some countries to serve their own interests. For its part, Bahrain had established partnerships to ensure security in its region, counter terrorism and protect trade routes.

MOHAMED KHALED KHIARI (Tunisia) said the increase in intra- and inter-State conflicts required a stock-taking of international prevention efforts. The $233 billion spent on humanitarian interventions, peacekeeping and hosting refugees should be rededicated towards strengthening early warning mechanisms, as well as enhancing national and regional leadership to foster resilient societies. Outlining issues that were essential to effectively promote sustainable peace, she said all means should be devoted towards implementation of the 2030 Agenda. At the same time, community-led initiatives to strengthen social cohesion and local solutions remained paramount. Sustaining peace was also deeply linked to women’s role when addressing the causes of conflict, she said, encouraging women’s participation in mediation.

ZAKIA IGHIL (Algeria) set out a number of elements that were essential for peacebuilding and sustaining peace, including broad, inclusive national ownership, overcoming the fragmentation of United Nations activities, addressing the nexus between security and development, and involving more women and youth in conflict prevention. Urging greater cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union, she said that Algeria, having won its battle against terrorism in the 1990s, took a preventative approach to stability that focused on deradicalization and combating violent extremism. That policy included addressing the factors behind marginalization and exclusion, while promoting national reconciliation, democracy, human rights and the rule of law.

VALENTIN RYBAKOV (Belarus) described a world in which unprecedented conflicts were evolving, with hundreds of thousands of people suffering due to the aggressive geo-political conduct of certain States. A third world war was under way, with one third of States involved in combat operations — more than in the Second World War. Massive air strikes had subjected Syria to a blatant act of aggression, while there was probably still someone in Iraq looking for weapons of mass destruction. Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/Da’esh) might have been defeated, but an end to war was nowhere in sight. Claims of chemical weapons use, the spread of bogus stories, the bullying of States and the imposition of sanctions had meanwhile taken the situation to the point of absurdity. For some leaders, war was a means of self-assertion. However, the status of super-Power implied super-responsibility, not becoming a barbarian wielding a modern tomahawk. Responsible, civilized States must talk to each other, show political will and unite for peace. “Our common future depends on the good-faith efforts of each and every country,” he added.

MOUNZER MOUNZER (Syria), associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement, recalled how the founding of the United Nations had created a new hope for the world’s people. Importantly, the Organization had emphasized the responsibility of Governments to sustain peace. He urged respect for the Charter, which stressed sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in internal State affairs, while condemning the practices of some Member States that did not heed such principles. Those countries attempted to change regimes by force or by igniting strife. He questioned whether foreign interventions had built peace in the world or whether, in some States, they had only brought about raging war and breeding grounds for terrorists. Indeed, foreign occupation threatened global peace and security. Any effort to counter terrorism would fail if it contravened international law and was taken without the consent of Governments concerned. Pointing to hypocritical remarks by his counterpart from Turkey, he expressed dismay at his claim that countries must interfere in order to prevent conflict, noting that Turkey had been the main cause of terrorism in Syria for years.

BERNARDITO CLEOPAS AUZA, Permanent Observer of the Holy See, said societies could not thrive if they were torn by conflict and strife. Indeed, citizens could not realize their potential if they were engulfed by instability and insecurity. He stressed the need to develop a practical, comprehensive and integrated strategy to promote peace that took into account national responsibility. He also highlighted the need to address the deep roots of conflict, while taking collective responsibility to eliminate extreme poverty. Meanwhile, measures to prevent the outbreak, escalation and recurrence of conflict required a coherent, integrated and coordinated approach, he said, noting that the Peacebuilding Commission could help strengthen coordination. In most conflicts, there were “no winners and everyone loses. That is why we must commit ourselves to being artisans of peace,” he concluded.

RIYAD H. MANSOUR, Permanent Observer of the State of Palestine, said that, having been deprived of peace for so long, Palestinians understood how invaluable and fundamental it was for all aspects of life. The attention span of the international community was increasingly hard to sustain, with too many crises, too many cold conflicts and too many violent conflicts. “Diplomacy cannot just follow the news cycle,” he said. Rather, it must respond to early warnings and engage in situations both before they made the news and after they had left television screens. On the situation in the Middle East, he said Palestine was suffering from double standards and an “a la carte” approach to the implementation of Security Council resolutions, alongside an exemption for Israel that had allowed it to escape accountability. “Our tragedy has proven over and over again that impunity is the enemy of peace,” he said, appealing for a revival of the ideals underpinning the international system and for the law to be upheld.

ANDREA CARONI, Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), said antagonisms and divergences were inevitable, and that platforms to address them — including, at the national level, parliaments — were therefore indispensable. But as the United Nations reorganized itself to better prevent conflicts, it was a matter of concern that parliaments and parliamentarians were often missing from the Organization’s debates and reports, despite the essential role they could play in sustaining peace. He recalled the resolution on sustaining peace adopted by the IPU Assembly in March that highlighted the need for inclusivity and partnerships. Parliaments had much to offer when it came to sustaining peace, he said, asking relevant actors to keep that in mind.

FRANCISCO ROJAS ARAVENA, Rector of the University for Peace, said education was a fundamental tool for peace. That involved education for non-violence, for social inclusion and for the rule of law. Such education must promote skills, values and behaviours. Without it, societies would be condemned to repeating cycles of conflict and violence. Sustaining peace also required prevention, addressing the roots and consequences of crises. He stressed the need to provide broad and effective education to achieve the 2030 Agenda. For its part, the University for Peace was at the heart of the United Nations, highlighting the role of women and young people in conflict prevention, and educating and training leaders in prevention, mediation, transformation and conflict resolution. “If we want peace, we must work for peace”, he concluded.

PATRIZIO M. CIVILI, Permanent Observer of the International Development Law Organization, said many root causes and drivers of conflict stemmed from, or were exacerbated by, the absence of the rule of law. “For peace to take hold, people must have confidence in justice institutions,” he said. Noting his organization’s work in fragile and conflict-affected countries, he said meaningful and sustainable justice sector reforms were only possible when they were nationally led and owned and tailored to specific contexts. Rule of law initiatives — including the empowerment of those seeking justice, notably women and girls — must be both top-down and bottom-up. Greater and more sustained investment in justice sector reforms were required as well, he said, warning that short funding cycles and unrealistic time frames risked alienating stakeholders when they failed to deliver.

Action

The General Assembly then took action on draft resolution A/72/L.49 titled “Follow-up to the report of the Secretary-General on peacebuilding and sustaining peace”, adopting it without a vote.

By its terms, the Assembly invited the relevant United Nations bodies and organs — including the Peacebuilding Commission — to further advance, explore and consider implementation, as appropriate, of the report’s recommendations and options during its current and upcoming sessions.

It requested the Secretary-General to present to the Assembly, during its seventy-third session, an interim report further elaborating on his recommendations and options, including those on financing for United Nations peacebuilding activities.

It also requested the Secretary-General to submit to the Assembly, during its seventy-fourth session, a report in connection with the next comprehensive review of the United Nations peacebuilding architecture, focusing on continued implementation of resolution 70/262 and progress in the implementation of the recommendations and options contained in his report.

Statements

MIROSLAV LAJČÁK President of the General Assembly (Slovakia) thanked delegations for a successful meeting, as the Assembly had gained more understanding and ideas for the future. Member States recognized that holistic approaches and a culture of peace were needed for sustaining peace. While that goal was a difficult task, the international community had not shied away. Prevention was a key theme, he said, noting that it was no longer an abstract concept. The importance of a coherent approach and national ownership were also emphasized throughout the meeting. Touching on inclusivity, particularly the role of women, young people and civil society, he said: “When we pull up more chairs to the table, we see more results. We must open our doors wider.” The private sector must also play a greater role in making our planet more peaceful. It had also emerged that Member States could do more to fully grasp the preventative potential of the 2030 Agenda and that the United Nations must learn from regional organizations. Noting that many Member States had called for increased funding for the Peacebuilding Fund, he said the international community had a shared responsibility to bring sustaining peace to the people on the ground.

Right of Reply

The representative of Iran, speaking in exercise of the right of reply, said his counterparts from Saudi Arabia and Yemen had made unfounded remarks against his country. Claiming that Iran had intervened in Yemen was a naïve and false scenario aimed at diverting attention away from war crimes being committed there. He added that the Persian Gulf was the correct name for that body of water; it had been so for centuries and would remain so forever.

The representative of Turkey rejected the intervention by her counterpart from Iran. It was appalling that such a regime could even take the floor in the context of a meeting on peace and security, she said, adding that those responsible for the suffering of the Syrian people would be held accountable for their crimes.

The representative of Syria said Turkey country had cooperated with others to support terrorist groups in Syria, including ISIL/Da’esh and the Nusrah Front. Among other things, Turkey had enabled terrorists to train on its territory and helped them to develop chemical weapons for use against Syrian civilians. Turkey continued to support terrorists inside Syria, he added.

The representative of Turkey, taking the floor a second time, rejected the comments by Iran’s delegate.","Concluding, he underscored the importance of an unbiased, unpoliticized and transparent approach to sustaining peace that would, without mentoring, support beneficiary countries.
He went on to convey support for the Secretary-General’s proposals for a more effective and accountable United Nations development system.

Chance played a role in delivering a set of circumstances that made the agreement possible. And a set of chance factors have intervened to start unravelling it. These factors include Brexit, a weak government majority in Westminster that empowers and emboldens the hardline Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the breakdown of power-sharing at Stormont, and the death of Sinn Féin politician Martin McGuinness in March 2017.

More predictably destabilising though has been the failure to progress healing and reconciliation in society despite the political gains made since 1998. Civil society has not taken ownership of the peace process by continuously or systematically tackling sectarianism or promoting reconciliation. The churches are the largest civil society grouping in Northern Ireland and this failure is partly theirs.

For more on the 20th anniversary of peace in Northern Ireland, listen to The Anthill podcast on the Good Friday Agreement.

Institutions and mavericks

It has long been understood that during the conflict the churches failed to show prophetic leadership. Both Catholic and Protestant church leaders were highly constrained in what they felt able to do, while a number of mavericks and independents on the ground had a strong prophetic presence and did a great deal to bring about peace.

Ballesteros/EPA

The work of some of these mavericks was sensitive and so highly secret during the peace process. Now we know for example, that Alec Reid, a Redemptorist in Belfast’s Clonard Monastery, helped facilitate talks behind the scenes between the leader of the Social and Democratic Labour Party, John Hume, and Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams in the 1980s. These talks opened the door for Sinn Féin and, ultimately, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), to engage with the British and Irish governments at a time when “talking with terrorists” was anathema. Adams famously told Reid that only representatives of the Catholic Church could have facilitated these developments within nationalism.

Other mavericks understood their work as a public ministry to change hearts and minds. One of the most effective examples was the Evangelical Contribution on Northern Ireland (ECONI). The organisation was formed in the mid-1980s as an explicit alternative to the way the then-DUP leader Ian Paisley mixed religion and politics. Paisley, a Protestant minister, used evangelicalism to bolster Ulster Protestant identity over and against Catholic nationalists. Instead, ECONI challenged the “sins” of its own community, which created opportunities for relationships with Catholics. It produced educational resources that reached deep within Protestantism, asking hard questions that the institutional churches often ignored.

In defence of the institutional churches, they were not trained experts in conflict resolution. Pastoral care and parish management were their skills, not conflict resolution. However, as society emerged out of conflict, the churches should have come into their own.

Absent from public debates

As people learn to live together in tolerance, the skills needed are precisely those possessed by churchmen and women in abundance. Northern Irish society needs debates in the public square about the meaning of forgiveness, mercy, justice, healing, reconciliation, compassion, grace and empathy. These are qualities and skills which the churches can rightly claim as their own.

Sadly, however, the churches remain as absent from public debates as they were during the conflict. Having earned no legitimacy for their active leadership in the peace process, the churches have not been able to lead the debate in the post-conflict period. Meanwhile, anti-clericalism has expanded as a result of church involvement in institutional child and sex abuse. Religious practice in Northern Ireland is declining as fewer people attend church regularly and they become more liberal in the beliefs they hold.

In the decade after the Good Friday Agreement, the Church of Ireland and the Presbyterian Church both attempted to implement anti-sectarian peacebuilding programmes throughout their congregations. But the resources were used primarily by people who were already enthusiastic about reconciliation. When the funding from external sources ran out after a few years, the programmes were quietly dropped.

The Irish Churches Peace Project, a partnership between the four largest churches and smaller denominations affiliated with the Irish Council of Churches in 2013-15, suffered a similar fate. Again, rather than convincing more ministers and churchgoers that Christians have much to offer a society transitioning from conflict, these programmes appealed to people already engaged in peacebuilding. Instead of making peacebuilding mainstream, then, these programmes have tended to marginalise the mavericks who thought the churches had something wider to say about forgiveness, mercy and empathy.

Outside the institutional churches, a few mavericks carry on. The ecumenical Corrymeela community, Northern Ireland’s oldest reconciliation organisation, has expanded its educational programming and is tackling contemporary issues such as Brexit and LGBTQ rights, as well as anti-sectarianism. For the last six years, the 4 Corners Festival in Belfast has encouraged people to attend events in all parts of a segregated city with the aim of inspiring them to cross boundaries in their everyday lives.

It is these groups and the individuals who drive them who are striving not only to frame public discourses about reconciliation – but also to convince the institutional churches to join them in this work. This may prove to be the more difficult task.

In the years following the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland is a less religious society. As institutional churches are turning inward to preserve and protect the piety of their remaining believers, this limits their engagement with the tenor and spirit of the agreement – to their detriment.","The churches are the largest civil society grouping in Northern Ireland and this failure is partly theirs.

Bogota, Colombia – The arrest of a former top FARC commander last week has put an already fragile peace deal under further strain, but could help bolster the peace process in the long run, depending on how the charges are carried out, according to analysts.

The deal between the left-wing rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) group and the state, signed in late 2016, formally ended 52 years of conflict that had left an estimated 222,000 people dead and more than seven million displaced.

Despite having received near-universal praise on the international stage, domestically, Colombia‘s landmark peace accord has never received the same level of popularity.

Following delays in its implementation and corruption scandals, the process encountered another setback this week when Seuxis Hernandez, better known as Jesus Santrich, was charged by US courts and the Colombian general prosecutor with conspiracy to ship 10,000kg of cocaine – with a street value of $320m – to the United States.

According to analysts, the charges pose some serious issues for the peace accord by further damaging trust with the FARC, potentially frightening ex-rebels into joining dissident groups and potentially swelling support for reversing an already unpopular agreement.

“This is a serious blow for the political standing of the FARC,” said Jorge Restrepo, director of the Conflict Analysis Institute, CERAC.

“They did not get more than 50,000 votes in the elections – [the arrest] shows there was reason in the majority of Colombians who did not trust them to abandon organised crime,” he added, referring to last month’s elections that saw the FARC participate as a political party for the first time.

A setback for trust in FARC?

With their history of drug-trafficking, kidnapping, extortion and massacres, building societal trust in the FARC was never going to be easy, analysts say.

{articleGUID}

A large sector of the population still doubts their ability to reform themselves from narco-criminals to ordinary citizens and despise the special judicial arrangements in the peace accord, which are perceived to let ex-rebels off easy for serious crimes they have committed such as kidnap, murder and drug-trafficking.

According to a Gallup poll from February, 73 percent of those interviewed said they do not believe the FARC will comply with what was agreed on in the accords.

Trusting these individuals only became more difficult when it was revealed that Santrich, who played a role in the historic peace negotiations in Havana, had allegedly continued to conduct illicit activities after the deal was signed.

The blind commander was also one of 10 former rebel leaders guaranteed a seat in congress according to the peace deal, individuals who critics argue should not be in politics but jailed for life for their past actions.

“I don’t understand how this can happen,” former Vice President Francisco Santos Calderon told Al Jazeera.

“Somebody who just won a huge prize of having all his crimes cleaned gets caught drug-trafficking? It gives the peace process huge problems, and it gives the organisation huge problems.”

‘Who will be next?’

In response to the shock arrest, President Juan Manuel Santos announced his “hand will not waiver” in extraditing Santrich if he is found guilty. The prospect of jail and extradition to the US, however, has caused a lot of anger among the FARC who continue protesting the innocence of their comrade and reiterating the potential negative consequences for the peace deal at a critical juncture.

{articleGUID}

“With the capture of our comrade Jesus Santrich the peace process finds itself at its most critical point and threatens to be a true failure,” announced Ivan Marquez, another high-ranking FARC leader.

The former rebels also claim the arrest is a conspiratorial move – “orchestrated by the US along with the public prosecution” – which was hatched when US Attorney General Jeff Sessions was in Colombia last December.

The claims come despite allegedly strong video and written evidence and the capture of his three FARC coconspirators, but regardless of the truth behind the accusations, the FARC’s fears could still affect all.

“They are chopping heads and making things up to jail FARC leaders, obviously following orders from the Pentagon”, Jorge Tavarich, a demobilised rebel currently residing in a dedicated FARC reincorporation zone told Al Jazeera.

“We are all a little worried, because, who will be next?” he said.

Due to the government’s perceived inability to comply with their end of the peace deal, some 1,200 former FARC rebels did not demobilise and instead joined dissident groups, according to military figures from March.

The probability of a full u-turn by the FARC is next to zero, but the risk of widespread anxiety pushing more former fighters to join the dissidents is very real, according to analysts.

{articleGUID}

“Obviously, the risk is that certain ex-guerillas feel that promises are not being met and will want to return to arms,” said Yann Basset, a political analyst at La Universidad del Rosario, Bogota.

“It is therefore important for the judicial system to act with all transparency and forcefulness in the evidence provided by the prosecution, and for the government to act prudently and clearly inform demobilised guerrillas of the situation,” Basset told Al Jazeera.

Restore faith in the peace process?

More generally, however, experts say that while the development may increase the already strong anti-peace accord sentiment, it could also restore faith in the process, depending on the results of the judicial process and positions taken in politics.

“It depends on how the political institutions act and political leaders react,” CERAC’s Restrepo said. “If the day after tomorrow he is quickly extradited … that will lead to a strengthening of the peace agreement.”

One potential effect is a boost for right-wing presidential candidate Ivan Duque and his Democratic Center Party’s goal to roll back the peace accord.

Fair and transparent judicial treatment of Santrich, however, could strengthen both the accord and “pro-peace” political parties by quashing accusations that FARC criminals are outside the law.

“The issue is being well received by public opinion as it shows the peace accords are not a pact for impunity – contrary to what its most radical opponents pretend,” Basset said.

According to analysts, it appears the Santos government and the judicial system will now have to walk a fine line between respecting the principles of the peace accord and the FARC while also not going “light” on Santrich.

“This is a moment of reckoning, a serious challenge to the institutions created by the peace process – and particularly those relating to transitional justice,” says Restrepo. “They need to show the FARC that they cannot even entertain the possibility of continuing in criminal activity without the serious threat of prosecution.”

{articleGUID}

Should the web of illegality be found to entangle more FARC commanders, however, it could be fatal for the peace accord.

“A nephew of [commander] Ivan Marquez was also captured; that tends to point not towards an individual decision, but a collective decision by the FARC to continue with drug trafficking,” former Vice President Calderon said.

“If it’s proven that it is a collective FARC operation, it could mean that all the heads of the organisation are asked for extradition, that would definitely be a deadly blow to the peace process.”","While analysts say the arrest is a ‘serious blow’ to FARC, they say it could bolster the peace process in the long run.

Sudan rejects participation of ex-army chief in peace talks,"April 10, 2018 (JUBA) - South Sudan wants the regional bloc (IGAD) and the Troika member states (Norway, United States and Britain) to exclude ex-army chief, General Paul Malong from the next round of peace talks in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

Addressing reporters in the capital, Juba on Tuesday, the Presidential Press Secretary, Ateny Wek Ateny said the participation of Awan, a former ally of President Salva Kiir, would affect the ongoing peace process.

Ateny accused the ex-army chief of being a believer in violence rather than peaceful means.

Awan announced the formation of the South Sudan United Front (SSUF), which he claimed was the only means through which he would work with compatriots to ""arrest the carnage"" in the country.

“Our movement is a just an urgent call to our compatriots and a struggle to first arrest the carnage that has befell our country and secondly to steer us towards democracy and development, which are the cornerstones of nationhood, an African nationhood of democracy, development, equal citizenry, justice and freedom”, he said in a statement issued on Monday.

He accused Kiir of building a nation where total impunity is the order.

“Our movement seeks to reverse this. We must build our nationhood around strong institutions and not strongmen. Strong institutions will outlive all of us and guarantee the prosperity of our nation. This is what we yearn for in our country”, stressed the ex-army chief.

Malong said his new rebel group would strive towards fighting what he described as ""systemic corruption, stop the ongoing carnage, steer the country toward democracy, justice, equality and freedom.""

He also vowed to respect the cessation of hostilities agreement signed in December last year by the various warring parties and he urged the regional bloc, Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), to allow his new group to be part of the high-level revitalization forum meeting scheduled April 26 in Addis Ababa.

Ateny, however, said the former army chief of staff is a “corrupt” individual already been sanctioned by the international community.

""Malong was sanctioned by the same international community for the role they thought he played as part of the government when he was the Chief of General Staff of the army,"" Ateny told reporters.

In February this year, the European Union imposed sanctions on Malong and three South Sudanese officials implicated in human rights violations and obstructions of their country’s peace process.

He accused the ex-army chief of destroying the August 2015 peace deal that forced rebel leader Riek Machar out of Juba last year.

""Malong was against the peace agreement on the resolution of the conflict in South Sudan. That is why he staged almost three attempted coups against President Kiir between 2015 and 2016,” said Ateny.

Relations between Awan and President Kiir deteriorated after the former was sacked from his post as army chief of staff in May 2017 and placed under house arrest for fear he would start a rebellion.

The ex-army chief was freed in November following mediation led by the Jieng Council of Elders. The agreement refrained him from going to his home-town of Aweil in Northern Bahr el-Ghazal state but was allowed to travel to any East Africa country.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres in an address to the Security Council

UNITED NATIONS, Apr 13 2018 (IPS) - The situation in the Middle East is in chaos — to such an extent it has become a threat to international peace and security.

The region is facing a true Gordian knot – different fault lines crossing each other and creating a highly volatile situation with risks of escalation, fragmentation and division as far as the eye can see with profound regional and global ramifications.



We see a multiplicity of divides. The first is the memory of the Cold War. But to be precise, it is more than a simple memory.

The Cold War is back — with a vengeance but with a difference. The mechanisms and the safeguards to manage the risks of escalation that existed in the past no longer seem to be present.

Second, the Palestinian-Israeli divide. Third, the Sunni-Shia divide, evident from the Gulf to the Mediterranean. It is important to note that apparent religious divides are normally the result of political or geo-strategic manipulations.

Finally, a wide range of different factors — from opposing attitudes in relation to the role of the Muslim Brotherhood or the status of the Kurds, to the dramatic threats to communities that have been living in the region for millennia and are part of the rich diversity of Middle Eastern societies.

This multiplicity of divides is reflected in a multiplicity of conflicts with different degrees of interconnection, several of them clearly linked to the threat of global terrorism. Many forms of escalation are possible.

We see the wounds of the Palestinian- Israeli conflict deepening once again. The recent violence in Gaza has resulted in many needless deaths and injuries.

I repeat my call for an independent and transparent investigation into these incidents.

I also appeal to those concerned to refrain from any act that could lead to further casualties and, in particular, any measures that could place civilians in harm’s way.

This tragedy underlines the urgency of revitalizing the peace process for a two-state solution that will allow Palestinians and Israelis to live in two democratic states side by side in peace and within secure and recognised borders. I reaffirm the United Nations’ readiness to support these efforts.

In Yemen, we are witnessing the worst humanitarian disaster in today’s world. There is only one pathway to ending the Yemeni conflict and addressing the humanitarian crisis – a negotiated political settlement through inclusive intra-Yemeni dialogue.

My Special Envoy Martin Griffiths is doing everything possible to facilitate that political settlement — and he will brief the Council next week.

In Libya, I encourage all parties to continue to work with my Special Representative Ghassan Salamé, as he engages in the political process with a broad range of Libyan interlocutors across the country to implement the UN Action Plan. It is high time to end the Libyan conflict.

Iraq demonstrates that progress is possible with concerted local, regional and global commitment. With the defeat of Daesh, and after overcoming the risk of fragmentation, the Government of Iraq must now focus on reconstruction, reforms and reconciliation. I hope the upcoming elections will consolidate this progress.

At the recent Paris and Rome conferences, the international community reaffirmed its support for Lebanon’s sovereignty, stability and state security institutions.

It is absolutely essential to avoid a new Israel-Hezbollah conflict that could inevitably result in many more victims and much greater destruction than the last war.

I reiterate the critical importance to act on key principles and commitments on Lebanon, including Security Council resolutions such as 1701, and the policy of disassociation. The dangers of the links to the Syrian conflict are evident in the recent confrontations between Iran and Israel in Syria.

Syria indeed today represents the most serious threat to international peace and security.

In Syria, we see confrontations and proxy wars involving several national armies, a number of armed opposition groups, many national and international militia, foreign fighters from everywhere in the world, and various terrorist organizations.

From the beginning, we have witnessed systematic violations of international humanitarian law, international human rights law, and international law tout court — in utter disregard of the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter.

For eight long years, the people of Syria have endured suffering upon suffering. I reiterate: there is no military solution to the conflict.

The solution must be political through the Geneva intra-Syrian talks, as stipulated in resolution 2254 of the Security Council, in line with the consistent efforts of my Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura.

Syrians have lived through a litany of horrors: atrocity crimes, sieges, starvation, indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, the use of chemical weapons, forced displacement, sexual violence, torture, detention and enforced disappearances. The list goes on.

In a moment of hope, the Security Council adopted resolution 2401 demanding that all parties cease hostilities without delay for a durable humanitarian pause.

Unfortunately, no such cessation of hostilities ever really took place. That is the bleak panorama of Syria today.

In this panorama, I am outraged by the continued reports of the use of chemical weapons in Syria.

I reiterate my strong condemnation of the use of chemical weapons by any party to the conflict and under any circumstances. Their use is abhorrent and a clear violation of international law.

The seriousness of the recent allegations requires a thorough investigation using impartial, independent and professional expertise.

In this regard, I reaffirm my full support for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons – the OPCW — and its Fact-Finding Mission in undertaking the required investigation into these allegations.

The Fact-Finding Mission should be granted full access, without any restrictions or impediments to perform its activities. I take note that the Syrian government has requested it and committed to facilitate it.

The first team of the OPCW is already in Syria. A second is expected today or tomorrow. But we need to go further.

In a letter to the Council two days ago, I expressed “my deep disappointment that the Security Council was unable to agree upon a dedicated mechanism to attribute responsibility for the use of chemical weapons in Syria”, following the end of the mandate of the Joint Investigative Mechanism, or JIM.

I want to repeat today that the norms against chemical weapons must be upheld.

As I wrote in the same letter: “Ensuring accountability for a confirmed use of chemical weapons is our responsibility, not least to the victims of such attacks.

A lack of accountability emboldens those who would use such weapons by providing them with the reassurance of impunity. This in turn further weakens the norm proscribing the use of chemical weapons and the international disarmament and non-proliferation architecture as a whole.

I urge all Member States to act responsibly in these dangerous circumstances.

I appeal to the Security Council to fulfil its duties and not give up on efforts to agree upon a dedicated, impartial, objective and independent mechanism for attributing responsibility with regard to the use of chemical weapons. I stand ready to support such efforts.”

Increasing tensions and the inability to reach a compromise in the establishment of an accountability mechanism threaten to lead to a full-blown military escalation.

In my contacts with you — especially with the Permanent Members of the Security Council — I have been reiterating my deep concerns about the risks of the current impasse and stressed the need to avoid the situation spiralling out of control.

This is exactly the risk we face today – that things spiral out of control. It is our common duty to stop it.","Middle East: a Threat to World Peace & Security, Warns UN ChiefUN Secretary-General António Guterres in an address to the Security CouncilUNITED NATIONS, Apr 13 2018 (IPS) - The situation in the Middle East is in chaos — to such an extent it has become a threat to international peace and security.

Security Council

8229th Meeting (AM)

Despite an ever-precarious security situation that had claimed the lives of civilians and United Nations peacekeepers alike, the peace process in Mali was making headway along a timetable leading to elections later in 2018, the Secretary‑General’s Special Representative in that country told the Security Council today.

Mahamat Saleh Annadif, who is also Head of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), said significant developments in the past three months included the appointment of a new Prime Minister, Soumeylou Boubèye Maïga, who, in March, toured the restive north and central regions, as well as a growing level of trust between the signatories of the 2015 Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation.

While progress towards peace was being made, the fact that 2018 was an election year could not be overlooked, he told Council members. With presidential elections scheduled for 29 July and 12 August to be followed by legislative elections in November and December, he emphasized the urgency of sticking to the electoral timetable.

However, the first quarter of 2018 also saw a deterioration of the security situation, as well as serious human rights violations, he said. In line with Council resolutions, MINUSMA was conducting more and bigger patrols to reassure the population, assess the human rights situation and engage with communities in hard-to-reach areas. Nevertheless, the number of casualties was growing, as demonstrated by the deaths earlier in April of two “blue helmets” from Chad and a third from Nigeria.

Emphasizing the need to better train peacekeepers for one of the United Nations most hazardous operations, he said the Mission remained about short of about 100 armoured vehicles, and that a pledge by Canada to supply six helicopters, while welcome, also fell short of what MINUSMA needed.

Coming back up on the elections, he said implementation of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali was a priority that must not become a political football. In line with its mandate, MINUSMA had started to lend technical and logistical support, within available resources, including the distribution of election materials and deployment of electoral personnel, while also preparing for any potential violence. He urged the Council to call upon Mali’s political class to respect the electoral timetable and adhere to the path to consensual, peaceful and credible elections.

Sweden’s delegate, speaking in his capacity as Chair of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 2374 (2017) concerning Mali, briefed members on its activities, which started on 1 February. Together with other Committee members, he said he visited Bamako on 26 and 27 March and received first-hand information from key stakeholders on how the sanctions regime could support Mali’s peace and stability.

In the ensuing discussion, the representative of Côte d’Ivoire — one of seven countries bordering Mali — voiced concern about delays in implementing the Agreement. “Time is of the essence,” he said, calling on all parties in Mali to engage meaningfully and respect the electoral timetable. Welcoming Council unity on MINUSMA support for the Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel) joint force, he said security measures must be undergirded by initiatives on employment for youth and women, their engagement in politics, the fight against poverty and overcoming regional discrepancies.

France’s representative said recent fatalities among MINUSMA peacekeepers, including two French soldiers, served as a reminder of how the Mission was evolving, but also of the critical role it played. Calling for progress in such areas as disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, and security sector reform, as well as in countering human rights violations and impunity, he said Council members must remember that Mali had been waiting three years for peace. In that context, the Council should adopt measures to ensure that all parties complied with their road map responsibilities. The sanctions regime established in 2017 was a first step in that regard, he stated.

The representative of Bolivia said terrorism in Mali was not only placing civilian lives at risk, but also putting the brakes on economic and social growth, exasperating the presence of transnational organized crime. Emphasizing that the security situation was riven with challenges, he said the root causes of conflict in the Sahel were intertwined with the aftermath of intervention and regime change, notably the 2011 military intervention in Libya.

Agreeing, the Russian Federation’s speaker said the “unbridled spillover” of terrorism from Libya into Mali and other neighbouring States was the main destabilizing factor in the region. In that regard, he urged Council members to “learn from that lesson” in their future actions. He added that the sanctions must be used as a measure of last resort.

Tiéman Hubert Coulibaly, Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Mali, said his Government understood and shared the sense of impatience and angst regarding the implementation of some aspects of the Agreement. However, it wanted to reassure the Council and the international community of its determination to see the process through. There had already been many achievements, he said, not least a halt to fighting between the Agreement’s signatories. On the security situation, he said terrorists wanted to turn Mali into a place of hate, evil and crime. That was not a problem for Mali alone, as the shadow of terrorism loomed over the entire region. There must, therefore, be international support for regional initiatives, such as the G-5 Sahel force, he said.

Reiterating his Government’s determination to hold transparent, inclusive and credible elections, he added that all reports of human rights violations would be investigated. Turning to the humanitarian situation, he said the Government was, despite limited resources, investing in basic social services and striving to reopen schools. He went on to voice his Government’s unequivocal support for MINUSMA and seconded the Secretary-General’s appeal to strengthen its resources. Concluding, he said there were good grounds for hope. Peace in Mali was possible and the Government would leave no stone unturned in achieving that objective.

Also speaking today were representatives of Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, China, Sweden, United Kingdom, Kazakhstan, United States, Kuwait, Poland, Netherlands and Peru.

The meeting began at 10:10 a.m. and ended at 12:33 p.m.

Briefings

MAHAMAT SALEH ANNADIF, Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), introduced the Secretary-General’s report on the situation in that country (document S/2018/273). He said the reporting period featured the appointment on 31 December 2017 of Soumeylou Boubèye Maïga as Prime Minister of Mali, who, from 22 to 26 March, undertook a tour of his State’s north and central regions, as well as increased trust between signatories of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali and some headway in the peace process. For its part, MINUSMA had assisted the Government to augment its authority in the north and centre of Mali and better provide for local needs. Despite such progress, the fact that 2018 was an election year could not be overlooked, with Presidential elections scheduled for 29 July and 12 August, and legislative elections in November and December, he said. Against that backdrop, the Mission was engaging with all Malian political actors, encouraging them to do their part for peaceful and credible elections.

The reporting period had also been marked by a deterioration of the security situation, particularly in the centre of Mali, as well as serious human rights violations, he said, noting the concerns recently voiced by the independent expert on the human right situation in the country. Welcoming a new national border policy, he said a draft law on national reconciliation was expected to be put before the National Assembly during its April session. Meanwhile, the transfer on 31 March of Al Hassan Ag Abdoul Aziz to the International Criminal Court underscored that reconciliation was not synonymous with impunity. With the United Nations country team, MINUSMA had launched an initiative to promote the restoration of State authority in central Mali, as well as economic growth and the provision of social services.

Emphasizing that a purely security approach was not enough, he said the Mission was continuing to support the specialist judicial system tackling terrorism, money-laundering and cross-border crime. Similar cooperation had enabled a national policy to tackle violent extremism and terrorism to be rolled out. In line with Council resolutions 2295 (2016) and 2364 (2016), MINUSMA was conducting more and bigger patrols, particularly in the centre, to reassure the population, assess the human rights situation and engage with communities in hard‑to‑reach areas. Despite such expanded activity, a shadow had been cast by the growing number of victims of landmines, improvised explosive devices and the indirect targeting of shells and rocks, as seen last week by the death of two “blue helmets” from Chad. He emphasized the need to give priority to the training of peacekeeping troops, adding that the Mission remained about 100 armoured vehicles short. Troop- and police-contributing countries had been asked to do what they could to fill the equipment gap. Canada’s offer of six helicopters, while welcome, fell short of what was needed.

Turning to the ongoing strategic review of MINUSMA, he said the Mission was awaiting the Secretary-General’s recommendations with the hope that ensuing discussions would lead to a better alignment between its mandate, on the one hand, and the realities on the ground and the expectations of the Malian people, on the other. Pending those recommendations, the Mission would work closely with the country team to address the needs of the people, especially women and children. He noted the contributions that would be made by the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 2374 (2017), the independent observer and the International Commission of Inquiry. Such mechanisms added to the architecture of the follow-up to the 2015 Agreement, with the sanctions regime helping to raise levels of accountability while reminding the parties of the parties of their obligations and consequences, he said.

In addition to its role in security sector reform, MINUSMA — in line with resolution 2391 (2017) and the technical agreement among the United Nations, European Union and the G-5 Sahel reached in Brussels, had sketched out a framework for its support of the G-5 Sahel joint force, he said. Mechanisms to ensure medical evacuations and logistical support were now operational, he said, noting also the contributions of the Peacebuilding Fund through a $3 million initiative to improve security for local populations.

Reiterating that 2018 was an election year, he said Malian actors must remember that implementation of the Agreement was a priority that must not become a political football. The peace process was complex, but it was time to move from promises to action and for deadlines to be upheld. The entire political class agreed that elections must take place on time, with the utmost transparency and credibility. The international community shared their preoccupation. Just as the 2013 elections re-established constitutional order in Mali, those in 2018 must irreversibly anchor democracy. In terms of preparations, an agreement was in place to revise the electoral law and an order had been placed for 8 million voter’s cards. In line with its mandate, MINUSMA had started to lend technical and logistical support, within available resources, including the distribution of election materials and deployment of electoral personnel, while also preparing for any potential violence. Concluding, he said the Council must call upon the Malian political class to respect the adopted timetable and encourage them along the path to consensual, peaceful and — above all — credible elections. The alternative would mean adding one crisis onto another, with the enemies of peace emerging the victors. They did not merit such a gift.

OLOF SKOOG (Sweden), briefing the 15-member organ in his capacity as Chair of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 2374 (2017) concerning Mali, said his report covered the period from 5 September 2017 to 4 April 2018, during which the Committee had met twice in informal consultations and conducted additional work via the written silence procedure. On 29 January, it adopted guidelines for the conduct of the Panel of Expert’s work, and on 1 February, that body had begun its work. On 5 February, the Committee had held its first informal consultation during which members of the Panel of Experts had introduced their work plan. On 28 February, the Committee had considered the Panel’s first interim update and held a discussion on its work. Together with other members of the Committee, he said, he had visited Bamako from 26 to 27 March, which had allowed him to obtain first-hand information from key stakeholders on how the sanctions regime could support Mali’s peace and stability, including through the implementation of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation.

Statements

FRANÇOIS DELATTRE (France) said the tragic recent death of MINUSMA peacekeepers — including two French soldiers — served as a reminder of how the Mission was evolving, but also of the critical role it played. Recalling that the Council had taken a decision in January to consider additional measures under the sanctions regime if the Government did not meet commitments laid out under the designated timetable, and welcoming initiatives taken since that time by the Government, he nevertheless expressed regret that most of those commitments had not been achieved. Calling for progress in such areas as disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, and security sector reform, as well as in countering human rights violations and impunity, he expressed support for the recent adoption of a new road map based on a revised time frame.

However, he said, Council members should remember that the road map was not the first instrument of its kind, and the country had been waiting for peace for more than three years. In that context, the Council should adopt measures to ensure that all parties complied with their road map responsibilities. The sanctions regime established in 2017 was a first step in that regard, but they must go further. France would engage in efforts to identify all those who obstructed the Agreement’s implementation, leading to sanctions designation proposals, specifically those that colluded with terrorist groups and trafficking networks. He also called for the urgent establishment of an early warning mechanism in the case of attacks against MINUSMA and civilians.

ANATOLIO NDONG MBA (Equatorial Guinea), voicing his delegation’s commitment to stabilization and peace in neighbouring Mali, welcomed the recent road map adopted by that country’s Government. Mali still faced major challenges, and it would be impossible to untangle its security issues if the main challenge of terrorism was not combated. The Government must strengthen its presence across the whole country, he stressed, adding that terrorist activities within Mali often spilled over the borders into other nations. Regional and subregional cooperation, including through Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the African Union, was therefore critical. Welcoming the establishment of the Group of Five Sahel (G‑5 Sahel) force as a step in the right direction, he called on the Government of Mali and all signatories to the Agreement to redouble their efforts towards its swift implementation. In that regard, he aligned also himself with a March communiqué of the African Union Peace and Security Council, reaffirmed the importance of the Nouakchott process and called for enhanced support for MINUSMA, which must be better equipped and better able to train the Malian armed forces.

TEKEDA ALEMU (Ethiopia), paying tribute to fallen peacekeepers and victims of terrorist acts, commended the appointment of a new Prime Minister and his efforts to foster a conducive electoral environment. Ethiopia welcomed preparations for regional, district and municipal elections in April and called on all parties to work towards their smooth conduct. The Prime Minister’s announcement of measures to restore State authority and deliver peace dividends was commendable, as well. However, the continued deterioration of the security situation in the north and south due to terrorist activity remained of serious concern. Urgent action must be taken to quickly reverse that situation. Mali was once a viable democracy and a beacon of hope for Africa and there was no reason that it could not be so again, he said, adding that the Council must do everything possible to have Mali’s back.

ZHANG DIANBIN (China), noting recent progress in implementing the Agreement, said the security situation remained grim, with rampant terrorist activity having an impact on the peace process. Signatories to the Agreement must show political will and work together for national development and reconstruction, he said, voicing hope that the Sanctions Committee would help in that regard. At the same time, an integrated and regional approach must be adopted to respond to terrorism in Mali and surrounding areas. Expressing his country’s appreciation for MINUSMA and the Special Representative, he said he hoped the Mission would continue to work in close cooperation with the Government. China had contributed 400 peacekeepers to MINUSMA, he said, and noting the deaths of “blue helmets” from Bangladesh, Chad and Niger in three attacks so far in 2018, he said there should be strengthened communication with troop-contributing countries and donors to ensure that MINUSMA had the resources it needed to carry out its mandate.

Mr. SKOOG (Sweden), speaking in his national capacity, and welcoming the Government of Mali’s ambitious new plan to restore stability, particularly in the centre of the country, recalled that the Council had on 24 January adopted a press statement clearly setting out its expectations regarding key reforms foreseen under the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation. “The time to evaluate progress has come,” he said. Prime Minister Maïga’s visit to the north and central regions of the country were encouraging, as was the process of drafting a national security sector reform strategy. Voicing regret that many of the deadlines set out in the January timetable had not been met, he reiterated the need for substantial steps forwards towards the full implementation of the Agreement as a prerequisite for successful elections in Mali. “It is crucial for Mali and the peace process that elections are duly and legitimately undertaken and not postponed,” he stressed, calling on all parties to play their part to those ends. Women’s participation in that process would be critical, he said, also calling for the further institutionalization of their inclusion in the mechanism supporting the implementation of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation.

KAREN PIERCE (United Kingdom), joining others in condemning the recent deadly attacks against MINUSMA peacekeepers, voiced strong support for the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali as the best way to achieve stability and counter extremists. Despite recent progress, the persistent delays which had long tested the Council’s patience still remained. The parties had agreed on yet a new road map, revising existing deadlines, instead of focusing on implementing benchmarks they had already agreed to. Recalling the Council’s intention to take additional action to respond to spoilers, she said the United Kingdom now supported appropriate action including the imposition of sanctions against those that obscured the Agreement. It was now up to the parties themselves to do their part, she stressed. MINUSMA must be properly equipped to fulfil its mandate, she said, calling on States to generously provide equipment and recalling that the United Kingdom had recently contributed several helicopters to operation Pagnali. Expressing concern about reports of summary executions on the ground, she said human rights reporting and monitoring must be prioritized in the MINUSMA mandate, and hoped the Mission would address such alleged violations.

KANAT TUMYSH (Kazakhstan) said the implementation of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation must be the international community’s priority in Mali. Indeed, addressing the country’s critical security concerns were crucial, but such work must be coupled with efforts to bring about national reconciliation, economic development, good governance, the delivery of basic services and the rule of law. Also critical would be to ensure the transparent, fair and inclusive conduct of elections later in 2018. The Mission’s assistance, in that regard, as well as that of the international community, would be critical, as would efforts to improve Mali’s humanitarian situation. Expressing concern over the deteriorating security situation in the country’s north and central regions, he said more robust combat operations were needed against asymmetric threats in those areas. The operationalization of the G-5 Sahel force, alongside reinforced efforts on the part of MINUSMA and the Malian national security forces, were essential to those ends.

AMY NOEL TACHCO (United States), recalling that the signatories to the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation had, in January, committed to make substantial progress in implementing that accord by March, expressed regret that little had been accomplished. Available tools to respond to that failure included the Mali sanctions regime, which could address spoilers who obstructed the Agreement, including by colluding with criminals. “There really is no more time to waste”, as Mali faced critical humanitarian and security situations. That was particularly true in the centre of the country, where extremists threatened violence against civilians if they failed to cooperate with them. The recent increase in attacks against MINUSMA and Malian national security forces was also of grave concern. The Mission’s support to the Government in expanding its presence across Mali was crucial, but that expansion must be viewed as a positive development by local communities. She, therefore, expressed grave concern about reports of summary executions by signatories to the Agreement. Also voicing support to regional forces — including the recently operationalized G-5 Sahel force — she emphasized that the people of Mali “deserve better” than what the Agreement’s signatories had delivered to date.

MANSOUR AYYAD SH. A. ALOTAIBI (Kuwait) said the deteriorating security situation was deeply saddening. Pledges made in Brussels regarding the G-5 Sahel force would enable that operation to fulfil its mandate. Welcoming the road map signed on 22 March, he urged the parties to commit to its timetable. Implementation of the Agreement was the main solution to the crisis, he said, calling on the Government to provide a conducive environment in that regard. Emphasizing that the absence of State authority in the north would thwart any comprehensive progress, he welcomed the Prime Minister’s recent visit to that area. On the humanitarian situation, he called for steps to be taken to avert collateral deaths and injuries during military operations, as well as for the reopening of schools throughout Mali. The role of the United Nations in Mali and the wider Sahel was irreplaceable and Kuwait looked forward to the results of the MINUSMA strategic review in preparation of the renewal of the Mission’s mandate in June.

JOANNA WRONECKA (Poland), noting that implementation of the Agreement remained slow, said tangible progress was crucial to advance the peace process. Holding presidential elections on time would be vital for Mali to avoid serious political tensions. However, a situation whereby the State was absent in large parts of the country might deepen the crisis. Restoring State authority nationwide was therefore urgent. She added that the security situation in the north and centre remained crucial, as well as a threat to the wider Sahel. Counter-terrorism operations meanwhile raised grave human rights concerns. A multidimensional approach was needed which focused on military operations, creating jobs for youth, and ensuring accountability for serious crimes. Poland welcomed the technical agreement between the United Nations, European Union and the G-5 Sahel regarding operational and logistical support to the G-5 Sahel force, and commended the tireless efforts of MINUSMA men and women in difficult circumstances.

BERNARD TANOH-BOUTCHOUE (Côte d’Ivoire), emphasizing that his country, as a neighbour of Mali, reiterated support for the Government in implementing the Agreement, which was the sole framework for a peaceful and lasting settlement of the crisis. Côte d’Ivoire appreciated progress thus far, but it shared the Secretary-General’s concern about implementation delays. “Time is of the essence,” he said, calling on all parties to engage meaningfully and respect the electoral timetable. His country fully supported the Prime Minister’s recent visit to the north, the first of its kind since 2014, which had helped to defuse tensions and restore trust. It was urgent for MINUSMA to continue its support for the redeployment of State institutions. Improving the Mission’s capacity with armoured vehicles and air assets was critical, but it must be preceded by calibrated training for peacekeepers in asymmetrical violence. Welcoming a convergence of views and unity in the Council on the Mission’s support for the G-5 Sahel force, he said his delegation also welcomed the G-5 Sahel’s adoption of a human rights compliance framework, which reflected donor demands and the need to engage with local populations. To be effective, security measures must be undergirded by robust initiatives on employment for youth and women, their engagement in politics, the fight against poverty and overcoming regional discrepancies.

SACHA SERGIO LLORENTTY SOLÍZ (Bolivia) said terrorism in Mali was not only placing civilian lives at risk, but also putting the brakes on economic and social growth, exasperating the presence of transnational organized crime. Asymmetric attacks with improvised explosive devices, small arms and light weapons were worsening the situation on the ground, with Malian forces suffering the greatest casualties. Recalling resolution 2364 (2017), he said MINUSMA must adopt a more proactive stance to fulfil its mandate, and in that regard, he encouraged the Mission to implement its memorandum of understanding with the Government to support the latter’s forces in the field, including with demining and medical evacuations. Emphasizing that the security situation was riven with challenges, he said deep-rooted causes of conflict in the Sahel were intertwined with the aftermath of intervention and regime change, notably the intervention in Libya which led to the non-State armed presence in the region. Bolivia would support all initiatives that promoted the well-being of the Malian people and the wider region as a whole, he added.

KAREL JAN GUSTAAF VAN OOSTEROM (Netherlands), spotlighting the many challenges facing Mali — including terrorism, drug‑smuggling and the trafficking in people and weapons — called for action in line with the “three Ps”: The primacy of politics, performance and the prevention of impunity. Only a negotiated political settlement would lead to sustainable peace and security, he said, noting that the Mission’s supportive role remained critical in that regard. The international community, including the Netherlands, had invested heavily in Mali. “In return, we expect all Malian parties to take their responsibility to implement the peace agreement,” he said. Calling for a new momentum in that regard, he said peace could only be achieved through an inclusive political process in which all Malians were represented. Urgent steps were required, especially in the decentralization of State authority, the reform of the security sector and the demobilization and reintegration of former combatants in the Malian armed forces. He also called for fair, inclusive and peaceful elections, adding: “We should not shy away from using the sanctions regime against spoilers of the peace process, including those involved in the smuggling economy.” The Council must dare to reflect honestly on the MINUSMA mandate and the capabilities required to effectively execute it, he said, noting that the Mission’s upcoming strategic review and subsequent mandate renewal provided the opportunity to do so.

DMITRY A. POLYANSKIY (Russian Federation), echoing concerns about troubling developments in Mali, said the dangerous potential for conflict — driven largely by terrorist groups — continued to loom over the country. All stakeholders must align themselves with the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation, including by committing themselves to prompt security sector reform and the restoration of civil authority, as well as the conduct of local joint militia patrols in the north and centre of the country. Condemning attacks against MINUSMA peacekeepers, he said such events should prompt the Council to make the Mission fully operational. That hinged on the provision of the necessary arms and equipment, he stressed, calling on donors to avoid any delay in delivering those items. Welcoming the regional efforts of the G‑5 Sahel force, he recalled that the Russian Federation had supported resolution 2374 (2017) establishing the sanctions regime. However, “the explicit use of sanctions needs to be a measure of last resort”, and haste should be avoided. Drawing attention to the ongoing security crisis in Libya — which resulted from the 2011 decision by some nations to oust that country’s Government — he described the “unbridled spillover” of terrorism from Libya into Mali and other neighbouring States as the main destabilizing factor in the region. In that regard, he urged Council members to “learn from that lesson” in their future actions.

GUSTAVO MEZA-CUADRA (Peru), Council President for April, spoke in his national capacity, expressing concern over the deteriorating security situation in areas where Mali’s State control was weak. Calling for redoubled efforts to pursue decentralization and sustainable development across the country, he also underlined the need to carry out a fair, transparent and inclusive electoral process, fully supported by regional and international partners, in 2018. Meanwhile, Malian stakeholders should accelerate efforts to implement the country’s disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme for former combatants, as well as plans for security sector reform. The crisis in Mali had a knock-on effect across the Sahel region, he stressed, calling for an enhanced regional response to the forces of extremism and the actions of organized criminal groups. As MINUSMA continued to suffer from a dearth of equipment, he expressed hope that the Mission’s upcoming strategic review would provide a chance for the Council to make all necessary adjustments in that regard.

TIÉMAN HUBERT COULIBALY, Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Mali, extended condolences following the airplane crash that took place in Algeria earlier today. Recalling his January appearance before the Council, he welcomed the Secretary-General’s acknowledgement of the new momentum in the peace process. The Government understood and shared the sense of impatience and angst regarding the implementation of some aspects of the Agreement, but it wanted to reassure the Council and the international community of its determination to see the process through. There had already been many achievements, including an end to fighting between the signatories, the return of State authority to many parts of the country and the road map leading to Presidential and legislative elections.

Noting efforts on security sector reform and the demobilization, disarming and reintegration of former combatants, he said progress so far was fragile — all the more, so given a complex and difficult environment of terrorism, violent extremism and illegal trafficking. Terrorists wanted to turn a country on the road back to democracy into a place of hate, evil and crime. That was not a problem for Mali alone, as the shadow of terrorism loomed over the entire region. There must, therefore, be international support for regional initiatives, such as the G-5 Sahel force, he said, appealing for the disbursement of resources and pledges made at the Brussels conference in February.

The Government was determined to hold transparent, inclusive and credible elections, on time and throughout the country, he asserted. Thanks to a process of dialogue, Mali has never known post-electoral conflict in periods of non-crisis and that would be the case once again, with concerns about the participation of women and youth taken on board, as well. Emphasizing that all reports of human rights violations would be investigated, he expressed reservations about some parts of the Secretary-General’s report in that regard. While the Ministry of Justice was investigating alleged human rights violations by the armed forces, the Government rejected claims that soldiers had failed to prevent arson attacks in the Mopti region. On the humanitarian situation, he said the Government was, despite limited resources, investing in basic social services. It was also committed to reopening schools, with Koranic schools being integrated into the formal educational system. Returning to MINUSA, he voiced his Government’s unequivocal support for the Mission and agreed with the Secretary-General’s appeal to beef up its resources. Concluding, he said there were good grounds for hope. Peace in Mali was possible and the Government would leave no stone unturned in achieving that objective.

By Ajogwu Jerry

Students of Taraba State origin under the auspices of Southern Taraba Students’ Peace Initiative yesterday applauded the successes of Exercise Ayem Akpatuma in Taraba state and environs, lauding the Nigerian Army Leadership for its intervention in the protection of lives and properties across the state.

The students drawn from various higher institutions in the country whilst paying a ‘thank you visit’ to the Commanding Officer of 93 battalion Nigerian Army, Ada Barrack Takum, Taraba State, Lt. Col. Ibrahim Gambari, they further lauded the Commander for his exceptional roles and landmark achievements within the state.

The students applauded the charismatic leadership roles of the Commanding Officer and accorded him a leadership award of excellence as an “Icon of Peace and Humanitarian Service”.

In a speech read by the National President of the group, Comrade Fahad Ahmed Sule, he said the students felt the achievement of the Nigerian Army in general and the hero in particular must not go unrecognized.

He said, Lt. Col. Gambari, is an individual whose attainment in life: socially, economically and politically among others have brought fame, honour and respect not only to 93 batallion but the Nigerian Army at large.

Part of the statement read:

“The life of Lieutenant Colonel Ibrahim Gambari right from junior cadet to senior cadet, junior officer to senior officer is akin to the proverbial grass to grace story.

“Lt. Col. Gambari in 100% compliance with the Nigerian Army Headquarter engaged in scrutinizing each house within his territory in order to fish out all illegal arms and to maintain the sustainable peace and stability in our land is commendable and legendary.

“He stands out as a distinguished professional with an enviable pedigree earned as a philosophy, his reputation as a man of principles with integrity as his watchword remained intact and indeed grown by the day, we believe you are in the class of great men that have taken the best place in the world, as a natural leader of men, you are accountable, approachable, adoptable, bold step brave, candid, challenging, charismatic, compassionate, honest, cool and calm.”

The students thanked the Nigerian Army for restoring peace and security in the general area of Taraba south and hoped that the relative peace enjoyed at the moment will be sustained across the entire state.

The Legitimacy Landscape

Saskia Brechenmacher and Thomas Carothers

Civil society is under stress globally as dozens of governments across multiple regions are reducing space for independent civil society organizations, restricting or prohibiting international support for civic groups, and propagating government-controlled nongovernmental organizations. Although civic activists in most places are no strangers to repression, this wave of anti–civil society actions and attitudes is the widest and deepest in decades. It is an integral part of two broader global shifts that raise concerns about the overall health of the international liberal order: the stagnation of democracy worldwide and the rekindling of nationalistic sovereignty, often with authoritarian features.

Attacks on civil society take myriad forms, from legal and regulatory measures to physical harassment, and usually include efforts to delegitimize civil society. Governments engaged in closing civil society spaces not only target specific civic groups but also spread doubt about the legitimacy of the very idea of an autonomous civic sphere that can activate and channel citizens’ interests and demands. These legitimacy attacks typically revolve around four arguments or accusations:

That civil society organizations are self-appointed rather than elected, and thus do not represent the popular will. For example, the Hungarian government justified new restrictions on foreign-funded civil society organizations by arguing that “society is represented by the elected governments and elected politicians, and no one voted for a single civil organization.”

That civil society organizations receiving foreign funding are accountable to external rather than domestic constituencies, and advance foreign rather than local agendas. In India, for example, the Modi government has denounced foreign-funded environmental NGOs as “anti-national,” echoing similar accusations in Egypt, Macedonia, Romania, Turkey, and elsewhere.

That civil society groups are partisan political actors disguised as nonpartisan civic actors: political wolves in citizen sheep’s clothing. Governments denounce both the goals and methods of civic groups as being illegitimately political, and hold up any contacts between civic groups and opposition parties as proof of the accusation.

That civil society groups are elite actors who are not representative of the people they claim to represent. Critics point to the foreign education backgrounds, high salaries, and frequent foreign travel of civic activists to portray them as out of touch with the concerns of ordinary citizens and only working to perpetuate their own privileged lifestyle.

Attacks on civil society legitimacy are particularly appealing for populist leaders who draw on their nationalist, majoritarian, and anti-elite positioning to deride civil society groups as foreign, unrepresentative, and elitist. Other leaders borrow from the populist toolbox to boost their negative campaigns against civil society support. The overall aim is clear: to close civil society space, governments seek to exploit and widen existing cleavages between civil society and potential supporters in the population. Rather than engaging with the substantive issues and critiques raised by civil society groups, they draw public attention to the real and alleged shortcomings of civil society actors as channels for citizen grievances and demands.

The widening attacks on the legitimacy of civil society oblige civil society organizations and their supporters to revisit various fundamental questions: What are the sources of legitimacy of civil society? How can civil society organizations strengthen their legitimacy to help them weather government attacks and build strong coalitions to advance their causes? And how can international actors ensure that their support reinforces rather than undermines the legitimacy of local civic activism?

To help us find answers to these questions, we asked civil society activists working in ten countries around the world—from Guatemala to Tunisia and from Kenya to Thailand—to write about their experiences with and responses to legitimacy challenges. Their essays follow here. We conclude with a final section in which we extract and discuss the key themes that emerge from their contributions as well as our own research.

Objectivity Without Neutrality: Reflections From Colombia

César Rodríguez-Garavito

Critics as diverse as postcolonial and postmodern scholars, authoritarian governments, conservative legal scholars, and some progressive social movements have objected to the activities of human rights organizations, claiming that these organizations lack legitimacy for their work. To complicate matters, this same charge—a lack of legitimacy—often encompasses diverse critiques: some critics point to geopolitical factors, such as the dominance of the Global North’s organizations in the field, or cultural attributes, such as allegations that human rights norms embody only Western values. Others highlight political factors, such as human rights organizations’ lack of public electoral accountability, and social concerns, including the allegation that NGOs have become professionalized and detached from the grassroots bases and communities they are meant to serve.

To find solutions to these real or alleged legitimacy shortcomings of human rights organizations, we therefore have to answer three key questions: What type of legitimacy is at stake? What is the organization’s nature, and what are its constituencies? And what context does the organization operate in? I discuss these questions here in light of the experiences of my own organization, the Center for Law, Justice, and Society (Dejusticia), based in Bogotá, Colombia. Although all four elements of legitimacy (geopolitical, cultural, political, and social) are relevant to Dejusticia’s work, this analysis addresses the organization’s political and social legitimacy—the main focus of this collection of essays.

With respect to the organization’s nature and constituencies, political and social legitimacy does not have a one-size-fits-all model—for the simple reason that there is no one-size-fits-all organizational structure for human rights actors. These actors range from large global membership-based organizations such as Amnesty International, to small local social movement organizations, to midsized “think-do tanks” such as Dejusticia that work both nationally and internationally. In addition to differences of scale and structure, human rights organizations vary widely in the tools they use. Different tools entail different expectations about legitimacy.

At Dejusticia, we define our approach and toolkit as action-research: a combination of academic research and advocacy strategies that feed into each other. Our research is geared toward unpacking and solving pressing human rights problems, and our advocacy is informed by the knowledge that we and others produce. What does this mean for our legitimacy? As scholar Martha Finnemore put it, legitimacy is “by its nature, a social and relational phenomenon”; it is given by others, including by peers and “by those upon whom power is exercised.” Our hybrid approach results in two different types of legitimacy expectations. First, for our research to be legitimate—that is, accepted by relevant audiences and constituencies—it must meet the rigor and objectivity standards demanded of scholarly work. Second, for our advocacy to be legitimate, it must be impactful and must meaningfully engage with those whose rights we defend.

These two sets of expectations do not necessarily align. In fact, they may at times pull us in opposite directions. On more than one occasion, our allies in advocacy work—for example, a social movement organization that we represent in court—have asked us to join a public statement that includes assertions of fact that go beyond what we can confidently say based on available evidence. Similarly, our colleagues in academia are sometimes baffled by our direct engagement in high-stakes litigation and campaigning. Maintaining our legitimacy thus entails a balancing act. We meet this challenge by being objective while not being neutral. Our distinctive voice and our scholarly tools demand that we engage in careful and objective consideration of all the facts and points of view. At the same time, we openly take sides with the victims of human rights violations and marginalized populations.

This hybrid approach is not without risks. We navigate these risks by being transparent about our methods and goals, and by being radically collaborative with counterparts in academia, government, civil society, and grassroots communities. Most of our work is carried out in partnerships and coalitions rather than through arms-length representation. As theorists of collaboration have remarked, this approach requires investing considerable time and effort into communications and deliberation to build and maintain trust. For example, at the national level, we have developed long-term relationships with social movement organizations—from environmental justice collectives to women’s rights organizations to indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities—that include joint decisionmaking about priority issues for research and legal action. At the international level, our work is entirely demand-driven: we work only in countries where local partners request our contributions to specific issues, be it arbitrary detentions in Venezuela or closing civic space in India, Egypt, or Turkey.

Finally, the relevance of different sources of social and political legitimacy is always highly context-specific. For instance, in countries with a long history of nationalist politics, NGOs are under pressure to demonstrate that they are driven by local demands and priorities, as opposed to those of foreign funders. The national context in which Dejusticia carries out its domestic work is marked by low levels of nationalism, low social trust, and high political polarization. In this context, Dejusticia’s legitimacy hinges largely on preserving and demonstrating its independence with regard to other national political actors, including the state, political parties, corporations, and social movements. To do so, the organization must support strong institutional practices, from not taking government funds to denouncing human rights violations regardless of the perpetrators’ political affiliation. Maintaining an independent and balanced voice, one that shifts between confrontation and engagement, is vital for Dejusticia to be perceived as a legitimate actor that cannot easily be identified with either of the increasingly polarized extremes in Colombia’s public debates about human rights.

Legitimacy From Below: Supporting Indigenous Rights in Guatemala

Walter Flores

As part of an aggressive set of neoliberal policies, the Guatemalan government of the late 1990s privatized major public assets and subcontracted the delivery of many basic public services to nongovernmental organizations, especially in the areas of health, education, and the administration of public infrastructure. This led to an exponential growth of civil society organizations (CSOs) whose main aim was to become government contractors. Not surprisingly, this contracting model for basic public services and infrastructure facilitated corruption. Public officials allocated contracts to CSOs that they either had founded themselves or indirectly controlled, which resulted in contracts being given to groups with no actual capacity or experience delivering health or education services. Their poor performance delegitimized CSOs—particularly those holding public contracts—in the eyes of the public.

My organization, the Center for the Study of Equity and Governance in Health Systems (Centro de Estudios para la Equidad y Gobernanza en los Sistemas de Salud; CEGSS), was founded in this context. Because our aim was to promote inclusion, equity, and democratic governance, the issues of legitimacy and political independence were of utmost importance to us. The executive board decided from the outset that CEGSS would neither seek nor accept any public funding from the Guatemalan government to implement its activities, a decision that remains in place today. This is particularly important given our core constituencies. The rural indigenous populations that are the main target of CEGSS’s work are often skeptical of CSOs, viewing them as government-contract profiteers with little real commitment to helping indigenous populations. The fact that we at CEGSS did not have any contractual relations with the government helped us gradually gain the trust of these communities.

A second key challenge for CEGSS was to build our legitimacy in the eyes of public officials. This approach was crucial to effectively fulfill our mission: in order to promote greater accountability in health service delivery for indigenous populations, we had to engage public officials at all levels of government. Our first strategy in this regard was to collect evidence of failing public services in indigenous rural areas and present it to public officials. CEGSS experts, who were nonindigenous, urban, and internationally educated professionals, were tasked with presenting the data. We thought that our expertise and academic background would give our cause and demands greater credibility and legitimacy. Yet the reality was that officials accused us of being politically motivated and having no real legitimacy because we were not from indigenous communities ourselves.

In response, we revised our strategy. Rather than using our theoretical expertise to speak on behalf of the communities we aim to support, we provide capacity-building services to community-elected representatives so that they can engage with government officials at different levels themselves. We also cover the costs of transport, food, and accommodation incurred by community representatives who attend meetings with government officials. This strategy has worked well. For example, we have trained, advised, and provided logistics for the Network of Community Defenders for the Right to Health, which includes elected representatives from the thirty-five municipalities where we work. The network engages with authorities at different government levels, as well as with the media, and organizes campaigns on health-related policy issues. CEGSS purposely maintains a low profile to lower the risk of government officials using the argument of “civil society manipulating poor and marginalized communities” to discredit accountability demands. In addition, community representatives are empowered and learn how to navigate the state apparatus. Whereas other CSOs working on accountability are constantly subject to government attacks on their basic credibility, CEGSS usually is not. We believe that this is partially the result of the strategy described above.

In the past two decades, many elected Guatemalan officials have emerged from CSOs that are active in the media and development realms. Some of those officials clearly used civil society as a launch pad for their political careers. After they were elected, the organizations they left behind often lost credibility and faded away. Politicians have used this phenomenon to accuse all CSOs of being political projects in disguise. Taking this concern into account, CEGSS has never used the problems facing indigenous populations, such as exclusion, poverty, and racism, as a platform to launch the political career of CEGSS members. We also do not take sides or align with any political party during election campaigns.

Lastly, CEGSS strives to “walk the talk” when it comes to our work with indigenous communities. Currently, half of our staff is of indigenous origin. Every year, we carry out a national assembly that includes the whole CEGSS team and representatives from all thirty-five municipalities where we work. Together, we review successes, failures, and future plans. Our effort to include our local partners in our planning, monitoring, and evaluation process also contributes to our local legitimacy.

Of course, our approach also involves some trade-offs. For example, by choosing not to receive any Guatemalan public funding, CEGSS has ended up 100 percent dependent on international grants. Some public officials and media outlets have accused other organizations receiving international funding of political bias. So far, this has not happened to CEGSS, possibly owing to our strategy of keeping a low organizational profile and uplifting the role of mobilized communities instead. As the municipalities we support make progress in their demands for greater transparency and accountability, we anticipate that CEGSS will face greater public scrutiny. However, we are convinced that the local legitimacy we have built with indigenous communities will help us to confront any negative campaigns.

The need to compete for international grants is another major burden on senior staff as well as a constant challenge to organizational stability. We are currently discussing new funding strategies that may include seeking donations from urban, middle-class professionals to support the health accountability demands of rural indigenous populations. This could take the form of a campaign through which better-off citizens can support the efforts of worse-off populations to exercise their rights as citizens. However, moving toward such funding strategy also means making CEGSS highly visible, which would be a clear departure from our strategies to date. The likelihood that CEGSS will deploy these alternative strategies for funding and implementing our activities will depend to a large extent on whether and how civic space in Guatemala continues to close.

Pushing Back: Lessons From Civic Activism in Uganda

Arthur Larok

On September 20, 2017, Ugandan security officials launched an unprecedented raid on the offices of ActionAid Uganda, a nationally registered antipoverty and human rights nongovernmental organization (NGO) affiliated with a global federation working in forty-six countries. The siege lasted two full days. Officials cordoned off the offices and confiscated laptops, personal mobile phones, and several organizational documents. Two weeks later, the Bank of Uganda froze ActionAid’s bank accounts, having received allegations from the Criminal Investigations Department that ActionAid was being investigated for money laundering and conspiracy to commit a felony.

The attack on ActionAid Uganda was part of a wider crackdown on legitimate citizen protests against ongoing efforts to remove the presidential age limit from the Ugandan Constitution—a move that would allow sitting President Yoweri Museveni to remain in power indefinitely. The cordon-and-search operation was clearly aimed at delegitimizing ActionAid’s work by framing it as dangerous and subversive. It was followed by a relentless propaganda campaign, including by the government spokesperson and the head of Uganda’s media center, accusing ActionAid and several other civil society organizations of being agents of imperialism.

Three months after the attack, ActionAid Uganda took the Finance Intelligence Authority, under whose instruction ActionAid Uganda’s bank accounts remained blocked,1 to court. These legal efforts proved successful: on December 23, 2017, even before the end of the court case, the Finance Intelligence Authority decided to unfreeze ActionAid Uganda’s accounts. What happened between September 20 and December 23 is in many ways a story of effective pushback to an affront on civil society’s legitimacy.

What lessons can be drawn from ActionAid Uganda’s experience? What sources of legitimacy could ActionAid draw upon to achieve a turnaround? And what does this mean for its future work?

As noted by Saskia Brechenmacher and Thomas Carothers, civil society organizations draw their legitimacy from five major sources: who they are, what they do, how they do it, with whom, and what their impact is. In the case of ActionAid Uganda, our response to the attack on the organization’s legitimacy played out in the following ways.

To demonstrate one source of legitimacy, ActionAid drew on its track record of long-term, locally rooted programs with demonstrable impact on the communities that we work with. As we engaged the authorities in the aftermath of the raid, we drew officials’ attention to our many decades of development interventions in the education, health, agricultural, and other sectors. ActionAid’s legitimacy in this sense was based not only on its work challenging vested political elites, but also on its long-standing contributions in more traditional service delivery fields. This reality challenges the often sharp distinction made between traditional charity work and civil society advocacy on more systemic issues—our work proves that it is possible and productive to do both!

The organization’s second source of legitimacy was, somewhat surprisingly, its history of working with the same government that it was now up against. ActionAid’s approach to its projects—regardless of whether they involve working in rural communities responding to livelihood threats emanating from climate change, addressing gender-based violence, or even partnering with the Ugandan police to fight corruption—has always been to communicate and coordinate with government actors, even in some cases through memoranda of understanding with local governments. An attack on an organization that was open to and worked with the government turned out to be difficult to sustain.

Our third source of legitimacy was the partners we work with, and their understanding of and unrelenting support for our joint cause. ActionAid is well connected within Ugandan civil society. The attack on our work therefore attracted immense solidarity from peers and communities. A community- and partner-led petition to unfreeze ActionAid Uganda’s bank accounts generated more than 17,000 signatures from across the country in less than two weeks. On the day of the scheduled court hearing for ActionAid’s legal suit against the continued blocking of its accounts, 300 ordinary citizens and civil society leaders packed the courtroom and later marched through the capital to deliver a petition to the prime minister. This wider public support for our work represented an important source of legitimacy, as it showed that we had a strong local constituency.

Our efforts to remain cooperative and transparent throughout the process emerged as another key source of legitimacy. Throughout the siege and the police investigations, ActionAid offered as much information as was demanded. The organization’s aim was to prove that it had nothing to hide. It kept an open dialogue with the investigating agencies while retaining its right to explore other defense strategies, such as protesting and litigation.

The fifth and final source of legitimacy was the credibility of ActionAid Uganda’s leadership. Government officials repeatedly have accused civil society leaders of being opposition politicians in disguise, of being corrupt, and of receiving outside money to destabilize the country. However, these attempts to taint the civil society leaders’ image have largely failed to gain traction, mostly because the leaders are locally known and respected figures. Civil society organizations need credible leaders in order to build and maintain legitimacy in a context of shrinking civic space.

After four turbulent months, ActionAid Uganda has emerged as a stronger organization. We have a better understanding of how to operate in a difficult political landscape that requires civil society actors to be agile and adaptive. Above all, the ActionAid experience shows that civil society legitimacy comes from multiple sources—no single source is sufficient to withstand relentless efforts to delegitimize the sector.

Confronting Partisanship and Divisions in Kenya

Kimani Njogu

Kenya is often lauded for promulgating one of the world’s most liberal constitutions. Passed on August 27, 2010, it radically devolves power to county governments, ensures the separation of powers, and entrenches a progressive bill of rights. This would have been impossible without the work of robust, courageous, and independent civil society organizations (CSOs). Civic actors first laid down their recommendations for constitutional reform in the document “Kenya Tuitakayo” (The Kenya We Want), which became a crucial resource for the Constitution of Kenya Review Commission. After former president Daniel Arap Moi asked at a public rally what “Wanjiku”—a common name, meant to refer to ordinary Kenyans—could possibly know about constitution-making, civil society appropriated the term, popularized it, and turned it into an organizing symbol for the constitutional reform process.

Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, the legitimacy of Kenya’s civil society stemmed from its engagement with key issues that all citizens cared about. Following the liberalization of political space, CSOs undertook extensive civic education on basic rights and how public sector corruption affects citizens’ access to health, food, shelter, and education. They provided a link between citizens’ daily lives and the people who occupied leadership positions in government. Faith-based organizations offered sanctuary to those targeted by the state and used their platforms to speak about the need for political change.

Yet over the past ten years, the political climate has changed. A number of politicians have publicly questioned the legitimacy of CSOs, especially those engaged in governance and human rights. Some have referred to civil society as “evil society,” a label used to rationalize new restrictions on civic space. These attacks have their roots in the 2007–2008 electoral crisis. In the aftermath of the violence, CSOs worked closely with public institutions and international agencies to collect evidence against those suspected of having orchestrated unrest. When the International Criminal Court (ICC) indicted several senior political leaders, the latter used ethnic identity and nationalism to mobilize their followers to fight back. State functionaries accused CSOs of working with foreigners to undermine the sovereignty of the nation. Although the ICC later dropped the cases, the “foreign agent” label stuck. It has undermined CSOs’ relationship with the wider population and weakened their claims to legitimacy. Political elites’ incessant instrumentalization of ethnic identity has further exacerbated the problem. They have tried to paint civil society as ethnically biased in order to erode public trust in their positions. As a result, it has become harder for civic actors carry out their work.

Kenyan CSOs also have been tainted by the perception that they are partisan political actors. This perception is particularly damaging in a context of high ethnic polarization where oversight institutions are weak. During the 2013 and 2017 presidential elections, the incumbent government accused some civil society actors of siding with particular opposition candidates and political parties. This perception stemmed from the fact that parts of civil society voiced their opposition to politicians who had previously been indicted for crimes against humanity by the ICC and who were viewed as intolerant to the civil liberties enshrined in the constitution.

Perceptions of partisanship have not only alienated some civil society stakeholders but also fostered ideological divisions within civil society. Of particular concern, for example, are tensions over electoral justice between development and peace-building groups on the one hand and human rights organizations on the other. Whereas the latter emphasize that electoral justice is essential for sustainable peace, the former have argued that in a highly polarized nation like Kenya, electoral justice can only be realized in a stable, calm, and nonviolent atmosphere. The fact that some human rights actors have used labels such as “peace-preneurs” to categorize organizations working to prevent election-related violence does not help build the legitimacy of the sector. Instead, divisions among CSOs only serve as fodder for attacks by the political elite.

In the current hostile political context, public officials have also exploited administrative rules to crack down on civil society. As a result, it has also become crucial for all organizations to ensure they are properly registered and meet all statutory requirements. In August 2017, for example, the NGO Coordination Board set out to deregister the Kenya Human Rights Commission. It also instructed the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to shut down the operations of the African Centre for Open Governance (Africog) for allegedly operating without a registration certificate. Individuals from the Kenya Revenue Authority raided Africog’s offices over clams of tax noncompliance. Although these allegations were later debunked through the judicial process, it is noteworthy that the state had launched the attack based on alleged noncompliance with legal and regulatory processes. Kenya has hundreds of community-based organizations that generally are viewed as highly legitimate because they are known by their immediate constituencies, from the household to the village. They speak the language of their communities and undertake activities viewed as local priorities. These organizations can easily lose their legitimacy if they are no longer viewed as accountable and transparent in their work.

Kenyan CSOs face a delicate balancing act as they try to build legitimacy while facing continuous attacks by the state. To survive, they should continue to demand accountability in the use of public resources by leaders and public officials. Internally, they ought to build governance and monitoring and evaluation systems that enhance their transparency and advance their mission. They also have to engage with the issues that directly affect their constituencies. When the state seeks to limit civic space, our stakeholders in the communities we serve ought to be our first line of defense.

Delegitimizing Civil Society in Tunisia

Youssef Cherif

To address the legitimacy of civil society organizations (CSOs) in non-Western contexts such as Tunisia, two major factors must be taken into account. The first is the pervasive willingness of ruling elites to crush dissident voices and curb civil society oversight of their work. The second is the intrinsic weaknesses of most CSOs, which often make them easy targets for detractors.

A Hostile Context

Tunisia has long had civil society in different forms, including the network of trade unions that won the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize for their prodemocracy work. But in the decades of dictatorial rule before the popular uprising that ousted president Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in early 2011, the government co-opted most civic organizations and prevented them from working in fields that it considered politically sensitive. Thus, while thousands of civic organizations existed, they were usually government-affiliated, with a reputation for corruption, nepotism, and progovernment zeal.

After the 2011 uprising and the start of the attempted democratic transition, activists launched large numbers of new, genuinely independent CSOs, often with the support of foreign donors and mentors. Many of these new groups aimed to tackle human rights issues, security sector reform, civil-military relations, and other systemic problems. Some remained small and operated with limited reach, while others gained national and international profiles.

Nevertheless, the Tunisian public, still influenced by years of government propaganda about the supposed evils of foreign-funded CSOs as corrupt, decadent agents of the United States, Israel, and other hostile powers, has met this burgeoning set of new groups with skepticism. And even though the new Tunisian leaders initially welcomed foreign donors and organizations seeking to support the transition process, large segments of the bureaucratic “establishment”—namely, the hundreds of thousands of public sector employees who kept their posts after the fall of Ben Ali—resisted this trend.

The terrain therefore remains fertile for political actors to sow distrust about civil society. Since 2011, each government has responded to civil society criticism with attacks against these groups, or has relied on government-affiliated media and social media outlets to attack civil society as well. This trend has intensified, as the economic crisis has increasingly tarnished the image of democracy—and, by extension, civil society—in the eyes of many Tunisians.

Tunisian civil society now is stuck between a hostile bureaucracy, a suspicious security sector, a skeptical population, and an irritated government. In many cases, it is simply the weakest foe that the “system” can attack. The shifting tide of the international context toward increased authoritarianism and nationalism, as well as Tunisia’s own faltering economy, have only fueled these attacks on independent civil society.2

Weak Spots

But critiques of Tunisia’s civil society are not completely unfounded. Foreign funding is a real issue. At the end of the day, these are Tunisian organizations working for the Tunisian people with Tunisian teams, but they owe their continued existence to foreigners’ money. This state of affairs cannot easily be explained to the general public, in part (as noted above) because of the suspicions fostered by years of autocratic rule. When asked about foreign funding to local CSOs, Tunisians often reply with a popular saying: “No cat hunts for God’s benefit”—that is, nothing comes for free. Even though only a handful of local funders are willing to sponsor CSOs, and these funders usually ask for something in return when they do so, some domestic funding sources do exist, be it philanthropists, local foundations, and other private sector funders. But many Tunisian groups have gotten used to the far more generous funds they can raise from foreign donors. Their heightened expectations lead them to favor foreign donors over potential local supporters.

Some foreign-funded organizations have also damaged their credibility through wasteful spending. Grants paid out in foreign currency typically are significant amounts of money once converted to Tunisian dinars. CSOs frequently must spend this money in a short period of time, which leads them to throw useless conferences in fancy hotels. An influential Tunisian activist is known for cracking jokes about the “pauses cafés” (coffee breaks) that CSOs are now famous for organizing, and which for many participants seem to be the most important part of a conference. Additionally, some CSO members—who are dubbed activists but often are well-paid consultants or staff members—do not shy away from showing off their newly acquired “wealth.” Some younger CSO workers, for instance, use their Facebook or Instagram profiles to promote themselves and to show off their travels, new clothes or laptops, and other signs of lavish living.

Lastly, the issues that some of these newer CSOs tackle, as well as the methods used to do so, also contribute to their estrangement from the wider public. Because CSOs already are perceived as foreign entities with little connection to their people, those that debate culturally sensitive issues such as homosexuality or drug use, using primarily Western idioms and strategies, are easily dismissed as an elitist, Westernized minority. Either their intentions are misunderstood, or their work backfires.

Solutions

In all likelihood, political efforts to delegitimize civil society in Tunisia will continue for years to come. To counter this trend, we need to continue raising awareness about the importance of civil society and how it works, in parallel to supporting democracy and human rights in the country. And although the criticisms of CSO members’ misbehavior may on occasion be legitimate, unfounded conspiracy theories and false claims should be openly confronted.

A number of young activists have tried to do this by systematically mocking CSO-related clichés, be it on their own Facebook profiles and pages or by commenting with fake self-criticism on the usual inflammatory anti-CSO posts. These types of efforts should continue, coupled with sustained campaigns to debunk conspiracy theories and myths surrounding CSOs and promote democracy. Nevertheless, CSO members also need to address the criticism they receive and change their behavior accordingly.

Closing space for civil society is not a uniquely Tunisian phenomenon, but a global trend. Members of the international community that still support democracy around the globe need to adjust their ways of working accordingly. Aid, first of all, should be well coordinated to avoid duplication. CSO funding should be audited more frequently, and projects need to be customized to a local audience. There should also be greater flexibility in project timelines to ensure that they match local realities rather than the demands of the donor country. Such initial steps would help ensure greater civil society sustainability.

The Legitimacy Deficit of Thailand’s Civil Society

Janjira Sombatpoonsiri

Thailand’s civil society has been fragmented by the country’s protracted political conflicts and high levels of polarization. Traditional elites have used this fragmentation to further attack civil society’s legitimacy. Overcoming this crisis of legitimacy will require civil society actors to build a political vision that cuts across the main sociopolitical divide.

Traditionally, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) advocating for community development, sustainable growth, and equitable resource distribution formed the core of Thai civil society. However, during the 1990s, many new prodemocracy and rights-based civic groups with a more urban support base, as well as nonstate religious organizations, emerged on the scene. These groups came together around the 1992 mass demonstrations against military rule that paved the way for democratization. They gained legitimacy from a shared political vision that brought together an incredibly diverse range of actors.

Yet in the years that followed, Thai civil society suffered from several weaknesses. Some groups pursued single-issue-based campaigns that were blind to the intersections of different social problems. Many competed for resources and prestige rather than cooperating with each other, and a number of organizations lost their political independence by relying on state funding. Others adopted a patronizing stance toward grassroots communities and became increasingly detached from the changing needs of rural populations, which organized instead into bottom-up social movements. Efforts to address these shortcomings remained limited. Together with Thai society’s authoritarian political culture, which views NGOs’ contentious politics as a driver of political instability, this failure to self-reflect reduced the legitimacy of NGOs in the public eye.

Thailand’s recent political conflicts have exacerbated this trend. These conflicts generally pit the old elites (the palace, army, and allied businesses) and their Bangkok-based, middle-class supporters against democratically elected yet autocratic-leaning leaders and rural constituents who seek greater equality through electoral representation. The former—who have come to be known as the “yellow shirts”—view representative democracy as an existential threat to the feudal order and as a source of moral corruption. The latter—known as the “red shirts”—emphasize elections as the only game in town.

When the red shirt–backed government of then prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra turned increasingly autocratic in the early 2000s, union activists and development NGOs sided with traditional elites in an attempt to “cleanse” Thai politics. In 2006, this coalition gave rise to a palace-endorsed army coup that overthrew the democratically elected Thaksin government. Prodemocracy NGOs, rights advocates, and progressive academics felt betrayed by the undemocratic stance of their fellow civil society activists. Many became active supporters of the red shirt movement. As a result, civil society became increasingly polarized around two ostensibly opposing visions of Thailand’s political future: undemocratic but “clean” (noncorrupt) governance versus electoral but possibly illiberal democracy. Unlike in the 1990s, when different segments of civil society shared a common political dream, these two camps came to epitomize different moral crusades, unwilling to find common ground.

After several years of impasse, the 2014 coup was a wake-up call for many civil society groups. Traditional elites exploited high levels of societal polarization to topple yet another red shirt–backed government. They did so by orchestrating mass demonstrations buttressed by some segments of civil society. Nationwide protests paralyzed the government and generated public fears that the country was on the brink of civil war. Claiming to restore security and order, the junta then took over and set in motion a swift crackdown on dissidents, targeting even those who had supported their takeover.

All the same, this crackdown proved insufficient to bridge the deep divisions within civil society. Civil society groups critical of the autocratic and corrupt tendencies of the red shirts’ political leadership do not respect the latter’s calls for electoral democracy. Meanwhile, the prodemocracy movement deeply mistrusts those organizations that were sympathetic to the military coup, which they view as a clear violation of the “one man, one vote” principle. Certain development NGOs’ patronizing stance toward rural communities does not ease this already conflictual relationship.

Thailand’s civil society is thus divided into two camps, and each side considers the other to be illegitimate. This polarization makes it difficult for civil society groups to form broad-based coalitions that would be powerful enough to counterweigh the state. Instead, the junta and its associates have been able to present themselves as the only unifying entity that can effectively advance citizens’ well-being. The junta has also appropriated civil society spaces by redefining the term “civil society” (pracha-sangkhom in Thai) as “state-society” (pracha-rat)—which implies that citizens are supposed to follow and obey the state, without an autonomous sphere of organization.

Yet there is still some hope to rebuild the legitimacy of Thailand’s civil society. First and foremost, each side needs to recognize the others’ grievances as legitimate. Both of their opposing visions—clean politics without democracy and electoral democracy without checks and balances—have serious flaws. Second, in a divided Thailand, different civic groups need to come together and formulate an alternative political vision that lays out specific ways to overcome these flaws. The ruling junta will continue to lose popular support—but without a competing political narrative, it can conveniently cling to power by pointing to the lack of alternatives.

Any such political vision would need to guarantee the principle of electoral representation and equal life chances for all citizens. However, it must also assure Thailand’s anxious middle class and elite interest groups that majoritarian rule can be counterbalanced through democratic means rather than through authoritarian channels. Finally, linking this narrative to Buddhist teachings and Thai national myths could help immunize democracy against xenophobic critiques of its Western origins. “Vernacularizing” democracy would not only ensure greater popular legitimacy by increasing local ownership but could also help bolster civil society legitimacy amid the authoritarian tendencies of Thai political culture.

Such a broad-based coalition and shared political vision will be particularly crucial ahead of the upcoming election. If any such coalition succeeds at restoring meaningful democratic governance, it can push back against the regulations and constitutional clauses that the junta has enacted to undermine civil society. By reclaiming civil society spaces, civic groups will be able to reverse the authoritarian relationship between state and society that has been intensified by the military regime.

Navigating Politics and Polarization in Turkey

Özge Zihnioğlu

In Turkey, the public generally accepts the idea of civil society and views its actors positively. This is not to suggest that all civic actors are readily recognized for their work. On the contrary, building legitimacy for civil society and more specifically for advocacy groups presents many challenges.

First, a key determinant of the legitimacy of civic actors is the issues they work on. The Turkish public has a particular understanding of what civil society should do. People mainly associate civil society with philanthropy, relief work, and social services. The kinds of groups that initially come to peoples’ minds when they think of civil society are charities and humanitarian aid organizations. These groups enjoy relatively high levels of public support. They typically are seen as entities that should be active in areas that the government or official social welfare mechanisms cannot reach. In terms of public support, social service organizations and charities are followed by organizations working on environmental issues and education, although their approval ratings are lower.

Second, Turkish society does not necessarily feel that civil society organizations must be completely detached from the state. The links that civic organizations develop with public institutions often lend the former greater legitimacy in the public eye. Again, this is based on the widespread notion that civil society should complement rather than challenge the state. Although civic organizations across the ideological spectrum can seek to enter into such partnerships, it naturally is easier for those ideologically closer to the government to do so. This discrepancy only reinforces the divide between civic organizations. However, there are certain risks to keeping close links with public institutions. With no legal framework for and no tradition of cooperation between the public sector and civil society, civic organizations are likely to benefit from indirect access and participation at best. In some cases, such links appear to be only for show, used by government actors to signal their openness to civil society without making any real changes.

Third, a major challenge for advocacy groups has been that most of the Turkish public believes that civil society should refrain from becoming politicized or acting ideologically. Any organization that challenges government policies and practices in its focus areas is considered to be doing politics and being political. These politicized organizations then attract criticism for abandoning the civic space and entering the zone of political parties. In the eyes of the public, these organizations serve specific interest groups, and therefore not only go beyond their organizational objectives but also lose their impartiality and legitimacy. Civil society organizations often take this sensitivity into account; even groups that work on political issues tend to emphasize that they are nonpolitical or seek to demonstrate that they are above party politics.



Finally, civil society’s legitimacy in Turkey cannot be considered without factoring in the highly polarized political environment, one in which all actors are divided into “us” and “them.” This polarization extends to civil society. Civic actors position themselves by setting themselves apart from other groups, often not recognizing one another’s legitimacy. Even in areas of shared interest, civil society organizations tend to position themselves in reference to the overarching axis of polarization and find it difficult to sit around the same table with those from the opposite pole. For example, all women’s organizations share the goal of improving girls’ education, but conservative and secular groups diverge over whether girls should be allowed to wear the veil in high schools. Conservative organizations argue that this option will increase girls’ schooling rate, whereas secular activists object that doing so will impede the same girls’ empowerment. Such ideological divides make effective cooperation difficult.

Together, these constraints on civil society allow the government to more easily dimiss and delegitimize unwelcome criticism. This is an uphill battle for advocacy groups in particular, as they challenge public policies or practices on a regular basis.

How can civic organizations build and defend their legitimacy in this fraught sociopolitical context? In Turkey, civic organizations draw their legitimacy primarily from their members or support base. For most advocacy groups, this is a limited part of the public. Building resilience against delegitimization thus requires these groups to reach a wider audience. Advocacy groups can take a number of steps to broaden their audience without losing sight of their core positions and values.

First, advocacy groups can focus on crosscutting problems that bring different segments of society together. Such an approach would encompass campaigns organized jointly by groups working in different policy areas. For instance, a recent campaign against the construction of a new hospital in Istanbul in a public land area brought together city planners, doctors, environmentalists, archaeologists, and the local community around a common cause.

Second, advocacy groups can reach out to divided constituencies. Unless civil society organizations from opposite ends of the national polarization axis recognize each other’s suffering, they cannot hope to win wider public support or counter the government’s delegitimization efforts. Of course, reaching out across the divide is easier said than done. Doing so effectively will require advocacy groups to reframe existing social and political problems in ways that open space for new alliances. To go back to the example of girls’ education, in the early 2000s, several groups took up the issue by framing it more as an extension of welfare services for deprived families, rather than as an effort aimed at women’s empowerment. This repositioning enabled different constituencies to come on board.

Such a modified approach will also require a better communication strategy for advocacy groups. Most civil society organizations in Turkey do not pay attention to how their work is perceived. Instead, communication currently often implies either relations with their own members, supporters, and the constituencies they aim to represent, or one-sided awareness-raising activities. To maximize their impact, advocacy groups should establish a long-term mutual dialogue with the parties they seek to persuade.

Finally, civil society organizations should not shy away from cooperating with business and the media. Effective advocacy often depends on gaining momentum. Stronger support by private sector actors along with media interest and coverage would strengthen advocacy groups’ hands. This strategy, of course, could risk triggering government backlash if civil society is seen as serving specific interest groups. However, such cooperation would nevertheless enable advocacy groups to better communicate their cause to a larger audience and make it more difficult for the government to dismiss their work.

Beyond Apathy and Mistrust: Defending Civic Activism in Hungary

Stefánia Kapronczay

“We are dealing with paid political activists. And in addition, these paid political activists are political activists who are being paid by foreigners.” These words from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s infamous “illiberal democracy” speech, delivered in Hungary in 2014, are crucial to understanding the ongoing crackdown on independent civil society organizations in Hungary. The key part of this excerpt, however, is not the reference to foreign funding (as often assumed), but to political activism.

The Hungarian government argues that independent human rights organizations have no legitimacy to influence public policies because they are not democratically elected. The implicit assumption is that only elected officials have the privilege of voicing opinions about public affairs. Foreign funding plays an important part in this critique. However, only a small subset of all Hungarian organizations receiving foreign support have been vilified in government-friendly media outlets—namely, those whose mission is to foster active citizenship and hold the government accountable. I believe that even if my organization, the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, were funded only by Hungarians, the current government would still target us as undesirable.

When discussing the sources of legitimacy for civil society organizations, I partially agree with our populist critics: we have to focus on what resonates with citizens.3 Instead of polishing the perfect counterargument to the government’s attacks, we need to focus on why these arguments are so effective. One of the main goals of the human rights movement is to empower people to represent their own interests and to demand answers from their political leaders. Understanding citizens’ concerns is thus not only a strategy to fight back against repression, but also a return to the very core of our mission. Understanding why governments’ attacks on civil society legitimacy resonate with ordinary people also helps us identify potential solutions rather than diagnosing the symptoms.

Despite being members of the European Union, Central European democracies are still relatively young. Until the end of Communist rule in 1989–1990, governments in these countries treated citizen participation in public affairs as undesirable meddling. Those who expressed their opinions publicly could expect surveillance, threats, and even arrests. The legacy of this era is still reflected in most people’s attitude toward active citizenship: it is viewed as having a finger in every pie and yet being futile at the same time. We also still witness low levels of trust in most institutions compared to Western European countries. This is particularly true for state institutions but also for corporations and civil society organizations. Citizens in the region often view their governments as corrupt and authoritarian, although most citizens who hold these opinions consider it to be business as usual.

To strengthen the legitimacy of human rights organizations in this context, we have to focus on explaining what “political activism” means and why it benefits most citizens. First, human rights organizations, especially those targeted by the government, represent the powerless. They regularly report on the situation of disenfranchised people, such as those in prisons, institutions for the disabled, and refugee camps, and those mired in deep poverty. Even if human rights groups do not have a broad membership, their field experience and relationships with grassroots partners provide them with unique insights into the situation of these vulnerable groups. Giving voice to viewpoints that are rarely represented in politics thus represents a core source of human rights organizations’ legitimacy. To strengthen the representation of these voices, organizations should be more transparent about how they collect their data and how the data shape their policy recommendations.

Through smart and innovative communication strategies, organizations also can show that their work is relevant to the majority. This is not to suggest that we should tailor our communications to the principles of populist politics. But human rights organizations should be able to demonstrate why human rights are beneficial for all people who are not in positions of power; why they also protect “someone like us.” They should educate the public about their values by tackling issues that affect a wider constituency, while not losing sight of the systemic problems that the human rights movement is meant to address. An important caveat is that vulnerable groups often do not enjoy the sympathy of the majority. A narrow focus on constituency-building can lead human rights organizations to neglect the interests of these marginalized groups.

Second, human rights organizations should emphasize the fact that they do not represent foreign values, but values that in most cases their own states adopted through sovereign decisions. For example, Hungarian groups arguing for compliance with international human rights law as codified in the European Convention on Human Rights are in fact arguing for compliance with laws agreed upon and implemented by the Hungarian state. This fact provides domestic legitimacy to organizations that are holding governments accountable to human rights and other international legal norms.

Lastly, the lack of sectoral equity can play an important role in fighting back against delegitimatization. In its 2017 position paper on foreign-funded nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), the government-funded think tank Századvég Foundation laid out the motivation behind the Hungarian Law on Transparency of Foreign-Funded Organizations, an anti-NGO law passed in 2017. This paper argued that it is important to register foreign-funded organizations because NGOs operate as de facto lobbyists. However, the anti-NGO law requires only foreign-funded civil society organizations to register with the government, fulfill stricter administrative criteria, and display the “foreign funding” label. The so-called Stop Soros legislative proposal, currently under public consultation, also targets only civil society organizations. Even though corporations and businesses also engage in lobbying activities and influence public policies while lacking electoral legitimacy, there has been no parallel legislation on lobbying in force in Hungary since 2012. This situation is not unique to Hungary: around the world, many governments unduly differentiate between businesses and civil society associations, imposing burdensome restrictions on the latter while failing to regulate the former. Arguing for equal treatment between NGOs and other organizations, like businesses, and greater overall transparency in the state decisionmaking processes could help diminish the lack of public trust in civil society so common in Central European societies.

On Our Own Behalf: The Legitimacy of Feminist Movements

Zohra Moosa

Mama Cash is the oldest international women’s fund, founded in the Netherlands in 1983. The feminist groups, organizations, and movements that we partner with are among those civic actors most vulnerable to repression—because of who is leading the work and because of the issues they address. We deliberately work with groups led by women, girls, and trans and intersex people. Moreover, our grantee-partners typically focus on issues that are critical for advancing social justice, but that are neglected or contested in their local contexts and insufficiently prioritized by other funders.

This combination of factors makes it particularly challenging for these groups to establish their legitimacy. They are unlikely to enjoy a wide base of support in either mainstream society or within social justice and human rights movements. Whereas other civil society actors may more easily band together in solidarity against attacks, our partners are often fighting to have their voices, issues, and agendas recognized as legitimate even within civil society.

Being Self-Led as a Source of Legitimacy

Yet these groups and movements do possess an important source of legitimacy: they are organized and led by people from the communities they seek to represent. This makes them powerful advocates: they are speaking for and about themselves, without mediation or interpretation by others. It is more difficult to dismiss a demand for change as illegitimate when it comes from those directly affected by the issue. Self-led groups and movements, even when marginalized from the mainstream, can credibly assert that they are experts on their own realities. Our partners often use the phrase “nothing about us, without us” to emphasize the importance of inclusion in achieving just and legitimate sociopolitical change.

We recently published research with fifteen partners exploring the strategies that they use to advance their agendas. We found that working with and from within their communities was vital for effecting change. Activists worked to deliberately build alliances within their contexts to demonstrate community support for their positions. They noted that their position as “insiders” has enabled them to leverage personal relationships and use culturally specific messaging. For example, they knew when and how to challenge restrictive social norms because they had been raised with the same narratives as those whose minds they were seeking to change.

Mama Cash’s legitimacy, meanwhile, stems from our identity as a women’s fund created by and for feminists. We maintain our legitimacy by engaging in open dialogue with and being accountable to feminist movements. We regularly solicit their feedback on how we can improve our work. Since 2014, for example, we have conducted a biannual survey of grantee-partners and grant applicants (through the Center for Effective Philanthropy), asking them to assess our practice as a feminist grantmaker and reporting what we have learned from this feedback. In 2017, we also reviewed our support to and engagement with other women’s funds, through interviews as well as an anonymous survey. We also actively seek to partner with diverse actors within and beyond exclusively feminist movements, which contributes to our identity as a recognized movement actor. In sum, our legitimacy derives, in part, from belonging to the movements we serve and taking accountability to them seriously.

Promoting Feminist Movements

Our recent efforts to bolster the legitimacy of feminist movements and women’s funds may offer some ideas for how to build the legitimacy of other parts of civil society in the eyes of the general public or specific institutional actors. Our approach consists of

resourcing self-led groups because we recognize their ideas as legitimate and believe that they should be funded,

documenting our partners’ realities and showing their (and our) track record of achievements,

pointing to external research that demonstrates the efficacy of self-led feminist advocacy, and

supporting governments and other donors to pilot new approaches to establish a track record.

First, we have made approximately €60 million in direct grants to self-led groups of women, girls, and trans and intersex people since we were founded. We are also encouraging other donors to make more and better funding available to support this type of work.

Second, we have documented the changes our partners are making on the ground and analyzed whether and how Mama Cash’s support contributes to their efforts.4 This review and analysis has allowed us to pinpoint the ways that our funding sustains the work of feminist groups, which in turn helps build our legitimacy.

Third, our efforts have been reinforced by external research showing that feminist movements are critical to enabling women’s empowerment. For example, based on data collected over four decades across seventy countries, we now know that autonomous feminist movements are the single most important variable in advancing policy change to tackle violence against women.

Finally, we push governments to pilot new approaches. For example, we supported the Dutch government in launching the Leading From the South Fund, which empowers a coalition of four women’s funds from the Global South to independently manage €40 million in Dutch aid designated for women’s rights. This previously untested model aims to establish women’s funds as legitimate, valuable partners in the eyes of other governments. The initiative will also seek to bolster the legitimacy of women’s funds from the Global South, including in their respective contexts.

Our approach thus consists of resourcing self-led actors, highlighting the value of their work, and supporting other stakeholders to engage them, too—while seeking direct feedback from our partners to ensure our work promotes their goals.

All for One, One for All: Protecting Sectoral Legitimacy

Nilda Bullain and Douglas Rutzen

The International Center for Not-for-Profit Law (ICNL) is different from many of the other organizations discussed in this collection. It is not a domestic nongovernmental organization (NGO) focused primarily on one country, but a transnational NGO, headquartered in the United States, that has worked in more than 100 countries around the world. Like any international organization, we had to work hard to establish our legitimacy with local stakeholders. Over the years, we have received feedback from our partners in civil society, government, academia, and other sectors that revealed what they see as the key sources of our legitimacy.

Prioritizing Local Capacity and Impact

Although there is certainly no magic bullet to defeat legitimacy attacks, a combination of institutional attributes and approaches has been crucial in supporting our position. The first is our accumulated expertise, drawn from detailed, in-depth research, knowledge production, and advocacy on civil society legal issues over the past twenty-five years. Second, our international character helps to defend us against challenges to our legitimacy: the members of our board and advisory council come from thirty-seven countries, and the vast majority of our staff come from the countries and regions in which they work. Third, we are careful not to act like a law firm advocating on behalf of a client, but rather as a values-based organization standing for principles rooted in international law, good practice, and practical experience. Fourth, our work on civil society issues in the United States, where we maintain a robust civic freedom program, helps strengthen our legitimacy to pursue international work, especially in today’s troubled U.S. political climate.

We have also thought carefully over the years about the question of local rootedness and legitimacy. Our aim is to support local capacity, not to supplant it by rooting ourselves in a particular country. As a result, we work in over 100 countries, but by design have relatively few offices on the ground. We want to institutionally constrain ourselves from leading local initiatives. Our goal is to help in-country stakeholders make fully informed decisions, not to impose our solutions. In short, we prioritize local relevance rather than local rootedness.

One of our toughest organizational dilemmas has been whether to formalize our constituency, specifically whether to institutionalize our partner network. Ultimately, we decided not to do this. Given that we focus on the legal environment for civil society, we have a wide range of allies in governments, parliaments, and judicial sectors who are helpful in achieving our mission. Many of these stakeholders told us that they would be prohibited from joining a civil society network. Some said that they would engage less as a result; others said that ICNL would undermine its honest-broker role and be viewed as a trade association if our network members were almost exclusively civil society organizations (CSOs). Accordingly, we had to make the difficult choice to sacrifice a possible formal constituency in order to enhance our impact.

The Limits of Local Constituency-Building

When it comes to civil society legitimacy more broadly, we often hear that the best way for a CSO to withstand legitimacy attacks is to develop a local constituency. According to this common theory of change, if the CSO comes under attack by the government or other hostile actors, the constituency will defend the organization, thereby ensuring adequate space for the CSO to operate. We agree that it is important for CSOs to develop strong constituencies and other sources of support. But we worry that this will not be a sufficient defense for many of our partners operating in hostile political contexts.

Illustrating this point, in November 2017, our Hungarian partners awoke to find their names blasted across newsstands. The cover of a government-friendly magazine showed a black flag of the self-proclaimed Islamic State. The words in the middle of the flag had been changed: instead of the Islamic State’s slogan, the flag contained the names of two Hungarian human rights organizations written in Arabic-style font. The magazine’s headline roared, “Fighters are coming to Europe.”

One of the CSOs named on the Islamic State flag was Migration Aid, an organization that grew out of a self-organized network of hundreds of volunteers during the 2015 refugee crisis and maintains a strong and active supporter base today. Despite having a genuine local constituency and deep domestic roots, Migration Aid is a regular target of the government’s propaganda campaign.

Or consider the environmental movement in Latin America, LGBTI groups in Africa, or Muslim-American charities in the United States. They all have vibrant, dedicated constituencies. Yet power-holders frequently disregard—or aim to trample—the interests of these constituencies.

Strengthening Sectors, Not Just Organizations

It is therefore crucial for concerned international and domestic actors to supplement efforts focused on bolstering the legitimacy and local rootedness of individual organizations with initiatives aimed at strengthening the legitimacy of a pluralistic civil society sector overall. This, of course, is a difficult task. A recent U.S. case helps illuminate one potential way forward.

In 2017, U.S. Congressman Ron DeSantis proposed an amendment to an appropriations bill that would have banned Islamic Relief Worldwide (IRW) from receiving any funding from the federal budget. The U.S. civil society sector collectively responded. Faith-based organizations, including Catholic Relief Services, American Jewish World Service, American Hindu World Service, and Mercy Corps, joined with other CSOs, including InterAction, One Campaign, and ICNL, to support IRW. In the end, nearly fifty of the world’s most prominent humanitarian relief and development groups voiced their opposition to the amendment, which they saw as threatening the sector as a whole. The amendment was defeated.

It would be interesting to extract lessons learned from this successful campaign, including the role of the Together Project and other civil society umbrella organizations in coalescing the sector around common values. It would also be useful to research and document other case studies from around the world where multiple actors within civil society work together to advance the rights of the sector as a whole.

Reaffirming the importance of freedom of association will be crucial to the success of such sectoral approaches. It is essential not to conflate good practice, such as not being dependent on foreign support, with legislative requirements, such as placing restrictions on foreign funding. International law enumerates narrow grounds to restrict civic actors’ freedom of association, and a lack of legitimacy is not one of these narrow grounds. This seems like an essential point to highlight as many governments use concerns about legitimacy as a pretext to impose constraints on civil society. We need to make sure that the sector’s important introspection about legitimacy does not inadvertently fuel further restrictions on citizens’ right to freedom of assembly and association.

The Legitimacy Menu

Saskia Brechenmacher and Thomas Carothers

As the different contributors make clear, the closing space for civil society presents a minefield of legitimacy challenges. Governments hostile to independent civic groups have become experts in sowing public doubts about civic actors’ identities and agendas while squeezing them with legal and regulatory restrictions and informal but punishing methods of harassment. They are able to use the global rekindling of nationalist sovereignty and renewed emphasis on traditional values to paint in dark colors civil society organizations’ reliance on an international framework of rights and norms and the contributions they receive from international funding partners.

In most newly democratic countries, as well as ones still gripped by authoritarian leadership, citizens start from a natural skepticism about civil society advocacy. They welcome charity and service delivery work, but perceive civic groups that engage in governance and policy issues as part of the dirty terrain of partisan politics. Government efforts to portray civil society as pursuing subversive geopolitical or oppositional agendas without electoral accountability only add fuel to the fire. Civil society actors face the dual challenge of having to defend their right to engage on political issues while fending off accusations of being partisan actors in disguise.

The rising political and societal polarization in many countries, often reproduced within civil society itself, complicates efforts by civic actors to build broad coalitions for change. Civic actors in deeply divided societies often struggle to overcome mutual mistrust, even on crosscutting issues and concerns. As a result, they fail to form a strong countervailing force to government abuses. Governments in turn can exploit cleavages within civil society to delegitimize challengers, co-opt others, and pit different factions against each other. In a context of mistrust and fear, it becomes easier to discredit critical voices as somehow inauthentic or illegitimate because of their identity, international ties, or alleged ulterior motives.

Civil society organizations navigating these uncertain waters have to balance different legitimacy risks in every element of what they do and how they do it. This is especially true with respect to funding. Receiving foreign funding can play into government narratives of foreign subversion and reinforce public mistrust. Within civil society, competition for resources and prestige often impedes effective cooperation. Yet accepting public funding can also jeopardize organizations’ independence and reputation. Moreover, it is often unclear whether foregoing international support would necessarily protect civic activists from attacks, or whether the attacks simply would take a different form.

Approaches to Building Civil Society Legitimacy

How can civic actors build and defend their legitimacy in this challenging political context? What sources of legitimacy can they draw on, and what approaches have proven most effective at countering government narratives and building public support?

The contributors to this collection offer a varied picture of the challenges to the legitimacy of civic actors. Many context- and capacity-related factors shape the sources of legitimacy that civic groups can draw on and build for themselves. Yet despite considerable variation, a number of recurring themes suggest a core set of “legitimacy sources” that organizations can cultivate and highlight, as well as specific strategies to strengthen both individual organizations and the civic sector as a whole.

First, legitimacy for civic groups can stem from who they are: their basic identity as societal actors. Groups can bolster their identity-based legitimacy in several ways:

Practicing direct representation: A key theme of the contributions is that organizations based in and led by the communities they seek to represent are often more difficult to dismiss as illegitimate than those that advocate on behalf of others. They can speak directly and expertly about their own realities, and thus cannot easily be discredited as ignorant or as having an ulterior agenda. They also tend to have in-depth knowledge about the attitudes and norms among the wider communities they need to win over, and the messages that are most likely to be effective. Of course, local rootedness is not necessarily a sufficient defense in hostile political contexts: from Central Europe to Latin America, locally driven movements with active support networks have faced sustained repression.

Cultivating ethical leadership: Identity also matters for civil society organizations that are not based in or represent one specific constituency. Activists who enjoy local credibility and respect are much better positioned to fend off government attempts to taint their image. Conversely, wasteful spending, extravagant lifestyles, and other behaviors that set civic leaders apart from the communities they seek to represent can damage their image as serious drivers of political change.

Shaping counternarratives: Civil society groups should try to address conspiracy theories and rumors that misrepresent their identity head-on. Humor may be an effective way of debunking some of the myths surrounding civil society, as Tunisian activists have tried to do online. Other contributors have suggested highlighting inconsistencies in government attitudes toward civil society advocacy versus private sector lobbying: the latter is often poorly regulated and nontransparent, while restrictions only apply to civic groups. Similarly, civic activists accused of pursuing foreign agendas can stress that they represent norms that governments themselves have signed up to and which are, in most cases, embedded in domestic legal frameworks.

Second, civic organizations’ legitimacy is shaped by what they do; namely, the issues that they work on. Organizations can shape their thematic focus and expertise to bolster their legitimacy in the following ways:

Ensuring local relevance: Several contributors emphasize the need for civic actors to work on issues that directly impact people’s lives. Rather than only focusing on responses to government smear campaigns, civic actors should seek to understand and tackle the root causes of citizen discontent, and demonstrate why their work is relevant to ordinary citizens. In some cases, this approach may mean reframing specific social or political causes in ways that are more locally resonant or culturally appropriate, rather than simply adopting international frameworks and discourse.

Giving voice to the powerless: At the same time, not all civic actors work on issues that have majority appeal. In fact, their legitimacy may stem from giving voice to marginalized issues and groups that otherwise are excluded from the political sphere—provided that, as noted above, they build on and cultivate genuine linkages to the communities they seek to represent.

Having a diverse portfolio: In some cases, working on service delivery or other more “palatable” issues can give civil society organizations space to address more politically difficult topics. For example, combining traditional development work with advocacy can lend added legitimacy: it allows organizations to point to concrete achievements they have helped to produce in areas such as health, education, or agriculture. In the case of the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law (ICNL), having a U.S.-focused advocacy and research program gives the organization a stronger basis to engage in similar work abroad. Of course, having a diverse portfolio can also mean having to reconcile competing objectives: for example, groups like Dejusticia in Colombia that engage in both research and advocacy have to balance different legitimacy expectations for different areas of their work.

Third, civil society organizations also accrue legitimacy based on how they do their work. Three core principles stand out:

Strengthening downward accountability: Even civic organizations that did not emerge as grassroots actors can prioritize local capacity-building to enable their key constituencies to advocate for themselves, rather than speaking on their behalf. Such an approach, if applicable, helps to ensure that their efforts have popular buy-in, and makes it harder for governments to dismiss demands for change. For example, ICNL has specifically chosen not to have local offices in the countries where it works to avoid hijacking local initiatives. In Guatemala, the Center for the Study of Equity and Governance in Health Systems similarly found that lobbying the government on behalf of indigenous communities quickly backfired. The organization has since moved toward providing lower-profile support for indigenous activist networks. Taking local legitimacy seriously can also mean fostering strong downward accountability mechanisms, whether by involving constituencies in key organizational decisions or regularly soliciting feedback from stakeholders and partners.

Maintaining political independence: Advocacy work is of course inherently political. Yet as noted above, perceptions of partisanship can easily undercut an organization’s legitimacy in the eyes of the public, particularly in polarized contexts. Potential mechanisms to avoid accusations that political work is partisan work include embedding advocacy in international or domestic legal principles, eschewing government funding, not taking sides in election campaigns, and refraining from using nongovernmental organizations as launch pads for political careers. Groups can also try to explicitly bridge political divides by fostering campaigns around crosscutting issues and reaching out to new allies—a strategy discussed in greater detail below.

Ensuring transparency about objectives and methods: Although government restrictions can naturally push organizations to work under the radar, several contributors highlight the importance of organizational transparency to preempt potential attacks. Financial and operational transparency—“bringing your own house in order”—can help counteract government accusations of corruption or subversion, and build public trust by showing that an organization and its members have nothing to hide.

Fourth, civic organizations draw legitimacy from those with whom they work, whether this includes other civil society actors, allies in related sectors, or even government officials and institutions. Many contributors highlight the importance of fostering broader alliances within civil society and bridging existing divisions to build more countervailing power, such as in the following ways.

Investing in sectoral cohesion: Long-term partnerships and alliances within society allow civic groups to expand their support base and tap into each other’s networks and expertise. Strong coalitions and a sense of solidarity within civil society can also help push back against attacks on individual organizations or the sector as a whole. For example, in the United States, a broad coalition of humanitarian aid organizations rallied behind Islamic Relief Worldwide after the latter was threatened in Congress. Activists therefore should not only consider the legitimacy of their own organizations but also join forces to build public support for associational freedom as a core political right.

Bridging societal divides: In polarized political contexts like Kenya, Thailand, and Turkey, building stronger alliances may require explicitly reaching out to partners across the divide. As a first step, this will require recognizing each other’s grievances and concerns as legitimate, and being open to reframing issues and causes in ways that ensure broader buy-in. Another potential avenue forward may be to focus on crosscutting issues that bridge existing axes of polarization.

Finding new allies: Civic actors can try to build public support by finding new allies in the media or private sector that can disseminate their message in novel ways. They can also invest in communications to show the relevance of their work to a broader audience. This approach will require them to show why their work should matter to ordinary citizens, thereby moving beyond one-sided awareness-raising activities toward a more sustained dialogue with those parties they seek to persuade. Nevertheless, there can be real tensions between trying to grow a wider constituency and sticking to a core mission or maintaining a low organizational profile, and groups have to carefully navigate potential trade-offs.

Building partnerships within government: In some contexts, good working relations and a history of collaboration with state institutions can be another important source of civil society legitimacy. In Uganda, for example, ActionAid’s past experience of working with the government on development issues made it more difficult for state actors to frame the group as dangerous and subversive. In Turkey, the public often views organizations that work closely with the state as more legitimate and effective than those that try to preserve their autonomy. Yet in many contexts, collaborating with state actors is practically impossible for civic organizations that are not ideologically aligned with the government—or entails high risks of cooptation and instrumentalization.

Finally, civil society organizations build legitimacy based on what impact they have and what they achieve. Several contributors have pointed to their track record of successful advocacy as well as their accumulated subject matter expertise as key sources of legitimacy, both in the eyes of local partners and of government actors and funders they are trying to influence. Mama Cash, for example, purposefully invested in research examining the local impact of their work, and leveraged external research to underscore the importance of its core mission. International organizations like ICNL have built up their reputation and access based on years of knowledge production, best-practice development, and legal advisory work. Of course, effective advocacy and coalition-building can also make organizations more of a target, particularly if their work goes against core political and economic interests. In such contexts, strong support networks within civil society and allies in other sectors will be particularly important.

In sum, multiple strategies exist for civic actors seeking to build legitimacy or defend it in the face of attacks by hostile governments or other actors. Not all of the strategies are available or feasible in every context. None of the available strategies is a silver bullet. But it is important for all civic actors to assess their legitimacy vulnerabilities carefully and think through the full range of possible actions they can take either to build legitimacy before attacks come or to respond effectively if attacks are already underway. Given that the punishing global wave of attacks on civil society legitimacy grows out of larger changes in power relations and patterns of domestic governance that are likely to define the international landscape for the foreseeable future, the legitimacy challenge is here to stay. In some contexts, the forces arrayed against civil society are overwhelming. Yet as the contributions here highlight, even under adverse circumstances, thoughtful approaches and hard work can make a positive difference.

The April 9 arrest of Santrich, a top figure of the now largely demobilized Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC), was the result of the United States charging him with drug trafficking crimes.

US officials have said that Santrich’s involvement in the drug trade extended beyond the signing of a November 2016 peace deal between the FARC and the Colombian government, which would make him ineligible for the agreement’s provisions that protect former guerrillas from extradition.

The high-profile arrest raised concerns about the future of the peace process, especially after reports soon emerged that the United States had launched a drug trafficking investigation against another top FARC member, Luciano Marín Arango, better known as “Iván Márquez” — who, like Santrich, was set to take one of the seats in Colombia’s Congress allotted to the FARC’s new political party as part of the peace accord.

These developments have generated disputes within the FARC political party, questions around the role of the transitional justice and, probably more importantly, the future of the peace process as a whole.

InSight Crime Senior Investigator and Colombia expert Ángela Olaya explains some of these issues in more detail as Colombia debates how justice should be delivered in the country.

InSight Crime (IC): What are the main developments in the investigation around Jesús Santrich and how will they affect the peace process?

Ángela Olaya (AO): The capture of Jesús Santrich reveals all the difficulties of the peace accord. His case illustrates how there is still a strong drug trafficking dynamic in Colombia and how there are actors that are interested in keeping this dynamic strong. The state should act quickly and agree upon what are the processes to deal with his case and decide how the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (Jurisdicción Especial para la Paz – JEP) should act in coordination with the Attorney General’s Office, so that the government can continue fighting organized crime in Colombia.

In the past couple of weeks, we have seen the JEP and the Attorney General debate over which entity has the authority to oversee Santrich’s extradition process. In their latest statement, the JEP — which oversees crimes committed before December 1, 2016 — said the extradition process should be stopped until a decision can be reached as to whether Santrich continued committing crimes after the peace accord was signed.

The Attorney General, on the other hand, is claiming the JEP does not have the jurisdiction to authorize whether or not Santrich will be extradited to the United States. For many years in Colombia, there has been a saying about “train wrecks.” It was often used to describe the interactions between other institutions in the government but it applies to the current situation. We are seeing a budding competition between ordinary justice and transitional justice.

IC: Who is Jesús Santrich, both as a member of the demobilized FARC guerrillas and now as a member of the new FARC political party?

AO: The case of Jesús Santrich is complex. He had a very important role inside the FARC and had a large influence over the peace negotiations. In the FARC, Santrich was part of “Carribean Bloc,” which controlled guerilla operations in northern Colombia. While in charge, Santrich was responsible for establishing the FARC’s political guidelines. Therefore the fact that he has been accused of drug trafficking during this period of transitional justice illustrates the challenges the new FARC will face as a political movement. Ultimately, the FARC as a demobilized political party needs to clarify its platforms on crucial themes such as drug trafficking and the new dynamics of organized crime.

IC: What do you think is going to happen to the peace process, considering Santrich represented the old FARC and now is a member of the new FARC?

AO: The key issue here is the rule of law. The question of how the JEP will function in the future will depend on how the state resolves the case of Santrich and whether the processes that were agreed upon during the peace negotiations will be maintained.

Ultimately, the Santrich case has demonstrated that the state has not ensured a safe future for all in Colombia. In addition, two important aspects of the peace accord hang in the balance: the development of productive projects and ensuring the security of ex-combatants.

Regarding the recent killings of ex-combatants, the government has yet to provide the public with a clear explanation for the recent violence. The current political context has cast doubt on whether the state can guarantee the protection of ex-combatants.

IC: This week, President Santos expressed his concern over the recent murders of former FARC members and assured the public he would guarantee the protection of ex-combatants. Would you agree that Santos sees these killings as a crucial obstacle to the peace process?

AO: Absolutely. In the southern region where many of these ex-combatants have been killed, we have seen other instances of violence between criminal groups as they vie for control over the FARC’s former drug trafficking routes. Many people in Colombia have grown frustrated with the Santrich case and are saying that if he committed the crime we should let justice take its course. However, the debate is not about whether or not he should pay for the crime. The debate is about how are we going to guarantee each one of the agreements and how they can generate positive measures that will protect the livelihoods of ex-combatants and affected communities. Above all, the crux of this discussion is whether we can prevent the demobilization of the FARC from becoming an economic opportunity for other organized crime groups.

Since the 2011 revolution, Tunisia has taken several steps to devolve power from the highly centralized structures run by the Ben Ali family to the new, democratic central government and then from the executive to the parliament. Today, Tunisia faces the crucial task of shifting power from the national to the local level. This decentralization of power has the potential to address long-standing issues of dramatic regional disparity in the healthcare and education sectors, as well as in poverty and infrastructure.

The Opportunities of Decentralization

If done right, decentralization will empower local actors to make decisions regarding their municipalities and regions that lead to real changes for their constituents.

This could introduce a new political class, which would be outside the country’s traditionally dominant political parties and could provide more opportunities for women and youth to enter politics.

Decentralization should also improve service delivery at the local level—where poor performance since the 2011 revolution has resulted in mistrust between citizens and the state as well as low tax revenues.

Decentralization requires strong political will—from officials in the central government, who must willingly give up some of their own power and demonstrate their commitment to participatory governance at the local level; and from local officials who must build trust with their constituents, provide opportunities for citizen engagement, and prevent the re-creation of ineffective institutions at the local level.

What Can Be Done?

The national government should also provide adequate financial and human resources, including ensuring the distribution of tax revenue to the local level.

Civil society must continue to guard the democratic process. But it has an even more important role to play at the local level to encourage and ingrain a culture of participatory democracy by conducting an outreach campaign to the public regarding decentralization.

Additionally, donors should continue to fund e-government efforts, including the digitization of local government forms and processes, to create a one-stop shop for citizens to access municipal services and communicate with municipal officials.

Donors must also train and equip local officials based on best practices from around the globe.

Introduction

Tunisia’s May 6, 2018, municipal elections, the country’s first-ever democratic local elections, constitute an important step that will move the country closer toward fully consolidating its democratic transition. By democratically electing 7,200 local officials who will represent 350 municipalities, Tunisians will signal their commitment to democracy. But these elections are only one small piece of a much larger decentralization program, whose fate is uncertain. Elections will be meaningless without a strong legal framework for decentralization that clearly delineates power and responsibility between the national and local levels. The process will also require the political will to implement decentralization at both the national and local levels.

On paper, Tunisia has had local governance for some time, with municipal and regional authorities empowered to make some, albeit mostly administrative, decisions. However, the decentralization practiced since Tunisia’s independence in 1956 has been “just pure fiction” according to Tunisian scholar Neji Baccouche.1 In reality, the political system was highly centralized under both presidents Habib Bourguiba and Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, a “political choice which addressed the need of rebuilding a united state which was able to fight against an ancient tribal system,” as Baccouche put it.2 Most local authorities were appointed by the central state, and they reported to the feared Ministry of the Interior.

Local actors who exhibited any sort of political independence were summarily dealt with by a central state that retained authority to replace councils with their own handpicked officials. The official in charge of Tunisia’s post-2011 decentralization process, Mokhtar Hammami, explained it this way: “The main dilemma that we faced [when starting the decentralization process] was the dominance of the central system, which . . . turned [the municipalities] into dependent facilities and stripped them of their powers. [This centralization] created an expensive bureaucracy and distorted the image of the municipalities.”3 Additionally, regions and municipalities were created based largely on security concerns to divide problematic areas, and the division of territory was “used to impose the authority of the central state over the entire territory.” Thus, “many [regions] were created in exceptional circumstances regardless of development requirements.”4 Furthermore, “the role of municipalities was limited to classic services such as waste collection and urban planning. The vital services related to the basic needs of citizens, such as health and education, were outside their authority, which contributed to the weakening of municipalities and the lack of confidence in this structure.”5

Tunisia’s decentralization process has the potential to reinvigorate the democratic transition by empowering local actors, improving service delivery, injecting new energy and ideas into the policy process at the local level, and alleviating some pressure on the central government. But the process must provide long-term systemic changes to governance and fiscal authority as well as demonstrate short-term wins, particularly in the country’s traditionally disadvantaged interior regions. Decentralization’s success depends on it.

Goals and Benefits of Decentralization

Globally, decentralization is believed to have several positive effects, from increasing government efficiency and reducing corruption to improving the relationship between citizens and the state. Officials who are physically closer to the people and live among them can more easily identify their needs, leading to more efficient public services. This is a virtuous cycle in which better and more transparent service provision leads to higher tax collection rates, which in turn lead to more money in the coffers to provide even better services.6 As some scholars have noted, “Decentralization, and in particular devolution will plausibly improve accountability and governance by bringing government closer to the people.”7 And as Tunisian Minister of Local Affairs and the Environment Riadh Mouaker said, “Decentralization, if successful, will become the key driver of local development.”8

Decentralization also offers the opportunity to experiment and try out different policies. Because policy change is far easier at the local level and needs and resources vary by municipality, decentralization can allow policymakers to evaluate what types of programs and initiatives are most effective and where. Furthermore, national-level bureaucrats and politicians are often more risk-averse than their local-level counterparts; thus, local governments can be more creative in developing policy solutions to local issues. While not all creative solutions are successful, local officials may be more willing to try new ideas, which, if successful, could be replicated elsewhere.

Yet for decentralization to be successful, it requires a tremendous amount of preparation as well as certain institutional and psychological conditions.

Aside from the overarching plan of devolving administrative and financial power from the central state to the localities, Tunisia’s decentralization efforts have three other goals: to ensure a more equitable distribution of resources; to empower local actors to make decisions for their communities; and to improve service delivery across the country.

But for decentralization to be successful, it requires a tremendous amount of preparation as well as certain institutional and psychological conditions. The most important precondition is political will and vision, particularly from the central government. A central government that either attempts decentralization half-heartedly or actively undermines the process will produce failed policies.

In addition to a legal framework and the institutional structures aligned with the newly devolved functions, the decentralization program must be backed by significant financial and human resources at both the central and local levels. There must be some form of interbureaucratic management procedures to both ensure accountability and prevent a duplication of efforts. And there must be some form of societal dialogue—at the national and local levels—to invest the public in the process. The public, through civil society organizations and informal networks as well as direct participatory processes, plays a crucial role in providing oversight and accountability.

Distributing Resources Equitably

Currently, Tunisia suffers from dramatic regional disparities on virtually all indicators (see table 1). In 2013, eighteen municipalities (including Tunis and its suburbs of La Marsa, La Goulette, Sidi Bou Said, and Carthage) held 51 percent of the state’s municipal budget, while 246 municipalities held the remaining 49 percent.9 A study by the International Labor Organization in June 2017 found dramatic inequality in various regions when comparing the poverty rates, purchasing power, and quality and proximity of public services.10 In the Ben Ali regime’s final budget before it fell, 82 percent of state funds were dedicated to coastal areas, compared to only 18 percent for the interior.

Furthermore, in the past, more than 50 percent of the territory was “non-municipalized,” so that more than one-third of the country’s population lived outside of a municipal district and therefore had no ability to elect local officials.11 To ensure every citizen resides in a municipality, the government created eighty-six new municipalities and expanded the territory of several others. Additionally, one of the key pillars of Tunisia’s decentralization process is to correct regional disparities through the process of “positive discrimination.”12 This process is intended to provide for equitable (rather than equal) resource distribution (from state budget support to administrative and human resources) that will eventually level the playing field for all Tunisians, regardless of where they live.

Positive discrimination is enshrined in the 2014 constitution (in article 12), but it is not a new concept in Tunisia. Tax incentives and investment bonuses for regional development have been in place since the 1970s.13 However, the decentralization process is framed, in large part, as a way to sustainably correct the

Citizens in Tunisia’s traditionally marginalized regions hope that decentralization will bring more attention to their regions. As a civil society activist in Sidi Bouzid noted, as of early 2018 there are no national ministers or highly ranked officials from Sidi Bouzid.14 This contributes to the alienation and physical and psychological distance from the center. One resident of the Siliana Governorate, who is running in the municipal elections in the town of Kesra, said he is hopeful that decentralization will bring improvements to his town because “people will be elected who will respond to the needs and voices of citizens,” unlike the current officials who are inexperienced and take their direction from Tunis.15 The newly elected municipal council will likely have more legitimacy, he said, in part because the members are elected but also because they will “understand the reality of the region.”16 While decentralization will likely not correct the problem of having local interests represented at the national level in Tunis, it will provide the opportunity for Sidi Bouzid’s citizens to make decisions about Sidi Bouzid and Siliana’s citizens to make decisions about Siliana.

Residents of Kesra echoed the issue of visibility, hopeful that decentralization will provide them with the chance to show off their region to other Tunisians.17 Few Tunisians—let alone foreigners—are aware of Kesra, which is the highest elevated town in Tunisia and is home to tremendous biodiversity, historical sites, and tourism potential. While tourism increased in Kesra after the revolution, the tourism and agricultural sectors remain vastly underdeveloped.

The decentralization process is framed as a way to sustainably correct the long-standing regional disparities by prioritizing certain regions over others.

According to another candidate for local elections in Kesra, decentralization there has purely developmental goals.18 Siliana is one of the marginalized governorates of the country. Advocates for decentralization there hope it will increase economic development through better allocation of resources to the agricultural and tourism sectors. The candidate said he has a vision for how to improve the tourism industry, how to address pollution, and how to upgrade the town’s agricultural industry so it becomes an example for organic farming, but he needs financial resources and administrative and political independence to carry it out.19

Empowering Local Actors

According to the World Bank, one of the primary goals of decentralization is to make municipalities “more active players in the planning, implementation and delivery of municipal infrastructure and services.”20 Some analysts have noted that local government is more responsive due to access to better information as well as stronger incentives, than central government.21 Noted Ghanaian scholar Joseph Ayee wrote that decentralization in his country “awakened the spirit of voluntarism and ‘awareness’ among most sections of the communities.” It led to “incremental access of people living in previously neglected rural areas to central government resources and institutions” and “created a huge number of opportunities for mostly young people who aspired to a career in politics.”22

Decentralization can also bring job opportunities for unemployed youth, particularly those with degrees in management or policy who can take on new roles as local bureaucrats. And the new local leadership will give women and youth the opportunity to be part of the political decisionmaking process. As one Tunisian civil society activist noted, even when they are active members of their political party, women and youth are often “discarded” when they try to run for national office.23 The law governing the municipal elections tries to address this issue, stipulating that municipal and regional councils must have gender parity. That’s to be achieved by alternating between men and women on each candidate list with parity among heads of lists for parties with more than one list.24 And each list must include someone under age thirty-five among the first three candidates.25 As a result, over 75 percent of registered candidates are under forty-five and more than 50 percent are under thirty-five.26

Improving Service Delivery

Globally, decentralization has been shown to improve efficiency in the use of public resources as well as increase competition for public resources.27 In Porto Alegre, Brazil, for example, access to basic water, sewage treatment, and elementary and secondary school enrollment nearly doubled between 1989 and 1996, and the city increased revenue collection by 48 percent.28 In Bolivia, decentralization resulted in a massive shift in public resources favoring smaller and poorer municipalities. There, public investment in education, water treatment, and sanitation rose in three-quarters of all municipalities, representing a shift from large-scale production to social needs.29

According to civil society actors working on decentralization, Tunisians would most like improvements to already existing services, such as street lighting, waste collection, construction and quality of roads as well as local transport.30 Citizens in Tunisia’s traditionally disadvantaged regions are particularly hopeful on this score.

Improving service delivery has numerous secondary effects as well. It helps to rebuild the trust between citizens and their elected officials. According to a November 2017 survey by the International Republican Institute, 57 percent of Tunisians rated the performance of the government as “very bad” or “somewhat bad.” And 67 percent said the ministries do “nothing at all” to address the needs of people like them, while 73 percent said the same of parliament.31

Globally, decentralization has been shown to improve efficiency in the use of public resources as well as increase competition for public resources.

Additionally, there is some research that suggests that fiscal decentralization can reduce corruption.32—people can identify the centers of power and how to communicate with them. This is “highly symbolic,” as one activist put it, but easy to achieve.33 Currently, Tunisians receive very little communication from their municipalities. According to a 2015 World Bank survey, only 3 percent of respondents had received any form of communication from their municipality during the previous year.34 Part of the issue is digital infrastructure—many municipalities do not have functioning websites, so municipal officers must use their personal Facebook pages to communicate.35 Furthermore, many municipalities do not have a communications officer, and others have only one or two staff members to cover all issues in an entire municipality. Thus, there is a need for a dramatic increase in local staffing.

Another secondary effect of better service delivery is that it can help make municipalities—particularly those in the interior—more attractive to foreign donors and the private sector. For example, there remain dramatic disparities in the road conditions between Tunis in the north and the southern and northwestern regions. Driving south from Tunis, the highway is in good condition to Kairouan, about 100 miles. However, the route then becomes unpredictable—turning at times into a dirt road and at other times into a pristine highway. And due to poor road conditions, the drive southwest from Tunis to Siliana, about 80 miles away, takes longer than the drive from Washington, DC, to Philadelphia, which is nearly twice as far.

There is some research that suggests that fiscal decentralization can reduce corruption: by creating more direct links between citizens and authorities, there is more transparency.

Finally, decentralization can also help remove the bureaucratic bottlenecks and red tape that tend to delay decisionmaking, frustrating citizens and encouraging corruption.36 In this regard, decentralization is beneficial to not only local leaders but also national officials, who, by delegating the routine tasks of governing to local officials, are free to focus on statewide policymaking.37

Challenges of Decentralization

Yet there are numerous challenges—structural, logistical, and psychological—that decentralization in Tunisia continues to face. The biggest logistical chal­lenge is that the Code des Collectivités Locales (Local Authorities Code), the law governing the entire decentralization process (Organic Law No. 48 of 2017), was only passed by parliament on April 26, 2018—just ten days ahead of the municipal elections.38

Numerous civil society activists expressed dismay that the law would not be completed far enough in advance of the elections process for candidates to understand what their roles would be and for the Tunisian voting public to digest what they were voting for. The new law, which is one of the longest and most com­plex in Tunisia’s history, replaces the 1975 law on municipal governance. The old law gave local officials “neither real authority nor real administrative and financial autonomy,” according to Tunisian journalist Hayfa Dhouib.39

A further structural challenge is that eighty-six new municipalities (out of 350 total) were created during the decentralization process, and so far they are only “ink on paper.”40 In fact, 18 percent of Tunisians are in a brand new municipality, while 58 percent are in extended municipalities.41 While some of these new municipalities were split from larger municipalities and therefore already had functioning staff, offices, and budgets, it will be difficult to staff all 350 municipalities and create a culture of community in the short term. As a civil society activist in Sidi Bouzid noted of that mostly rural region, it is very challenging to put the physical systems in place to allow for close contact between local officials and the citizenry.42

Finally, the decentralization process is a lengthy endeavor—the government estimates twenty-seven years to fully devolve power to local officials and to bring the most poorly performing municipalities on par with the rest of the country—that risks running out of steam. One participant in a Carnegie-organized workshop noted a fear of partial decentralization. The failure to decentralize fully would create confusion and hinder accountability in both the local and central governments.43 Partial decentralization has been an issue in some cases around the world. In Brazil, Pakistan, and South Africa, local authorities were given administrative powers but not fiscal powers, depriving them of the ability to enact their policy decisions.

Managing Expectations

In conversations with officials and civil society activists in and out of Tunis, it is clear that expectations vary widely for what decentralization will bring to the country. Tunisia’s traditionally marginalized interior regions have some of the highest expectations for decentralization—that it will level the playing field and provide a more equitable distribution of resources. But these outcomes are not guaranteed. Even under a system of positive discrimination, taxation and distribution of resources might remain unaffected because “certain local areas will find it much easier to raise significant tax revenue than others” due to natural resources, infrastructure, and other issues that do not magically change with decentralization.44 In Ghana, only those who lived in larger towns or had special political influence were successful in developing their regions. Decentralization was seen as more of a public relations move than reality, and the political will to enforce change suffered as a result. Conversely, Uganda succeeded where Ghana did not, due to proper coordination among ministries (led by an office within the presidency) and building capacity at the district level (carried out by district staff who had been trained by external trainers).45

Tunisia’s traditionally marginalized interior regions have some of the highest expectations for decentralization, but the outcomes are not guaranteed.

Part of managing expectations is that, as a report by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) noted, “the benefits of devolution may take years to accrue, but the costs are front-loaded.”46 The Local Affairs Ministry’s twenty-seven-year plan is laudable and was created after years of preparation—from workshops and seminars around the country to consultations with international experts from twelve countries.47 However, it is not clear what short-term wins decentralization will provide for residents in the interior. A delegate in Sidi Bouzid noted that decentralization is a slow process that will take a decade. Thus expectations shouldn’t be too high—“it won’t bring miracles,” he said.48

In conversations with individuals in the interior regions, it was not clear what change they want to see in the short term, other than local control over their affairs. While that is a realistic goal, it will not guarantee the economic development needed by Tunisia’s traditionally marginalized municipalities. As other cases have shown, centralized governments are more effective than local governments at redistributing wealth and alleviating economic disparities. Thus, once decentralization moves forward, and the central government’s power to intervene locally decreases, the ability of the central government to level the playing field across regions might similarly decrease.

Officials, politicians, and civil society should also manage the public’s expectations regarding decentralization’s ability to provide improved governance. Ahlem Hachicha Chaker, executive director of the Policy Institute of the Machrou Tounes Party, noted that the public has high expectations that municipal elections will improve citizen participation. Through municipal elections, “the elector chooses, in a direct way, the people who represent him locally [and] manage public affairs on his behalf.”49 But, she argues, “I think we are making these elections more meaningful than they are. We want to believe that these elections will solve all the problems of society, that they correspond to an ‘instant democracy,’ that they will bring this new model of much sought-after governance”—results that are highly unlikely.50

Building Political Will

One of the greatest predictors of decentralization’s success is the level of political will at the national and local levels. The basic premise of decentralization is that it shifts power from the central state to the local level. Thus, the centralized bureaucracy is likely to oppose a process that “threaten[s] its power and control.”51 In Chile and Uruguay, “subnational officials were largely absent for the negotiations over decentralization. . . . Consequently, decentralizing measures . . . were quite circumscribed, cautious, and gradual, in stark contrast to the often radical approaches adopted in neighboring countries,” writes political scholar Kent Eaton.52

Tunisia’s political will is there, on paper. The constitution devotes an entire chapter (Chapter 7, articles 131 through 142) to local government, and article 12 describes the process of positive discrimination: “The state shall seek to achieve social justice, sustainable development and balance between regions based on development indicators and the principle of positive discrimination.”53 Additionally, article 14 states that “the state commits to strengthen decentralization and to apply it throughout the country, within the framework of the unity of the state.”54 Thus, it is clear that the state is de jure committed to decentralization. However, some civil society activists and analysts question the political class’s commitment.55

One glaring example is the repeated postponement of municipal elections (to say nothing of parliament’s inability to finalize the Local Authorities Code well in advance of these elections).56 Participants in Carnegie’s civil society workshop stated that decentralization does not have many advocates. As one person said, “Politicians are scared of decentralization because of the risks it brings to their own power. Thus, parties are not promoting it.”57

Furthermore, many citizens question the project’s intentions because the Ministry of the Interior has controlled the decentralization process. In particular, some municipal officials and civil society activists are uncomfortable with the “centralization of decentralization,” as one activist put it.58 A civil society actor noted that “the Directorate General of Local Authorities (DGCL) of the Ministry of the Interior wrote the draft Code of Local Authorities intended to devolve decentralization. Absolutely, it’s the ministry, i.e. the central authority, that imagines decentralization. . . . The center has historically held control over everything and has trouble getting rid of [that control].”59 These sentiments were echoed by a municipal executive who stated the code was “made by people who are against decentralization. . . . The Ministry of the Interior prepared the bill . . . as long as it is not reformed, we will be under the yoke of the Ministry of the Interior.”60

Many citizens question decentralization’s intentions because the Ministry of the Interior has controlled the process—some officials and activists are uncomfortable with such a centralization of decentralization.

In particular, some people are concerned that decentralization will simply re-create the authoritarian structures that plagued the Ben Ali era. One municipal executive stated, “The question is: how does this new project of decentralization break with the legacy of the police state and authoritarianism, avoid anarchy, and ensure development, which is at the heart of the demands of the revolution?”61

When local government structures are created, there is a tendency to replicate the central government’s organization. While this may seem to be the easiest path forward, it also risks re-creating authoritarian tendencies and patronage networks and can contribute to localized corruption. As one study on decentralization in the developing world noted, “The fundamental nature of the public sector does not automatically change when a public sector is ‘decentralized’ by severing the bottom tier of the state bureaucracy from the top layers if, at the same time, the ‘big man’ at the top of the central government pyramid is merely supplemented by smaller ‘big men’ at the top of each local government pyramid.”62 The United Nations explained that in some Latin American cases, for example, “decentralization reforms were . . . geared towards better infiltrating society, monitoring opposition forces and increasing stability of authoritarian regimes.”63 Scholars have pointed out that “governments often perform acts of decentralization as theater pieces to impress or appease international donors and NGOS [nongovernmental organizations] or domestic constituencies.”64

Furthermore, at the local level, it is more difficult to recruit and retain high quality and professional staff, who often set their sights on more prestigious positions in the capital. One study on decentralization in Tunisia noted that several municipalities do not even have a single engineer or architect.65 In the same report, a mayor explained, “In terms of senior management, we are very poor, we have a very low staffing rate. This has negative repercussions on the advancement and execution of projects. . . . Who’s doing the checking and monitoring projects? We need technicians.”66

The issue of human capacity is crucial. The municipal elections will bring to office thousands of new officials who have had no experience holding public office or running a municipality. While some local and international NGOs are planning training programs for these officials, it will be an incredibly difficult challenge to adequately train so many new officials on the tasks of governing, building consensus, communicating with the public, and working with the central government. This is further exacerbated by the fact that the Local Authorities Code has yet to be publicly released —meaning that these new officials will come to power with very little time to learn about their new responsibilities, let alone how to effectively carry them out.

Fighting Corruption

Decentralized political systems can be more vulnerable to corruption, due to additional layers of bureaucracy that can be influenced.67 Transparency International found that federal states are on the whole more corrupt than unitary ones, as “restraints by one [state] level merely increase the pickings of the other.” Given free rein, subnational officials invariably engage in corrupt practices that undermine the state.68 Unitary systems limit this possibility.69 Local structures are typically less developed than national ones, and thus easier to corrupt. Officials are usually less trained and paid less, because those with the requisite education and ambition are likely to seek employment at the national level. With more skilled personnel, national structures tend to be more transparent and accountable to the citizenry.70 Furthermore, the confidence in decentralization as a cure for corruption neglects to seriously consider the possibility of elite capture of local government resources. Local officials often “over-provided to local elites at the expense of non-elites,” thus undermining decentralization by re-creating national problems on a local level.71

The Role of Government

While both local and national government officials and institutions must work together to make decentralization a reality, the national government’s political will is the most critical factor for its success. The national government must drive the process initially, commiting to devolving financial and administrative power as well as by creating a clear separation of powers between the national and local levels. Furthermore, the national government should spearhead the effort to instill a culture of clear and consistent communication between and among officials at all levels. As a report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development argued, “Implementation of controlled decentralization in Tunisia depends on the capacity of the country to establish effective coordination and control systems.”72 However, the central state must simultaneously protect the territorial integrity of the state. As a report by USAID noted, the “national government must be strong enough to defend civil liberties, political rights and the rule of law throughout the territory.”73

At the local level, decentralization requires effective cooperation and coordination between the various layers of local government (such as between the mayor and the municipal council); between different local departments (such as health, education, and transportation); and collaboration between local officials on one side and the private sector and the greater community on the other.74 The constitution requires local authorities to operate according to the principles of “good governance,” “open governance,” and “participation by citizens and civil society,” but those principles will remain flimsy unless local officials—in concert with civil society and with encouragement from the central government—devise mechanisms to implement them in practice.75

National Government

In addition to giving the entire decentralization process top-cover, the national government has three key roles to play in Tunisia’s decentralization process going forward: to devolve power effectively and equitably; to develop a fair and efficient method of fund transfers; and to ensure a qualified workforce at the local level by training and equipping local officials and enticing high performers to take positions in the most marginalized regions.

Devolving Administrative Power Effectively and Equitably

Even in a decentralized state, the national government normally retains significant power. In Tunisia, it will be responsible for determining how much power and responsibility the various levels of local government receive. Here, the debate over the Local Authorities Code in parliament is instructive. Members of parliament had significant disagreements over the role of the governor—who is centrally appointed—versus the elected municipal counselors. Article 20 of the draft law states that “the head of the council and the heads of the municipal councils and the governor as the representative of the central authority in the region shall establish a mechanism for coordination and cooperation between the municipalities and the external departments and departments of the central administration and its affiliated establishments.”76 Some members had been concerned that the law is too vague and risks the governor encroaching on the work of the local councils.77

Article 200, which describes the conditions under which the municipal council could be dissolved, also generated significant debate. Some parliamentarians had argued that the council should be totally disbanded if it fails to perform its duties, while others were uncomfortable with the amount of power given to the non-elected officials to disband the council.78

And article 264, which states that the governor has the right to take over the mayor’s job or appoint a temporary mayor, should s/he refuse or neglect his/her duties, was the topic of heated debate. One member suggested that the municipal council should first attempt to resolve the issue, with the governor only intervening if the municipal council cannot solve the problem. But this amendment was ultimately rejected.79

These debates make it clear that disagreement remains over how much power the elected local officials should have and what role the appointed governor should play, as well as about how much power the minister of local affairs and parliament have to interfere in local issues. For decentralization to succeed, it is imperative that the local officials are empowered enough to truly represent their constituents, otherwise the process risks re-creating the toxic authoritarian structures and procedures that plagued the Ben Ali regime as well as contributing to the already dangerously large trust gap between the Tunisian people and their government—or both.

To address this, once the Local Authorities Code becomes law and municipal councils are elected, the national government should prioritize quickly transferring power to the local level as well as clearly communicating the boundaries of that power to the public. For Tunisians who have lived under a highly centralized state for decades, the cultural shift to decentralized and localized governance will take time. This shift can be made smoother with full transparency as to who controls what and what citizens can realistically expect from local officials.

Levels of Government There are three levels of local government—the regional, governorate, and municipal. Tunisia’s twenty-four regions are headed by a centrally appointed governor (wali). The 350 municipalities are each headed by a mayor, who is elected from the members of the municipal council for a five-year term. The mayor is responsible for planning, public security, traffic, and environmental management. The mayor also works with the council to develop the municipal investment plan and to levy municipal taxes.1 The Directorate General for Local Affairs (DGLC), which oversees the municipalities, was previously housed under the Ministry of the Interior, but was moved to the newly created Ministry of Local Affairs and the Environment in 2016. The Ministry of the Interior supervises regional governors, who are the representatives of the central state, through the Directorate General for Regional Affairs. The Directorate-General for Regional Affairs was removed from the ministry along with the DGLC and attached to the Ministry of Local Affairs and the Environment upon its creation in May 2016. However, in June 2017, it was re-attached to the ministry by government decree.2 Some of the roles of the Directorate General for Regional Affairs include guiding and controlling the action of governors in administrative, political, economic, social, cultural, and religious matters;

coordinating with other relevant ministries and agencies on all matters falling within the remit of the Directorate General for Regional Affairs;

monitoring the implementation of regional development programs; and

ensuring the coordination between the different governorates, and to study the problems and reforms concerning the regional administrative structures.3 Notes 1 Intissar Kherigi, “How to Make Local Government in Tunisia More Accountable,” Jasmine Foundation, June 2016. 2 Government Decree No. 2017-729 of June 5, 2017. 3 See the Ministry of the Interior’s website, https://www.interieur.gov.tn/fr/.

Developing Fair and Effective Fund Transfers

In addition to retaining some modicum of administrative power, the national government will also retain the power of the purse—the ability to provide financial transfers to the localities. Today, Tunis controls 96 percent of public spending, while only 4 percent of the state budget is spent at the local level. This is compared to a global average of 15–35 percent of budgets spent at the local level.80 The decentralization process is attempting to address this issue, and Minister of Local Affairs Mouakher recently stated that he plans to increase the 4 percent to 10 percent within six years, but simply funneling money to the local level is insufficient.81 The government must enact a fair and transparent method of transferring funds downstream and promoting an equitable distribution of resources.

A 2011 white paper by the Tunisian government explained the goals of reducing regional disparities:

The first dimension is the upgrading of marginalized regions by reducing socio-economic inequalities; the second dimension is to link the marginalized areas to the advanced zones in order to exploit the effects training and dissemination by the agglomerations; the third corresponds to the insertion of all the regions in the global economy so as to include them in a dynamic and sustainable development perspective.82

A United Nations Development Program report argued that “without appropriate fiscal empowerment, the autonomy of sub-national governments cannot be substantiated and, in this way, the full potential of decentralization cannot be realized.”83 Thus, the national government must “clearly define the assignment of expenditure responsibilities in order to enhance accountability, avoid unproductive overlap . . . duplication of authority and legal challenges.”84 A significant amount of research and thought has already been put into how to most effectively and fairly accomplish this goal through a partnership between the Ministry of Local Affairs and the World Bank (for more details, see the section on the international community).

One challenge for decentralization is that many goods and services cannot be easily divided between the national and local levels. Healthcare, education, and transportation all cut across borders.

Yet many goods and services cannot be easily divided between the national and local levels. Healthcare, education, and transportation all cut across borders and will require careful coordination. Furthermore, the central government must also retain the responsibility of redistributing income among the regions because local governments are less likely to tackle this in a fair manner.85 Furthermore, to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of resources, the central government must encourage development throughout the country, as “raising individual incomes is not the same thing as increasing the development potential of the area.”86

In addition to transfers from the federal government, local governments can raise revenue through various taxes on property, retail sales, motor vehicles, and motor fuel as well as user charges for local services. But, according to a 2016 report by USAID, the Tunisian tax code “reinforces inequality, tax evasion, and illegality.”87 For example, the municipality of Carthage is fully subsidized—residents do not pay taxes. And, according to a 2014 World Bank survey, 38 percent of Tunisian households do not pay taxes.88 One study on Tunisia’s decentralization process noted that “after the revolution . . . many citizens decided they would not pay inefficient and illegitimate local authorities.”89 Yet it is critical for local governments to raise and collect taxes—“when citizens pay taxes to local governments, they are more likely to demand services from those governments,” thereby creating a virtuous cycle of accountability.90 This has already been borne out in Tunisia. In the municipalities where participatory budgeting has been introduced, municipal authorities have reported more residents paying taxes than under the prior system.91

Ensuring a Qualified Workforce

For national officials to reap the benefits of decentralization, such as a decreased workload and better access to information in the far-flung regions, they must have well-qualified partners throughout the country. While some regions—particularly those on the coast—will have no problem attracting the best and the brightest, and can provide high-quality equipment for local government offices, the traditionally marginalized regions will need support from the central government.

One way to do so, is to develop an incentive structure to entice highly qualified civil servants to move to the most poorly served municipalities. Elected officials may not succeed because of a “gross mismatch between available resources and promised expenditures,” which has implications for both the local and the central governments.92

Local Government

In addition to the obvious role played by local government in the decentralization process, the municipal councils, mayors, and governors should work to establish healthy administrative and financial relationships with the central government and stimulate engagement across municipal boundaries. Furthermore, local officials should develop methods to formalize and normalize participatory governance.

Formalizing Participatory Governance

While the Local Authorities Code devotes an entire section to participatory governance, it leaves the specifics up to local officials, stating that “the elected local council, in consultation with civil society, determines the mechanisms and modalities of participatory democracy.”93 The code further instructs local and regional councils to adhere to a participatory approach in monitoring utilities and developing the local development plan. It also calls on the local and regional council to establish a committee on participatory governance and local democracy. However, Tunisian scholar Intissar Kherigi has recommended enshrining stronger protections for citizen engagement in the law. In particular, she has advocated for citizens to have the right to demand that local authorities hold public hearings and receive public petitions. As she argued, “This could strengthen transparency by empowering and engaging citizens through multiple mechanisms beyond information requests, and obliging local authorities to communicate and justify their decisions more openly.”94

One method traditionally used to engage a citizenry is participatory budgeting. In Porto Alegre, for example, participatory budgeting was very effective in enhancing transparency and accountability in the use of public funds, and the decisions that came out of the process led to more equitable spending and needs-based community development.95 Tunisia already has some experience with participatory budgeting, which was implemented in a few pilot localities. In La Marsa, for example, the process taught that participatory budgeting requires technical knowledge, and thus technical staff are useful in helping citizens understand the overall budget picture as well as making informed decisions.96 Other methods of encouraging citizen participation are holding town halls, having open council sessions, and conducting citizen surveys to connect citizen preferences to local government. Civil society can play a role here in increasing participatory options for the citizenry.97 The Jasmine Foundation, a Tunisian think tank, has already piloted citizen scorecards to present citizen preferences to local government. It hopes to expand this into an index that would show comparisons over time and between municipalities.98

Beyond formal mechanisms for participatory governance, local officials should encourage a culture of participatory governance by civil society and the wider public.

Another way to be more responsive to the citizenry is through use of digital documents and electronic governance initiatives. Kherigi recommended “one-stop shops” for citizens in each municipality to provide simplified access to information on government services and procedures.99 These could be both physical as well as digital, to provide even greater ease of use, and would free up time for local bureaucrats who would otherwise be spending hours answering questions in person. A model could be the Washington, DC, government’s 311 service, which is available by phone, app, and web portal, allowing residents to contact the appropriate local government office for the work they need. By phone, citizens dial 3-1-1 and are directed by an operator to the appropriate office. Using the app or website, citizens can report issues (such as a missed trash pick-up or a pothole), see other issues that have been reported, contact the mayor, or grade local services and agencies.

Normalizing Participatory Governance

Beyond formal mechanisms for participatory governance, local officials should encourage a culture of participatory governance by civil society and the wider public. Much of the citizen engagement process is discretionary, and in a country where public participation was nonexistent, or dangerous, for decades, local officials will need to work with civil society to encourage public participation. This can benefit all parties. Local officials benefit because they are better able to respond to their citizenry, which makes it more likely that they will be viewed as effective and stay in power. And citizens undoubtedly benefit from stronger public engagement because their priorities and preferences are more likely to be translated into public policies. Furthermore, public engagement supported by the local government can help prevent the sort of massive trust gap that Tunisians currently have with the national government.

The Role of Civil Society and Citizens

Civil society has a crucial role to play both in developing Tunisia’s decentralization process as well as in implementing it, including serving as a watchdog over the local and national governments; collecting and communicating citizen preferences to local officials; and encouraging and engaging in participatory governance.

Serving as a Watchdog

Tunisian civil society has been particularly adept at serving as a watchdog of the national government. And several of the country’s most powerful and effective national organizations—Al Bawsala, Mourakiboun, and Barr al Aman—have demonstrated the ability and desire to play this role at the local level. Al Bawsala’s Marsad Baladia project was launched in January 2014 to monitor municipalities and connect citizens to them.100 The Marsad Baladia team collects information on the municipal budget, human resources, property, investments, and activity of the municipal council and publishes that information on the project’s website.

Mourakiboun, which began as an elections-monitoring organization in 2011 has undertaken significant work both in monitoring voter registration for the municipal elections as well as in monitoring the health sector. In a partnership with Democracy International, Mourakiboun created a centralized hub of election-related data, maps, and analysis that “facilitate data-driven decision-making to improve the electoral process.”101 In the health sector, Mourakiboun monitored 2,060 basic healthcare centers in 264 districts in January 2017 to observe the state of their infrastructure, the conduct of medical consultations, the status of equipment and supplies, and other indicators.102

Barr al Aman works to improve governance through the media. Their hour-long weekly radio program focuses on elected local and national bodies. It seeks to “present concretely and close to the reality of citizens issues related to decentralization, the next local elections, but also the administrative procedures, the functioning and dysfunction of state institutions.”103 Additionally, national organizations like Kolna Tounes have local branches throughout the country that are run by local activists and seek to address local issues.

There is some fear among Tunisian activists that local organizations will be sidelined by Tunis-based or international organizations. As a civil society actor stated,

It is up to regional civil society to give priority to the issue of decentralization. . . . Civil society in the regions will reject the associations that come from Tunis, and so we will create a split inside civil society. We encouraged these people for them to be listened to, the next step is to talk to Tunisian civil society . . . to tell them that we must listen to these people, they must be represented, we must integrate them. In all the analyses, it is necessary that the media invite the associations working in the inner regions, you have to listen to these people.104

Furthermore, one civil society actor noted that even those organizations based in Tunis are viewed with skepticism by local actors:

The problem with the municipalities is that even if we are a Tunisian NGO, they ask us systematically the question: Who is behind you? What is your agenda? The classic conspiracy theory. . . . At the same time, citizens cannot [accept] more broken promises from civil society. Civil society is replacing the government, civil society actors make meetings everywhere, round tables, talk about solutions, but there is nothing concrete after. . . . People want concrete things, they do not want to speak just to speak, they are tired of the blah. . . . So we tell them, if you attend the preliminary sessions, your life will not change overnight but you will understand how things work, that’s all. We also said to the municipalities, we are going help you talk about your recruitment and equipment issues to citizens, this is the maximum we can do. The broken promises are the worst thing for citizens and for municipalities.105

Collecting and Communicating Citizen Preferences

In addition to monitoring local governments’ performance, civil society can collect and communicate citizen preferences to local officials. In Sidi Bouzid, the NGO Smart Solutions has worked to actively inform residents about the role of municipal government and how they can best engage with their elected officials. The organization has held more than twenty workshops in some of Tunisia’s most disadvantaged regions—Sidi Bouzid and Kasserine—that collectively brought together 6,500 people to answer the question, “What would you do as mayor?”106

Civil society has a crucial role to play both in developing Tunisia’s decentralization process as well as in implementing it.

Civil society has also been effective at explaining the importance of decentralization and its mechanisms. As a civil society activist in Sidi Bouzid said, “People want to be autonomous, but they don’t trust political parties so they won’t vote.”107 The growing distrust between people and their government has the potential to block decentralization’s benefits. Thus, civil society must convince people that it is in their interest to participate in local government decisions that directly impact their lives. As the civil society activist said, “People’s priority is not politics—it is improving the economy and improving their lives,” but many people, particularly outside of the capital, do not fully understand they have the opportunity to do that by participating in local governance.108 As a civil society actor in Tunis noted, civil society needs more financial support to be able to raise awareness about decentralization. As of now, “Most people do not know about it.”109

And a delegate from Sidi Bouzid pointed out that citizens are “policymakers” at the local level. Another activist echoed this point, stating that citizens must do more than vote—they need to be engaged in making the decisions and policies that will impact their town and their lives.110

Actively Participating in Available Mechanisms

The issue of participatory governance has been highly controversial—so much so that it is one of the only aspects of the Local Authorities Code that was postponed until the end of the discussion due to a lack of consensus. Currently, Tunisia has a process of participatory budgeting, but civil society activists agreed that local participation needs to expand far beyond that.111 The constitution has an expansive definition of participation: “Local authorities shall adopt the mechanisms of participatory democracy and the principles of open governance to ensure the broadest participation of citizens and of civil society in the preparation of development programmes and land use planning, and follow up on their implementation, in conformity of the law.”112

But there is some fear that the code does not put the principle of participatory democracy into practice, as described by the constitution.113 Thus, for decentralization to succeed, civil society must also facilitate citizen participation in local affairs. As one study noted, “Citizen participation in local government decision making does not come automatically. It requires specific strategies to establish communication channels and build capacities of both citizens (and organizations that represent them) and local governments to engage in a constructive dialogue.”114

While participatory democracy tends to be easier to implement locally, the shift from a top-down, centralized form of governance to a bottom-up, participatory process requires formal incentives—at least in the early phases. One way to do this is to create legislation that requires local government to “gather information from citizens regarding their needs and opinions, grant citizens access to council deliberations, or inform citizens of a pending government decision,” as described by a USAID report.115

But even legally mandated participation can only go so far without political will. One civil society actor stated,

In 2016, all development projects in Tunisia were participatory, and I say that because the Ministry of the Interior has sent the municipalities a participation guide. There is no procedure to control the implementation of the participatory approach, the only instruction received by the municipalities were that they must hold at least two meetings without any indicators regarding the representativeness of the citizens. . . . Municipalities just need to hold at least two meetings, and they just have to document that with pictures and send them as a report.116

Even the drafting of the Local Authorities Code did not live up to the participatory standard civil society was expecting. As one activist noted, the law was drafted by legal experts who consulted very little with civil society. When the draft law was first presented, half a day was given to the judiciary to review it, half a day for civil society, and half a day for each of the six regions. Most of civil society’s day was taken up by the presentation of the code, and civil society organizations were only given two minutes each to respond. Furthermore, the draft law—with more than 300 articles—was only made available to the public three days before this consultation, leaving very little time for civil society and the public to study it.117 A member of parliament from the Ennahda party argued that there is a “crisis of confidence between citizens and politicians. This can only be resolved by more dialogue with citizens.”118

The Role of the International Community

The international community can both raise awareness of the decentralization process as well as provide technical assistance and financial support to implement it. Several international donors have conducted rigorous analytical research on local priorities, and USAID is working to improve local-level service delivery in a few pilot projects. Here, public-private partnerships can also play an important role. During the lead up to the May 6 municipal elections, international NGOs and donors provided significant support in candidate training, campaign awareness, and get-out-the-vote efforts. In fact, international experts began the process of training local officials well in advance of the elections. As a civil society activist in Sidi Bouzid said, international donors can help civil society and local officials “broaden their lens” by connecting them with the wider world to teach best practices.119

The World Bank–supported Urban Development and Local Governance Program has been very successful in both incentivizing good governance at the local level and in digitizing and streamlining bureaucratic procedures. The Ministry of Local Affairs’ Local Government Portal, supported by the World Bank, “provides users with diversified information on finances, municipal performance, investment plans and the legal and regulatory framework of local authorities. The E-Reclamation area offers citizens a section where they can register their complaints, and the Local Authorities Area makes it possible to strengthen exchanges between the central level and local communities.”120

The sixty-month, 1,220-million-dinar ($508 million, of which $300 million was paid by the World Bank) program is designed to “implement the constitutional provisions related to: the decentralization enshrined in the Constitution, the adoption of the mechanisms of participatory democracy, and the principle of free administration of the Commons.”121 One of the key aspects of the program is a new grant transfer system where the amount of grants given to a locality is determined by a set of performance evaluation mechanisms. The grants support projects to improve infrastructure and services.122 To qualify for a grant that year, the municipality must meet the following five minimal conditions:

have a budget adopted by the council;

submit financial statements to the Ministry of Finance by July 31;

have an investment plan approved by the council;

have a procurement plan uploaded to the national procurement website; and

have an approved memorandum of understanding with the Tunisian Common Loan Fund (known by its French acronym CPSCL).

Beyond those conditions, municipalities are graded on a 100-point scale, with indicators covering governance, sustainability, and management. Municipalities are assessed by an independent audit, and the results are available on the Local Government Portal. If the municipality receives a grade of 70 or above, their grants will double for 2018 and beyond.123 In the first year, more than 90 percent of municipalities fulfilled the five basic criteria to give them access to grants for 2016.

Conclusion

Tunisia’s decentralization process has tremendous potential. It is both symbolically important as a key step toward fully consolidating the country’s democratic transition as well as a practical step toward correcting some of the regional injustices that occurred prior to the revolution. By empowering local actors and improving service delivery, the government’s decentralization effort could help narrow the vast trust gap with Tunisians. However, to be successful, the central government, local government, civil society, and international donors must each invest in the process.

Recommendations

The Tunisian central government can take several actions to demonstrate its political will to democratization:

Manage public expectations by clearly communicating about the devolution of administrative and financial power. This includes publicizing the twenty-seven-year plan, which members of parliament had yet to receive as of this writing, 124 as well as short- and long-term benchmarks upon which the decentralization process will be evaluated by the Ministry of Local Affairs. The ministry should also make publicly available the outcomes of the extensive global research that led to the draft Local Authorities Code.

Develop an incentive structure to encourage highly qualified civil servants to serve in the most marginalized regions. This could include bonus pay or basing promotions on required service in certain regions.

to encourage highly qualified civil servants to serve in the most marginalized regions. This could include bonus pay or basing promotions on required service in certain regions. Ensure a proper public review process for public participation at the local level. The Local Authorities Code does not adequately address the specifics of participatory democracy, instead leaving these to a Guide on Participation to be mandated by a government decree. The idea of issuing a decree on public participation is antithetical to participatory democracy. Rather, the state should issue a draft decree and provide sufficient time and opportunity for nationwide review and stakeholder input into the guide.

The local governments can:

Provide opportunities for participatory governance outside of those mandated by the law, such as the creation of citizen councils or regular policy preference surveys.

outside of those mandated by the law, such as the creation of citizen councils or regular policy preference surveys. Devise mechanisms for cross-municipality collaboration and communication. Local officials should focus first on their own territory, but should also work with local officials in neighboring municipalities to discuss issues that bleed across borders and to brainstorm creative policy solutions.

Civil society must continue to play its role as watchdog of the democratic process. But it has an even more important role to play at the local level to encourage and engrain a culture of participatory democracy. Specifically, civil society should:

Conduct an outreach campaign to the public regarding decentralization. This should be led by local grassroots organizations that have strong credibility in their municipalities and should focus on explaining the role of the municipal council under the Local Authorities Code as well as the opportunities for public participation in local government.

regarding decentralization. This should be led by local grassroots organizations that have strong credibility in their municipalities and should focus on explaining the role of the municipal council under the Local Authorities Code as well as the opportunities for public participation in local government. Connect citizens with participatory governance mechanisms. Civil society should both serve as a knowledge base regarding participation opportunities as well as a conduit between the public and local officials. Civil society should devise mechanisms to capture citizen preferences and communicate those preferences to local officials—either through town halls, formal advisory roles, digital comment forms, or informal channels.

To assist civil society in carrying out these tasks, donors should work to build the capacity of local grassroots organizations and networks (as well as Tunis-based organizations) to enhance their ability to effectively encourage participatory governance. Additionally, international donors should:

Fund e-government efforts including the digitization of local government forms and processes. The goal should be to create a physical as well as a digital one-stop shop for citizens to access municipal services and communicate with municipal officials. Additionally, donors could support the Tunisian government to create an online portal to help match local government job openings by experience and education with existing government officials. 125

Additionally, donors could support the Tunisian government to create an online portal to help match local government job openings by experience and education with existing government officials. Train and equip local officials based on best practices from around the globe. In partnership with the private sector, donors could ensure that local officials across the country have access to appropriate technological resources to enable them to communicate with Tunis as well as with their constituents. Donors should also train local officials on how to most effectively carry out their duties.

“The polis exists to assure the good life” – Aristotle. “For however strong a ruler may be, he will always have need of the goodwill of the inhabitants if he wishes to remain in power” – Machiavelli. “It is not by the concentration of powers, but by their distribution, that good government is effected” – Thomas Jefferson. “There is no time to waste. We must either unite now or perish” – Julius Nyerere.

I - WHAT SHOULD BE AT STAKE FOR SOUTH SUDAN IN THE HLRF?

All the above quoted political wisdom should serve as reminders for finalizing the High-Level Revitalization Forum (HLRF) without further delays. The conscience of stakeholders of the de facto Transitional Government of National Unity (TGoNU)—whose term of office ended in April 2018—and the loosed opposition groups should get awakened so as to reach an urgent conclusion of a peaceful settlement that must end the filthy civil war in South Sudan.

Also, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) should rethink its institutional bottleneck to become a trustworthy peace mediator with the commendable achievement of the desired goal. The hierarchical decision-making organs of the IGAD (i.e., Assembly of Heads of State and Government that determines the policies and guidelines; Council of Ministers that approves the work programs and budget of the Secretariat; and Committee of Ambassadors that influence the Heads of State and Government, the Ministers and officials of the Secretariat, etc…) have often undermined the work of HLRF mediation experts, especially on issues of good governance and credibility of leadership of the awaited post-war South Sudan.

At the end of the game, all the stakeholders (nationals and foreigners alike) should get tough lessons from the evolution of the political history of South Sudan so as to avoid dangerous blunders of unending crises. They must know that absence of good life, deflated people’s will, concentrated power and decayed national unity usually put BIG QUESTION MARKS on the essence of existence of a modern democratic state in the globalized era of universal human rights.

It was regrettably a wishful naivety to have thought that the tainted history of abortive governments and oppositions of Sudan would absolve ‘independent’ South Sudan from inheriting the DNA of bad governance, dooming insecurity, confused economy and recurrent humanitarian catastrophe. The deceptive economic boom from oil revenues in the SPLM/A-controlled government in Juba (not clear for any confidence whether it is free-market capitalism, protected regulatory socialism or ‘mixed’ economy) has been infected by Dutch Disease with the behaviour of milking public coffers unaccountably.

As the reality of SPLM/A’s government and opposition has now gotten known by hard way of trial-and-error, it is high time the search for lasting peace is informed by roots and links of the evolved political past of South Sudan. Such acknowledgement is necessary, precisely when the territorial geography of the new country on the globe has not shifted to the Atlantic or the Indian Oceans, or even to the Red and the Mediterranean Seas.

The historical facts and actors about South Sudan must be gleaned and screened honestly from illusionary propagandist fictions. SWOT Analyses must be applied rigorously to identify internal and external Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats of the existing dysfunctional institutions and those leading them with defective attitudes. Also, SMART Principles must be invoked to ensure adherence to Specificity, Measurability, Achievability, Realisticity and Timeliness of IGAD-mediated negotiations without fear or favour of anti-peace or anti-transformation proponents. Empirical descriptive evidence and logical premises must be used rigorously to arrive at sound prescriptive conclusions on resolving the daunting problems of leadership, security reforms, humanitarian assistance, sustainable economy, transitional justice and democratization of power in South Sudan.

What do you call the rivalling political leaders who act without a vision for a mission and behave strangely as if there will not be a future to cherish for themselves or their heirs?

With its commendable emancipatory past, should the SPLM/A be allowed to continue disgracing the present and discrediting the future of South Sudan for posterity?

Is there a pride in the nauseating political disgusts about the renowned SPLM/A freedom fighters who sacrificed dearly to see South Sudan liberated from the injustices of old Sudan, but find themselves escaping the country for exile to live in the diaspora as stateless individuals?

What honour is left there in the citizens who overwhelmingly voted for the independence of South Sudan but to get displaced internally to camps that are expensively guarded by foreign forces or seek refuge abroad in environmentally tough habitats of neighbouring countries?

What do you call a government in a contemporary world whose 3rd secretary diplomat in headquarters of the ministry of foreign affairs receives only a delayed monthly salary of 10 dollars?

What do you call a government in the era of universal human rights whose primary teachers are provisionally paid by foreign humanitarian donors (40 dollars a month) to keep them in schools for the sake of basic education rights of poor children, while the ministry of finance drags to pay in time the salaries of those teachers (equivalent to 5 dollars per a month)?

What do you call a naturally resource-rich country in the era of Millennium Sustainable Goals when 90% of its population lives beyond the threshold of poverty line due to man-made crises?

As the war situation stands, it will not be sustainable to temporarily bandage a government or opposition on fear mongering of ‘if we don’t this we will collapse and perish’. Such demise is the determined destiny of any irresponsible government or opposition that blocks the needed drastic change of bad status quo to new normal. No amount of propaganda or intransigence can triumph because when the political pendulum has swung to the extremes of frustrating fragile peddling, nothing but a final collapse would get queued in the sequence of events.

The cross of the very authoritarian cult that the exiled and rebellious SPLM/A leaders had established in South Sudan when they were on the grip of power, is what is haunting them mercilessly to the core now. The SPLM/A was supposed to be archived in libraries after the independence of South Sudan in 2011 because there was no Sudan to be liberated any longer in the new state. Only memorial celebrations of that formidable liberation movement in Africa would have remained upheld yearly every 16th May.

However, the real anguish about embattled South Sudan is the possibility of its breaking up into tiny fragilities that would make it difficult for rescuing the savable from political ruins. The fragmented status quo usually leads to undesirable uncertainties (e.g., reckless adoption of unsustainable political governance mechanisms, crooked security approaches, anarchical political economies and unending humanitarian catastrophes) with disturbing threats to the dignity of international peace and security. That is why South Sudan shouldn’t be allowed to sink deeper into the abyss because the repercussions of ‘failed African solution’ shall not smell good for the region after what was witnessed in Somalia.

The nauseating war situation of South Sudan is akin to John T. Rourke’s diagnosis in his Books “International Politics on the World Stage” (1st – 8th editions), Daron Acemoglu’s & James Robinson’s depictions in their Book “Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty” and Peter H. Schuck’s accounts in his Book “Why Government Fails So Often”. According to these critical writers, governments that mess up themselves with senseless conflicts and extractive corruption become predominantly characterized by:

1) Dynamics of arrogant and self-serving power ambitions greedy actors with no real sense of responsibility for state/nation building; 2) Little institutional engineering hampered by unsustainable bureaucratic deforms; 3) Poor performance due to incompetence lack prudence on political economy; 4) Recurrent abhorring violence exacerbated by rotten social fabrics; 5) Riveting dramatic events with politically-motivated complex tragedies; and 6) Dramatic collapse though sometimes hopeful ending that leaves everyone dumfounded by the turns and twists of new emerging realities.

The unending senseless wars drain the desired assurances in governments, oppositions, political parties, civil societies, interest groups and the entire people of a country. In such situation the international standards and humanitarian law become the first casualties (e.g., violence pursued and promoted not as last resort for a just cause; war declared and managed without legitimate authority; war conducted disproportionally for senseless aggression rather than self-defense; war fought without discrimination of non-combatants, and war continued without intention to restore the disturbed security and peace in the shortest time possible).

General Omar Bradley, the former Joint Chief of Staff of U.S.A Army, would not hesitate (as he did at the testimony to the Senate Committee in 1951 about extending Korean War into Red China) to call what is happening in South Sudan as “the wrong war, at the wrong place, at the wrong time, and with the wrong enemy”. The Dutch Father of International Law and the author of ‘On the Law of War and Peace (1625)’, Hugo Grotius, would also get irritated if the HLRF ends without compelling the negotiating parties to sing an equitable peace deal.

As nothing stands strategically designed for pursuing the undignified path of ‘real politics by other means’ but political survival through war, the sustainability of running South Sudan for longer in war would get squeezed into the parochial irrational arena of unsophisticated luck or believe in superstitions. The history is full of refreshing hints of the fate of governments and opposition groups that had defied the sense of preservation of human dignity.

II - GLIMPSES FROM TURKO-EGYPTIAN & ANGLO-EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENTS (1821 – 1956)

The governments that founded and ruled Sudan (including Southern Sudan) in the past were modelled after the Treaty of Westphalia (1648), which ended the Thirty Years of religious wars of monarchies in Europe. That Treaty upheld the sanctity of equality of sovereign European states based on respect for a conciliatory secular approach to politics among the superpowers who operate according to unified understanding for colonizing the less powerful nations that were regarded as not yet rational, scientific, moral and theistic for full humanity.

The history of Turkish-based Ottoman Empire (founded in the 15th Century and collapsed in 20th Century when its territories were divided up in 1922 for trusteeship by strategic victors behind the League of Nations), is an important epistemological archive worth revisiting nowadays. That Empire was the founder of Sudan (land of the blacks) by default in 1821 via its commander, the Albanian-born Muhammad Ali Pasha (1769 – 1849). The objectives was to extract valuable resources and capture black slaves to be used for consolidation and expansion the colonial regime to new territories.

Muhammad Ali’s grandson, ‘the magnificent’ Khedive Ismail Ibrahim Pasha (1830 – 1895) tried to improve the tainted image of his government among ‘the virgin tribes’ of Southern Sudan. He appointed European adventurers to govern this slaves hunting zone (e.g., Samuel White Baker, Charles George Gordon and Eduard Schnitzler) to help him with reforms and “abolition of slavery” in accordance with Anglo-Egyptian Slave Trade Convention (1877) and the Congo Act (1885):

1) Freedom of navigation and trade for all nations in the region forming the basins of the Congo and Niger without allowing a total hegemony of Britain or Portugal; 2) Recognition of African boundaries as international borders demarcated by the dominant colonial powers who have endorsed the partition understanding via the Congo Act; 3) Future appropriation of territory on the African coast had to be conducted by the dominant colonial powers via notification in advance to the signatories of any territorial acquisition; and 4) Joint measures for the suppression of slavery and slave trade within the colonial territories.

Also the history of British Empire (founded in 16th Century and expanded extensively between 17th and 20th Centuries to be known as the vast territory where the sun doesn’t go setting, though it diminished from the 1950s and disappeared in 1997 after handing over Hong Kong to its rightful Chinese owners), is connected with the making of South Sudan though Lord Cromer (1841 – 1917) discredited it perceptively as a useless large tract that was difficult and costly to administer for any meaningful colonial interest. The Anglo-Egyptian colonial governments used the divide-and-rule tactics to subdue the local people of the Sudan but disadvantaging Southern Sudan through special policies of ‘Military Patrols’ to enforce colonial law and order, Closed District Ordinance (1921), Passports and Permits Ordinance (1922), Trade Permit Order (1928), Rejaf Languages Conference (1928)—six local vernaculars (Dinka, Nuer, Shilluk, Bari and Latuko and Zande) were recommended as medium for Southern education without prejudice to English or other European languages, ‘Building of Self-contained Tribal Units’ based on customary system, and banning mingling or intermarriages between Southerners and Northerners.

The post-World War I (1914 – 1918) and politics of the League of Nations; the invasion of Eritrea by Italy in 1935 with attempts to conquer parts of Sudan adjacent to Ethiopia; the World War II (1939 – 1945) and politics of the United Nations; the move by penultimate King Farouk I of Egypt to declare himself the Monarch of both Egypt and Sudan; and the pressure of Northern General Graduate Congress (formed in 1936) on the Anglo-Egyptian colonial Government to revoke its Southern Sudan policy and involve Sudanese in government, led to formation of Northern Sudan Advisory Council and enactment of Local Councils Ordinances in 1943 though with ‘safeguards’ by the British to uniqueness of the South. But the post-World War II (1939 – 1945) and politics of the United Nations shifted the paradigm where the British resorted to policy of empowering Southern Sudan educationally and economically to enable them to stand strongly and competitively on their own as Negroid African, either as attached to the North, annexed to East Africa, or distributed between North and East Africa.

The U.K’s Labour Minister, Ernest Bevin, and the Egyptian Prime Minister Ismail Sedky Pasha signed a Protocol in 1946 on self-government and referendum for the Sudanese to decide on their annexation to Egypt or staying independent after nullification of Condominium Agreement (1899) and the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty (1936) prior to the exit of colonial officials from Sudan. The Condominium Civil Secretary, James W. Robertson, wanted the South to remain attached to the North and the Middle East rather than East Africa. He and the Machiavellian Northern Sudanese Judge, Mohamed Saleh Shingeiti, organized the Sudan Administration Conference in Khartoum (1946) with a special focus on ‘Sudanization’ of public service. The Conference recommended for the conduct of Juba Conference in 1947 to bring Southern participants (civil servants, local chiefs, religious leaders and British officials) on board by persuading them to get closer to the central government in Khartoum in returns for equal treatment in job remuneration, promotion, privileges, transfers and education.

Unfortunately, the London-Cairo-Khartoum geopolitics undermined the original mood and promised of the Juba Conference. London preferred appeasing Khartoum to strike a blow on Cairo and its push for unity of the Nile Valley. The 13-Man Committee that drafted the Self-government Statute (chaired by Justice Stanley Baker in 1951 and with MP Buth Diu as the only member from the South but who boycotted with disappointment when his call for federalism was rejected) was affected by the diplomatic wrangling and confusing legalistic interpretations of the Agreement between The Egyptian Government and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Island Concerning Self-government and Self-determination for the Sudan (1953.

With approval by the British authorities, the Northern politicians (patronized by Pro-Egypt Khatimya Islamists under Ali al-Mirghni and Pro-Britain Ansars Islamists under Abdel Rahman al-Mahdi) spat on the face of Southerners by denying them representation in the negotiations of Anglo-Egyptian exit from Sudan. They despised the South as apolitical to be consulted because it didn’t have a single political party and would not deserve to sit equally with their masters to discuss government affairs. The Egyptian Information Minister Saleh Salim, serving under the Junta of Mohamed Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser, frequented his visits to Southern Sudan to promote unity of the Nile Valley.

It didn’t take longer before the workers in Nzara and Yambio went on riots, Torit armed forces went on mutiny, and wider unrest ensuing in Southern Sudan by1955. Khartoum blamed “the Southern Problem” on British policies of isolating the South from North with widened gap of mistrust, underdevelopment and backwardness of Southerners, disrespect of Northern traders and elites towards Southerners, false assumptions that Egyptians and British will intervene in favour of the South, miscommunication and maladministration by government officials, and rumour mongering by the opposition against Ismail al-Azhari’s interim government.

In a nutshell, the respective governments of the Great Ottoman Empire and the Greatest British Empire, including their extension into Sudan via assistance of de facto governments in Egypt, had to collapse mainly for these reasons: 1) conducting themselves above the fundamental universal human rights, and 2) pursuing globalization without moral conscience or human face. Regrettably, their political DNA is still haunting South Sudan nowadays (e.g., family dynasties with use of religions for political appearance of support and solidarity, proliferation of militias for government security against opposition, capitalist free market economy, anti-federalism, spree of corruption, maladministration, insensitivity to plight of local population, recycling of arrogant politicians in government, and intransigence on military might and other repressive demeanors against the colonized people).

III - HINTS FROM GOVERNMENTS OF INDEPENDENT SUDAN (1956 – 2011)

The Stanley Baker’s Statute of Self-government was passed into Transitional Constitution of the Sudan (1956) without incorporating the demand of Southerners for self-rule (Southern politicians were only persuaded that their demand would be given due consideration by Constituent Assembly during the permanent constitution-making process). Independent Sudan didn’t change the bad politics of the colonial past, particularly against Southern Sudan and other marginalized peripheries that remained intact as God created them at the time of Adam and Eve (i.e., no added value of human and infrastructural development).

The British policies adopted after the Rajaf Conference (1928) and Juba Conference (1947) regarding ‘due recognition’ of uniqueness of Southern Sudan in its multi-cultural, multi-customs, multi-religious and multi-linguistic diversity, were trashed under new “Sudanization” policies adopted by the veterans of Northern Sudanese General Graduate Congress inline with the ‘Baqt’ (652 – 1323 A.D) of the Treaty that victimized the natives of Southern Sudan:

1) Allow safe and free movement and settlement of Arabs and Muslims into Nubians territory, and vice versa for a limited movement of Nubians to and through Egypt for trade only without resettlement; 2) Cease raids and wars between Egypt and Nubia so that the Peace of God and Islamic Message of Prophet Mohamed could prevail without obstruction; 3) Build a Mosque in Dongolla and protect it for the Muslims and the in respect to Rulers in Egypt; 4) Pay a tribute of 300 slaves annually to Egypt (reduced later to 360 slaves per 3 years); 5) Return to Egypt the escaped black slaves and fugitive Arabs who opposed the Islamic dynasty.

The political character of the Jellaba and the intelligentsia who inherited government institutions of post-colonial Sudan didn’t become different from that of Jihadists of the Mahdiyya (1885 – 1898) who unleashed havoc in Southern Sudan to extract resources for the upkeep of nepotistic, corrupt, brutal, famine-stricken and slaves trading regime of Khalifa Abdullahai Al-Taishi (e.g., the notorious Jihadist Zaki al-Tamal beheaded the Shilluk King Yor Akoch of Fashoda after capturing him in a fierce battle of Nigiir, and Karmallah al-Kerkasawi tried to Islamize by force the tribes of the Lado Enclave but was ferociously resisted by King Gbudwe Bazingbi of Azande who was eliminated by British later).

The elites in Khartoum continued to deny the demand of Southerners for federalism and sabotaged the implementation of feasibility studies on big developmental agro-industrial schemes and mechanized farming in Southern Sudan (e.g., Nzara Cotton Plantation and Cloth Industry, Melut and Mongalla Sugar Sugar Plantation/Processing, Aweil Rice Plantation/Processing, Wau Fruits Plantation/Canning, Tonj Kenaf Plantation/Processing, Kapoeta Cement Factory, Upper Talanga Tea Plantation/Processing, and Malakal and Bor Fish Freezing and Drying Industries, etc).

The young politicians of Southern Sudan didn’t compromise like their old fathers and uncles. They won elections overwhelmingly in 46 Southern constituencies in 1957 on the following campaign trail for change of status quo: emancipation of the marginalized with adoption of secular federalism, repatriation of Southern schools and students from Northern Sudan, recognition of both English and Arabic as official languages, establishment of independent economic development program for Southern Sudan, formation of independent organized armed forces for Southern Sudan, and repatriation of the Sudan back from the Arab World to Africa. By then the cold war between Russia and its allies versus the U.S and its allies was staring to get hot in Africa.

The learnt youth of Southern Sudan didn’t betray the cause even when their leader, Ezbon Mundiri, was arrested and imprisoned for seven years for a crime against unity of the Arabized Islamic Sudan purported to have been committed by leading aggressively the Southern campaign on the above-mentioned cards. Fr. Saturnino Lohure Hilangi took the challenge of the leadership of the federalists as he protested in the Constitutional Constituent Assembly (1958) and underscored the following statement succinctly as Southern Parliamentarians walked out to boycott the undesirable sittings:

“The South has no ill-intentions whatsoever towards the North; the South simply claims to run its local affairs in a united Sudan. The South has no intention to separating from the North, for had that been the case nothing on earth would have prevented its demand for separation. The South claims to federate with the North, a right that the South undoubtedly possesses as a consequence of the principle of free self-determination which reason and democracy grant to free people. The South will at any moment separate from the North if and when the North so decides, directly or indirectly, through the political, social and economic subjection of the South.”

The betrayal of aspiration of Southerners led to collapse of Ismail al-Azhari’s and Abdallah Bey Khalil’s governments (1956 – 1958) as their shifting coalitions got characterized by rivalling, strikes, violence, mutinies, imprisonments, dismissals, nepotism, divisions, conspiracies, vote of no confidence, change of electoral laws, budget crises, suppression of contrary opinions, and insensitivity to people’s predicaments caused by the raging civil war.

General Ibrahim Abboud’s Government (1958 – 1964) made things worse by banning discussions on self-rule (federalism); restricting recruitment of Southerners into armed forces except those who converted to Islam and embraced Arab culture; adopting Missionary Society Act (1962); expelling hundreds of foreign Christian missionaries from Sudan in 1964; and deploying Muslim missionaries and Arabic teachers to the South. The Junta used repressive military power (e.g., indiscriminate detentions, torture, the assassination of Southern intellectuals, burning of villages and massacre of the civilians) to subdue the Southern resistance.

The exiled Southerners sought refuge in the sympathetic eastern and central African neighbouring countries, organized themselves into associations and liberation political groups: The Sudanese Christian Association in East Africa (SCAEA) and the Sudan African Closed District National Union (SACDNU) formed in 1962 and transformed to Sudan African Union (SANU) in 1963 with formation of Anyanya (snake poison) as an armed wing in 1964.

It didn’t take long before the Junta of General Abboud collapse finally as it failed to end the oppressive war in the South. The educationist Sirr al-Khatim al-Khalifa took the charge of the post-uprising interim government with the participation of Southern Front (SF), most of whose leaders were young university graduates and local chiefs. Queen Elizabeth of the U.K visited Sudan (February 8, 1965) where Interim Supreme Councillor, H.E. Mr. Luigi Adwok received her in Khartoum when he was the Rotational Head of State for Sudan for that month, an honour detested by Northerners as it raised the political self-esteem of Southerners.

The traditional Northern political leaders (i.e., Khatimya, Ansars, Unionists, Communists & Islamists) got divided on how to handle “the Southern Problem” even when the Round Table Conference and 12-Man Committee were launched in 1965 to bring all the political forces and different shades of opinions together to deliberate on how to end the civil war and normalize the country again, especially in the Southern part of the country. But the Conference failed its objectives of healing the old wounds of slave trade and slavery—tributes to St. Josephine Margaret Bakhita (1869 – 1947) of Roman Catholic Church who got rescued from humiliation of slavery and to Effendi Ali Gifoon—known as Lwaldit Mayker of Fashoda village, the slave who became an outstanding fighter of Turko-Egyptian army in Mexico during South American wars (1862 – 1867) and also in the war against Mahdiyya (1898 – 1900) where he accompanied General Herbert H. Kitchener in his conquering expeditions. Its resolutions were thrown into politicization dustbin for the sake of partial elections and maintenance of shifting conspiratorial governments of Imam Sadiq al-Mahdi’s and Mohamed Ahmed Maghoub (1965 – 1969).

Additional number of movements and declarations propped up for liberation of Southern Sudan from the Sudan: Azania Liberation Front was formed by Joseph Oduho in 1965, Nile Provisional Government by Gordon Mourtat in 1969, Anyidi Provisional Government by Emedio Tafeng after crashing the Nile Provisional Government in 1969, the SUE Republic and Sudan African Union Conservatives declared by Michael Towil in 1969, and South Sudan Liberation Movement in 1971 by Joseph Lagu. The shifting governments in Khartoum kept harassing, massacring, arresting and assassinating Southerners (e.g., assassination of Fr. Saturnino in 1967 while mobilizing Anyanya forces at Uganda Border & William Deng Nhial in 1968 while campaigning for partial elections in Bahr el Ghazal); committing massacres; massacring of intellectuals in Wau where Southern First Veterinary Doctor from University of Khartoum Justin Papiti Akol Ajawin was shot dead with others in a wedding occasion and also in Juba and Malakal). Khartoum forces burnt many villages and closed down schools for a scorch-earth policy of punishing Southern civilians for supporting the Anyanya guerrilla.

Prime Minister Sadiq tried to improve Sudan’s relations with Uganda, Congo, Kenya and Ethiopia to help his government to crush the rebellion in the South. But the forced submission to the will of Khartoum under pretext of restoration of law and order in Southern Sudan pushed Israelis to support the South against the Arabized Islamists of the Sudan who wanted Israel wiped out from the geography of the Middle East (indicated by Israel-Egypt War in 1967 and solidarity by Khartoum). The British volunteer guerrilla trainer known as Uncle Fashoda and Israeli retired Army General Kawagia John trained the Anyanya freedom fighters rigorously as he confirmed in 2013:

“The building of the military force in the South provided the basis and military framework which resulted in both command and operational experience. The above changed the situation of years whereby the North could harass the population in the South. The Anyanya soldiers demonstrated a high level of discipline, a willingness to learn all relevant subjects and above all to demonstrate stubbornness in sticking to their mission.”

It was just a matter of time before the government in Khartoum collapsed to the guts of the second military coup (1969 – 1985) led by Jaafar Mohamed Nimeiri in collaboration with the Sudan Communist Party. The Junta banned multi-party politics and adopted a one-party presidential-parliamentary system under the umbrella of Sudan Socialist Union (SSU)—politicians, teachers, farmers, technicians, professionals, intellectuals, armed forces, youth and women. From the onset, Nimeiri acknowledged “the Southern Problem” and diagnosed it as being caused by local backwardness and western imperialism, similar to the findings of the Committee of Inquiry on Southern Unrest in 1955. He prescribed the solution to be the treatment of Southern Sudan as a unique region with its own diversity of culture and mode of rule within the bigger united, stable and prosperous Sudan.

Nimeiri issued a general amnesty for Southern opposition politicians and Anyanya fighters, promising them higher education opportunity and top public jobs (e.g., appointing first Southern law graduate of University of Khartoum, communist Joseph Garang, as Minister of Southern affairs though he hanged him to death later with Hashim al-Atta and other Communists for a foiled coup in 1971 but replaced with another Southern lawyer from University of Khartoum, Abel Alier Kwai). Moscow, Beijing, Libya and other communist countries isolated Nimeiri’s regime and motivated the traditional Islamic Northern political forces to harden their opposition to topple his government. Nimeiri had no choice but to look west for support from the U.S and the capitalist allies, including churches and Zionic lobbyists. He recommitted himself to resolving “the Southern problem” in accordance with the resolutions of Round Table Conference (1965). The World Council of Churches and the All African Council of Churches agreed to meditate the peace negotiations between Nimeiri’s regime and Anyanya leaders.

Though by then the Anyanya and South Sudan Liberation Movement (SSLM) were better organized under the young graduate of Sudan Military College, Joseph Lagu, he was faced with tremendous pressure for peace. Ugandan government became unsafe and unstable under President Idi Amin who arrested Mr Rolf Steiner (the volunteer German Anyanya trainer) and handed him over to Khartoum where he was imprisoned for life. Zaire government of Mobutu Sese Seko got closer to Khartoum through Arab countries that funded his deficit budget and offered him other benefits. Ethiopian government of Emperor Haile Selassie improved its relations with Sudan and couldn’t tolerate Anyanya rebellion within or across the borders. Humanitarian donors (e.g., Norway, Denmark, Sweden, UNHCR and Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan), Southern refugees and intellectuals pressed hard on the rebel opposition to minimize the divisive wrangling and agree to a peaceful settlement.

The 1972 Addis Ababa Peace Accord between SSLM and Nimeiri’s government brought back the lost sanity. The Relief and Resettlement Commission was established with the mandate of 1) establishment of adequate reception centres containing facilities for shelter, food supplies and medication; 2) arrangement of transportation of refugees to permanent resettlement places of origin; and 3) provision of materials and equipment for executing this work. Christian missionaries and humanitarian NGOs were encouraged to assist the people of Southern Sudan with service delivery and community development projects (UNHCR, UNICEF, WHO, UNDP, FAO, German Caritas, Norwegian Church Aid, Lutheran World Service, Catholic Relief, ACROSS, etc…), including continuous assistance for student refugees until appropriate arrangements were made for their repatriation and resettlement.

The peace agreement provided for special security arrangement for Southern Command (12,000 troops with 6,000 Southern Sudanese distributed equally to its 3 regions and integrated into the Sudan Defense Forces within 5 years as managed by Joint Military Commission & Joint Cease-fire Commission). It also granted autonomy to Juba with jurisdiction over Southern Provinces (Bahr el Ghazal, Equatoria and Upper Nile), and where other culturally and geographically associated areas to Southern Complex (e.g., Abyei) would decide via referendum whether to join the South or remain where they have been transferred in Northern Sudan.

The High Executive Council (HEC) was constituted together with the People’s Regional Assembly (PRA) to govern the South in a parliamentary system where the citizens would elect their representatives democratically via secret ballot. The PRA had to legislate for Southern Sudan in accordance with the Sudan’s constitution and the provisions of the peace agreement as incorporated into the Organic Law of the Regional Government, including Public Service and Economic Institutions (e.g., revenues from taxation, profits or loyalties accruing to the Central Government from exports in Southern region, and grants-in-aid or donations). English was affirmed as the principle language for the Southern Region without prejudice to the use of any language or languages that would serve a practical necessity for the efficient discharge of executive and administrative functions of the Regional government.

The Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie visited Juba to participate in the anniversary celebration of Addis Ababa Agreement (March 3, 1973). He donated the Multipurpose Training Center (MTC) in Juba for promoting developmental skills. The Tanzanian President Julius K. Nyerere also visited Juba (October 1974) and advised Southerners to be patient with implementation of the peace accord. He donated ox-ploughs and agricultural hand tools with large quantities of maize seeds. The Libyan President Muammar Gaddafi visited Wau to participate in the Peace Agreement Anniversary (March 3, 1975) where he tried tipped Juba to conspire in overthrowing Nimeiri’s regime.

The Addis Ababa peace dividend blessed South Sudan with the opening of University of Juba in 1975 alongside Yambio Institute of Agriculture, Institute of Veterinary Science and Institute of Rural Development. Egypt, U.K and U.S offered some scholarships for competitive Southern Sudanese students to pursue tertiary education and come back home to contribute in building the country. The U.S.A Government constructed communications station (television, radio, telex and telephone) in Juba. The USAID paved a 500-mile road from the border of Kenya via Nadapal to Juba. Yugoslavia built the regional Government Complex in Juba with only 5 million USD (Big Parliament, 11 Ministries and 28 Residences). The Government of Netherlands through its business company built the Nile Bridge in Juba (the only bridge build on the Nile in the territory of South Sudan since the beginning of God’s creation). The contingent of British Royal Army Engineers built Tonj Bridge and repaired other bridges and roads in Bahr el Ghazal. The Federal Republic of Germany Built the Bussere Bridge and repaired a 600-mile road from Juba to Wau. The Government of Kuwait established a coordination office in Juba headed by Ambassador Abdalla AI-Seraie to monitor Kuwaiti projects (e.g., AI-Sabah Children Hospital, Friendship Primary and Junior Schools, Nyakuron Cultural Center, Juba Broadcasting Station, Hai Kuwait Residential Area and Kuwait Mosque). Chinese Medial Team provide medical services in Juba Hospital and other parts of Southern Sudan.

Juba stood firm in honour of Addis Abba Peace Agreement when northern opposition (Umma Party) armed elements attacked Khartoum in 1976 and President Nimeiri went hiding for few days. However, the Field Marshal Nimeiri’s political behaviors became unpredictable when he declared ‘National Reconciliation’ in 1977 and 1978 with leaders of traditional northern political parties that were opposed to peace in the South, especially Sadiq al-Mahdi and other Muslim Brothers. Nimeiri decided to dishonour the peace accord by encroaching unilaterally and illegitimately on the land rights of Southern Sudan. He linked up with Egyptian Government to dig 360 kilometer Jonglei Canal (1974 – 1984) despite the outrage by the people of Southern Sudan who felt the threat on the environmentally rich Sudd Region (blockage of 350,000 m2 of grassy wetland and lagoons of 30 rivers converging naturally with plenty of variety of fish that die of old age). Also Khartoum tried to redrew the South-North boundaries with intention to annex oil and agricultural rich areas (Bentiu, Hofrat el Nehas, Kafia Kingi and Northern Upper Nile region) to the North, and to issue unilaterally oil exploration licenses (e.g., to American Chevron in 1974 and to French Total and Royal Dutch Shell in 1980), including construction of refineries in the North to process the pipe-lined Southern crude oil or ship it to international markets via Port Sudan with no returns to the South.

Nimeiri’s violations of peace agreement was exacerbated by the divisions and lack of unity of Southern the leaders under the conspiratorial groupings of Joseph Lagu and Abel Alier who were used by Khartoum by short-changing them in power as the Jellaba wished. His disruption of armed forces integration process in the South and declaration of the peace agreement as not Bible or Quoran provoked the discontented Anyanaya veterans to rebel (Kerubino Kwanin Bol in Bor on May 16, 1983 joined by William Nyuon Bany in Ayod on June 6, 1983, Dr. John Garang de Mabior from Panyigor, among others) and go to border of Ethiopia to form the Sudan People’s Liberation Army/Movement (SPLA/M) with the Manifesto that called for liberation of the old Sudan from bourgeoisie and marginalization so as to realize a new Sudan of camaraderie, nationalism, secularism, socialism, equality, freedom, justice, prosperity and respect of human dignity; signified by self-rule and equitable development regardless of gender, race, family, ethnicity, tribe, region or religion.

“In 1956 our country gained formal independence but entered into the era of neo-colonialism. Since then a small parasitic clique that had mutated from a pre-independence system of exploitation and took over the formal instruments of oppressions in the form of the state for their own interests and against the interest of the majority of the Sudanese people. This clique has utilized the multi-racial and multi-religious character of Sudanese society to perpetuate their rule and to keep our people undeveloped and backward.” – Dr. Garang in 1983.

The renewed struggle went beyond “the Southern Problem” with civil war paralyzing the economy and causing humanitarian catastrophe, which become unbearable for civilians and armed forces to tolerate. The professional and trade unions became restive as they demanded for an increase of salaries to cope with hyperinflation while government dragged its feet. The judges went on strike as Nimeiri imposed Islamic Penal Code (Sharia) to cuts of hands petty criminals and hang to death the black market dollar traders together with the accused of apostasy (e.g., capital punishment against Mahmoud Mohamed Taha).

Nimeiri failed to survive in politics by nooks and crooks and without peace in the country. The wrath of people’s power and second popular uprising in Sudan caught up with his intransigence as he was on medical treatment visit to Washington-DC in April 1985. The American generosity and CIA-led foreign policy under President Ronald W. Raegan’s Administration had to stand with the people against the abnormal betrayal by Nimeiri. His diehards and arrogant apologists had to go hiding in shame, internally and abroad, as the plane carrying Nimeiri was landed in Military Airport in Egypt for the arranged exile of a fallen dictator. The Regional Government of Southern Sudan Government, which rescued Nimeiri in 1976 when Khartoum was put on fire by Libya-backed Northern opposition armed elements and mercenaries, was already destroyed by Nimeiri-induced ‘Kokora’ (divisive politics and tribalism instead of equality) with politicians scattered in disarray to Malakal, Juba and Wau in 1980s after the unconstitutional dissolution of Juba-based regional government.

The National Alliance for National Salvation (NANS) of the banned political parties, professionals and trade unions, and students convinced the Chief of General Staff of the Sudan Defense Forces, Lt. Gen. Abdel Rahman Suwar Al Dhab, to become the Head of the Interim Revolutionary Command Council and with Dr. El-Jizouli Dafallah as the Transitional Prime Minister. The SPLM/A signed the Koka Dam Declaration (March 26, 1986) with the NANS to end the war and adopt a just secular system of governance. However, it didn’t take long before partial elections brought back Sadiq al-Mahdi to assume the Premiership again without peace but more atrocities of war and creation of chaotic militias to terrorize Southern Sudan in attempt to defeat the SPLM/A militarily. Famine and humanitarian crises intensified in Sudan. The UN Secretary-General, Javier Perez, and the UNICEF Executive Director, James P. Grant, initiated the Operation Life-Line Sudan (April 1989) for the quick response. Though many fake internal and external peace initiatives were attempted the war continued relentlessly.

Sadiq al-Mahdi’s government had to collapse again in June 1989 when the third Junta’s coup overthrow him in collaboration with National Islamic Front where Dr Hassan El-Turabi was the ideologue. Islam was officially sanctioned as government’s policy. Holy war was declared against the SPLM/A. Radical international Islamists, including Osama bin Laden, got involved in the pursuit of the Holy War and enforcement of “Islamic Civilization Project”. Mengistu Haile Mariam of the Derg Regime in Ethiopia was deposed and SPLA/M got split into Naser and Torit factions. The Frankfurt (1992) declaration on self-determination for Southern Sudan, the Abuja I and Entebbe (1992), Abuja II (1993) and other peace initiatives were attempted but failed due to the intransigence of the warring parties.

The IGAD’s Declaration of Principles (1994) for achieving peace in Sudan was adopted: dialoguing for a just political solution, affirmation of the right for self-determination, making unity in diversity attractive with secular democracy, guaranteeing fundamental freedoms and human rights, realizing appropriate and fair sharing of wealth, and ceasefire and interim arrangements. The National Congress Government exploited the divisions within the SPLA/M and initiated some short-lived internal peace deals (Khartoum Peace Agreement in 1997 and Fashoda Peace Agreement in 1998) to pave the way for the protection of oil areas in Southern Sudan. The Chinese, Indian, Malaysian, Canadian, French and Swedish oil companies got involved in the oil business in Sudan despite human rights concerns on the scorched-earth policy against the local population in oil fields. Khartoum shipped the first oil consignment to the international markets in 1999, emboldening its arms sale capabilities for military victory against the SPLM/A and enforcement of its Islamic policies and Arabization of Southern Sudan.

The Zionic Lobbyists, the Churches, humanitarians NGOs, and human rights activists persuaded the U.S. Congress and President Bush to intervene robustly in order to end the war and achieve peace in Sudan, using “Carrot and Stick Policy”. Osama Bin Laden’s terroristic attack on the biggest Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon (9/11/ 2001) made George W. Bush Jnr’s Administration press for peace in Sudan. The SPLM/A factions got reunited under the leadership of Dr John Garang. The IGAD and its partners and friends (Troika, Italy, China, Netherlands, EU, AU and UN) were able to make a breakthrough with the mediation of the Machakos Protocol (July 2002), which endorsed the previous IGADD’s Principles. This paved the way for agreements on Security Arrangements (September 2003), Wealth Sharing (January 2004), Power Sharing (May 2004), Resolution of the Conflict in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile (May 2004) and Resolution of the Abyei Conflict (May 2004) mediated by the IGAD Special Envoy and Kenyan Army General, Mr. Lazarus Sumbeiywo.

The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) made the Sudan Government in Khartoum to grant a special autonomy for the Government of Southern Sudan (2005 – 2011) in Juba and in control of the 1o states in the South based on a separate secular Interim regional Constitution (2005). The SPLM became the ruling party in the South while its military wing, the SPLA, remained as standing army alongside with other organized forces. The oil wealth was shared between South and North. The developmental multi-donor trust fund was established and coordinated in Juba to assist in post-war reconstruction and normalization Southern Sudan.

Despite the hitches between Juba and Khartoum, the 2010 general elections confirmed the incumbent SPLM/A and NCP leaders to continue in the same power positions and make unity of the Sudan attractive. But the people of Southern Sudan overwhelmingly voted for separation in the January 2011 Referendum. The independence was declared with national euphoria and international admiration. In this regard, the Government of Field Marshal Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir (1989 – 2011) could only be considered as partially collapsed after South Sudan broke away officially from Sudan in July 2011. President al-Bashir has been a bit lucky because the IGAD and the African Union were ready to cheer him up in solidarity as his government continue to facing tremendous political and economic difficulties, some of whose mitigations were designed in the expense of oil revenues accruing from independent South Sudan (e.g. paying Transition Financial Arrangements of 3.028 billion USD and hiring Sudan-based oil pipelines costing unfair 24.5 USD per a barrel). That unfair deal was negotiated by the leaders of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) under the mediation of African Union High-Level Implementation Panel who favoured Sudan to get compensated by South Sudan for its losses. Part of the cause of 2013 spike of the crisis in South Sudan could be traced to that deal and the oil flow shut-down in 2012 by Juba to the dismay of the world.

Abel Alier’s Book “Too Many Agreements Dishonored: Southern Sudan” and Dr. Lam Akol’s Book “SPLM/SPLA: Inside an African Revolution” had captured succinctly the machinations and hegemonies of governments of the Jellaba of Sudan but also the problems of Southern leaders (e.g., unity, federalism, armed forces, Jonglei canal, oil fields, land tenure, tribalism, the price of dishonoring peace agreements, regimes collapses, prospects for political settlements and multi-party politics). Both of these experienced politicians were convinced that the Machiavellian politics on economic and social progress in Southern Sudan was a farce without peace, security, stability, tranquillity, good policies, stable government, professional workforce, financial resources, pluralism and inclusivity.

IV. LESSONS FROM SURVIVAL & COLLAPSE OF SUDANESE GOVERNMENTS

In recapitulation, the subsequent collapse governments of independent Sudan, which kept short-changing themselves in Khartoum between military and civilian politicians had the same colonial ‘master-slave’ mercantilist mentality of extractive hegemony and alienating marginalization of Southern Sudan and the adjacent backward areas. Their political misconduct was met with fierce resistance by the liberation fighters who could not tolerate the disruption of the originality of cultural and religious settings and traditions of native African tribes; their kinship value system of totems and taboos; their believe in God as the source of all life and to whom all human persons should be responsibly accountable; their reverence of inter/intra generational powers of diviners, herbalists, warriors, elders and living-dead; and their preference for Christianity than Islam.

The hinted refreshing historical knowledge about the critical junctions of survival or collapse of governments and oppositions in independent Sudan could be summarized in these points: imprudence of government and opposition leaders, politically motivated raging senseless long civil wars, discontent of citizens with corrupt political economy, popular uprisings due to sharp economic shocks on purchasing power of ordinary population, aggressive foreign sanctions provoked by humanitarian despair, and international lobbying for restoration of democratic civic duty in an environment of peace. Tough Lessons should be learnt here for shaping a way forward for a better South Sudan because history doesn’t forgive faltering leadership.

The exposed historical blunders should sent alerting signals and disqualify any consolation of political fallacy of the blind content that the earth will go around the sun normally with the morning and night passing daily for the status quo to remain triumphant against all odds of the pressing change. It should also shift the paradigm and present alternative keys that must unlock the potentials of finding reliable innovative solutions for a government and opposition of peace and happiness in South Sudan, based on liberal democratic culture of checks and balances with periodic trustworthy fair elections that are upheld legitimacy by both winners and losers. The glimpses from history should move the good people convincingly to withdraw their confidence from any bad political leader in South Sudan who cannot think outside the box to implement the vows of peace, justice, liberty and prosperity incrementally with spirit of stewardship and dynamic synergy of the stakeholder’s performance on the following mandate:

1) Commit to full and timely implementation of the revitalized ARCSS with oversight by reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (JMEC) and its Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements Monitoring Mechanism (CTSAMM); 2) Consolidate the restored security and peace in collaboration with IGAD and Partners; 3) Promote Human Rights and Fundament Liberties for Preservation of Dignity; 4) Fast-track and Provide Protection for Humanitarian Relief, Repatriation, Resettlement and Rehabilitation of IDPs and Refugees; 5) Recover the Economy and Manage it Effectively with Prudence, Transparency and Accountability for the Welfare of the People; 6) Rebuild the Destroyed Infrastructure and Construct new Public Facilities; 7) Provide Services for Human Development and Stable Livelihoods; 8) Expedite Public Service Reforms and Transformation for Civil and Armed Sectors; 9) Facilitate Transitional Justice, Reconciliation and Healing; 10) Devolve Powers and Allocate Development Resources to States and Counties; 11) Initiate and Finalize Permanent Constitution-making Process; 12) Facilitate the Conduct of National Population Census and Household Survey; 13) Facilitate Credible Conduct of Elections Before the end of Transitional Period; and 14) Perform the normal Functions of Government, Horizontally and Vertically.

Today is Nakba (‘catastrophe’) Day, when Palestinians commemorate the cataclysm of their expulsion from their homes in 1948. The most important voices to hear today are theirs: before they read Western commentators, anyone who cares about the tragedy of the Middle East should read Palestinian ones. There could be few better places to start than this powerful meditation by Randa Abdel-Fattah on loss, rage and hope.

But it is also important for those of us not directly affected by the ongoing ethnic cleansing of Palestine to show that we will not be silent: attending the demonstrations taking place around the country (in Sydney and Brisbane tonight, in Melbourne and Canberra on the weekend) are one obvious way to do so.

Protests are necessary, but they can seem a weak gesture in the face of the carnage on the Gaza boundary. Since the first Great Return March a month and a half ago, around ninety people have been killed by IDF snipers. The victims include at least two journalists and five children. As of midnight Sydney time on Monday, no less than 40 protesters had been killed, and over 900 injured in Gaza on that day alone.

As well as these assassinations, thousands of overwhelmingly peaceful Palestinian protesters have been deliberately shot, often causing devastating injuries, by members of the ‘most moral army in the world’. In at least 17 cases, amputations have been necessary. With mass crossings of the Gaza fence expected this week, the death toll can only mount tragically higher.

Israel’s actions have been documented and denounced by organisations like Medicins Sans Frontiere and Human Rights Watch. Yet, true to form, Western leaders, Australia’s included, have stayed eloquently silent. That silence expresses better than words the moral bankruptcy over Israel that has long been normalised within the Western ruling class. The US lobby group Jewish Voice for Peace recently took out newspaper advertisements noting that as of May 10, only 21 out of 535 members of Congress had spoken out against Israeli brutality during the Great March of Return protests.

Fresh from our newly signed defence cooperation agreement with Israel, official Australian reaction to Israel’s Gaza slaughter has been precisely nil. It’s not, apparently, that Australian authorities are unmoved by loss of life: it just depends whose life it is.

On April 26, after four Fridays of protests, with 40 Palestinians already killed and 5511 wounded, Chris Cannan, the Australian ambassador to Israel, finally broke his silence – to tweet his sympathy after the drowning of 10 Israeli high-school students on a school excursion.

The ambassador stated he was ‘Deeply saddened to hear of the tragic loss of so many young lives today’ and that his thoughts were ‘with the students’ families and loved ones, and the people of Israel, at this terrible time.’ Neither he nor any other Australian Government official has had any ‘thoughts’ or sadness to express about the loss of young Palestinian lives, before or since.

Australia, Israel’s best friend

Cannan’s attitude is nothing new. On his visit to Australia in 2017, Netanyahu said that ‘there is no better friend [than Australia]for the state of Israel’. He wasn’t greatly exaggerating. The UN committee that drafted the 1947 Partition resolution creating Israel was chaired by an Australian, HV Evatt, as local politicians often remind us. A glance at Australia’s recent UN voting record speaks volumes about Australia’s position on the “extreme fringe” of world opinion on Israel.

In a 2012 vote making Palestine a UN non-member state, we abstained. In 2013, when a record 162 countries called for a stop to “all Israeli settlement activities in all of the occupied territories” and condemned any attempts to desecrate the Al-Aqsa Mosque, we abstained. We even voted against a UN resolution declaring the following year, 2014, the International Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. Faced with a proposal in the UN Security Council demanding Israel end the occupation of Palestinian territories within two years, we abstained.

At the same time, the Abbott government took the extraordinary step of ruling out using the term ‘occupied’ when describing Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem. In 2016, Australia indicated it didn’t support the UN Security Council resolution condemning the construction and expansion of settlements. Last year, when the UN passed a resolution in December condemning the projected move of the US embassy to Jerusalem, we abstained.

As my colleague Ben Saul, Professor of International Law at the University of Sydney has put it, “The Australian government has become an apologist for Israeli war crimes and a wrecker of sacred international humanitarian law principles.”

We can contrast Australia’s official attitude during the current Gaza protests with that of France, not well known for its fondness for Palestinians. In the wake of Israel’s Gaza outrages, the French foreign ministry told L’Humanité newspaper that ‘France condemns indiscriminate shooting by the Israeli army, calls for the lifting of the Gaza siege, and for restraint and the proportionate use of force.’ That statement falls scandalously short of what is needed, but it goes far beyond anything any Australian government official has found it in themselves to say.

Too complex to solve?

When criticized on our record, Australian politicians often fall back on the stock claim that the Middle East is ‘complicated’. It’s the same defence that Zionists themselves are quick to jump to when they want to justify Israel’s crimes. The Palestine question is just so complex, we’re told. The message is that unless you’re an expert, you simply don’t have the right to venture an opinion on the subject.

This reactionary mystification serves one purpose only: to quarantine Israel from the condemnation of public opinion. The idea that Israel-Palestine is somehow different from other questions of world politics – that people can have a view on what’s happening in Tibet, the US, or Myanmar, but that Israel is just too hard – is one of the strategies that Zionists use to delegitimize criticism.

We need to reject the notion that the Israel-Palestine question is characterized by a superhuman degree of complexity. Many well informed, expert analysts on the left — people like Gideon Levy or Randa Abdel-Fattah — tell us the exact opposite: that, actually, the situation is simple, that Palestinians themselves have been testifying for years about what’s going on and that, as a result, you don’t need to have studied or lived in the Middle East to be able to take a side.

Certainly, the fundamental consideration about Israel-Palestine politics couldn’t be simpler: the fact that in Israel, there is not one single place built that did not have a former Arab population. That’s not me saying it, or Gideon Levy or Randa Abdel-Fattah. It’s not even a Palestine supporter: it’s a quotation from Moshe Dayan, the Israeli general and defence and foreign minister in a lecture in Israel in 1969.

The Nakba is the root of the tragedy of the Palestinian people. When this obvious point is made, Zionists retort that it sounds a lot like calls for Israel’s dissolution, and go on to make an instant comparison to Hamas: apparently, anyone who wants Israeli apartheid replaced by a democratic state where Palestinians and Jews are equal can only be calling, like Hamas, for Israel’s ‘destruction’.

But Israel’s policies on Gaza and settlements, and the major legislative step just taken by the Knesset towards the legal establishment of Jewish-only communities in Israel, show us that it’s Israelis who want to replace Palestinians, not the other way around.

The new Hamas charter of 2017 states that ‘without compromising its rejection of the Zionist entity and without relinquishing any Palestinian rights, Hamas considers the establishment of a fully sovereign and independent Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as its capital along the lines of the 4th of June 1967, with the return of the refugees and the displaced to their homes from which they were expelled, to be a formula of national consensus’.

It’s true that the charter is an ambiguous document, but its de facto acceptance of Israel and the 1967 borders is a major concession. If that’s what Hamas is capable of while Gaza is being throttled, what could it do with an Israel that wasn’t intent on settlements, abided by international law, and let Palestinians work, travel and live in their homes?

Liberal Zionist pessimism

Complexity isn’t the only ideological mechanism which Zionists use in order to secure inaction over Palestine in the West. Another is pessimism. Liberal Zionists frequently tell us how pessimistic they are about peace. Australian Zionists Philip Mendes and Nick Dyrenfurth do so in their 2015 anti-BDS tract, Boycotting Israel is Wrong: they are, they say, ‘highly pessimistic about the chances of a peace deal being struck in the near future’. Mark Baker said something very similar just a few weeks ago at a Sydney Writers’ Festival panel.

We need to hear less from liberal Zionists about how depressed and pessimistic they are, and more about the urgency of justice for Palestine. No-one should care about Zionists’ pessimism: the main effect of their articulating it is to sap the audience of any commitment to acting for change.

Pessimism and depression are infectious, and lead inexorably in one direction: back to the status quo. On the surface, liberal Zionists may lament the fact that progress in Israel seems unlikely, but the effect is to deliver exactly the same message as Netanyahu: nothing is going to change, so Palestinian resistance is futile.

Writers and academics who want a just peace in the Middle East would do well to take some advice from an influential French Jewish intellectual of the first half of the 20th century, Julien Benda. In words that could have been addressed to the pessimistic liberal Zionists of our own age, Benda wrote that “when we see moralists, educators, professional providers of spiritual guidance, assert at the spectacle of human barbarism that ‘that’s what humans are like’, that ‘that’s how you have to take them’, that ‘you will never change them, we are tempted to ask them what is their reason for existing’.”

Benda’s question is a good one. If Zionist intellectuals can’t do better than proclaim their pessimism, it’s genuinely puzzling as ‘thought leaders’ what they see their role to be. If peace and progress are out of reach, why pour such effort into discussing them? Benda’s answer is categorical: by affirming the impossibility of progress, intellectuals “create that eternity of barbarism necessary to the maintenance of the institutions which are dear to them”.

Israel imprisons Gazans in a hell of undrinkable water, permanent power cuts, one of the world’s highest unemployment rates and periodic murderous assaults. It forces Palestinians on the West Bank to go about their lives in a rat-run of rubble, checkpoints and barbed wire. For as long as that assault on human decency continues, there will be a need for Zionist intellectuals to rationalize those crimes to a Western elite that has every reason to want to avoid criticism of Israel.

BDS: a global intifada for justice and peace

No-one thinks that peace can be forged overnight. But rather than proclaim their pessimism, anyone who really cares about peace in Palestine-Israel should embrace the currently most promising tactic of the Palestine solidarity movement: the boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign (BDS).

In the last few months, the pace of BDS actions has accelerated remarkably, especially on the cultural front. Figures as diverse as the NZ singer Lorde, Paul McCartney, Jean-Luc Godard and Natalie Portman have all refused ties with Israel. Not all of these personalities have been prepared to admit that they are implementing the boycott, but the reality is that, whatever they call it, that is exactly what they have been doing.

Disappointingly, the Australian singer Jessica Mauboy has recently made the opposite decision. The victory of Netta Barzilai in this year’s Eurovision Song contest, in which Mauboy took part, means that next year’s final will take place in Israel. This is a significant opportunity for the boycott campaign. Already, the Lord Mayor of Dublin has called for Ireland to boycott the contest.

In Australia, BDS efforts have recently been scaled up. Following a large BDS conference at Sydney University last year, the first Australian national BDS committee has been constituted, and is busy working on campaigns. Boycott activities are not new in this country, and have been far from unsuccessful. Marrickville council voted in favour of BDS in 2010 (the decision was subsequently overturned under intense pressure). At Sydney University, Jake Lynch won a landmark case establishing the legality of the academic boycott in 2014.

Last year, BDS activists successfully campaigned for the Royal Flying Doctor service to pull out of a multi-million dollar contract with the Israeli weapons and ‘security’ firm Elbit, who were going to supply them with a flight simulator. This year, academics at Sydney University made national and international news when over 40 of us pledged to cut ties with Israeli academic institutions. The same pledge has gathered over 20 signatures at the University of Wollongong, and efforts are underway on other campuses.

With the new national committee, BDS in Australia now has a national strategy and coordination, and there’s every reason to hope that boycott activity here will be significantly boosted.

Australia is far from the centre of the Israel-Palestine issue, but what happens here still matters. John Lyons reminds us in his recent book, Balcony over Jerusalem, that in the 2009 Israeli war on Gaza, Cast Lead, no less than three prominent spokespeople for the Israeli side were all Australians: Netanyahu’s spokesman, Mark Regev, and IDF spokesmen Benji Rutland and Guy Spiegelman. Regev is now Israeli ambassador to the UK.

The fortunes of Zionism in Australia are noticed in the world beyond it. Since the pressures on politicians to remain bankrupt are strong and most politicians’ willingness to resist them absent, civil society must act. If there is a preferable tactic to BDS, no-one has yet demonstrated it. Against the ‘passivism’ of Zionist propagandists, BDS is a global intifada for justice and peace through which everyone can actively contribute to the struggle for Palestinian rights.","Today is Nakba (‘catastrophe’) Day, when Palestinians commemorate the cataclysm of their expulsion from their homes in 1948.

43,https://time.com/5325315/peace-ireland-border-brexit/,"Fri, 29 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",TIME,What Brexit Means For Peace in Northern Ireland,"When I moved to Belfast for a three-year fellowship in September 2001, American news was covering a nasty episode in the capital of Northern Ireland. In a segregated neighborhood, a Protestant mob shouted abuse and threw bricks and blast bombs at Catholic schoolgirls whose parents—eventually joined by riot police—were escorting them to Holy Cross School. A week later, two planes crashed into the World Trade Center. Friends never again asked if I felt safe in Belfast, and the place disappeared from international headlines.

In recent months, Northern Ireland has dominated Britain’s negotiations to leave the European Union, as the Irish border has come to symbolize the challenges of Brexit. When E.U. leaders met in Brussels on June 28-29 and assessed the status of divorce talks, the E.U.’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier warned “huge and serious divergences” remained over the unique problems posed by this divided island.

Despite years of American investment in the Northern Ireland peace process, this issue has received scant coverage in the U.S. press and minimal engagement by the Trump Administration. In May, I returned to Belfast, along with Dublin and London; I spoke with over 40 people from government, media, business, and civil society about the implications of Brexit for politics, prosperity, and peace in my former home. What I heard should worry Americans.

Life After the Troubles

In 1921, the island was divided: the Republic of Ireland gained independence from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (U.K.), while the six northern counties comprising Northern Ireland remained part of the U.K. The region’s constitutional status has remained contested, as the unionist and largely Protestant community wishes to remain part of the U.K. while the nationalist and predominantly Catholic community wants Irish unification. This dispute caused decades of political turmoil and violence, often known as the Troubles. More than 3,600 people were killed.

In April 1998, the signing of the Good Friday Agreement/Belfast Agreement—comprised of an international agreement between the British and Irish governments and a multi-party agreement in Northern Ireland—heralded a comprehensive approach to governance, civil rights, policing, and justice. Peace talks were shepherded by George Mitchell, the former U.S. Senate Majority Leader who served as Special Envoy for Northern Ireland.

The fact that both the U.K. and Ireland belong to the E.U. has made this tenuous peace more viable—eliminating physical, economic, and psychological barriers and facilitating cross-border ties. Along with the peace process, the E.U.’s single market (which means the bloc functions as one territory without any internal borders or other regulatory obstacles to the free movement of goods and services) enabled the gradual dismantling of customs posts and military checkpoints along the border.

Northern Ireland slowly and quietly began moving in the right direction. Its new Assembly focused on routine issues of governance rather than contentious debates about identity. Invest Northern Ireland reports an influx of foreign investors focused on technology and financial services, with nearly 900 international companies employing around 100,000 people. I used to ride the bus to Dublin Airport for cheap Ryanair flights to the continent, unaware I had crossed an international border until I saw Gaelic street signs, kilometer speed limits, and euros. There are now dozens of direct flights across Europe. Belfast opened a museum about the Titanic (built at the local shipyard), served as the location for films and TV series (most notably “Game of Thrones”), revamped its city center with high-end shops and hipster cafes, and was named by Lonely Planet as the best travel destination in 2018.

Relations also improved between the U.K. and Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement created north-south and east-west institutions that enabled government officials to coordinate policies (such as agriculture and environment) across the island of Ireland. Queen Elizabeth made a state visit to Ireland in May 2011, the first trip by a British head of state since Irish independence. During a visit to Northern Ireland a year later, the Queen shook hands with Martin McGuiness, Deputy First Minister and former leader of the paramilitary Irish Republican Army (IRA). The conflict was personal for the Queen: her cousin, Louis Mountbatten, was killed in a 1979 IRA bombing. Her actions would have been unthinkable only years before.

And then Brexit happened.

Derailing the Brexit Process

In a June 2016 referendum, Britain voted to leave the E.U. by a narrow margin of 51.9 to 48.1 percent. London has now spent months entangled in messy negotiations with Brussels about the terms of separation, which will take effect on March 29, 2019. Northern Ireland, which was little discussed during the campaign, has proven the most complicated issue and could derail the process.

When leaders met at the European Council in December to assess progress on negotiations toward a withdrawal agreement, tensions quickly became apparent. The U.K. is currently part of the EU’s customs union and single market. After Brexit, it will leave both—raising the status of the Irish border to that of a customs border, with associated checks and controls. This does not just create practical and economic challenges; it is also politically and psychologically inconceivable for many who live there.

Although the U.K. committed to avoiding a hard border with Northern Ireland, it offered no formal proposals for doing so. Given uncertainty about the U.K.’s future relationship with the EU, Brussels insisted on a “backstop” provision to safeguard the status quo for Northern Ireland. If London is unable to devise alternative arrangements, the backstop says Northern Ireland will remain in the E.U. customs union and “full regulatory alignment” (at least for goods) with the single market. This effectively eradicates the need for checks and controls at the Irish land border, pushing them to sea and air entry points to the island of Ireland. In response to objections from unionists, London added a provision preventing “new regulatory barriers” between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K. These aims are mutually incompatible. The question is who blinks first.

Despite work in recent months, these differences were not resolved before leaders reconvened at the European Council on June 28-29. They expressed “concern that no substantial progress has yet been achieved on agreeing a backstop solution” and called for “intensified efforts” amid looming deadlines. Closer British ties with the E.U. would make it easier to manage the Irish border yet harder to achieve the autonomy that motivated Brexit.

May is running out of time in this high stakes face-off, as the U.K. could crash out of the E.U. with no deal. European Council President Donald Tusk cited a “great deal of work ahead” if the sides are to reach a deal by October. He warned May’s Cabinet, which meets next week to take major decisions on Brexit, that “This is the last call to lay the cards on the table.”

The E.U. has thus far backed Ireland, a small member state with existential policy concerns. Just last week European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker visited Dublin and warned the U.K. there would be no Brexit deal without agreement on the border. Yet Dublin fears Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s Taoiseach (Gaelic for prime minister), will be forced to make concessions when leaders next meet in October. Former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern described this nightmare scenario as “a Halloween party,” with Varadkar’s arm twisted at 2 a.m. to conclude the withdrawal agreement.

Brexit Fatigue

Dynamics in London, Dublin, and Belfast make the situation even more complicated. Theresa May became the U.K.’s prime minister in June 2016 after David Cameron resigned following the Brexit defeat. In an effort to strengthen her negotiating legitimacy, she held snap elections a year later. She had a disastrous result, falling 8 seats short of a parliamentary majority less than two weeks before EU talks began. In a dramatic twist, May became reliant on 10 MPs from Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) for a “confidence and supply” agreement (it supports the government on budget and confidence motions but is not bound by a policy platform).

In Ireland, Leo Varadkar—the young, gay, son of an Indian immigrant—has served as leader since winning a party leadership contest last June. All parties support the government’s stance in Brexit negotiations: an orderly U.K. exit that protects Ireland’s fundamental interests, including trade and a strong bilateral relationship. The challenge, an Irish official told me, “is how to achieve the first without damaging the second.”

In Northern Ireland, the Good Friday Agreement created an Assembly with a power-sharing executive to ensure representation of unionist and nationalist communities in policy-making. And although Sinn Féin, the largest nationalist party in Northern Ireland, and the DUP are on opposite sides of the Brexit debate, they sent a joint letter to May with shared concerns about its impact on Northern Ireland. Yet the region’s voice has been absent in these discussions since January 2017, when the executive collapsed amid a domestic political controversy; the polarized nature of politics amid Brexit have hindered efforts to revive the Assembly.

But May has now boxed herself in politically with a “trilemma” of three incompatible goals: an exit from the E.U. single market and customs union, no hard border with Ireland, and an all-U.K. approach to Brexit. If she reneges on the first, she will lose the backing of “Brexiteers” who would argue this undermines the point of the referendum. If she waivers on the second, Ireland (and the EU) would almost certainly reject the deal and the U.K. could crash out of the EU. If she caves on the third, the DUP could bring down her government. In recent months, British officials have explored various options, involving the creative collection of customs tariffs and advanced technology to monitor border crossings. To date, they have failed to find a workable alternative to the backstop. Brexit fatigue is palpable in London, with many arguing May simply needs to make a choice.

America’s Absence

Despite significant American investment in the Northern Ireland peace process across several administrations, Washington has been largely absent from these discussions. Former President Barack Obama visited London two months before the referendum and expressed support for “a strong U.K. in a strong E.U.”

In contrast, President Donald Trump is skeptical of the EU and called Brexit a “great thing.” He wants a free trade agreement with the U.K., which he described last summer as “a very powerful deal, great for both countries” that will get done “very, very quickly.” In reality, it seems unlikely a deal will be either quick (as most take 10 years to negotiate) or great for Britain. According to Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, the U.K. must choose between E.U. and U.S. regulatory models. American standards on agricultural products are controversial in the UK (particularly chlorinated chicken), while any divergence would hinder the U.K.’s ability to trade with the E.U. My Brookings colleague Tom Wright has described the Trump Administration’s approach as “a predatory policy, designed to take immediate economic advantage of the dislocations and vulnerabilities created for the U.K. by the Brexit process.”

American diplomats have quietly encouraged progress in negotiations, but the U.S. has mostly remained silent on what it views as a domestic matter. The Administration has not yet nominated an ambassador for Ireland nor has it decided whether to appoint an envoy for Northern Ireland. Although the unique nature of the current Administration elicited caution in all three capitals about greater U.S. involvement (with someone in Belfast telling me “we don’t want Trump tweeting about Northern Ireland”), there was agreement that American appeals to protect the Good Friday Agreement would resonate with those who ignore Brexit’s impact. While Trump reportedly mentioned Northern Ireland in a phone call with May earlier this month, his visit to London in July seems to be a good opportunity to convey this message more strongly.

Dividing Lines

Brexit has soured Dublin’s relations with London. A member of Irish civil society told me “Brexit triggered a historical muscle memory switch,” with tensions previously confined to the rugby pitch spilling out in daily life. My Irish interlocutors sounded like aggrieved younger siblings, as they lamented British television hosts who mispronounce “Taoiseach,” engage in “paddywhackery,” and caricature Irish politics.

Despite decades of IRA bombings in England, memories of the Troubles have faded there. Three English MPs caused outrage by suggesting the Good Friday Agreement “had outlived its usefulness” and was “not sustainable in the long term.” British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has repeatedly downplayed the threat, saying recently it is “beyond belief that we’re allowing the tail to wag the dog.”

Irish diplomats are quick to reject suggestions Brexit may lead to “Irexit,” understanding that E.U. membership gave a small and peripheral island an enhanced role on the world stage. In contrast, many outside observers see Brexit as the cry of English nationalism and are skeptical about May’s call for a “Global Britain.” As I sat in the British Foreign Office listening to a diplomat explain the concept, I looked out the window and saw a gilded, horse-drawn carriage deliver an African dignitary to a Commonwealth meeting. It was a relic of an imperial era when Britain truly had global reach.

Brexit negotiations have already caused damage in Northern Ireland, as the very idea has destabilized politics, divided families and communities, and forced people to choose sides. The Good Friday Agreement, which celebrated its 20-year anniversary in April, did not fully resolve past tensions. There were no peace commissions or reconciliation efforts, nor has there been an enduring answer to the constitutional question. Less than seven percent of children attend integrated schools, with former First Minister Peter Robinson describing the segregated system as a “benign form of apartheid which is fundamentally damaging to our society.” Localized violence remains higher in Northern Ireland than outsiders realize, with punishment beatings by paramilitary organizations increasing 60 percent in the last four years.

During my recent visit I toured the peace walls—erected to prevent attacks on residents living along the lines between mainly unionist and mainly nationalist areas. It was a marker of how physically close yet psychologically far the two communities live from one another. Community groups have toned down the militaristic nature of several murals, while some gates are staying open longer. Yet there are more peace walls now than in 1998, with the International Fund for Ireland reporting nearly 70 percent of Troubles-related murders took place within 500 yards of these walls.

Despite these remaining challenges, the Agreement allowed people to take a break from ever-present identity questions. Nearly everyone I met in Belfast lamented how Brexit has forced the return of “orange and green,” a shorthand reference to the constitutional preferences of unionists and nationalists. Many unionists supported Brexit. DUP representatives are unconcerned by border debates given their primary loyalty to Britain and loath to see the region have a “special status” (preferring “special circumstances”). Yet the reality is Northern Ireland has always been treated differently from the rest of the U.K. It is heavily subsidized by the British state. It is the only part of the U.K. where gay marriage and abortion remain illegal; it is even isolated from Ireland, which recently voted to legalize both measures. At the same time, the island’s economy has become heavily integrated, particularly in the agri-food sector.

In contrast, the overwhelming majority of nationalists voted to remain in the E.U. They view a hardening border as a political defeat given recent progress on demilitarization, a single economic market, and free movement. Sinn Féin has renewed calls for a “border poll” to determine whether Northern Ireland should remain part of the U.K. or join Ireland. A recent survey found increasing support for the E.U. in Northern Ireland amid the complexities of divorce, with 69 percent now backing Remain (compared to 56 percent in the referendum two years ago). Brexit has increased Catholic support for Irish unification: while only 28 percent would vote for a united Ireland if the U.K. remained in the E.U., 53 percent would support unification if the U.K. left the customs union and single market.

What the Future Looks Like

Irrespective of political views, a hard Brexit will affect daily life in Northern Ireland in myriad ways. Business representatives worry about transport delays, supply chain disruption, and new bureaucracy. The agriculture sector will be particularly hard hit, as it comprises 35 percent of Northern Ireland’s exports with nearly a quarter shipping to Ireland. All-island healthcare has grown amid high costs and limited demand, with Brexit raising questions about future access; for example, the closure of children’s heart surgery services at a Belfast hospital led to the joint creation of a pediatric cardiology center in Dublin. Brexit could limit citizens’ rights. The most frequently cited example is a provision in the Good Friday Agreement that allows those born in Northern Ireland to hold British passports, Irish passports, or both; it is unclear how the rights of Irish (E.U.) citizens will be enforced. On the policing front, the U.K. will lose access to the European Arrest Warrant that facilitated information sharing and extradition with Irish law enforcement.

My interlocutors were careful not to overstate the risk of renewed violence and did not expect a return to the Troubles, especially as there is no appetite for conflict on either side. Yet everyone was equally clear that any infrastructure on the border would be attacked. The Chief Constable of the Northern Ireland Police Service, George Hamilton, warned customs posts would re-emphasize “the context and causes of the conflict,” be seen as “fair game” by dissident republicans, and require 24-hour police protection. Three former Irish Taoiseachs echoed this concern, with one (Bertie Ahern) explaining: “You wouldn’t have to wait for violence—the communities on both sides of the border, with their bare hands, would pull down anything that was put up.”

Northern Ireland remains a place of contradictions and challenges, of tentative steps forward and shuffles backward. In a world dotted with frozen conflicts, the Good Friday Agreement provided an imperfect but workable solution for a war-weary population. Brexit has re-opened old wounds.

An irresistible force is preparing to meet an immoveable object; the lack of a solution to the “trilemma” means something will surely break. This year will define Northern Ireland’s future. Whatever the shape of the final deal, the people will likely have to live with its consequences indefinitely. Given the fragility of the situation, Americans should help Europeans do everything possible to protect the gains of the Agreement.

Robin Lloyd

As guests arrived at the Saturday afternoon party to celebrate the 80th birthday of Burlington activist, philanthropist and filmmaker Robin Lloyd, they were greeted at the garden gate by a wooden bowl filled with origami birds tied to strings. A handwritten sign suggested, ""Hang a peace dove somewhere!""

This small, symbolic gesture was just one of several acts of solidarity that guests could undertake to honor Lloyd's milestone. At one end of the dinner buffet, a card table was lined with political pamphlets, including pledge cards to support one of Lloyd's latest projects: a forthcoming documentary by Massachusetts filmmaker Robbie Leppzer, titled Theater of the Possibilitarians: The Story of Bread & Puppet, which chronicles the Glover-based political theater troupe.

It was classic Lloyd: One doesn't visit her longtime home in Burlington's Hill Section and expect to be a passive observer. Once you enter her sphere of influence, everyone steps up and plays a part, no matter how small.

Doreen Kraft, executive director of Burlington City Arts, is one of Lloyd's oldest friends and collaborators; for more than a decade, the pair traveled together through Haiti and Central America making films. At the birthday party, Kraft shared the story of how, upon meeting Lloyd in Rochester, Vt., in the early '70s, Lloyd asked her to help give an arts presentation at a local church. Five months after the event, the two were still there, sewing banners with church members.

""That's one of the most magical things about Robin,"" Kraft said. ""You go somewhere new, and you can end up ensconced in a new adventure.""

For most of her adult life, Lloyd has thrown herself into all kinds of adventures, hanging her ""peace doves"" across the land. A documentary filmmaker could recount the history of the American social justice movement in the last half century just by tracing the many projects, organizations and grassroots campaigns in which she's been involved.

The fruits of Lloyd's labors were well represented at her party. The 60 or so guests, who sipped wine and nibbled appetizers in her garden, hailed from a cross-section of organizations that she either founded or has supported.

At one table sat a group of white-haired activists from the Women's International League of Peace and Freedom, a peace organization cofounded in 1915 by Lola Maverick Lloyd, Robin's paternal grandmother. Robin has long been a financial contributor, board member and activist for WILPF.

At another table sat Wendy Coe; she and Lloyd cofounded Burlington's Peace & Justice Center (initially the Burlington Peace Coalition) in 1979. Nearby was James Haslam, executive director of Rights & Democracy. Previously, he ran the Vermont Workers' Center and, before that, PJC's livable-wage campaign. Lloyd has contributed to all three.

Haslam noted that Lloyd was one of the first people he met when he joined Vermont's social justice movement in 1999. Since then, he's been impressed by the breadth of issues in which she's been involved, he said, ""building an infrastructure"" that's endured for decades.

""It's not hard to get wealthy people to invest in heartstring issues,"" Haslam added. ""Robin invests in justice.""

And her investments aren't just monetary. Time and again, Lloyd has proven her activist cred through nonviolent civil disobedience. In February 2012, as part of a campaign to close the Vermont Yankee nuclear power station in Vernon, Lloyd was one of nine women who donned death masks and were arrested for trespassing in the Brattleboro offices of the plant's owner, Entergy.

That wasn't her first, or most consequential, arrest. In November 2005, Lloyd was taken into custody outside the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, formerly known as the U.S. Army School of the Americas, at Fort Benning, Ga. Since 1990, antiwar activists have held annual demonstrations there because the facility trains counterinsurgents, some of whom have been linked to human rights abuses. Lloyd served three months in a federal prison for her civil disobedience.

""She crossed the line,"" said Chris Lloyd, Robin's younger brother, referring to the now-ritualized process of how protesters get arrested at the annual marches. ""She's always crossing the line.""

At an age when most of her contemporaries have long since retired, Lloyd still seems to have an unquenchable thirst for the good fight. Admittedly, friends and family say, she's not as spry as she used to be. Lloyd now walks with a cane, speaks slowly and occasionally pauses mid-sentence to recall a name or detail from a protest, conference or project she worked on decades ago.

Nevertheless, those who know her assert that Lloyd's passion for her causes — opposition to war chief among them — burns as brightly as ever.

Ben Dangl is editor of Toward Freedom, the progressive international news journal founded in 1952 by William Bross Lloyd Jr., Robin's father. Dangl, who's worked for Robin since 2005, described her as ""a visionary"" who continually pushes the online magazine's freelance writers and board members to think and act as idealistically as she does.

""She's always off to another teach-in or march or demonstration,"" Dangl said. ""It's incredible to see that level of energy sustained the whole time I've known her.""

Journalist Greg Guma, Lloyd's onetime romantic partner and father to their son, Jesse, said that if Lloyd's political activism has waned in recent years, ""I don't see any sign of it.""

On June 27, the Vermont International Film Festival honors Lloyd with its 2018 VTIFF Community Champion Award, both for her own cinematic work and for supporting other local filmmakers for decades. The occasion allows Vermont's film community to celebrate one of its most generous and prolific patrons.

""Robin stands tall for her decades-long commitments to the arts and a potent and enduring progressive social vision,"" said filmmaker Jay Craven, of Kingdom County Productions in Barnet, in an email. ""She has supported my work for nearly 40 years and has been a dear and appreciated friend through thick and thin.""

Craven's partner and fellow filmmaker, Bess O'Brien, echoed that sentiment. She marveled at Lloyd's accessibility and willingness to support groundbreaking projects without expecting people to jump through the hoops of a laborious grant-application process.

""Filmmakers don't always have people who understand their work,"" O'Brien added, ""but Robin totally gets it.""

Lloyd's activism is often close to home, literally. Since the 1980s, she has routinely opened her house to refugees, asylum seekers and others in need of shelter — for days, weeks, even months. Garry Davis, the international peace activist who created the World Passport, was among her more famous houseguests.

At times, Lloyd has welcomed those shunned by others. In 2004, she hosted newly released parolee Steven Buelow. In August 1988, the then-14-year-old had raped and murdered his 7-year-old step-cousin, Crystal Sumner, in a Bristol cornfield.

""It was a terrible thing,"" Lloyd recalled of that horrific, high-profile crime, ""but we just felt that he was an underaged kid who deserved a second chance, despite the sadness of the act he performed."" He only stayed a short time — perhaps a few days to a week — and then moved out of state.

As a lifelong Quaker dedicated to compassion and nonviolence, Lloyd occasionally takes positions far removed from the political mainstream. As Burlington attorney, activist and longtime friend Sandy Baird pointed out, Lloyd was a vocal supporter of the rights of the Palestinian people years before that was an acceptable position to express publicly, even among fellow progressives.

But Lloyd has never shied away from alienating potential allies. In May 1999, she condemned then-Rep. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for his support of NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia. ""We had depended on you to speak truth to power in Washington,"" she told him before a crowded public forum in Montpelier.

Peter Clavelle, Burlington's seven-term Progressive mayor who hosts this week's VTIFF Community Champion Award event, once called Lloyd ""the conscience of our community."" But he admitted that she also could be ""a pain in the butt sometimes.""

Why? As Guma put it, Lloyd is a ""true believer"" who cleaves to positions, including unpopular ones, that she believes are moral and just. In May 2011, she and Baird called a press conference to condemn the assassination of al-Qaeda cofounder Osama bin Laden as ""an act of murder"" by the Obama administration. As Lloyd explained recently, ""The rule of law either applies universally, or it doesn't.""

She has even questioned whether it's morally defensible to kill Islamic State militants. In an op-ed piece published in the Burlington Free Press on April 16, 2017, Lloyd wrote: ""Do they hate us, or do they simply want us to get out of their space? ... Perhaps some of them are simply poor farmers who have been given a good salary for the first time in their lives.""

Critics might roll their eyes at Lloyd's idealism and seeming naïveté, but Baird sees Lloyd's principled stances not as weakness but as her greatest strength.

""Robin is consistently antiwar,"" Baird explained. For her, ""there are no excuses.""

If Lloyd has an Achilles' heel, Guma suggested, it's her unwillingness or inability to say no to people who need help.

Her son, Jesse Lloyd Guma, noted that his mother often pooh-poohs suggestions that she be more generous to herself when, say, she needs a new appliance.

""She'd rather give the money to the Haitian relief fund,"" he said. ""She's always been that way.""

Mavericks and Muckrakers

Lloyd's storied history began, as she told Seven Days in 2001, with the ""anarchist cows."" That's what she called the cattle that her paternal great-great-grandfather, Texas rancher Sam Maverick (1803-1870), refused to brand because he considered the practice inhumane. Through that small kindness, the San Antonio lawyer and land baron introduced the word ""maverick"" into the American lexicon — and the maverick identity into his bloodline.

In many respects, Lloyd has most closely followed in the footsteps of her paternal grandmother — Sam Maverick's granddaughter — Lola Maverick Lloyd (1875-1944). Lola's father was Henry Demarest Lloyd (1847-1903), the famed Chicago Tribune journalist and progressive. He was a muckraker long before president Teddy Roosevelt popularized that term, writing searing exposés about John D. Rockefeller and Standard Oil.

Lola was a suffragist, pacifist, feminist and philanthropist. She cofounded the Women's International League of Peace and Freedom and the Woman's Peace Party in 1915, and was among dozens of women who risked the perilous crossing of the Atlantic Ocean that year in an attempt to stop World War I.

""She became convinced that war was a terrible violation of human rights and justice,"" Lloyd explained, ""so she stuck with that for the rest of her life.""

Lloyd herself grew up in the tony Chicago suburb of Winnetka, Ill., one of four children of writers William and Mary Lloyd. Robin's father was a conscientious objector to World War II; he moved the family to California for two years so that he could perform alternative service as a firefighter. In 1949, the family relocated again, this time to Switzerland, while William completed his book Waging Peace: The Swiss Experience.

In 1957 and '58, Lloyd attended Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio. As part of the school's foreign studies program, she traveled to Africa with her father, an anti-colonialist campaigner.

Lloyd dropped out of Antioch in her junior year to marry Dan Papish, and then followed him to Brandeis University in Massachusetts. He enrolled in graduate school, and Lloyd earned a bachelor's degree in art history. In 1961, the couple moved to New York City, where Papish became a stockbroker and Lloyd fell in with Manhattan socialists. The marriage didn't last.

In the late '60s, Lloyd earned a master's degree in fine arts from Columbia University. In 1970, while she was working on a film about her then boyfriend, an artist, he took his own life. Devastated, Lloyd finished the film and then moved to Rochester, Vt., where her parents had bought 250-acre Wing Farm.

While teaching art in Rochester schools, Lloyd met Doreen Kraft. The two friends later relocated to Burlington and eventually bought the house on Maple Street where Lloyd still lives. In 1974, they founded Green Valley Film and Art, now the nonprofit Green Valley Media.

In the early '70s, Lloyd and Kraft traveled repeatedly to Haiti and Central America to make documentary films. Their 20-minute animated folktale ""Black Dawn"" recounts the story of Haiti's liberation from French colonial rule.

In 1976, while working on that film, Lloyd met Greg Guma. At the time, he was an instructor at the Vermont Institute of Community Involvement, which later evolved into Burlington College. (For years, Lloyd was a major donor to the now-defunct college and served on its board of trustees until 2013.) Guma, who'd studied journalism and the history of the muckrakers, said he had read Henry Demarest Lloyd's 1894 book Wealth and Commonwealth but didn't make the connection to Robin until years later.

Guma eventually moved into the Maple Street house. Jesse was born in 1978. Though Guma and Lloyd never married, and ended their romantic relationship, they've remained close friends. Guma has lived in the Burlington home off and on over the years.

In 1979, Lloyd launched the Peace & Justice Center, which focused initially on nuclear nonproliferation.

""The birth of Jesse was a turning point,"" Guma recalled. ""Robin was always a progressive type of person, but ... that really catapulted her into the peace movement.""

Now 39, Jesse is married and lives in Manhattan. He recalled that when he was young and his mother went to protests, he was ""pretty much at her hip through most of it."" In the early '80s, the Burlington Free Press ran a photo of Jesse as a toddler standing over his mother at a no-nukes ""die-in"" on Church Street.

But he noted that the most seminal experiences of his youth resulted from the near-daily stream of exotic travelers his mother invited to stay in their home.

""Sometimes people stayed for three days. Sometimes people stayed for three months,"" Jesse recalled. ""You never knew what you were going to get, but, amazingly, there was never a bad experience ... As a kid, you don't know that this is not normal.""

'Moral Compass'

In 1980, Lloyd ran for Congress on the Citizens Party ticket against incumbent Republican representative Jim Jeffords. Though she was a single-issue candidate, advocating for a nuclear weapons freeze, Lloyd garnered 14 percent of the vote statewide — and 25 percent in Burlington.

In March 1984, Lloyd was one of 44 local activists who staged a three-day occupation of the Winooski offices of Vermont's Republican senator Robert Stafford to protest U.S. military involvement in Central America. At the time, Stafford served on a committee that controlled military funding. In all, 26 protesters were arrested, including Lloyd.

The ""Winooski 44,"" as they were known, included a young peace activist who went on to make her own mark on Vermont: Deb Markowitz, the former six-term Vermont secretary of state and former secretary of natural resources under governor Peter Shumlin.

Markowitz had met Lloyd as a teenager through the Burlington peace movement while attending the University of Vermont. With Lloyd's help, she traveled to Europe to protest first-strike nuclear weapons at ""peace camps"" that WILPF erected outside of American military bases. Upon her return, Markowitz and her husband, Paul, helped organize the Winooski sit-in.

In a sense, the arrests and ensuing court case put the Reagan administration's foreign policy on trial. Ultimately, a jury acquitted all 26 defendants charged with trespassing, who'd argued that their sit-in was necessary to end the bloodshed in Central America. And, as Markowitz pointed out, the protest convinced Stafford to change his vote to end the military funding.

""Robin was an incredibly important presence because she held the moral compass,"" Markowitz explained. ""She's a quiet, unassuming person. And yet, her leadership in those years was really important.""

In the 1990s, with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, Lloyd shifted her activism to other global issues. In 1995, to mark the 80th anniversary of WILPF, Lloyd was among 240 women from 42 countries who rode a chartered ""peace train"" from Helsinki, Finland, to Beijing, China, to attend the United Nations' Fourth World Conference on Women.

Six years later, she flew to Durban, South Africa, to attend the 2001 World Conference Against Racism. The global progressive movement was feeling optimistic, Lloyd remembered, buoyed by the success of the ""Battle of Seattle"" in 1999. There, environmentalists, labor organizers and human rights activists had marched together and successfully shut down a meeting of the World Trade Organization.

In Durban, the cause for Palestinian rights and African American reparations took over the agenda. When attendees introduced language that equated Zionism to racism, the U.S. and Israel delegations withdrew from the UN-sponsored event in protest. Nevertheless, Lloyd recalled feeling a sense of accomplishment when she returned home.

She landed at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on a clear September morning. As Lloyd got off her plane, the news was just breaking that another airplane had flown into the World Trade Center. On her drive home to Vermont, she listened on the radio as the towers collapsed.

""We knew immediately that everything that had happened at our conference, all the ideas ... were probably going to be buried by the World Trade Center [attack],"" Lloyd recalled. ""Since 9/11, it's been a battle to even regain a sense of moving forward with the kind of justice structures that are needed.""

Crossing the Line

After the reelection of George W. Bush in 2004, which Lloyd called ""disastrous,"" she decided to get away from U.S. politics for a while — by going to prison.

On November 20, 2005, at the age of 67, Lloyd was one of 40 protesters who ""crossed the line"" at Fort Benning. Specifically, she crawled under a wire-mesh fence to issue a ""citizen's-arrest warrant"" to Col. Gilberto Perez, then-director of the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation. Her warrant cited the Universal Declaration of Human Rights — adopted by the UN in 1948 — which states in part, ""No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.""

Lloyd was arrested, charged, fined $500 and sentenced to three months in the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Conn. She described it as ""a very middle-class way of getting arrested.""

As Burlington attorney Baird recalled, ""She's the first client I've ever had who wanted to go to jail and didn't want me to help her get out.""

What did Lloyd expect to accomplish from her incarceration?

""In part I was doing it to say to people, this isn't such a bad thing,"" she explained. ""Unfortunately, I didn't convince anyone in Vermont to follow in my footsteps.""

Perhaps she didn't on that issue. But Charlotte Dennett, a Vermont investigative reporter, attorney and longtime friend of Lloyd's, credits Lloyd for giving her a copy of The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder, by Vincent Bugliosi. Famed prosecutor of Charles Manson and coauthor of Helter Skelter: The True Story of the Manson Murders, Bugliosi suggested that Americans had a tool to end the war.

""It suddenly hit me that what we could do about it was try to prosecute Bush for this illegal war in a state court,"" Dennett explained. ""So, I decided to take up Bugliosi's challenge.""

In 2008, the Progressives recruited Dennett to run for Vermont attorney general. Her platform: If elected, she would prosecute Bush.

""Robin was right there for me, and her [home] office was turned into our campaign headquarters,"" said Dennett, who later wrote a book about the experience. ""It was really a blast!""

Of all the organizations that Lloyd has supported over the years, the one that didn't survive was perhaps the most surprising: Burlington College. As a longtime board member, she endorsed moving the campus to the former Catholic Diocese building. That land-purchase deal eventually resulted in the school's financial collapse.

""Looking back, it probably was an overextension of what we could have managed,"" Lloyd conceded. ""We thought that Jane [Sanders, the college's last president] would have the contacts to make it happen.""

Ever the idealist — or optimist — Lloyd suggested recently that the school could yet be resurrected. After reading a recent Seven Days story about arts faculty cuts at UVM, Lloyd and Baird have talked about raising money to hire some of those lecturers to teach classes in a Burlington community center. The model would be similar to a course they organized at Burlington College in 2013, taught by local migrants, former refugees and scholars. Though still a nascent idea, Lloyd cautioned, ""Maybe it could rise from the ashes.""

At a time when much of America's political attention has turned inward, nationalist and xenophobic, Lloyd said she's kept her activist gaze focused on global solutions. Over the last 15 years, she's participated in five World Social Forums — in Brazil in 2003, Kenya in 2007, Michigan in 2010, Tunisia in 2013 and Montréal in 2016.

Lloyd described World Social Forums as ""global think tanks of progressive/radical politics that seek to create an alternative future from capitalist globalization.""

How does she keep from becoming disheartened in the age of Trump, when so many of her progressive values are under attack?

""Because of my connections and involvement with people's movements around the world, I don't sink into depression too much,"" Lloyd explained. ""As the Indian [author and activist] Arundhati Roy says, 'Another world is not only possible, she is on her way. On a quiet day, I can hear her breathing.'""

'The World Pulls Her'

About a year and a half ago, Lloyd informed Kraft that she planned to take a one-year hiatus from politics to focus on her art. Kraft was thrilled. As she explained, many Vermonters don't realize that Lloyd is an accomplished visual artist. Soon thereafter, Kraft said, Lloyd enrolled for a residency at the Vermont Studio Center in Johnson.

""And then, a month later, I see my inbox is filled with political messages [from Lloyd],"" Kraft said. ""I thought, Well, that didn't last long. It's so hard for her to not be an activist. The world pulls her.""

Baird agreed.

""She's tried, at times, to stop [her activism], but it's too much in her blood,"" Baird said. ""Somehow, Robin's never been able to give up politics.""

""I keep trying to, but it keeps not happening,"" Lloyd confessed with a laugh.

Currently, she's got plenty of projects on her plate, including the Bread and Puppet documentary. And, as part of her ongoing work with WILPF, Lloyd plans to bring two hibakusha, or Hiroshima atomic bomb survivors, to Burlington for the UN-sanctioned International Day of Peace on September 21.

A cynic might argue that Lloyd is still waging many of the same battles as her storied ancestors did, against war, racism, corporate hegemony and, now, environmental degradation.

What pushes her forward? The recognition, Lloyd noted, that these battles often aren't won in a single lifetime. ""And just waking up to the amazing beauty of the world,"" she added.

Toward the end of her birthday party, Lloyd shared with her guests a dream she'd recently had. In it, she climbed a staircase in a Winooski building still under construction. She arrived at a space where people were lying on the floor with their heads pressed together, forming the shape of a star.

""So, I laid down with them and we put our heads together and had a common dream,"" Lloyd told her guests. ""The trouble was, I don't know what the dream was, because that's when I woke up!""

To interpret its meaning, Lloyd drew from her knowledge of Haitian culture. In Haitian Creole, she explained, the phrase tèt kole translates as ""heads glued together"" — used to describe people collaborating on a common goal. She then looked around her lush gardens and gave shout-outs to the many friends and organizations she's helped cultivate over the years.

""We're all here,"" she said with a smile, ""with our heads glued together.""

“However”, said the report, “Given the wide disparity between the peace performance of the nations of South Asia, the aggregate data tell an incomplete picture. Bhutan, famous for trying to maximise Gross National Happiness rather than Gross Domestic Product, was once again the most peaceful nation in the region and was the most significant regional riser last year.”

“Strengthening scores on the Political Terror Scale, refugees and IDPs and terrorism impact were only partially offset by a deterioration in external conflicts fought after a border dispute with China flared in the Doklam Pass”, the report said, adding, “The three-month standoff also involved India, which sent troops to the area.”

The report further said, “Sri Lanka was again the second most peaceful nation in South Asia, and the second largest riser in the region last year. Although the scores for terrorism impact, the incarceration rate and military expenditure improved, there are some worrying signs for the future. The scores for both refugees and IDPs and political instability deteriorated, a reflection of waning confidence that President Maithripala Sirisena can deliver the reforms his government promised.”

Though ranking quite high compared to India, the report, simultaneously, pointed out, “Bangladesh had the largest deterioration in the region. Improvements in political stability and terrorism impact failed to offset a rapid fall in external conflicts fought, and neighbouring countries relations, which were adversely affected by the influx of 700,000 Rohingya refugees from neighbouring Myanmar.”

The report measures GPI using three domains of peacefulness: Ongoing Domestic and International Conflict; Societal Safety and Security, and Militarisation, reflecting the link between a country’s level of military build-up and access to weapons and its level of peacefulness, both domestically and internationally.

A Sydney-based non-profit institute has ranked India 136th in its Global Peace Index (GPI) of 163 countries across the globe, a “slight” (one point) improvement over the year. The report , “Global Peace Index 2018: Measuring Peace in a Complex World”, released by the Institute for Economics & Peace, has found, however, that except for Pakistan, all other neighbours ranked much better than India. Thus, while Pakistan ranks 151st, one of the worst in the world, Bangladesh ranks 93rd, Sri Lanka 67th, Myanmar 122nd, Nepal 84th and Bhutan, one of the best, 19th. Commenting on the “a slightly improved overall score” of India, the report claims: “Government efforts to tackle violent crime have paid off with an improved score, and falling levels of military expenditure, particularly on weapons imports, resulted in a slight improvement in its militarisation score.”At the same time, the report does not fail to notice, though without providing any evidence, “However, the concentration of power in the office of Prime Minister Narendra Modi led to deterioration in India’s score for political instability”.Interestingly, among the comparable BRICS countries, India’s 136th GPI ranking is worse than China’s (112th), Brazil’s (106th), and South Africa’s (125th), but much better than that of Russia (154th).The report’s data show that India’s “economic cost of violence”, as a result of different types of conflicts, came to 9% of the GDP, as against Pakistan’s 13%, Bangladesh’s 4%, Nepal’s 6%, Sri Lanka’s 8%, Myanmar’s 10% and Bhutan’s 8%.The report states that South Asia as a whole may have slightly improved its position in GPI, but “inequality of peace in the region continued to widen over the year, with the least peaceful nations – Afghanistan and Pakistan – continuing their decline, while the most peaceful – Bhutan and Sri Lanka – continued to improve.”","“The regional scores on the domains of Safety and Security and Militarisation improved, but Ongoing Conflict, particularly internal and external conflicts fought and neighbouring countries relations, deteriorated”, it added.

46,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/327095-algeria-celebrates-the-international-day-of-living-together-in-peace,"Fri, 08 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The News International,Algeria celebrates the ‘International Day of Living Together in Peace’,"Today Algeria, in unison with the rest of the world, celebrates, for the first time, the ‘International Day of Living Together in Peace’ in our country, this celebration takes on a particular dimension for several reasons.

This message was sent by the President of the Republic, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, on the occasion of the International Day of Living Together in Peace.

First of all, it is because the General Assembly of the United Nations proclaimed last December 8th this day of living together in peace, thanks to the initiative of the International Sufi Association Alawiyya, the NGO chaired by Sheikh Khaled Ben Tounès, with the support of his country Algeria.

This proclamation reflects the international community’s recognition of our country’s patient and successful efforts to promote a culture of peace, dialogue, mutual respect and tolerance among its own citizens.

Secondly, this initiative is driven by the moral, cultural, social and human values to which our moderate people are fundamentally attached. It expresses just as much the strong commitment of our people that these universal values take the place that should be theirs in the relations between the nations and the people of the whole world.

Thirdly, this proclamation represents a commitment of our country as well as the will of the international community to work more to promote the culture of peace and dialogue both within societies and between Nations, at a time where breaking lines and the factors of division multiply.

In the face of the theorists of civilizational confrontation, in the face of the partisans of the logics of exclusion, facing the promoters of extremism and multifaceted violence arising therefrom, including withdrawal, rejection and inferiorisation of the other, discrimination in all its forms, and unfortunately the phobia of the Muslim in particular, our country has constantly advocated the promotion of dialogue, understanding and cooperation between religions and cultures, drawing its references in the teachings of our holy religion Islam, the religion that advocates peace and coexistence as shown by centuries of history of humanity, across continents.

Starting from these noble values of Islam, religion of the people and the State in Algeria, that our brave people has been able to overcome their national tragedy marked by a barbaric and despicable terrorism that our country has confronted alone and isolated thanks to the sovereign determination of its people through his choice of peace and civil harmony. This generous choice found its source in the values of Islam which calls on men to reconcile, to unite their energies and to combine their efforts and their hopes around the realisation of the only worthwhile goal, that of strengthening national unity, the consolidation of the cohesion of our people, the protection of our national sovereignty and the construction, together in a united approach, of a modern Algeria to which each and from modern Algeria in which each and each of us is proud of belonging

It is in this respect that we need to incorporate the constitutional definition, with clarity and precision, of the components of the national identity of Islam, Arab and Amazigh identity and the need to exclude them from exploitation of political operations and politicians, the promotion of economic, social and cultural policies driven by the requirement of inclusiveness and social justice, as well as territorial development strategies guided by an equitable distribution of opportunities, national wealth and generated prosperity.

It is this very path that constitutes our choice and which makes us inscribe the dynamic of promoting our young democracy in that it contributes to anchoring in the minds and behaviors of men and institutions the intrinsic values of living together, by strengthening the rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.

It is also in this chapter that our country has made significant progress in promoting the rights and status of women in our society and its crucial role in protecting social cohesion and national, in the transmission of the founding values that have united the Algerian nation for millennia.

Lastly, the profound reform of the national education system, whose role in the formation of the citizen rooted in its country’s millennial history, is anchored in the authentic values of its people, the Citizen attached to work and sacrifice to preserve the independence of its country and build his prosperous future, the Algerian school is today called to spread more values of living together in peace among the millions of students.

At the international level, starting from this same base, and with the correctness of its convictions, our country joined its efforts with those of other countries to prevail between peoples the culture of peace, solidarity, tolerance and dialogue.

It is in this spirit that our country was among the first to advocate for the strengthening of the dialogue of civilizations, cultures and religions and to promote the culture of peace, thus actively participating in bringing the international community to confront, more and more, the troublemakers of conflicts and dissension between the peoples.

Thus, the Algeria never stopped, on the international level, to promote the principles, ideals and objectives of the UN Charter in international relations, and this as well in the settlement of political conflicts in the introduction of more balanced economic relations.

In this regard, our people can be proud of their country’s foregoing five decades of global dialogue aimed at building more equitable and integrated economic relations between developed and less affluent nations during an extraordinary general assembly convened by the UN.

Algeria’s action towards its immediate neighborhood and all its partners has always been guided by the principles of peace, coexistence, cooperation and good neighborliness.

At the time when the whole world is going to celebrate this 16th of May 2018, for the first time since the proclamation of the day “International Day of Living Together in Peace”, our country derives a legitimate satisfaction from having initiated this action which is for the long term and aims to create our future generations, and by themselves in the near future, a better world based on tolerance, mutual respect in the difference, diversity and solidarity.

Our people will have to persevere in promoting the culture of peace and living together in redoubling effort and consistency within our country, in a palpable way, through promoting civism, work and love of the homeland.

Through dignified behavior, we will be able to defend the true image of our religion, Islam, and our homeland, on the path of construction, prosperity and fidelity to our glorious martyrs.

In conclusion of this message, I address to the children of our people, wherever they are in Algeria or abroad, to present to them my best wishes on the occasion of the holy month of Ramadan, while praying the Almighty to accept their fasting and to grant them health and well-being as well as to the entire Muslim nation.","Today Algeria, in unison with the rest of the world, celebrates, for the first time, the ‘International Day of Living Together in Peace’ in our country, this celebration takes on a particular dimension for several reasons.

NYT – Ethiopia announced Tuesday that it would accept a 2000 peace agreement with Eritrea over their disputed border, potentially a major step toward resolving one of post-colonial Africa’s bloodiest and most protracted conflicts.

A statement by the governing party of Ethiopia, the second-most populous country in Africa, said it would “fully accept and implement” the agreement with Eritrea, a former province of Ethiopia, which was signed but never honored.

“The Eritrean government should take the same stand without any prerequisite and accept our call to bring back the long-lost peace of the two brother nations as it was before,” the governing party, the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front, said in the statement.

The countries fought a war from 1998 to 2000 over their border dispute, which left about 80,000 people dead. They signed a peace agreement in 2000, but the Ethiopians never accepted the findings of a boundary commission established by the agreement.

The border has been a deadly point of contention ever since, and the dispute had been widely regarded as a diplomatic stalemate.

But Ethiopia signaled a few months ago that it wished to resolve the problem when its new prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, vowed in his inaugural address to seek peace with Eritrea.

Ethiopia’s major objection was the boundary commission’s decision to award Eritrea the border town of Badme. The Eritrean government contended that there could be no resolution until the Ethiopians withdrew their troops from Badme, as the commission had ordered.

“It’s always been Eritrea’s position that the commission’s ruling is the commission’s ruling,” said Bronwyn Bruton, deputy director of the Africa Center at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based research group. “The Eritreans know they’re in the right.”

It remains unclear how the Eritrean government will respond to Ethiopia’s announcement. But Ms. Bruton said she thought that “Ethiopia is really signaling its seriousness” to finally resolve the dispute.","By Rick GladstoneNYT – Ethiopia announced Tuesday that it would accept a 2000 peace agreement with Eritrea over their disputed border, potentially a major step toward resolving one of post-colonial Africa’s bloodiest and most protracted conflicts.

48,https://dailytimes.com.pk/251050/fatas-conflict-traps-and-peace-prospects/,"Sat, 09 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Daily Times,FATA’s conflict traps and peace prospects,"On August 26, 2016, the FATA reforms committee completed its deliberations on reforms in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), which were presented to Prime Minister (PM) Nawaz Sharif in November 2016. Between December 2016 and May 2018, the people of FATA waited for implementation of these reforms. Yet, these reforms were unnecessarily delayed, making the entire process dubious and frustrating the tribal people. However, on May 25, 2018, the FATA merger bill was placed before the Parliament and was hastily passed with a two-third majority.

The FATA bill was passed with a national consensus. However, there was np consensus of the people of the concerned area. Meaning FATA was merged with Khyber Pakhtunkhawa (KP) without going through the appropriate process. Perhaps, FATA is one of the few cases in the world where a merger or annexation of territory happened on the whims and will of people living in other provinces of the state.

What is the end result of this faulty and delayed process of reforms and merger? Anger, frustration, and lack of hope became a driving force behind a movement for civil rights. Within days of the merger and passing of the interim order for FATA by the President of Pakistan, the Pakistani regime started repressing Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM).This has been the Pakistani state’s standard approach to both violent and non-violent challengers from within. This kind of repression has already backfired in the case of Balochistan. Such an approach against tribal Pashtuns would further aggravate the situation and damage Pakistan’s already tarnished image.

At this point, the state must rethink its old strategy against such movements in Pakistan. There are massive political, constitutional, social and developmental crises in the tribal areas, meaning this conflict must be resolved before it creates rift within the country that cannot be bridged and diplomatic embarrassment internationally. The way out is to rethink this ill-conceived merger and reforms.

It is important to address the grievances of PTM by establishing a peace commission. In fact, this may be the only way to ensure peace and stability in the tribal areas

Conflicts need resolution, and this can only be achieved by addressing all the contentious issues. Here the issues are consent, human rights abuses, political, social, legal and developmental issues, and environment of moving towards civil peace, which refers to the absence of violent internal conflicts. PTM’s struggle for human rights, a merger without consent and reforms with no positive movement have created a ‘conflict trap’ in FATA. In this case, a high quality of life, basic fundamental institutions to establish and enforce rule of law, provision of basic goods and services, and a greater participation reduces the likelihood of any renewed conflict.

A long history of violent conflict produces negative long term social, economic and political consequences. Hence, there is a need to rebuild infrastructure, trust and relationships. It also has a long-term health impact crisis in societies because it creates deep social and political divides. In such situations, powerful elements takeover all political culture, leaving little space for negotiations and compromise.

Constructing a reliable, legitimate and accountable institutions is what is needed, and this can be done through an interim administrative set up during the transition period. PTM, FATA youth Jirga and Aman committees all are moving in different directions. In this regard, an interim set up of a non-partisan nature can help to find a way out of this ‘conflict trap’ in the tribal areas. PTM has extended the battlefield of problems of FATA to the rest of the Pashtun areas, thus making it more difficult to negotiate. While the presence of the Taliban after so many military operations is also a source of deep concern for the future of peace in FATA.

It is thus important to address the grievances of PTM by establishing a peace commission. In fact this may be the only way to ensure peace and stability in the tribal areas. The failure of truth and reconciliation commissions in South Africa is evident and makes it impossible to establish such a commission in Pakistan. However, a Peace commission could record cases of the aggrieved families, human rights abuses and grievances during years of conflict and develop a mechanism to address such grievances.

Building an infrastructure of peace at both social, political, legal and developmental areas is critical. It should also involve a trust building commission where the residents of the tribal areas are able to register the issues which are creating trust deficit between the state and people of the area. It is also important to re-define the terms of agreement between the tribal areas and Pakistan as previously they were defined between MA Jinnah and Bannu Tribal Jirga in 1948. Sweeping consent and agreements under the carpet and creating a new social-political set up overnight with no ground work will have a long-term impact on the structure of the system and the strategic mechanism through which such a structure is supposed to work.

The controversial new interim order by the President of Pakistan also calls for the administration of justice, maintenance of peace and good governance. Instead of using the interim setup to crush dissent, the order should be considered a last opportunity for peace. A Peace which rests on a three-tier approach: peace commission, infrastructure for peace and trust building commission. In place of bureaucracy with its 71 years of tainted history in FATA, it is important to include academia, civil society, and other non-partisan individuals and groups to carry out these commissions’ functions for a period of two years. A peace through the people approach is the only feasible way out from the conflict trap in FATA.

ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) — Eritrea’s president announced Wednesday he is sending a rare delegation to neighboring Ethiopia for peace talks, days after Ethiopia’s new prime minister took a major step toward calming deadly tensions with its decades-long rival.

This is the first such delegation since 1998, when a border war erupted between the countries and they cut off diplomatic relations.

Eritrea’s longtime President Isaias Afwerki noted “positive signals” in recent days from Ethiopia and said the delegation will “gauge current developments directly and in depth” to plan future steps. He spoke during a Martyrs Day celebration in the capital, Asmara.

Ethiopia early this month made the surprise announcement that it will fully accept the terms of a peace agreement with Eritrea signed in 2000 to end the two-year border war that killed tens of thousands. The countries have skirmished a number of times since then. Ethiopia had refused to accept the deal’s handing to Eritrea of key locations, including the town of Badme, which it still holds.

The decision to fully accept the peace deal was the biggest reform yet announced by Ethiopia’s young new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who once fought in Badme. “The suffering on both sides is unspeakable because the peace process is deadlocked. This must change for the sake of our common good,” Abiy’s chief of staff, Fitsum Arega, said at the time.

Eritrea shortly after the announcement replied that it had always accepted the peace deal.

On Wednesday, Fitsum on Twitter said Abiy had “thanked and congratulated” Eritrea’s president for the positive response and “expressed his readiness to welcome warmly and with considerable goodwill” the Eritrean delegation.

Eritrea’s ambassador to Japan, Estifanos Afeworki, on Twitter said the delegation will pursue “constructive engagement.” Eritrea’s ambassador to Kenya, Byene Russom, called it a “new chapter of peace and reconciliation between the Eritrean and Ethiopian people.”

While Ethiopia is one of Africa’s fastest-growing economies, tiny Eritrea is one of the world’s most closed-off nations, ruled by Afwerki since gaining independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after years of rebel warfare. Eritrea has become a major source of migrants fleeing toward Europe, Israel and African nations in recent years as human rights groups criticize its harsh military conscription laws.

The spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, Stephane Dujarric, told reporters that “obviously we’ll see what happens but we clearly welcome this development.” He said the world body stood ready to play a role in assisting the two parties.

Ethiopia’s announcement on the peace deal set off a number of protests by residents in the northern Tigray region bordering Eritrea. The Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front, a party in Ethiopia’s ruling coalition that has been the dominant force in government for most of the past 27 years, said the announcement had been made before the ruling coalition’s congress met to discuss it: “We see this as a flaw.”

50,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/peace-boat-highlights-opportunities-for-a-better-world/,"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Peace Boat Highlights Opportunities for a Better World,"12 July 2018: Peace Boat’s inaugural Partnership Expo highlighted the importance of partnerships for peace and sustainable development. Three panels consisting of speakers from civil society, the private sector and the UN system described the context for the evening’s event, articulated the links between sustainability, oceans and climate, and offered examples of public-private partnerships to help deliver the SDGs.

Organized in Partnership with the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), UN Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC), UN Office for Partnerships (UNOP) and the UN Global Compact, the event provided new perspectives, including from youth, on how to make the world more peaceful and inclusive. Genevieve Jiva, Fiji, one of the Ocean and Climate Youth Ambassadors, described the process of a Talanoa dialogue, noting that it seeks to answer three questions: Where are we? Where do we need to go? How do we get there? These are the questions, she described, that the Youth Ambassadors address as they travel with Peace Boat to raise awareness and inspire action on the Goals.

Challenges and Opportunities

Speakers discussed current challenges, raising issues of ocean plastic, elevated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, poverty, food insecurity and food waste, but also identified areas of hope. Cora Weiss, Hague Appeal for Peace, noted that peace makes it possible for sustainable development to happen, highlighting the recent peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea as setting the stage for progress. Sylvia Earle, National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence, in remarks delivered by video, flagged that more people need to know why the ocean and environment matter.

Echoing Earle, Peter Thomson, UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Ocean, noted that humanity has not been sufficiently taught about the need for action. Thomson cautioned that the world is still on a path to three degrees warming, a “dangerous uncertainty.” He emphasized the need for multilateralism, “now more than ever,” to teach humanity how to implement the SDGs and countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

We are one people on one planet traveling towards one shared future.

Former Astronaut Col. Ron J. Garan described an example of a man on a horse, who, when asked where he was going, responded, “I don’t know, ask the horse!” Drawing comparisons to Thomson’s remarks, he noted that “we are one people on one planet traveling towards one shared future.” He underscored the need for a new perspective, articulating how his experience in space shifted his worldview. We as a global society, he noted, need to move from a model of fragmented nation-states that consume as if there are unlimited natural resources, to one where we are common occupants of a single planet, recognizing our finite supplies.

Going Forward

Andrew Friedman, AJF Financial Services, Inc., expressed his desire to one day live in a world where we don’t have to use the word sustainable, because sustainability is already ingrained into everyday life. To get there, he offered perspective on action being taken outside of the UN system. Friedman emphasized the role of organizations like US SIF (the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment) and Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) as key to making progress in the private sector, and highlighted the need for shareholder activism.

Robert Skinner, UNOP, highlighted how the Office acts as a gateway and platform to connect and convene actors, including those from the private sector, noting similarities to Peace Boat as a means of sharing information to create a better world. Dan Thomas, delivering remarks on behalf of Lise Kingo, UN Global Compact, also recognized that Peace Boat provides a means for decision-makers and civil society alike to connect informally, outside a more formal UN setting.

The Summit reflected on synergies between Africa’s Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda and supported efforts to promote women’s empowerment and tackle corruption.

The 31st ordinary session of the AU convened in Nouakchott, Mauritania, from 25 June to 2 July 2018, under the theme ‘Winning the Fight against Corruption: A Sustainable Path to Africa’s Transformation.’ The Summit included the 36th Ordinary Session of the Permanent Representatives’ Committee, the 33rd Ordinary Session of the Executive Council, the 31st Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of States and Government of the AU.

On the AfCFTA, 49 out of the AU’s 55 member States have signed the agreement establishing the AfCFTA. Chad, Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), Ghana, Kenya, Niger and Rwanda have ratified the AfCFTA. Participants adopted five priority sectors: transport; communication; finance; tourism; and business. Leaders urged member States who have not yet done so to sign and ratify the agreement and urged member States to abstain from entering into bilateral trading agreements until after the AfCFTA enters into force.

The Assembly approved the AUDA’s establishment as the AU’s technical body and requested the AU Commission to develop a statute for AUDA for adoption at the January 2019 Summit. The Assembly recognized the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) Agency as the organization responsible for implementation of Africa’s Agenda 2063 and implementation of various African development programmes and initiatives. The Assembly agreed the implementation of African development programmes and initiatives would transition from NEPAD to AUDA.

During the opening session, President of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, who also serves as the AU Chair, described partnership as the common thread in the Summit’s deliberations. UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed stressed sustainable development as the center of the UN’s strategic partnership with the AU. She observed that Africa’s Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development “share a common vision” and provide the basis for the AU-UN Partnership framework for development. She called for aligning policy, programming and accountability on the agendas to amplify impact at regional and country levels.

Mohammed reflected that, in spite of huge challenges, Africa is making “continuous progress”, as evidenced by declining child and maternal mortality, increasing access to all levels of education and increasing decision-making roles held by women, in line with SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education) and SDG 5 (gender equality). She said the AU Great Green Wall can protect millions of people from climate change and desertification impacts while integrating renewable energy and investments in value chains, in line with SDG 13 (climate action) and SDG 15 (life on land).

On peace, security and migration, Mohammed praised Africa as a “generous humanitarian actor,” describing the continent as one of the “most reliable contributors” to UN peacekeeping operations. She further noted that Africa hosts more than one-quarter of the world’s refugees and displaced people, showing “a solidarity that is often missing elsewhere.” AUC Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat stressed the importance of the free movement of persons, saying Africans should not “be foreigners on their own continent.” He urged member States to ratify the AU Protocol on Free Movement of Persons, Right of Residence and Right of Establishment to ensure that Africans are treated with dignity and respect across the continent.

The Summit also addressed reports on peace and security and progress on reducing armed conflicts in Africa in line with the ‘AU Master Roadmap on Practical Steps to Silence the Guns in Africa by 2020,’ one of the key projects of Agenda 2063. Participants commended Zambia and Zimbabwe for being the first countries to submit written reports on their implementation of the Roadmap and called on member States to emulate their example.

A panel discussion on corruption focused on evaluating Africa’s progress in fighting corruption and developing additional strategies to tackle it. The Assembly encouraged member States to tackle illicit financial flows, invest in the demographic dividend and strengthen national anti-corruption agencies. Mahamat called on governments to follow up on the recommendations of the Tabi Mebki Panel on illicit financial flows, underscoring the potential contribution of these lost resources to finance Africa’s development.

On SDG 5, Kagame and European Union (EU) Commissioner Mimica co-hosted a joint AU-EU ‘Women in Power’ side-event on the role of women in driving political, social and economic development. Participants supported accelerating efforts towards gender equality and women’s empowerment, stressing such progress as fundamental to achieving all the SDGs.

The Summit also addressed, inter alia: the AU budget, which has been reduced by 12% compared to 2018 in line with management effectiveness reforms; a common position on the UN high-level meeting on Tuberculous; and appointments. The Summit designated the theme for the 2019 Summit as the ‘Year of Refugees, Returnees and Internally Displaced Persons in Africa: Towards Durable Solutions to Forced Displacement.’ [AU Press Release on Opening] [AU Press Release on Key Conclusions] [AU Press Release on Gender Equality Side Event] [President Kagame Statement] [UN Deputy Secretary-General Statement]","6 July 2018: Heads of State and Government attending the 31st ordinary session of the African Union (AU) discussed the AU institutional reforms, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), the establishment of the AU Development Agency (AUDA), and peace and security, among other topics.

At the Opening Ceremony of the Seventh World Peace Forum

Tsinghua University, 14 July 2018

Respected Madame Chen Xu, Party Secretary of Tsinghua University, Mr. Qiu Yong, President of Tsinghua University, and Mr. Wu Hailong, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs,

Distinguished guests,

Ladies and gentlemen,

Friends,

It gives me great pleasure to join you at the opening ceremony of the Seventh World Peace Forum in this beautiful campus of Tsinghua University. I want to thank Tsinghua University and the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs for their exceptional organization of this forum, which is now in its seventh year. My warmest congratulations on the opening of this year's forum and best regards to participants from around the world.

As the Chinese saying goes, ""with strong roots, plants will grow; with right approach, people will succeed"". Since its inception seven years ago, the World Peace Forum has brought together the great minds of the world to examine the root causes of major international security issues and to explore ways to address them through cooperation. This is no small contribution to world peace and development. When I look around this hall, I can see many veteran statesmen and leading scholars. We have before us a highly pertinent topic, that is ""Constructing a Security Community: Equality, Equity and Justice"". It is therefore most important that we put our heads together, think out of the box, and share new perspectives on achieving world peace and security.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Friends,

A few weeks ago, the Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs established ""Xi Jinping thought on diplomacy"" as the fundamental guideline for conducting China's external work in the new era. Since the 18th Party Congress, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has shown great foresight and strong leadership. Taking a hard look at the destiny and future of mankind as well as the development trajectories of China and the world, it has broken new ground in both theory and practice, and put forward a whole set of new, forward-looking ideas and proposals that are embedded in China's reality and reflect the trend of the times. This new thinking and approach has crystallized into Xi Jinping thought on diplomacy, which will guide China to make even greater contribution to both national rejuvenation and progress of all humankind.

Ladies and gentlemen,

The world is experiencing significant changes unseen in a century. We live in an increasingly multi-polar and globalized world. The IT revolution and cultural diversity are facts of life. Interconnection and interdependence between countries have become an inescapable reality. In such a world, all countries rise and fall together. With the forces for peace outpacing the factors of war, the call for peace, development and win-win cooperation has become the order of the day. This year marks the centenary of the end of the first World War. Looking back, we have painful and profound lessons to draw from our experience of two world wars and more than four decades of Cold War. Today more than ever, all nations prefer peace to war, and cooperation to confrontation.

On the other hand, it is also true that the international situation has become more unstable, uncertain and unpredictable. The world is caught in a historical process of increasingly fast evolution. The Cold War mentality, power politics, unilateralism and protectionism still manifest themselves. Regional turbulence, terrorism, climate change and refugee flows remain unresolved challenges, problems of economic and financial risks and the worsening development gap have become more acute. All of this presents global security challenges that are more complicated than ever before.

To sum up, the ever-changing international environment is reshaping the security landscape in profound ways:

First, security issues have become more interconnected. Security issues have increasingly taken on political, economic, cultural, ethnic and religious dimensions. Problems in one field now have repercussions in other areas more quickly. This new dynamic makes them more complicated than what meets the eye. A simplistic, palliative approach may lead to more problems than it attempts to solve. The spread of terrorism, a product of interwoven political, economic, religious and cultural factors, is a case in point, and must be tackled with a multi-pronged approach.

Second, security issues have become more contagious. In a world that is rapidly becoming a ""global village"", security issues respect no national borders. The vulnerability of any one country may create a security ""swamp"" attracting multiple risks from outside. The insecurity of one country may build up and spill over to the region and beyond. In this day and age, no one can stay unscathed from external risks or achieve so-called ""absolute security"" on its own. Hence, we must stick together.

Third, security issues have become more perilous. With economic globalization and the IT revolution gathering pace, security issues may wreak havoc in unprecedented ways, affecting not only ordinary citizens but also the elite, not only one but multiple domains and locations - indeed, the entire world. Take the seven-year-long Syrian conflict for example. It has driven millions from their homes and inflicted huge economic losses. The quest for security is also moving into new frontiers such as cyberspace, deep sea, the polar regions and outer space. At stake is not only the development and prosperity of this generation, but also that of our children and children's children.

To ensure lasting peace amidst these profound security shifts, many new and different solutions have come up. We owe it to our people to pass on the torch of peace, to create sustained impetus for development and to rekindle the light of civilization. Here is what China proposes. We believe that countries should dedicate themselves to global peace and common development, realize a world of lasting peace and universal security, and build a community with a shared future for all mankind. To this end, we call for a vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. To be more specific, we suggest the following principles to be followed in handling international security issues:

First, equality and mutual trust. These are the prerequisite of security. As China sees it, all countries, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are equal members of the international community. No country has the right to ""monopolize"" international and regional security affairs or erode the legitimate interests of other countries. The right approach is to treat each other as equals and with respect, be sensitive to each other's interests and concerns, reject hegemony and power politics, and never impose one's will on others. It is important to foster friendship, uphold justice and pursue shared interests, instead of seeking to advance one's own interests at the expense of others. It is also important to enhance strategic trust through sincere dialogue, which will reduce suspicion, expand common ground and increase harmony in the world.

Second, cooperation for mutual benefit. This is the surest path to security. ""Absolute security"" is an illusion. Just as the security of one country can never be built on the turbulence of others, threats confronting another country may very likely become one's own challenges. Therefore, a win-win outcome must be sought if everyone is to enjoy lasting peace and security. When problems first emerge, we must look for proper solutions rather than threatening the use of force, magnify the problems out of selfish interests, or adopt a beggar-thy-neighbor approach. Guided by a new vision of comprehensive and common security, we must take holistic and integrated steps to both address the immediate problems and contain potential risks. Countries must step up coordination and cooperation on such non-traditional security issues as fighting terrorism and extremist ideologies.

Third, equity and justice. These are both very important values, yet our world today is still far from being a place of equity and justice. Their deficit should remind us of the need to build a better world and reinforce the foundation of peace. This would require rejecting the outdated Cold-War mentality and zero-sum mindset, settling international disputes by peaceful means and forging a collective response to security challenges. We must honor our international obligations, safeguard the international system centered around the United Nations, and make the international order more just and equitable.

Fourth, reform and innovation. These are crucial if we are to meet the plethora of new security challenges. In many ways, the existing architecture of global security governance system requires improvement. We should keep abreast of the changing times, think outside the box and develop new ways of cooperation so as to find new solutions to old problems and good solutions to new problems, with a view to breaking the security dilemma facing the international community. Such an innovative approach will help us make global security governance fairer, more reasonable and effective.

Fifth, sustainable development. To build lasting security, development and prosperity must be inclusive. A tree cannot grow tall or bear fruit in a barren land torn apart by the flames of war. Many of you would agree that fundamentally speaking, much of the conflict and turbulence we see around the world stems from the lack of development. More people have come to the realization that only with development can we remove the breeding ground of global challenges, secure the basic rights of the people, and propel the progress of the human society. The right to development must be shared by all. Delivering this right is not just the responsibility of national governments, but also the shared obligation of the international community. Now, more than 80 percent of the global population live in developing countries. Their right to more development and a better life must be upheld. Development issues should not be politicized. We must implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, raise living standards, close the wealth gap and promote common prosperity. All these efforts will put our shared security on a stronger footing.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Friends,

We in China always believe that one should practice what he advocates. In this spirit, China is not only advocating world peace and security, but also taking concrete actions toward these goals. China has long been a staunch force for global peace and prosperity. With further development, China will be able to do more for global peace and prosperity.

China is a key anchor and engine of global economic growth. China's development has lent a strong momentum to global recovery and growth, contributing nearly 30 percent of world economic growth on average since 2002. Consumer spending and investment opportunities in China has created more jobs worldwide. Last year, China accounted for 10.2 percent of global imports and 12.8 percent of global exports, and was the leading trade partner of over 120 countries and regions. The Chinese government has been able to provide adequate food and clothing for its over 1.3 billion people and lifted over 700 million Chinese out of poverty according to current UN standards, which accounts for over 70 percent of poverty reduction worldwide. This is a very important contribution to the Millennium Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals.

China's Belt and Road Initiative creates immense opportunities for its win-win cooperation with the rest of the world. After President Xi Jinping first proposed it in 2013, the initiative has elicited warm responses and wide support from the world. The first Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, hosted by President Xi in May last year, attracted more than 1,600 participants from some 140 countries and over 80 international organizations. Five years on, the initiative is becoming an unfolding reality: more than 100 countries and international organizations are now on board, a great many projects have kicked off, trans-national infrastructure connectivity is taking shape, manufacturing cooperation is gaining momentum, governments are doing more to coordinate development policies, and people in the participating countries are benefiting from the Belt and Road cooperation. Five years on, trade between China and other participating countries has exceeded 5 trillion US dollars in cumulative terms, Chinese investment in these countries has exceeded 70 billion dollars and more than 200,000 local jobs have been created. These are clear proof that all relevant countries have benefited from their participation in the Belt and Road Initiative. The initiative is proving to be an enabler of economic growth for many countries, especially developing ones, and it is bringing a new hope for their people. All this is a vivid demonstration of China's efforts toward building a community with a shared future for mankind.

China has provided a vast amount of assistance to other developing countries, especially the less developed ones. Through concessional loans, through technical, personnel and intellectual support, and through projects directly benefiting local communities, China is helping other developing countries to become better-off through development. As an active participant in international disaster relief and humanitarian operations, China is among the first to rush to the aid of Ebola-affected areas in Africa and their neighboring countries, providing them with much-needed assistance at a most trying time. Recently, China International Development Cooperation Agency was set up for the very purpose of further improving China's foreign aid and enabling it to contribute more to the international development efforts. As we speak, tens of thousands of Chinese engineers, entrepreneurs and technicians are working in various parts of the world, helping other developing countries on their way to prosperity and a better future.

China has taken an active part in seeking political settlement of international and regional hotspots. It has played a constructive role in addressing issues like the Korean nuclear issue, the Iranian nuclear issue, Syria, Afghanistan and the Middle East.

On the Korean nuclear issue, the situation on the Peninsula has eased in recent months, and things are moving in the right direction of a political settlement. The hard-won developments must be cherished by all parties. Given the complex and unique nature of the issue, all parties must move in the same direction and stay the course. China is committed to the denuclearization, peace and stability of the Peninsula and to a negotiated solution through dialogue and consultation. China will continue to work with other parties for denuclearization, for a peace mechanism and for lasting peace on the Peninsula.

On the Iranian nuclear issue, China maintains that all parties should have the bigger, long-term picture in mind, stick to a political and diplomatic settlement, properly manage differences, uphold the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and return as soon as possible to the right track of its full implementation.

On Syria, China holds the view that Syria's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity should be upheld and respected. It is up to the Syrian people to decide for themselves the future of their nation. Political settlement is the only realistic answer to this issue.

On Afghanistan, China supports its peace and reconstruction efforts, and backs an inclusive political reconciliation process that is Afghan-led and Afghan-owned.

On the Middle East, China wishes the region an early restoration of peace and stability and every success in finding a political solution that accommodates the regional realities and the interests of various parties. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries concerned must be preserved, the role of the United Nations as the main channel upheld, and the legitimate aspirations of countries in the region respected.

China has firmly supported and actively participated in UN peacekeeping and other major operations. China is the largest contributor of peacekeepers among the P5, having dispatched more than 37,000 peacekeepers to 24 UN peacekeeping missions. China has also taken an active part in international cooperation against terrorism and piracy. For one thing, Chinese navy ships have conducted escort missions in the Gulf of Aden and off the Somali coast for ten years running, ensuring safe passage for over 6,000 ships. China has been deeply involved in international cooperation in such non-traditional security areas as counter-terrorism, anti-narcotics, cyber security and climate change. China's success in hosting the Shanghai Summit of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia and the Qingdao Summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization represents a major contribution from China to the regional security architecture. Facts have proven that China is a force for peace, development and world order.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Friends,

China has taken on a historic responsibility to pursue happiness for its people, rejuvenation for the nation, and for the common good of the world. In this new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the over 1.3 billion Chinese people are working tirelessly for a dream of great national renewal. This Chinese dream is closely linked to the dreams of other people around the world. China is committed to building a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind, thereby contributing even more to the development and prosperity of mankind, an aspiration shared world over.

China will stay true to the mission of upholding world peace and to the path of peaceful development. The pursuit of harmonious coexistence is in the DNA of the Chinese nation. Peaceful development is a strategic choice made by China in light of its national conditions and fundamental interests. It is a basic principle that must be followed in China's diplomacy in the long run. It is peaceful development, not predatory expansion, that has enabled China, a country once mired in poverty and backwardness, to grow into the world's second largest economy. For this reason, we will continue to uphold peaceful development and cooperation for win-win results, and stick to an independent foreign policy. No matter how advanced it may become, China will never seek hegemony, nor will it seek expansion or spheres of influence.

Pursuing peaceful development, however, doesn't mean China will ever give up its legitimate rights and interests. China is committed to peaceful development, and we also expect others to do likewise. China will safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests and uphold its core interests as a red line that cannot be crossed. China will not cause trouble to others. That said, China won't flinch from facing up to trouble that comes its way. No country should have any illusion that it can undermine China's interests at will.

For some time now, unilateralism and protectionism have jeopardized global growth, prompting concerns and opposition around the globe. China has always opposed unilateralism and protectionism in trade and investment. We advocate a sensible approach to any dispute or problem in trade relations. There will be no winner from a trade war, only a lose-lose outcome. China doesn't want a trade war, but China is not afraid of it. When its legitimate rights and interests are treated unfairly, China has every reason to take necessary countermeasures. China will work with all parties to uphold free trade and the multilateral trading regime, which we believe serve the shared interests of all countries in the world.

China, together with other countries, will push forward the Belt and Road cooperation under the commitment to achieving shared benefits through extensive consultation and joint contribution. As an old Chinese saying goes, ""When you eat fruits, forget not the tree they grew on; when you drink water, forget not the source it came from."" In the case of China, its development would not have been possible without the outside world, so in return, China will contribute more to global development. At the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation that China will host in 2019, China will work with other interested countries to ensure sustained progress in Belt and Road cooperation, and to translate the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits into concrete win-win outcomes. China will integrate the Belt and Road cooperation with its reform and opening-up efforts. Our approach is to drive reform and development through opening-up in all respects. China will never shut its doors. If anything, it will only open wider to the outside world. In the coming 15 years, the China market will further grow and expand, with an estimated import of 24 trillion US dollars worth of goods, and inbound and outbound investment of 2 trillion dollars respectively. The first China International Import Expo, scheduled for November in Shanghai, will serve as a new platform for such cooperation.

China will take an active part in the reform of the global governance system with a commitment to equity and justice. A Chinese adage has it that ""a just world should be pursued for the common good"". China maintains that global affairs should be run together by countries in the world, and that all people, irrespective of their nationality, social stratum, and walk of life, should be able to benefit from global governance. The global governance reform that China takes part in is not about overturning the current system and starting all over again. Instead, it is about improving the system so that it can better reflect the changing realities, increase the representation and say of developing countries, and bring greater democracy in international relations.

China is a staunch supporter of the basic norms governing international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. China supports the multilateral trading regime and a more open, inclusive, balanced economic globalization that delivers benefits to all. China stands firmly against trade and investment protectionism. On frontier areas such as cyberspace, deep sea, polar regions and outer space, countries should work together to develop new institutions and new rules, and build new platforms of win-win cooperation. China will continue to contribute its wisdom and proposals to help settle international and regional hotspots and issues of a global nature.

China will stay committed to building partnerships around the world. We Chinese often say, ""Those who share the same ideal and follow the same path can be partners; those who seek common ground while setting aside differences can also be partners."" China pursues friendship and cooperation with all other countries based on the five principles of peaceful co-existence. We have made the forging of partnerships a golden rule in our relations with other countries, and have established partnerships of various forms with over 100 countries and regional organizations. China will continue to expand this network of global partnerships and make more friends all over the world.

Major countries have a responsibility and obligation to play a bigger role in upholding world peace and security. China will continue to work for a framework of major-country relations featuring overall stability and balanced development. We will increase dialogue and seek closer cooperation with other major countries to enhance mutual trust and keep differences under control. This will be a significant contribution to peace, security, development and prosperity of the world.

China sees in its neighbors good partners in pursuing common development and true friends in maintaining regional peace and stability. China will continue to deepen good-neighborly ties in line with the principles of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness and the policy of forging friendship and partnership in its neighborhood with a view to building a community with a shared future in our neighborhood.

China regards other developing countries as trustworthy partners in its peaceful development. In its relations with other developing countries, China will continue to follow the approach of upholding justice while pursuing shared interests and the principles of sincerity, real results, affinity and good faith. China will work to upgrade cooperation with them and cement our good relations featuring solidarity, mutual trust, common development and affinity.

China will promote exchange and mutual learning among different civilizations with an open and inclusive mind. We Chinese people often say, ""Delicious soup is made by combining different ingredients."" There are more than 200 countries and regions, over 2,500 ethnic groups and multiple religions in our world. Diversity not only defines our world, but also drives progress of mankind. Interactions between different civilizations should be guided by the vision of harmony without uniformity, mutual respect and mutual learning, as that's exactly what makes our world colorful and vibrant. It is important that we promote exchanges and mutual learning between civilizations as a bridge of friendship, a driving force for human progress, and a bond for world peace. The wisdom and nourishment thus drawn from different civilizations can be a source of mighty strength for mankind as we tackle the myriad challenges in the world today.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Friends,

The youth are the hope and future of a nation. Tsinghua University, staying true to its motto of ""self-discipline and social commitment"", has dedicated itself to the well-being of Chinese society and to world development through robust international exchanges and cooperation. I was told that Tsinghua, the alma mater of a large number of movers and shakers with a global vision and a pioneering spirit, has cooperation agreements with 280 universities and research institutes in 50 countries, and hosts over 3,500 international students from 128 countries. Let me commend Tsinghua for what it has done to facilitate mutual understanding and friendship among young people from around the world and to promote friendship and cooperation between China and the rest of the world.

We in China often say, ""It takes not just one tree to build a mansion and not just one river to make an ocean."" While the prospects for a peaceful and secure world are bright, the road ahead will not be a smooth one. It will take the concerted efforts of all countries to make the bright prospects a reality. Let me say that we will work with all other countries, for a world of lasting peace and universal security, for a community with a shared future for mankind, and for greater progress in the lofty cause of world peace.

To conclude, I wish the Seventh World Peace Forum a full success. Thank you.","We believe that countries should dedicate themselves to global peace and common development, realize a world of lasting peace and universal security, and build a community with a shared future for all mankind.
To be more specific, we suggest the following principles to be followed in handling international security issues:First, equality and mutual trust.
Recently, China International Development Cooperation Agency was set up for the very purpose of further improving China's foreign aid and enabling it to contribute more to the international development efforts.
This will be a significant contribution to peace, security, development and prosperity of the world.
Let me say that we will work with all other countries, for a world of lasting peace and universal security, for a community with a shared future for mankind, and for greater progress in the lofty cause of world peace."
53,https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/07/15/natos-global-peace-is-unraveling-and-we-cant-see-it/,"Sun, 15 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Brookings Institution,NATO’s global peace is unraveling and we can’t see it,"Following a contentious NATO summit, Robert Kagan writes (originally for the Washington Post ) that the democratic alliance that has been the bedrock of the American-led liberal world order is now unraveling. For more on the decline of the global order, stay tuned for Kagan's forthcoming book, "" The Jungle Grows Back ,"" in September 2018.

Human beings often choose self-delusion over painful reality, and so in the days and weeks to come, we will hear reassurances that the NATO alliance is in good shape. After all, there have been spats in the past—over the Suez crisis in 1956, Vietnam in the 1960s and ’70s, missile deployment in the Reagan years and, of course, Iraq. American presidents have been complaining about shortfalls in European defense spending for decades. President Trump is not wrong to criticize Germany’s pipeline deal with Russia. As for this week’s fractious summit, we are urged to focus on the substance, not the rhetoric. U.S. forces in Europe have been beefed up in recent years, and new plans are in place to resist Russian aggression. On the ground, the alliance still functions.

All true, but unfortunately beside the point. Small troop deployments and incremental defense increases don’t mean much when the foundations of the alliance are crumbling—as they are and have been for some time. And pointing to previous differences ignores how much political and international circumstances have changed over the past decade. Europe faces new problems, as well as the return of some of the old problems that led to catastrophe in the past; and Americans have a very different attitude toward the world than they did during the Cold War. This is not just another family quarrel.

The transatlantic community was in trouble even before Trump took office. The peaceful, democratic Europe we had come to take for granted in recent decades has been rocked to the core by populist nationalist movements responding to the massive flow of refugees from the Middle East and Africa. For the first time since World War II , a right-wing party holds a substantial share of seats in the German Bundestag. Authoritarianism has replaced democracy, or threatens to, in such major European states as Hungary and Poland, and democratic practices and liberal values are under attack in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. France remains one election away from a right-wing nationalist leadership, and Italy has already taken a big step in that direction. Meanwhile, Britain, which played such a key role in Europe during and after the Cold War, has taken itself out of the picture and has become, globally, a pale shadow of its former self. The possibility that Europe could return to its dark past is greater today than at any time during the Cold War.

Some of that has to do with the changing attitude of the United States in recent years. It’s little secret that President Barack Obama had no great interest in Europe. Obama, like Trump, spoke of allied “free riders,” and his “pivot” to Asia was widely regarded by Europeans as a pivot away from them. Obama rattled Eastern Europe in his early years by canceling planned missile-defense installations in Poland and the Czech Republic as an inducement to Vladimir Putin to embrace a “reset” of relations. In his later years he rattled Western Europe when he did not enforce his famous “red lines” in Syria. Both actions raised doubts about American reliability, and the Obama administration’s refusal to take action in Syria to stem the flow of refugees contributed heavily to the present strain.

Obama was only doing what he thought the American people wanted. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, along with the 2008 financial crisis, left Americans disenchanted with global involvement and receptive to arguments that the alliances and institutions they supported for all those years no longer served their interests. The Obama administration tried to pare back the American role without abandoning the liberal world order, hoping it was more self-sustaining than it turned out to be. But the path was open to a politician willing to exploit Americans’ disenchantment, which is precisely what Trump did in 2016.

NATO has never been a self-operating machine that simply chugs ahead so long as it is left alone. Like the liberal world order of which it is the core, it requires constant tending, above all by the United States. And because it is a voluntary alliance of democratic peoples, it survives on a foundation of public support. That foundation has been cracking in recent years. This week was an opportunity to shore it up. Instead, Trump took a sledgehammer to it.

Never mind the final communique that Trump deigned to sign, or his reassurance at the end that the alliance was “very unified, very strong, no problem,” and or his claim that “I believe in NATO.” In his press comments alongside NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, in his tweets and in his private comments to European leaders, Trump made clear that he does not believe in NATO. In fact, he used this summit to lay out for the American people why NATO was not only “obsolete,” as he once said, but also a rotten deal for them.

Consider the question of allied military spending. As many pointed out, Trump could have come to Brussels and taken credit for the increased commitments that the Allies have made—and of course he did force Stoltenberg to give him credit. But then he moved the goal posts. He insisted the 2 percent of gross domestic product mark must be reached not by 2024, as agreed by the alliance (including the United States), but by January—something he knows is impossible. Then he went further, insisting that the allies spend 4 percent of their GDP on defense, higher even than his own defense budget.

These are not negotiating tactics. They are the tactics of someone who does not want a deal. In the private meeting, Trump is reported to have warned the allies that if they did not meet the 2 percent standard by January the United States would “go it alone.” To Stoltenberg he publicly warned that the United States was “not going to put up with it.” Whether he has any intention of making good on such threats scarcely matters. In his tweets, he asked, “What good is NATO” if Germany was paying Russia for gas? Why should the United States pay billions to “subsidize Europe” while it was losing “Big on Trade”? Those comments were not aimed at Europe. They were designed to discredit the alliance in the eyes of his faithful throng back home.

But even Trump must know the likely response in Europe. The insults and humiliations he inflicted on allied leaders will not be forgotten or forgiven. They will make it impossible for European leaders to win public support for the spending Trump disingenuously claims to want. What German leader after such a tongue-lashing could do Trump’s bidding and hope to survive politically?","For more on the decline of the global order, stay tuned for Kagan's forthcoming book, "" The Jungle Grows Back ,"" in September 2018.
Human beings often choose self-delusion over painful reality, and so in the days and weeks to come, we will hear reassurances that the NATO alliance is in good shape.
Some of that has to do with the changing attitude of the United States in recent years.
Like the liberal world order of which it is the core, it requires constant tending, above all by the United States.
Why should the United States pay billions to “subsidize Europe” while it was losing “Big on Trade”?"

The Duque administration and Colombia’s peace deal(s),"Support for this publication was generously provided in part by the United States Department of Defense-Minerva Research Initiative. The views expressed are the author's alone, consistent with Brookings’s commitment to independent research.

During his presidential campaign, Colombia’s President-elect Iván Duque promised to “modify” —but not abrogate—the historic peace deal with the leftist guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). His Democratic Center party and its leader, former President Álvaro Uribe, were vociferous opponents of the peace accords and mobilized a razor-thin majority to defeat a 2016 referendum on the deal. Many Colombians remain dissatisfied with the leniency that FARC members received under the accords, especially avoiding jail sentences and provisions allowing the guerilla group to transform itself into a political party (former FARC military commanders are now top party politicians).

Under the best of circumstances, the accords’ implementation was going to be complicated and require long-term dedication. The risk now is that the peace agreement will suffer death by a thousand cuts—via budgetary measures and other subversions—by the Duque government. As a result, the prospects for lasting peace and social integration and equity in Colombia are subtly but profoundly in jeopardy.

Four core peace accord issues at stake are detailed below, with the fifth—drugs—discussed in a separate blog post.

1

Reinsertion and reintegration of ex-FARC combatants

The FARC has already handed over its weapons under a U.N.-verified process. Yet even under the outgoing Santos administration—which negotiated the peace deal—the development of basic facilities in the demobilization camps, the so-called zonas verdales, has been slow. Lacking has been literacy and vocational training, as well as psycho-social support, let alone a systematic, determined effort to prepare both the ex-combatants and local communities for social reintegration. Mostly, the government has been providing only a stipend of $220 per month to the former guerrillas. Close to 90 percent of them have been on this payroll, scheduled to end in August 2019. But the recipients continue to lack skills for satisfactory legal livelihoods. Many want to be farmers but do not have legal plots of land, though some have informally started collective farms funded by the stipends.

This resulted in significant frustration among the 8,000 guerrillas who were originally located there, as well as the additional 5,000 who did not and stayed in cities or were released from prisons. By May 2018, thousands of guerrillas left the zonas verdales, with little knowledge of whether they went home or elsewhere.

Although President-elect Duque has expressed full support for reintegration of FARC’s foot soldiers, a key sticking point already plaguing the Santos administration is unlikely go to away: The FARC leadership insists on collective reintegration through collective business projects to maintain FARC’s ideology and political cohesion (without having any actual operational design of such projects), whereas the government of Colombia has preferred individual-level reinsertion and reintegration. Duque’s instincts, too, will be to embrace the latter.

2

Rural development

Providing economic and social development of Colombia’s long-neglected vast periphery was a key feature of the accord and is indeed a foundation for lasting peace in Colombia. The perpetual underdevelopment of large rural areas and the festering poverty and inequality have been fertile grounds for militant mobilization, drugs, and criminality for decades.

Yet rural development is complex and time- and resource-intensive. It is also very vulnerable to Duque’s policy moves. The Santos administration planned to construct 50 kilometers of roads in each of the 51 conflict-affected municipalities; provide land titles to small farmers, with the National Land Agency (ANT) established for that purpose; and through consultative local development plans deliver energy supply, market access, arable land improvement, and development of community facilities administered by the new Agency for Territorial Renewal (ART).

Duque has announced plans to scrap the new agencies and hand rural development to the Ministry of Agriculture, which could have profound implications for the accords’ implementation. For decades, Colombia’s Ministry of Agriculture has been captured by vested interests of large agri-businesses (which constitute a crucial element of Duque’s political base), often usurping resources for small farms and allowing land theft and resource misappropriation. The ministry turned out to be a key obstacle to rural development in its implementation of the Uribe administration’s 2009 National Territorial Consolidation Plan (Plan Nacional de Consolidación Territorial), with the unruly captured ministry effectively running local development efforts into the ground in many areas and the Consolidation Plan ultimately withering.

Moreover, Duque prefers to create jobs for the rural poor through strengthening large-scale agri-businesses in general, reversing the accords’ vision of bottom-up development focused on small farmers. And historically, although large landowners and agri-businesses in Colombia have taken up large tracts of land (often letting them lie fallow to launder money and avoid taxes, and exacerbating deforestation), they have been poor sources of job generation—nowhere matching the labor-intensiveness of coca cultivation, for example. Colombia has a long history of promising rural development projects and rolling them out only in name or in a meager form, checking the box once a single bridge is built, an electric generator delivered, or a clinic established.

Transitional justice and FARC’s political representation

Duque and other opponents of the accords have sharply criticized the fact that FARC combatants who admitted their crimes to a special transitional justice tribunal—the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (SJP), currently being stood up but not yet fully functional —would avoid prison sentences. They see the alternative punishments proposed, such as house arrest, as tantamount to impunity. Duque and Uribe have also insisted that members of the Colombian armed forces should not face the same tribunal for their crimes committed in the course of the counterinsurgency. A core campaign issue for Duque was strengthening punishments for the FARC. Yet as the International Crisis Group explains, it will be hard for Duque to make major changes since the accords’ transitional justice elements are now enshrined in Colombian law and since Colombia’s sentencing guidelines point judges to the most lenient law available. Nonetheless, he could create fear and suspicion among FARC commanders by fueling public outrage at lenient sentences the court may hand out.

Duque has similarly objected to the FARC’s political representation in the Colombian congress, where the group has five seats guaranteed in each chamber for eight years. He has argued that FARC members should first serve jail sentences and only then be allowed to participate in politics. Since Colombia’s supreme court has already approved the arrangement—which requires former combatants to confess to their crimes through the SJP process, pay reparation to victims, and comply with their (non-jail) sentences—Duque and his Democratic Center party would instead mount social and political campaigns against the group. The FARC performed poorly in Colombia’s March 2018 congressional elections, shocking the group’s leadership. A steady string of such disappointments may sour the leadership (particularly former middle-level commanders) on the accords.

4 Rising insecurity: FARC dissidents, the ELN, other insurgencies, and bandas criminales

Meanwhile, after the significant reduction in violence since 2012, insecurity in Colombia started rising again over the past year, with departments such as Chocó, Nariño, Arauca, Meta, and Guaviare affected particularly badly.

Some 1,500 FARC members have created dissident groups, returning to the battlefield to fight the government, rival guerrillas, and so-called bandas criminales, as well as participate in illicit economies. Already, such rival criminal groups—such as the Gaitanistas (also known as the Urabeños)—have been fighting with dissident FARC units and others over territories with drug cultivation, illegal mining, logging, and other extractable resources vacated by the FARC. The Santos government deserves much praise for its effort to combat these bandas criminales, which often emerged out of the demobilization of the paramilitaries a decade ago and which constitute a major threat to peace and social integration in Colombia. It’s not clear whether the Duque administration will take a similar approach or strike a lenient political deal with groups such as the Gaitanistas, failing to advance public safety in a lasting way. Meanwhile, dozens of community leaders have been assassinated, with almost no prosecution of those who ordered their deaths.

The peace process with Colombia’s second-largest leftist insurgency, the National Liberation Army (ELN) has been stalled for months. During the winter of 2017 and spring of 2018, the ELN mounted a vicious military campaign. While the group does not pose a threat to the central state, its violence has had debilitating effects in local areas, giving rise to new displacement of thousands and halting economic development. One area particularly badly hit is Catatumbo, which is on the border with Venezuela where the ELN has been battling another small insurgency, the Popular Liberation Army (EPL). The preconditions that Duque places on political negotiations with the ELN, including the assembly of ELN forces in designated areas and the cessation of criminal and military activity, is a nonstarter for the group. So is Duque’s stated intention to negotiate only disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration, without any political elements. But the fact that the ELN uses Venezuela as a safe haven and has many connections to Venezuela’s military and regime—and is deeply intertwined in cross-border illegal economies—means that the group will not be easily defeated on the battlefield.

The crux of the issue

Thus for at least the first part of the Duque administration, violent conflict in Colombia is likely to intensify. And over time—if the Duque administration manipulates and starves the implementation of the accords, particularly for equitable rural development—there could be more severe blows to the hopes of building lasting peace and social integration in Colombia.

His plans to use money allocated for U.N. monitoring of the accords’ implementation for, instead, addressing the humanitarian needs of Venezuelan refugees crossing into Colombia does not bode well, for instance. A comprehensive and well-funded plan for the Venezuelan refugee crisis—which puts further stress on Colombian communities along the Venezuelan border—is urgently needed. But so is independent monitoring of the implementation of the FARC peace accords.","During his presidential campaign, Colombia’s President-elect Iván Duque promised to “modify” —but not abrogate—the historic peace deal with the leftist guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
His Democratic Center party and its leader, former President Álvaro Uribe, were vociferous opponents of the peace accords and mobilized a razor-thin majority to defeat a 2016 referendum on the deal.
The risk now is that the peace agreement will suffer death by a thousand cuts—via budgetary measures and other subversions—by the Duque government.
Yet rural development is complex and time- and resource-intensive.
But so is independent monitoring of the implementation of the FARC peace accords."
55,https://wagingnonviolence.org/2018/07/unarmed-civilian-protection-sustainable-peace/,"Fri, 06 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Waging Nonviolence,Why unarmed civilian protection is the best path to sustainable peace,"The first image that often comes to mind when one thinks of peacekeeping, especially within the frame of the United Nations, is that of the blue helmets: armed soldiers gathered from member states who are then strategically deployed in conflict areas.

There are over 90,000 armed UN peacekeepers working around the world today — from Haiti to Lebanon to Kosovo to Darfur — who are generally isolated from the communities they are meant to protect. They engage from the outside, with soldiers often patrolling in vehicles and retreating at the end of the day to compounds of rarefied security.

This drastically reduces the ability of traditional peacekeepers to know and respect local people; without this understanding, trust is weakened and the kind of clear and open communication needed for sustained peace is undermined. A recent UN report exploring ways to improve the safety of UN peacekeepers embodies this relationship model: its focus is on the protection of peacekeepers who come from outside countries and concludes that their safety depends on the proactive use of force.

There is, however, another model for peacekeeping called unarmed civilian protection, or UCP. It works from the inside and has been proven to save lives, empower communities and can secure strong and lasting peace in areas plagued by violent conflict.

“Unarmed civilian protection challenges the widespread assumption that ‘where there is violence we need soldiers,’ or that armed actors will only yield to violent threat,” said Rachel Julian, director of the Centre for Applied Social Research at Leeds-Beckett University, during a UN event in May. Hosted by the permanent missions of Uruguay and Australia to the UN, the event offered inspiring success stories and provided persuasive evidence that unarmed civilian protection works.

UCP, she began, is not a new-fangled and untested method of peacekeeping — in its current form, it has been around for over 35 years. Despite its long history, UCP is rarely recognized by international bodies as a viable tool for peacekeeping; armed strategies tend to dominate institutional efforts to combat threats of violence. Julian’s research suggests that we have much to gain by expanding our conception of what peacekeeping is and by broadening our ideas of the methods it involves.

Julian explained that armed peacekeeping is limited in part due to the fact that the peace sought by armed peacekeepers is not grounded in the knowledge, practices and traditions of the people directly involved in the conflict. Armed peacekeeping imposes peace externally, introducing temporary resolutions from the outside. It is often implemented according to a fixed and prescribed model that is applied with relative uniformity in different regions and in all kinds of conflict.

As Youssef Mahmoud from the International Peace Institute said at the event, this kind of peacekeeping can yield “security, not safety.” And no doubt, security is important. But more important is a sustainable peace that finds its roots in the particular community itself. These local approaches to peace are always present, even amidst horrific violence.

Unarmed civilian protection draws on the peace infrastructure that exists within all communities by actively listening to everyone involved, by opening clear lines of communication, and by making a safe space for people to use and build on the knowledge and resources they already have. UCP is based on the recognition that each conflict and thus each peace is distinct and requires methods that are adapted to the particularities of the community and implemented by local people themselves.

Over the years, Julian has gathered a tremendous amount of data to prove the efficacy of UCP. Her research shows that unarmed civilian protection is scalable, that it is successful in preventing violence, that it works in all stages of conflict and that it is effective in preventing the displacement of civilians.

But the benefits that grow directly from the practices of unarmed civilian protection require time and funding, which they currently lack. Building trust and capacities, strengthening community ties, encouraging communication among “enemies” are not cheap and quick fixes. However, the investment pays off: the peace UCP ushers in tends to be strong and enduring. After all, its roots lie deep in the individual communities and in the hearts of its residents.

In the Kook community of South Sudan, strong local women came together to form the Women’s Peacekeeping Teams, which pooled their strength and knowledge to take action for peace. These teams were able to sustain peace among once hostile clans when it was threatened after a chief’s son was killed. Because the Women’s Peacekeeping Teams had laid the groundwork by taking the time to get to know and listen to people from all groups in the area, they were able to intervene on behalf of their community as a whole and ensured that no revenge killings would take place. And indeed, the peace remained.

Carmen Lauzon-Gatmaytan is the program development officer with Nonviolent Peaceforce, an unarmed, paid civilian protection force founded in 2002, which now has peacekeepers in the Philippines, Iraq, South Sudan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. An international NGO, Nonviolent Peaceforce is committed to “building peace side by side with local communities” in a way that saves lives and preserves human dignity.

Lauzon-Gatmaytan works in Mindanao region of the Philippines, which has emerged as an epicenter of violence in the country. Unarmed civilian protection has been effective in countering this violence, creating reliable channels of communication among opposing groups and cultivating islands of peace where conflict seemed inevitable. Local actors have been empowered through trainings in the methods of unarmed civilian protection, and trust among ostensible enemies is gradually emerging and taking hold. This has come in part by identifying common interests which unite rival groups, despite disagreement on the issues that drive the conflict.

A few years ago, a high school graduation celebration was disrupted by armed militias. Parents and students contacted Nonviolent Peaceforce to come work with their community, providing protective accompaniment to vulnerable people and encouraging dialogue among all parties. The following year, the graduates took part in a ceremony free of tension and fear. Families — whatever their political, religious and ethnic ties — recognized and respected the desire to watch their loved ones receive diplomas.

Building bridges among opposing groups reveals only one axis of UCP’s impact, which cultivates trust and strengthens ties among civilians. Equally significant, Lauzon-Gatmaytan insisted, is how UCP facilitates the coming together of civilians, government officials and armed actors to work for peace. This was witnessed in Mindanao when both the government and the main rebel group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, requested that Nonviolent Peaceforce join in the official ceasefire and recognized unarmed civilian protection as a tool to be used to find resolution to the region’s problems.

Yasmin Maydhane, an international protection officer with Nonviolent Peaceforce, has direct experience using unarmed civilian protection in remote areas of South Sudan that are inaccessible to the UN mission there. Her work has introduced her to local people whose knowledge and resources have been channeled and directed so that they are now active unarmed peacekeepers themselves.

Herself a byproduct of UN peacekeeping missions in Somalia, Maydhane has firsthand knowledge of what works and what doesn’t, and UCP, she stated without equivocation, works. She spoke with pride and excitement about the fact that UCP methods have inspired local youth to be increasingly involved in peacekeeping efforts in South Sudan, forming youth groups of motivated peace activists. The Upper Nile region, long cut off from aid of all kinds, now has basic humanitarian services thanks to UCP.

Perhaps most significant, women are leading some of the most successful peacekeeping efforts in the area. In one instance, they managed to bring together representatives from different ethnic groups to ensure safe passage through a once perilous series of checkpoints: Maydhane described how before these brave women joined forces, going through checkpoints meant abuse and rape. They declared, “Our men rape you, yours rape us — let’s end this” and South Sudanese women did just that. The checkpoints are now safely crossed.

At the event, Mahmoud said the efficacy of unarmed civilian protection comes in part from its adaptability and flexibility. This gives it a unique capacity to contend successfully with decentralized violence, a characteristic of most active conflicts in the world today. Equally important, unarmed civilian protection makes room for local actors to realize capacities that have become latent, and any good peacekeeper, he said, must draw on this untapped potential.

Peacekeepers must be sure to “map not only what is not working, but also what is working” — that is, to understand that the solutions to any conflict lie with the local people. This means that the aim of unarmed civilian protectors is ultimately to become dispensable — somewhat paradoxically, they must strive to be unneeded. In this, unarmed civilian protection goes beyond mere protecting, but supports local actors to build peace themselves. Real peace, Mahmoud stressed, always grows from the bottom up and while external actors can help make the space for peace, they must leave room for others “to shape it as their own.”

The UN event made clear that unarmed civilian protection is not simply about keeping peace, it is inseparable from building peace, which necessarily involves unearthing and realizing the capacity, knowledge and power of the communities that are directly involved in conflict. The kind of local ownership UCP depends on is essential for a robust and sustained peace as opposed to a fleeting and fragile one. Much of traditional peacekeeping has been pried from its natural place within grassroots peacebuilding, reduced to an external force that strains to impose a frozen peace from the outside and is itself dependent on outsiders.

The practices central to UCP — inclusive dialogue, protective accompaniment, trust-building and open negotiation — grow directly out of the awareness that local capacity is never absent, only buried and rendered dormant under the weight of conflict and violence. These are all too often the direct result of external forces — colonialism, proxy wars, scarce resources, climate change — for which those stuck in conflict bear no responsibility.

Nonviolent peacekeeping allows people to see humanity visibly manifested; unarmed peacekeepers must be decent and kind, they must listen actively and make all parties to a conflict feel as though they matter. In doing so, humanity is revealed to be not the property of one side or another, nor something that must be imported from outside.

Unarmed civilian protection directly addresses the urgent need to ensure that even the most violent regions across the globe are on a road to becoming safe and peaceful. Given increased international recognition and adequate financial support, data suggests that such widespread peace is in fact possible and sustainable.

Equally significant, this peace does not require the constant presence of saviors from outside, whether UN blue helmets or others. “Outsiders have to be humble enough to recognize that people have capacity not just needs,” Mahmoud said. “Outsiders also have to build into their DNA that they are dispensable.”","Hosted by the permanent missions of Uruguay and Australia to the UN, the event offered inspiring success stories and provided persuasive evidence that unarmed civilian protection works.

56,https://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/cohens-fund-seekers-of-peace/,"Thu, 05 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Jewish Standard,Cohens fund seekers of peace,"If there is to be any hope for peace, the late Stephen P. Cohen believed, it would have to come from human relationships. From people talking to each other out of the hot glare of the public eye. From backchannel diplomacy, because that allows a degree of honesty, of genuine connection, that more open and therefore more theatrical communications do not.

That’s why his family set up the Stephen P. Cohen Seekers of Peace Fund at the New Israel Fund. Last week, the Cohens announced the fund’s first grant, for $20,000, which will go to a Jerusalem-based project called “Lowering the Walls.”

Dr. Cohen — who was born in Montreal and taught in such institutions as Harvard, where he earned his doctorate, and who created and ran the Middle East Institute for Peace and Development at CUNY’s Graduate Center — lived in Teaneck for decades. He and his wife, the Jewish educator Elaine Shizgal Cohen, were active members of Congregation Beth Sholom there. Dr. Cohen died in January 2017. He was 71.

Now, Dr. Cohen’s widow — also called Dr. Cohen — along with their three daughters, his brother, her brother, and some others, created the Stephen P. Cohen Seekers of Peace Fund. The fund, according to its mission statement, was founded to further Stephen Cohen’s understanding that “the best approach to resolving conflicts among and between parties locked in political, cultural, and religious disagreements is through direct communication and face-to-face dialogue.”

The fund is not a foundation. It’s complicated to set up a 501 (c ) (3), Dr. Cohen learned, and if she and her board had done that, they would have had to send out their own requests for proposals, and then evaluate the responses, and the whole proposition “seemed overwhelming.” So the fund had to become part of a larger organization. “We looked at the New Israel Fund,” Dr. Cohen said. “I wanted to find a project that really reflected Steve’s values, and his approach to working on conflict resolution. I also wanted to find an area where our friends and relatives, across a fairly wide spectrum from liberal to progressive, would be comfortable.” (The family has a few friends or relatives to the right of center, she clarified.)

In making the choice of the New Israel Fund, Dr. Cohen said, she knew that she was picking a group that had been the target of “attempted vilification. But it is really doing well, and the recent attacks by Prime Minister Netanyahu resulted in 3,000 new Israeli donors to the fund.” (In early April, Mr. Netanyahu accused the NIF of being anti-Israel and blamed the organization for the reaction to his back-and-forth decisions on expelling migrants.)

“There isn’t such a culture of philanthropy in Israel as there is here,” she added; that makes the new NIF donors even more worthy of note. (NIF officials estimated that some 95 percent of the Israelis who gave in response to Mr. Netanyahu’s comments were first-time NIF donors.)

“The NIF works in the areas of human rights and democracy, shared social and economic justice, and religious freedom,” Dr. Cohen said. “So we decided to look at initiatives for strengthening democracy. Those are areas where we knew that Steve’s friends and relatives would be happy to make a donation.”

Elaine and Steve had three daughters, Tamara, Ayelet, and Maya; Tamara and Ayelet both are rabbis. They also have five grandchildren. The family and friends on the advisory board, each of whom is extremely well connected in the Jewish world, “set up a designated fund, and through outreach, we have raised $132,000 in the United States, and about $5,000 in Canada,” Dr. Cohen said. She jump-started the fund with a gift, and then approached many of her husband’s friends, students, and colleagues. They were generous.

The goal is to give away about $30,000 in grants for five years. “It is a spend-down, not a foundation,” Dr. Cohen said. The advisory board plans to give away another $10,000 this year; it has not yet started to decide where the money should go next year, but Dr. Cohen is fairly certain that it will go to different groups.

Lowering the Wall, which will receive $20,000 from the fund, is an anti-racism program based in Jerusalem; it’s small scale, and so the Cohen funds it receives can make an actual, noticeable difference for the potential leaders with whom the program works. The program brings Arabs and Israelis together; because it’s about building bridges, the activity to which Stephen Cohen devoted his life, and also about education, which has been the propelling force behind Elaine Cohen’s decisions, it seems a perfect way for Dr. Cohen to help Dr. Cohen’s memory flourish.

John Ruskay is the executive vice president of UJA-Federation of New York and a decades-long friend of both Steve and Elaine Cohen.

“We were part of related communities that were trying to renew Jewish life, from the early 1970s onward,” Dr. Ruskay said. “I was involved in the New York chavurah movement, and he was in Chavurat Shalom in Boston. We were both involved in Jewish educational renewal.

“We have been doing this for a very long time.”

He describes his friend Steve as someone whose work was both invaluable and hidden. “Steve was a pioneer in recognizing the urgent need to reconcile Israelis and Palestinians,” Dr. Ruskay said. “From the mid 1970s on, he devoted so much of his life to working with the highest officials of government on both sides. He did much of it totally privately — it was backchannel diplomacy. He also supported people-to-people endeavors, which led to greater understanding.”

He remembers a story about his friend Steve. “There was a crisis in Beirut, and he simply went to Beirut and started walking. “He wanted to find Arafat.” That was Yasir Arafat, the head of the Palestine Liberation Organization; the crisis was the siege of Beirut, which ended in Arafat’s expulsion from Lebanon. Dr. Ruskay doesn’t remember the specifics of the episode; what he remembers is his friend’s irrepressible chutzpah — and seemingly contradictory but nonetheless enormous capacity to keep secrets, if bridges could be built on those untold truths.

“His memory can provide both a model for what one person could do and can inspire others to seek ways to bridge the impasse,” Dr. Ruskay said.

Dr. Eva Fogelman, a Manhattan-based psychotherapist who specializes in trauma in general and the trauma of second-generation Holocaust survivors in particular, also sits on the advisory board for the Stephen Cohen fund.

Dr. Cohen changed her life, Dr. Fogelman said.

She remembers the first time she saw him. It was in 1972, at a conference of the Network of Jewish Students, an activist group that was both very much of its time and very, well, Jewish. “I remember that after the official program was over, a whole bunch of people got together in one of the rooms — it was a very dingy room, somewhere in New York,” she said. “He was pontificating about vocation versus avocation. It always sort of stuck in my mind.” Dr. Cohen always did have strong opinions.

Later, Dr. Fogelman moved to Cambridge, where Steve and Elaine Cohen lived; they were active in the same political and egalitarian religious groups and came to know each other well. She remembers that “Steve had a shortwave radio, so when the Yom Kippur War broke out in October of 1973 we would listen to the news.” Steve and a friend, Bill Novak (who went on to write books about Jewish humor) put together a newsletter called the Mideast Probe, Dr. Fogelman recalled. “Then a whole bunch of us who had cars would deliver them to influentials in the neighborhood.” Those so-called influentials included such New York Times columnists as Anthony Lewis, and the information in the newsletters in fact occasionally did surface in Lewis’s columns. “Most people did not have shortwave radios,” Dr. Fogelman pointed out. “One of the things that Steve always said is that information is power.”

When Dr. Fogelman worked on the doctorate, Dr. Cohen was her advisor. “He was a major influence in my life, intellectually, personally, socially,” she said. “He always was a feminist in his outlook, and in those days we had very few religiously committed Jews who were feminist.

“We did not know about all his activities,” she added. “We didn’t know about his meetings with people like Arafat. He kept them quite secret. We knew that he was doing things, but we didn’t know what he was doing.

“I am just one person whose life Steve influenced in a major way,” Dr. Fogelman concluded. “He believed in me, and what it was that I could do — and that changed my life.

EPA/Ericka Chavez

El Salvador is adjudged the world’s most violent country, with a rate of 81 murders per 100,000 people in 2016, more than three times that of Mexico, for example. San Salvador rivals Venezuela’s Caracas as the most murderous city at 137/100,000. The country is trapped in a vicious cycle. Because there is no security, there is little investment, no growth, few jobs, insufficient resources for security and thus an increase in insecurity. And the populism of the ruling FMLN has offered few answers, only greater problems

“Arena’s problem,” says Ernesto “Neto” Muyshondt, the Mayor of San Salvador of his own political party, “is that did not keep reforming and strengthening our institutions. When it was in government,” adds the lean 42-year old, who holds a Master’s degree from Incae, a leading regional business school, “it was not interested in sharing power, in building consensus.”

The same failure can also be said of the FMLN, the former guerilla movement, which succeeded Arena as the government in 2009, he says.

Muyshondt has inherited, at best, a very difficult situation.

The once grand and now fading facades of the old San Salvador peek from behind lines of informal traders who line the streets in the crowded centre of the city, pivoting around the old Cathedral where Archbishop Oscar Romero once preached. His assassination in March 1980 by extremists sparked a 12-year civil war, costing 75,000 lives and displacing 1.5-million. Stallholders align the road and pavement around the old national telecommunications headquarters and the Antonio Bou building, once upon a time the Home Depot of its era. The traders are gathered cheek-by-jowl in their plastic, canvas and wood stalls, hawking $5 dresses, $3 shoes, gaudily coloured electric fly-swats and backpacks among other tat, and two for $1 DVDs.

Papa frites and grilled chicken stalls smoke and sizzle away, adding aroma to the swirl of people, children, clutter and confusion. Cleaners with Gobierno de San Salvador stitched on the backs of their baby blue overalls steer their dust-carts past the traffic. The security forces patrols move quickly and through the stalls and crowds. Sections of soldiers with M16 assault rifles in jungle camouflage outfits, their faces covered out of fear of recognition, there to protect the single policemen in their ranks distinctive in his sinister black uniform.

Attempts to crack down against the 60,000-strong Maras (Mara is slang for gang), notably the M-18, MS-13 and the Rebels 13, have done little to blunt the surge in violent crime. Originating among the gangs and prisons of Los Angeles, the maras returned south to ply their trade in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. In 2015 alone, 61 policemen and 24 soldiers died in direct combat with gangs. With numbers like this, El Salvador is effectively in a state of civil war.

It’s easy in the circumstances to forget that El Salvador enjoyed a pretty good 1990s. After a decade of civil war pitting a US-backed government against Soviet and Cuban-sponsored FMLN (Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front) guerrillas, the election in 1989 ushered into power businessman Alfredo Cristiani representing the conservative Nationalist Republic Alliance, or Arena.

With business interests in coffee and pharmaceuticals, Cristiani had been drawn into politics in the beginning of the 1980s when the FMLN’s campesino followers, the rural poor dependent on agriculture, began squatting on farms. Under Cristiani’s leadership, a UN-supervised and monitored peace process began in April 1990. On 16 January 1992, the Chapultepec Peace Accords were signed in Mexico, by which the rebel FMLN became an opposition political party.

Ending the civil war had a positive impact on stability and growth. “If we had not had a democratic process, there would be no peace,” reflects Cristiani, a youthful 71. “Our conflict was generated by a lack of political space. We also needed economic reform, in trying to deal with the macro-economic aspects of the conflict.”

As the president of a country “coming out of war with a bad reputation”, Cristiani saw the need to get into high labour-intensive industry, the maquilas, and agro-industry beyond just producing food. Growth improved during the 1990s on the back of this diversification drive centring on textiles but increasingly delving into services, as advised by what Salvadoreans know as the Chilean Boys, a group of Chicago University-educated economists under ArnoldHarberger known as the Chicago-boys when they advocated reform in Pinochet’s Chile.

Not only did he deliver peace and a decent political deal, but Cristiani oversaw a boom in jobs and growth, the economy expanding at nearly five percent during the 1990s. Things started to slow in the 2000s and, since the FMLN took over from Arena in 2009, it has rapidly tapered off, limping along at under 2%, now the slowest in Central America. Poverty fell by half during Arena’s two decades in government to just 30%. It has since risen once more to over 40%, even though the FMLN has spent more, the fiscal deficit reaching 2.8% of GDP, with debt rising from 2009 from 40% to over 60% of GDP.

Muyshondt reckons that San Salvador’s debt could have quadrupled under the populist reign of his FMLN predecessor Nayib Bukele, less because of infrastructure expenditure than long-term contracts.

“One of the first things we will have to do is a detailed audit on where the money went,” he notes.

The new mayor’s agenda for the city will , however, aim to deal with insecurity, increase opportunities and improve a sense of order, including on the streets of San Salvador.

“It’s not acceptable,” he says pointing east from the terrace of our hotel, “that just 50m is a community living in a corriente, a stream, which puts them at risk several times every year when it floods. And they live side-by-side with $1-million mansions”.

Achieving his agenda will, he admits, need to get the population to engage beyond the headlines.

The political rise of Nayib Bukele hints at the scale of this particular challenge. Once a rising star of the FMLN, Bukele was expelled from the party in 2017 over alleged sexist comments. With 1.2m Facebook followers, 441,000 on Twitter and 277,500 on Instagram, he apparently offers a post-ideological alternative to traditional right-left, Arena-FMLN political divisions, though with seemingly little more than virtual content on pressing issues of growth, jobs and crime. His project, which “prefers advertising to organising,” notes one leftist writer, “is, essentially, himself”.

Still, Bukele’s pulling power can be seen in his call to his former FMLN followers to stay away during the March 2018 legislative elections. They did just that, with a low turnout of just 42% handing a resounding win to Arena, which won nine out of 14 major mayorships, and 37 of 84 seats in the National Assembly. One in 10 voters defaced their ballots or left them blank. Little wonder, given that polls show that Salvadoreans believe that gangs — not government officials — ‘rule’ the country.

Bukele may win the 2019 presidential election unless the two main parties refocus and reset themselves. This is more of a challenge for the FMLN. Of its 31 deputies at the start of 2018, 26 participated in the war. For Arena, just a single one of its 35 deputies did so. Regardless, refreshing the party’s leadership has become Arena’s major preoccupation.

Gerardo Dias is a campaign strategist for Carlos Calleja, 42, who won the election for the Arena leadership in May. Unlike Muyshondt, whose cotton-growing father lost everything in the civil war “save his debts”, the US-educated Calleja’s family is one of the wealthiest in El Salvador, the owners of the Super Selectos chain of some 98 supermarkets. This profile, unfortunately, reinforces stereotypes about the “progressive” FMLN and “oligarchic” Arena, the sort of polemic that the new breed of politicians will have to break if the country is to make progress.

Younger voters, says Dias, are more attracted to the kind of profile enjoyed by (President Emmanuel) Macron in France, those who come from the world from outside politics. He cites recent surveys which show that as many as 70% of Salvadoreans do not identify with any party, the highest such record in El Salvador’s polling history.

“Whereas previously our loyal voting pool, like the FMLN, was 40% of the electorate with 20% as swing voters,” illustrates Dias, “now less than 20% can be considered loyalists. People are tired of old ideologies and more open-minded to change.”

They are more likely, he believes, to challenge politicians.

Winning them over will require going back to basics he says.

“The paradox of the modern environment is that, while social media means you have more friends, relationships dilute – more people know, but they know less. Yet you have to fight harder for their attention.”

Thus he and Calleja have reverted in method to running “Town Hall” meetings with interest groups – so-called Plataforma de Participacion Ciudadana (Civic Participation Platforms) – less to promote the party than to engage with civil society, exchange ideas and build relationships. These include groups of artists, entrepreneurs, fishermen, and factory workers. Similarly, Muyshondt spent a lot of his campaign pounding the streets, going door-to-door in addition to the ubiquitous use of Facebook and other tools, in the process running the cheapest mayoral campaign for San Salvador in recent times, at just $1.6-million.

Success will demand that they are “more than just a wrapper” of slogans says Dias, reaching out to others for good ideas, including the likes of Costa Rica (on tourism), Israel (on agriculture), Colombia (security) and Spain (for low cost housing models). This contrasts with the FMLN, which is accused by civil society of not consulting outside of the party and its inner circle for advice and ideas, remaining less new left, than the old statist, socialist model, saysMuyshondt, like Cuba and Venezuela.

Calleja advocates a three-prong reform strategy focused on building a responsive government, tackling economic growth and seeking ‘unity in leaving behind the continuous fighting of the previous generations, since conflict has retarded our development.

“We need to focus on the things we agree on like better education, health care and ending violence,” states Dias.

No doubt the new leadership generation will have to shake the stain of corruption which assists the likes of Bukele and his ‘New Ideas’ movement and bedevils both Arena and the FMLN.

In February 2016, the first FMLN president Mauricio Funes, in power from 2009 until 2014, was found guilty of illegal enrichment. By then Nicaragua had granted him political asylum. His Arena presidential predecessor Tony Saca was arrested in October 2016, accused along with others in his administration of syphoning $246-million of public money. He is now in jail awaiting trial. Saca’s predecessor Francisco “Paca” Flores was accused (but never convicted) for having diverted $15-million in funding from the Taiwan government. Flores’ vice president Ana Vilma de Escobar is another under current investigation.

“We have gone off track because of corruption. When Saca – who was a disaster – entered government, corruption started to invest government institutions. Saca paid the president of the Supreme Court, for example, a monthly wage. When any country is corrupted in this way, then nothing works. People are no longer working for the country, but for themselves, to get rich,” says Cristiani.

The impact of Venezuela has not helped. The establishment of the Alba petroleum joint venture between Venezuela’s PDVSA state oil company and FMLN-controlled municipalities has proven a funnel for funding and means of clientalism. Allegedly as much as $1-billion has gone “missing” in the process. The Alba venture is allegedly part of complex money laundering operation involving the Maduro regime in Venezuela and their FARC Colombian ally. They forget, reminds another former Mayor of San Salvador, Norman Quijano, “that when communists (such as the FMLN) get into power, it’s not easy to get them to let go”.

There are other pernicious if unintended aspects which reinforce consumption and lack of ownership. With the share of agriculture to GDP falling to less than ten percent of GDP and its share of employment to under 20%, people have to make a plan. Some 3.5-million Salvadoreans live in the US remitting $5-billion, or nearly 20% of GDP, annually. This has both helped to offset endemic un- and under-employment including ‘informality’, at over 70% of the six-million citizens who remain in the country, but too has reinforced a dependency culture.

Overall the lessons of El Salvador’s transition from war to peace are threefold:

First, there is a constant need for political savvy and comprise, as it was in El Salvador in 1992, in order to achieve the continuity required for economic development. This applies, too, to the role of civil society as both a check and balance and adviser to government, which has all but been cut-off from access to the administration during the FMLN period of government.

Political support has, second, encouragingly reflected the performance of political parties. There is a need for parties to understand what the voters want rather than presume as much, at least as much as an imperative to understand their opponents.

Third, El Salvador’s initially successful transition from war to peace and its subsequent slide towards populism and weakened governance has profound lessons for leadership

Looking back, Cristiani advises that to be a successful leader:

“You have to lead towards things with a high moral goal. You have to use it for something good for the general population. You have to lead by example. You have to listen a lot, and learn from what you hear. But you also have to take risks. You have to understand that that you will not always get the support of everyone. Your actions have always to be in the interests of the majority of people, not just a few, and definitely not just yourself.”

But this has not diminished his faith in democracy. In his darker moments, he thinks that perhaps “we might benefit from a benevolent dictatorship. Then I am reminded that while they might start as benevolent, they usually end up a dictatorship”. DM

By John A. Akec*

The importance of a vision in the life of a nation is as ancient as our planet earth. Visions have underpinned the rise and fall of great civilizations throughout the recorded history of the world. Its mention goes back as far as the Bible time, wherein the book of Proverb we read: “where there is no vision, people perish.” Other versions of the holy book put it more starkly: “when there is no vision, people cast off restraint.” What does this mean exactly?

One the hand, and in the biblical context, lawlessness and sin reign supreme in societies and nations where divine guidance and the moral anchors, which Christianity and all other forms of organised religion strive to provide, are no longer central to what people do or not do. Sodom and Gomorrah were examples of visionless societies that abandoned all restraint, and have been recorded to serve as a warning on the terrible end that awaits similar societies.

On the hand, and in the political and secular context, governments, societies, and political parties of every stripe need “a vision of the end, and without a vision, there is aimlessness and vast chaos” as once noted by the great American educational philosopher, Robert Maynard Hutchins.

And without any shred of doubt, any possibility of agreeing on a comprehensive peace deal in South Sudan is a welcome news. After all, “a bad peace is better than a good war,” as the Yiddish wisdom puts it. But we also need to be reminded that this famous Yiddish wisdom is not without critics who counter that “a bad peace is worse than war.”In our context, one can argue that any peace deal that has no vision of the ‘end result’, is bad peace. Specifically, for South Sudan at this moment in time, the end result should be a united, prosperous, and resilient nation.

Hence, while we applaud the current momentum towards an inclusive peace deal that has been jump-started by the signing of Khartoum Framework Agreement, the absence of clear pointers to state-building goals should be a cause for concern, lest the emerging peace deal eventually unravels like its predecessors. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the parties to the regionally backed peace talks to try their hardest in order negotiate a peace settlement whose primary goal does not merely stop at the distribution of power, but that which must be based on a farsighted vision capable of propelling the country out of the vicious cycle of violence and socio-economic stagnation into spheres of sustainable peace, unity, security, and prosperity. In short, we need a peace deal that “will end all wars” in our country. And here are some, not necessarily all, of the elements of such a vision.

First, the agreement should resolve that South Sudan must be governed by its constitution. Our Interim Constitution is a good document that must guide and inspire all that we do or not do. And if there are clauses in the constitution that hinder our progress towards building a prosperous and united country, then we should speedily amend it. And until the amended constitution is passed, our current constitution should be our reference point and the anchor on which all government, business, and civil society actions are based.

Second, we must recognise that stagnation and the lack of socio-economic development could be a cause of current and future wars. Citizens must be given stakes that will raise the opportunity costs of war and consolidate peace. In the last 4 years, our country experienced negative economic growth as indicated by an ever contracting GDP. Oil production has dropped from over 350,000 bpd in 2011 to under 120,000 bpd in 2018. We remain amongst the most oil-dependent countries in the world. The contribution of tax to government budgets is insignificant We fought three disastrous wars since 2011. Our ability to provide services such as health and education has been affected negatively. Foreigners want to take over the security of our citizens.

And as the late architect, Constance Adams, who worked in American space programmes once noted: “no nation in the history of the earth has failed to conduct great projects and remained significant.” The Great Wall of China, Pyramids of Egypt, Burj Khalifa in Dubai, and Ivor Tower in Paris, are all expressions of what peoples of those great nations are capable of dreaming up and achieving. Until now, we as a nation are yet to complete a single ambitious project that we can be proud of.

What is holding us back? One may ask. It is my view that we can only reverse our fortunes if we can look inward to identify the weaknesses in our systems, and then devise strategies for overcoming them. Let me briefly outline some of these internal systemic weaknesses and possible strategic options for future success.

To begin with, by failing to raise enough taxes from our citizens to fund government’s budgets, our country is missing out of the benefits that come with dependence on tax revenues. Research shows that the benefits of depending on taxes for government revenues include strengthening of the institutions of fiscal governance, improved government transparency and accountability, and strengthening of the nation’s bureaucratic capability.

Furthermore, as a country, we must recognise that we have been drinking from a poisoned well. That is, our oil-dependent economy hinders our progress on many fronts. Economists have long found strong links between dependency on primary commodity for export earning and likelihood of civil wars. They argued that rents from extractive industries (oil and gas, diamonds, and timber) increase greed and attract the wrong kinds of people into politics. Researchers made their conclusions after studying the underlying causes of 47 civil wars in resource-rich countries around the globe. Commenting on these stark findings, Tina Rosenberg of the New York Times wrote: “Every nation wants to strike oil, and after it happens, nearly every nation is worse off for it.”Weaning ourselves from too much dependence on oil revenue could be the beginning of progress. The sooner, the better.

The question is how? Help is around the corner in terms of availability of models to emulates in order to escape the resource curse. The same research that unearthed these dark findings also points to possible remedies and experiences of others such as Norway (locking oil revenue out of economy), Alaska (distribution of rents to all citizens and future investment accounts), Botswana (establishing cluster of institutions for protection of private property) , and Rwanda (developmental state) are just few examples of countries that have succeeded to break loose of resource paradox by following certain strategic options. One radical strategic choice recommended by Mick Moore at the Institute of Development Studies at University of Sussex in England (and coauthor of an upcoming textbook: Taxing Africa: Coercion, Reforms, and Development), is for the resource-rich countries to distribute all revenues from primary commodity export to its citizens and then ask the citizens to pay percentages of that back in tax. He believes this can create a sense of commitment amongst citizens and strengthen accountability.

Moreover, our country needs to build its bureaucratic capability not only to be able to collect sufficient taxes but also to be able to manage external shocks more effectively as well as being able to turn our societal aspirations into actionable policies and projects. This can be achieved by reforming civil service so that only, and only the most capable and ethical amongst our citizens can be admitted into the public service, irrespective of the ethnic background or religious belief.

Finally, any future peace agreement should aim at reducing the transitional period to no more than 12 months. Why? Elections by in themselves are part of democratic development in the life of a nation. Regular elections do much to exercise tolerance of citizens and the politicians to celebrate victory in humility and accept electoral defeat in grace. Elections also provide the needed once-in-a-while opportunity for citizens to hold their government accountable and chose those who will rule the country on their behalf, and hence impart legitimacy and give the strong mandate to elected government nationally and internationally.

Depending on how the above nation-building blocks are captured by the peace deal being negotiated, we will be wrestling at heaven’s gate. And wrestling for that goal we should.

City council has approved a “Surrey City Lab” that’s set to open this September.

The “learning lab” project is a three-year partnership with KPU and SFU, and was unanimously approved by council Monday night.

According to a release, it will “deliver a program that will engage the region’s post-secondary students in real world issues affecting Surrey, offer civic related courses that contain City of Surrey priorities, and expand interdisciplinary and integrated opportunities for KPU and SFU students to learn and work together.”

A city report notes the three-year pilot will “offer SFU and KPU courses beginning in year 1 with current individual courses, and work over three years to build interdisciplinary options that integrate KPU and SFU students.

“The partners will work with current courses and with KPU and SFU faculty willing to engage their students and curriculum with city issues and challenges,” it adds.

Courses will be offered in their existing spaces, with some opportunity to host classes in city spaces such as City Hall and the City Centre Library. After year one of the project, dedicated space will be sought for the lab, which would be a city owned and operated building in City Centre.

The city says the Surrey lab joins a small, but growing, global network of “pioneering” cities adopting university partnerships to advance civic strategic priorities.

“The program will allow for co-created projects between students and city staff and will include direct curriculum connections to City of Surrey priorities and challenges,” a release notes. “Both partnerships will focus on interdisciplinary and experiential projects that benefit the community.”

For a three-year pilot, the city has committed to a contribution $138,000, which will be matched by KPU and SFU for a total of $414,000.

That would pay for a co-ordinator salary, events, material costs such as office expenses, and City Studio network fees.

According to a city report, the co-ordinator will be a “high level strategic thinker, and support City of Surrey staff and advisory committees in developing research questions, policy challenges, and project ideas for students.”

Mayor Linda Hepner said the lab is “another example of the innovative partnerships the city has forged with our higher education institutions.”

“This made in Surrey project is a unique opportunity that will allow for a student experiential learning initiative focused on City of Surrey priorities and challenges,” she added.

Dr. Salvador Ferreras, provost and vice president academic at KPU, said the university is “committed to transforming lives and empowering positive change.”

“As Canada’s only polytechnic university, KPU’s programs link thought to action,” he added. “Surrey City Lab will challenge our future leaders to provide positive solutions to real-time community issues. We are delighted that our students will have access to an even more enriched experiential learning opportunity through the transformative work of Surrey City Lab.”

SFU Surrey’s Executive Director Steve Dooley said his university is also committed to engaged with communities, and “providing students with real world learning opportunities.”

“As a Surrey City Lab partner we look forward to building on these commitments and to contributing through them to help Surrey advance its priorities and tackle its most pressing issues,” said Dooley.

Beyond the three-year pilot, the partners intend to look for external funding such as from foundations and other levels of government.

All have failed because they have not properly assessed the psychological nature of the problem and have largely ignored traditional conflict resolution systems in the subcontinent. If they were to delve deeper, international peacekeepers could take hope and inspiration from a smaller, older and more local justice system which has been mediating disputes in warring territories for centuries.

Conflict resolution is a cultural phenomenon and is dependent on any society’s relevant norms, practices and institutions. While conflict is universal, the ways in which it is expressed and managed are not. There are a variety of techniques and processes for handling conflict around the world which take in the culture of the warring groups. Different cultures develop their own formal and informal ways of handling conflict—such as Ubuntu/Gacaca and Mato Oput in Africa, Jirga in Afghanistan and Sulah in the Middle East.

For example, adultery can receive different types and scales of punishment in different cultures.

This can make conflict resolution seem complicated as each specific cultural model has its own perception of conflict and the techniques for resolving it. For example, adultery can receive different types and scales of punishment in different cultures.

Interestingly, a large number of interstate conflicts in the world are between culturally similar groups, such as North and South Korea, Serbia-Croatia-Bosnia and Palestine and Israel. Therefore, the study of indigenous models for conflict resolution is crucial before proposing a peacemaking agenda for such nations.

The panchayat system

Rural societies in India and Pakistan are structurally similar, if not identical in every detail. Both are agrarian societies and basic needs, including justice, have always been provided to people at village level. These village communities have been termed “little kingdoms” and “little republics”, being self-sufficient and almost independent of any foreign relations.

Traditionally, the panchayat system has acted as the justice-providing/conflict resolution organ in South Asian villages (mainly in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal). The word “panchayat” literally means a gathering of five but technically it is used to represent a council of respected village elders. The term has been used for centuries to describe traditional village assemblies.

The panchayat system is still practised in many parts of the subcontinent for conflict resolution. And despite massive urbanisation during the last three decades, around 70% of people still live in villages in both India and Pakistan.

Indigenous psychology

I believe the main reason international conciliators have failed to bring peace to this emotionally charged region is their ignorance of indigenous psychology. International peacemakers need to know what the secrets behind the success of the panchayat system are before delving into statewide issues.

The success of panchayatees (the five members of panchayat jury) largely depends upon both their respect and status within communities. It is not only the standing of jury members that enables them to impose their verdicts but the honour bestowed upon them by the parties in dispute. As an indigenous saying explains: “Even the prostitutes have money and power, but no prestige.” This could explain why superpowers like the former USSR and the US have failed to permanently resolve the conflict.

The panchayat system deals with both emotional and material aspects of the conflict. One strategy involves hearing the grievances of those in dispute repeatedly to help desensitise the problem. The prolonged discussions covering all potential perspectives facilitate a kind of emotional catharsis. The history of conflict and past wounds are often of more concern to the warring parties than the actual conflict itself. The material part of the dispute is only a minor expression of a longstanding antagonistic relationship between two groups.

The panchayat system deals with both emotional and material aspects of the conflict.

Long hearings in the presence of the entire community help to dissipate much of the emotion through this repeated recalling and re-experiencing of the grievance. The psychology behind this is to resolve the enmity and address the root causes.

Relative Justice

In contrast to universal principles of equality, the panchayat system provides relative justice based on the individuals and their community. The honour (Izzat) and status of the clashing parties has a strong bearing on the final decision which aims to save the honour of both sides—rather than sticking very closely to the facts. This aspect may seem strange to “Western” peacemakers and could be why it has been largely ignored as an arbitration tactic, despite its success at village level.

Jury members know exactly that people in the subcontinent can bear the material loss but not the loss of honour. Panchayat members provide both parties with “face-saving” resolutions, offering them different doses of honour and material benefits. The weaker party is usually privileged in terms of material benefits while the powerful party is promised an elevation in status.

It is time for international arbitrators to understand the locally constructed and time-tested common sense of conflict resolution in both countries. The process must be placed firmly within the frames of reference of both feuding groups.

The psychology does not differ much between interstate conflicts and smaller disputes within towns and villages. Although the Pakistan-India conflict is at the top of the scale when compared to village level quarrels, the characteristics are the same.

It is not to say that the panchayat system should replace the institutional layers of the modern international state system. But it should be used as inspiration to develop a workable model for interstate conflict resolution, one that appreciates the psychological and moral structures of this older and more humble form of justice.

Let’s take the example of two landlords, A and B (India and Pakistan), first cousins, both very powerful, with large families who cause confusion because everyone has a different opinion. In between their lands live two farmers, C and D (Kashmir), whose land has been respectively claimed by both A and B. In fact, they have divided C and D’s land with a fence. C and D are brothers who are not allowed to cross over this fence or talk to each other and are told that they have no real rights to their land; if they want to stay there, they better shut up and do as they are told.

Both A and B don’t really talk to each other because of their oversized egos, and they occasionally put up an act of trying to sort out the problem without any real intention. They sometimes fire their guns at each other to keep the issue alive.

The question to be answered is: If we really want to solve the problem of these two landlords, what do we need to do?

The first solution is for A or B to kill each other and take over the land of C and D completely. This is very difficult to do because both sides have guns and bombs, and it is likely that both A and B, along with their families, would be completely annihilated.

The second solution is for A and B to split the territory, telling C and D that the fence running through their land is permanent and to beat them up whenever they open their mouths. But C and D won’t accept this solution because they are real brothers.

The third solution is for A and B to allow C and D to live peacefully, giving up their respective rights. But this is unworkable because of the strong views of their families and their own personal egos.

The fourth and only real solution is for A and B to stop firing at each other and let C and D live in peace, meet and talk to each other, while taking some of their farm’s produce in taxes. They also help these farmers so their farm yield — and so their taxes — are higher. Everyone benefits. This is the only long-term solution to the Kashmir problem.

BACK TO REALITY

Let’s start with acknowledging the truth that most Kashmiris want independence (azadi) from both Pakistan and India, whether openly or secretly, even if they don’t admit this to the media. This is the third (and not workable) solution of a Kashmiri plebiscite under United Nations Security Council Resolution 47, which requires Pakistan to first withdraw from Kashmir. India would also never give its consent for this because it would be politically unacceptable in the country and disastrous for any election, aside from legal issues of secession needing careful management.

At least some Kashmiris acknowledge that this is never going to happen, albeit youngsters cling on to their pipe dream of independence, with many losing their lives in this quest. There is no doubt that the youth of Kashmir hates both India and Pakistan because of the loss of their basic freedoms as human beings. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the Indian-administered Kashmir.

The Indian Ministry of Home Affairs states in its annual report for 2017-18 that, since the start of militancy in 1990 and up to December 31, 2017, in India-administered Kashmir 13,976 civilians and 5,123 security personnel were killed in various incidents. Separately, it confirmed that 21,965 militants were killed from 1990 to March 31, 2017. However, human rights groups, such as Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society, put the number of civilian deaths from 1990 at a much higher figure of 100,000. According to the UN, the Kashmir conflict “has robbed millions of their basic human rights.”

The reality on the ground in Indian-administered Kashmir is that India has deployed one soldier for every 12 Kashmiri (Jammu and Kashmir) civilians — an estimated 700,000 security forces consisting of the army, paramilitary forces, Jammu and Kashmir police and other security agencies — to fight around 250 to 300 freedom fighters.

Former CIA Director David Petraeus’ counterinsurgency field manual says that experts recommend ratios close to 25:1,000 residents, which the US has never met in Afghanistan. Compare this to India’s 59:1,000 ratio, bearing in mind that the US Army is better trained and has better weapons and equipment.

Pakistan faces similar charges of human rights abuses in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, ranging from political repression, electoral fraud, forced disappearances, torture and suppression of freedom of speech. Neither country has allowed the UN high commissioner for human rights unconditional access to their respective protectorates.

The “Other”

Both India and Pakistan, first cousins and nuclear states, are currently in a quagmire of the first and second solutions, fluctuating between them depending on which government is in power and, particularly in Pakistan, how much the army chief or the head of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) exercises power over the civilian government. The genocide of the Partition and the 1971 Bangladesh War, along with other conflicts, have institutionalized hatred toward the “other” within the government.

This is reflected in the armed forces’ and intelligence services’ approach, even if Indian and Pakistani civilians get along perfectly well and are the best of friends abroad. It may be stated that the Kashmir issue is an intricate web that serves the interests of all in power and that nobody is actually interested in a permanent negotiated solution in which they compromise on their stated positions. Religious radicalization, nationalism and territorial ambitions have together created a bloodbath in Kashmir.

The BJP being in power is actually a fantastic opportunity for Pakistan to engage in a fruitful manner while bringing multiple stakeholders within its country to the table. It is virtually impossible to achieve a political solution in Kashmir with a weak coalition government at the national level.

Pakistan is described by academics as being an “ideological state” that is “persistently revisionist,” seeking to acquire territory in Kashmir that it does not need for security reasons, and also to reverse India’s emergence as a global power. The army dominates its foreign and domestic policies and projects its conflict with India in civilizational terms in a face-off between “Muslim Pakistan” and a “Hindu” enemy, with itself as Pakistan’s savior. It has undermined efforts by civilian governments to normalize relationships with India, including through trade and investment.

Further complications occur because of the considerable hold that Pakistan’s army has over the country’s economy. The army controls one-third of all heavy manufacturing in the country and up to 7% of private assets. The Pakistan armed forces run over 50 commercial entities worth over $20 billion. Key appointments and public sector posts normally occupied by civilians are given to senior retired and serving military officers. With this size, scale and power, it needs a constant enemy to define itself in relation to. This complicates problems because India’s traditional approach is to talk to the civilian government on the issue of Kashmir, whereas the army and the ISI — and even Islamists — run parallel governments in Pakistan. If India does not talk to all the relevant people at the same time, then it is simply not talking to the correct people, and the peace process will ultimately be derailed.

Strong Government

While India’s nationalist ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), supported by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS, a right-wing, Hindu nationalist volunteer organization), are driving the country toward “saffronization” — a militant Hinduism — partly with political objectives and partly in genuine fear of Islamic militancy, Pakistan is caught up with the problem of Islamic radicalization. Whatever the historical reasons for the spread of Islamic terrorism across Pakistan, it is certainly clear that this is a long dark path that will ultimately implode Pakistan. It is not in India’s interest to have a Pakistan caught up in the throes of militancy because of the risk of it spilling across the border. There is also the risk that Pakistan’s nuclear weapons (in an end-game scenario) find their way into the hands of Islamic militants with disastrous consequences.

Yet in India’s history there has arguably never been as powerful a government as the RSS-backed BJP that, for all its muscular approaches both in Kashmir and in its 2019 electoral strategy, has the right intentions to make a difference in India — whether it is on the right track or not is a different question. Currently, its tough policy in Kashmir — through a political alliance with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and now in the form of governor’s rule imposed in June — has not wielded the desired results; it is basically solution two from the above example.

India wrongly perceives the Kashmir conflict as a security issue and not a political one that needs a tripartite agreement that would include Kashmiri leaders and separatists. The BJP being in power is actually a fantastic opportunity for Pakistan to engage in a fruitful manner while bringing multiple stakeholders within its country to the table. It is virtually impossible to achieve a political solution in Kashmir with a weak coalition government at the national level. Assuming the BJP gets a second term in 2019, by 2020 it would have a majority in the upper house of parliament, the Rajya Sabha, making a deal with Pakistan easier to pass in both houses.

From 1947 to AK47

It is also important to look at the demographics in India to understand the overall context for a peaceful coexistence between its Hindu majority (80%) and Muslim minority (14%). In history, Islamic fundamentalists have been driven by an ideology of hatred and the desire to convert the “other.” However, India’s Hindus have resisted conversion through 800 years of Muslim rule. Moreover, the bulk of conversions to Islam in India happened in the hinterlands (and not around the capital cities of the Muslim sultans) as a result of the secular Sufi movement that Islamic fundamentalists denounce.

Kashmir was historically a land of Sufi Islam. Sufism is a good fit with Hindu-majority India because of its focus on love and humanity and the fact that almost all schools (barring the Naqshbandi School) do not require or pursue conversion to Islam actively. Mainstream Islam, on the other hand, will find itself in perpetual conflict with a nationalistic and determined Hindu population, particularly in the hinterlands. This fact needs to be accepted by the institutions in Pakistan (civilian government, army, ISI) and respected in order to have any long-term peaceful solution in Kashmir and also to manage its relations with India.

Historically, the bravest warriors in India were Sikhs who were mostly Hindus inspired by the Sikh beliefs of justice, righteous action and martyrdom for a just cause. The current wave of nationalism gripping India is arming and training Hindus in the hinterland for self-defense against Islamic fundamentalists, creating a new breed akin to the Sikh soldiers of the past. The bloodbath of radical Islamic militants facing these Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP, a right-wing Hindu nationalist organization affiliated with the RSS) Dharam Yodhas (religious warriors) head on is left to the reader’s imagination.

India has followed the same strategy in Kashmir since 1947 — in the words of a Kashmiri “from 1947 to the AK47” — that fits the definition of insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Pakistan is no different. Its support for cross-border terrorist attacks in India via proxies have effectively labeled the Kashmiri freedom struggle as a terrorist movement and caused them to lose Western support. People on both sides of the border suffer from fatigue with their governments’ approach to Kashmir. Ordinary civilians in both countries are sick of powerful politicians and generals talking big on nationalism and painting the other as the enemy.

It’s a false narrative, and people are now beginning to understand this, especially those civilians who interact with people across the border. Besides the issue of human rights violations, the amount of money wasted on the armed forces of both countries, the energy expended by its leaders on developing strategy and policy to counter the other, the misuse of the issue to whip up fear and animosity before elections — all these could be avoided if the institutions were more sincere about dealing with the issue through negotiation. They need to focus on growing their respective economies and eradicating poverty both in Kashmir and more broadly within the two countries.

It is important to underscore that India is less of a country and more a subcontinent, where diverse peoples coexist, as do multiple religions. Its diversity is both its strength and weakness, because there have been various separatist movements against the union at different points of time. The Khalistan movement of the Sikhs, insurgencies in India’s northeast states, the far-left communist Naxalite rebellion and the Kashmir insurgency are four key examples of such movements. Whilst some movements are more under control — the Dravida Nadu movement, for instance, is defunct — than others, the Kashmir issue cannot be seen as being anything special or different from other independence struggles, each of which has its own grievances and logic.

Similarly, Pakistan also has prominent ethnic nationalist movements, including the Bengali nationalist movement (which led to the creation of Bangladesh), Sindhudesh, Pashtunistan and the Free Balochistan movement. Realistically, what the Kashmiri people need to expect as an end-goal is a solution within the status quo and a return of peace and economic prosperity to the two Kashmirs. To ask for more is a denial of both the complexities and realities of the Kashmir issue.

Toward a Solution

So let’s look at the key components to construct a tripartite agreement implementing the fourth solution in which India and Pakistan stop firing each other and let Kashmir live in peace while both countries add value and levy taxes in their respective administered Kashmirs. This requires letting go of the past and moving forward in a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect, focusing on the future rather than being held hostage by the past.

First, we need to get the engagement model right. There needs to be time-bound engagement on both sides with multiple stakeholders, including the civilian government, army, intelligence, separatist leaders and civil society. This needs to include the resettlement of Kashmiri Pandits in the valley and a cessation of Islamic fundamentalist activities and disarmament.

Ultimately, the land being fought over in Kashmir is not as important as the people and their right to peace, security and to enjoy the fruits of development — to lead a normal life that we take for granted.

Over 100,000 Kashmiri Pandits fled the violence in India-administered Kashmir in the 1990s. Currently, the numbers in India are around 62,000; 40,000 of these live in Jammu, 20,000 live in Delhi and its satellite cities. Kashmir traditionally had a peaceful composite culture called Kashmiriyat, signifying the centuries-old indigenous secularism of Kashmir that demanded religious and social harmony and brotherhood. This needs to be restored to the valley. Interestingly, Muslims in the valley want the Pandits back and not in segregated townships. While ghettos are undesirable in the long term, for reasons of security it is likely that initially a mix of new townships and restoring Pandits to the areas originally inhabited by them is needed.

Second, the powers and constraints placed on the armed forces need review and modification. India needs to address the humanitarian concern around Kashmir by repealing the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act in its current form, replacing it with a version that recognizes and protects human rights of innocent Kashmiris. This is unlikely to offer protection to known terrorists, putting a brake on enforced disappearances of innocent civilians detained for questioning.

However, it also means that new legislation is likely to bring in stronger military and criminal measures to protect the rights of the Indian security forces who have had to face stone-pelting, to bring the stone throwers in line with the law (the law in countries like the US and Israel is far more stringent). The consequences of stone-pelting should be made clear to the civilian population in advance so that if they indulge in this, it would be at their own risk and responsibility. It is also good to involve parents to control their underage children from inadvertently becoming casualties. This should be part of the civilian outreach and is absolutely essential to the long-term success of any peace agreement.

Pakistan also faces charges from Kashmiris that intelligence agencies trap poor Kashmiri youth into a cycle of terrorism and frequent human rights violations, including enforced disappearances of people who live in villages close to the Line of Control (LOC). Hence, on both sides of the LOC, the armed forces would need to have similar powers and constraints imposed by humanitarian law.

Third, India and Pakistan need to issue a joint person of Kashmiri origin card, a 25-year multiple-entry visa entitling Kashmiris (from Greater Jammu and Kashmir) to travel for up to 180 days and invest anywhere in Jammu and Kashmir, whether in Pakistan or India. Controls can be there initially for periodic reporting to the local police stations every 15 days, but this can be dropped as the plan becomes a success and peace is restored. Moreover, where a Kashmiri is buying and selling goods from another Kashmiri across the border, it can be agreed that there would be zero import duties, but other customs checks on the nature of the goods would continue as normal.

Fourth — focus on autonomy alongside integration. India’s Kashmir currently enjoys a high degree of autonomy on paper through Article 370 of the Indian Constitution (except for defense, foreign affairs, finance and communications), and Pakistan-administered Kashmir also has significant autonomy, although actual practice differs in both parts. Specifically, it needs to be examined whether a higher degree of financial autonomy is required for both Kashmirs and how this would work.

For peace in Kashmir, India must address rights abuses by security forces.

Currently, impunity is the norm.https://t.co/X6B7TNitMk pic.twitter.com/E6XfZOnzDw — Human Rights Watch (@hrw) April 7, 2018

It is currently unclear whether Article 370 can be legally dropped altogether or not. Irrespective of that, Indians would want at least limited property rights, such as 99-year leasehold, in India’s Kashmir. Pakistan should do the same on its side. This also helps in national integration with mainstream Indians and Pakistanis. Avoiding ghettos of any sort is necessary for long-term peace, particularly in an Indian context.

Fifth — build focused law and order arrangements. Personal and religious freedom must be protected in both parts of Kashmir. India and Pakistan need to create a joint mechanism that agrees a common minimum plan for the entire Kashmir area including, for example, enhanced monitoring (such as using artificial intelligence) of radical preachers in mosques and madrassas, including publications distributed by them.

A minimum curriculum for madrassa students, including the secular teachings of Sufi Islam on love and humanity, should be introduced, and limitations placed on sharia courts to provide non-binding arbitration/mediation judgments on civil matters related to family disputes such as inheritance or divorce cases, review of fatwas issued on religious matters to ensure that they do not infringe upon the rights of individuals guaranteed under law; training for judges is needed. Websites and chat rooms need to be monitored and/or blocked to curb radicalization, as well as clamp down on the sale and distribution of extremist DVDs. Hawala funding needs to be monitored, including the use of cryptocurrencies on the dark web. Exchange of intelligence information and joint security operations must be undertaken across both sides of the border to flush out any remnant terrorist pockets.

Sixth — eventually, demilitarization is needed. This can be considered on both sides of Kashmir based on a phased approach once peace is firmly established, leaving sufficient armed forces to maintain law and order (including riot control) and counterterrorism on both sides.

Seventh — make investments and expect returns. India and Pakistan need to come out with a plan to invest in Kashmir’s industry, agriculture, services and tourism. There needs to be a budget and a new joint development body to execute these plans through both direct infrastructure investments, building institutions (such as popularizing high-yield agriculture) and lending via existing banks. It should be the same integrated plan with each country’s money being spent on their respective areas. Of course, central governments should recover these investments through taxes. The free ride for Kashmir has to stop in order to deal with the resentment that non-Kashmiris have for their tax money being used in mollycoddling Kashmiris who enjoy autonomy unlike most other states.

Eighth — establish the international border. Of course, the LOC would need to become a permanent international border in the context of the above (including Kashmir territory under Chinese control) legitimizing the status quo and ideally solving India’s other border disputes on its northeastern border with China in the same deal. India would need to make its peace with China on its Belt and Road initiative running through Kashmir, using it to benefit its half of Kashmir and the rest of India economically.

The full list of disputed territories in the area includes Jammu and Kashmir (also Ladakh), administered by India and claimed by Pakistan; Azad Kashmir — Pakistan-administered Kashmir, claimed by India; Northern Areas (Gilgit-Baltistan) part of Kashmir administered by Pakistan and claimed by India; Siachen Glacier, administered by India and claimed by Pakistan; Aksai Chin administered by China and claimed by India (India’s 1962 war with China was fought here); and the Shaksam Valley administered by China and claimed by India.

Ninth — create a role for the UN. In the context of an agreement between India, Pakistan and Kashmiri leaders and separatists, unconditional access needs to be given to the office of the UN high commissioner for human rights on both sides of the new international border. Both countries need to agree to act on any recommendations from the UN commissioner, wherever possible. Jammu and Kashmir has hitherto been treated as a “bilateral issue” under the Simla Agreement of 1972, albeit this only referred to the process of building a political solution.

Tenth — focus on building other bridges. Within Kashmir, engaging with the civilian population to get their buy-in for the peace agreement and to help them alleviate grievances is absolutely essential. A sustained campaign is needed, not a one-off effort, and to work it needs to be well thought through (involving social psychologists) and well managed. Beyond Kashmir, an economically resurgent India also has a role to help eradicate poverty in South Asia. Hence, a similar 25-year multiple-entry visa needs to be issued to prominent businessmen and other prominent persons (artists, writers, musicians) in both countries to cover travel, investment, trade (part of, but not a solution in itself) and working anywhere in India and Pakistan. Automated immigration services could be set up in key cities.

Eleventh — recognize that friends don’t fight. It obviously follows that Pakistan would need to give up its “bleed India with a thousand cuts” policy using proxies, and India would need to stop interfering in Baluchistan altogether. Both would need to release all Kashmiri political prisoners from their respective jails. Pakistan would need to remove extreme messages inciting religious hatred against Hindus from all school textbooks and cease all training camps for Kashmiri freedom fighters.

Twelfth — lead the transition with professional project management. Both India and Pakistan are notorious for their shoddy implementation of otherwise good ideas. What is needed is a systemic approach with a jointly appointed team consisting of professional managers, members of the civilian government, army and intelligence, with proper authorities responsible for information and transparent discussion of policies, identifying all the changes needed and rolling them out systematically. It also needs a high-level project governance committee consisting of the respective prime ministers, heads of the two parts of Kashmir, key central government ministers and army and intelligence chiefs meeting once a month via video conferencing to monitor progress.

The solution is as simple as we want it to be or as complex as we want it to be. It can take six months to agree or 60 years. But certainly without recognizing the existence of multiple stakeholders and having a time-bound negotiation, we can never expect to see peace in Kashmir or in the region as a whole. India’s approach of closing its porous border and treating Kashmir as a security problem is a short-term stop-gap solution that does not recognize the humanitarian cost, nor does it treat Kashmir as the unfinished business of Partition.

Pakistan’s approach of funding cross-border fighters is ultimately a piecemeal and failing strategy that achieves nothing long-term other than trouble for the local Kashmiri population. It remains to be seen whether both countries have the political will, wisdom and compassion needed for an actual solution. Thoughts, words and deeds have to come together for this. We cannot say one thing and do something else. To those who say that peace is never possible, please remember that no one could predict the collapse of the Berlin Wall.

Ultimately, the land being fought over in Kashmir is not as important as the people and their right to peace, security and to enjoy the fruits of development — to lead a normal life that we take for granted.

I. Introduction

The 19th-century English poet Walter Savage Landor once said, “Many laws as certainly make bad men, as bad men make many laws.” This holds true in the troubled state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), which is governed by two contentious laws – one Central and the other a State law – both purportedly aimed at maintaining peace and order. Over the years, the Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act (AFSPA) of 1990 has come under severe criticism for being “draconian” and calls for its revocation have been repeatedly made. However, the state’s political leadership as well as the separatists have been strangely silent on the other law, the Jammu & Kashmir Public Safety Act (PSA), 1978, despite it being slammed as a “lawless law”[1] by Amnesty International and labelled by former Kashmir Committee chief and former Union Law Minister Ram Jethmalani as “something we haven’t heard of even in Nazi Germany”.[2]

Over time, the imposition of PSA, a state law, created a situation where the enforcement of AFSPA by the Centre became inevitable. While the misuse of the former had inadvertently led to the growth of Pakistan-backed insurgency and also triggered a wave of increasingly violent homegrown resistance, the latter had to be implemented to contain the insurgency.

In 1989, when insurgency started in the Kashmir Valley, it had both domestic and foreign dimensions. The insurgency was born as an indigenous movement and targeted primarily the corrupt governance and autocratic rule of Sheikh Abdullah.[3] However, mass rigging of the elections to the state legislature in 1987 created a sense of deep resentment among the people who felt that the sham polls had robbed them of their democratic right to express legitimate dissent against the government in power. The sense of frustration was best expressed by Abdul Gani Lone, former opposition leader and candidate of the Muslim United Front (MUF):

“This simply deepened people’s feelings against the Government of India. If people are not allowed to cast their votes where will their venom go except into expression of anti-national feelings?”[4]

Externally, Kashmir has always been a bone of contention between India and Pakistan, over which the two countries have fought four wars.[5] After the end of the Afghan war in the early 1990s, Pakistan used its war-hardened soldiers and home-bred radicalised jihadis to revive its proxy war and insurgency against the Indian state in J&K. With the help of a section of the Kashmiri society, Pakistan succeeded in making the conflict over Kashmir into the seemingly unending phenomenon that it now is.

Over time, these internal and external dynamics have worked to make the “conflict in Kashmir” – a highly nuanced result of the government’s botched up policies – directly proportional to the “conflict over Kashmir”, one that is a consequence of the unresolved legacy issues between India and Pakistan. Whenever the ‘conflict in Kashmir’ has escalated, the ‘conflict over Kashmir’ has also intensified. For example, from 2016, ceasefire violations (CFVs) – used by Pakistan to provide cover to infiltrators into J&K across the Line of Control (LoC) – have increased enormously in tandem with the escalation of insurgency in Kashmir.

In 2017, India reported 860 CFVs by Pakistan, in which 19 Indian armed forces personnel and 12 civilians died. The same year witnessed 515 cases of infiltration from across the border, in which 75 militants were killed, or 130 percent more than the number reported in 2015. In just 22 days – from 1 January to 22 January 2018—CFVs were recorded on 192 occasions, claiming the lives of eight soldiers and eight civilians.[6]

II. PSA and AFSPA: A Brief History

2.1 PSA

The Public Safety Act, enacted in 1978 by the J&K government to curb timber smuggling, has since evolved as perhaps the most arbitrary tool in the hands of the state police. The law provides for detention for a maximum of two years in case of persons acting in any manner “prejudicial to the security of the state”. Until its amendment in 2012, it also allowed administrative detention of up to one year for “any person acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public law and order”.[7] The law thus gives the police absolute power to detain thousands of people on mere suspicion, against whom there may not be any chargeable criminal offence, and “keep them out of circulation”[8]. Prem Nath Bazaz wrote about the impact of the PSA at the time of its imposition:

“The educated Muslim youth, whose number multiplied several times in 30 years, realised that Sheikh Abdullah’s inconsistent behaviour had done immense harm to the interests of the Kashmiris; it had thwarted their progress and deprived them of several political and human rights enjoyed by all the other Indians.”[9]

According to Wajahat Habibullah, former chair of the National Commission for Minorities, the PSA, “the most draconian law of its kind” in India, is of “more universal application” than the AFSPA. It is applied “methodically and universally” in Kashmir.[10] Prevalent only in J&K, the law curtails the protection of personal life and liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Noted jurist A G Noorani has also said that “if the law (PSA) was enacted elsewhere in India, it would have been instantly struck down by the courts as it violates the fundamental rights bestowed by the Constitution.”[11] Sumit Ganguly, Professor of Political Science at Indiana University once said:

“Indian academics, activists and scholars have written about the PSA and some have argued that it is indeed ultra vires … given its sweeping powers, I would not be surprised that it is, in turn, a cause for further unhappiness and discord.”[12]

A 2010 report by Amnesty International (AI), ‘A Lawless Law: Detentions under the Public Safety Act’, has said that up to 20,000 persons were detained under the PSA since it was enacted in 1978.[13] Over 1,000 detentions were made from March 2016 to August 2017.[14] While arrests under the law continue to be made with impunity, official data show that courts in Kashmir have quashed 1,706 detention orders between 2008 and 2017. The highest number – 215 detention orders – were quashed in 2016 alone.[15]

Despite the numerous PSA orders being quashed, however, frivolous detentions have not only continued but have in fact increased. The police have adopted dubious measures to ensure that the detainees continue to remain behind bars even after the quashing of the PSA charges against them. It is seldom, if at all, that a detainee is able to walk out of prison, owing to what is referred to as “revolving door”[16] detentions or serial detentions designed to keep detainees locked up for years under the PSA, in some cases, even decades. Several other criminal cases are slapped by the police against the detainees during the pendency of the first case, so that when one PSA charge is quashed, another preventive detention order is served even before the detainee is released.

The PSA was amended in 2012 following the recommendations of the then Prime Minister’s Working Group on CBMs.[17] The detention period was reduced to six months from one year for first-time offenders, but the option of two-year detention was kept open to the discretion of the police. Minors were kept out of the purview of the law. However, the amendment has seldom been put into practice, if at all.[18]

The PSA has become a tool for corruption, alienation and radicalisation in Kashmir especially since 2010. This is a worrying trend, as today it is the youth, even stone-pelting teenagers and school boys, who, after prolonged detention under the PSA, are being drawn to militancy.

At the national level, preventive detention is exercised under the National Security Act (NSA) of 1980, which is extended across India except in J&K. Under this law, any person can be detained to prevent him or her “from acting in any manner prejudicial to the defence of India, the relations of India with foreign powers, or the security of India” or public order of any state. The detention cannot exceed three months without any review for first-time detainees. However, unlike the PSA, the NSA communicates to detainees in writing “the grounds on which the order has been made”; they are afforded “the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order to the appropriate Government.”[19] The NSA also mandates both the Central and State governments to constitute one or more advisory boards of three persons under the chairmanship of a sitting or former High Court judge to look into the matter within “three weeks of detention” and the detainee is provided a sort of legal procedure.[20] Still, the NSA too, has come under widespread criticism for arbitrary detentions.

2.2 AFSPA

The AFSPA was first imposed in 1958 in the northeastern states of Assam, Manipur, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura, with the aim of restoring normalcy in “disturbed areas” of the country. It was later applied to Punjab and Chandigarh for 14 years from 1983 to 1997 as a measure against the violent Khalistan movement. In Kashmir, it was introduced only in 1990, despite the Valley having been in the grip of terrorism since the late 1980s.

Notably, the AFSPA has worked towards restoring peace in several other conflict zones of the country. AFSPA was revoked in Punjab in 1997, and it has seen gradual revocation and dilution in the northeast. The Act has been repealed in three out of the seven northeastern states –viz. Tripura, Mizoram and Meghalaya – and has been significantly diluted in Manipur.[21] The AFSPA is expected to be revoked in Nagaland too, following the signing of the peace accord in August 2015.[22]

The AFSPA is invoked when the normal functioning of the state government breaks down and the state, or parts of it, are declared as “disturbed”. The invocation of AFSPA in any state, or parts of it, paves the way for the army to be brought in to restore normalcy in a hostile environment caused by militancy, insurgency or proxy war by a neighbouring country. The AFSPA provides for the protection of the armed forces during high-risk operations and, as such, many of its provisions are deemed to be valid and essential. AFSPA is also a “functional requirement” for the army in terror-hit zones, as the armed forces are mandated to save the country’s critical security installations and equipment.[23] In J&K, Indian armed forces are fighting a proxy war. The AFSPA enables them to fight both the external as well as the externally-abetted forces that threaten not only the security of the state, but also of the country.

There have been sustained – and mostly politically motivated – calls for the revocation of the AFSPA in J&K. Since its inception, the Act has largely failed to achieve any of its primary objectives in the state. The Supreme Court’s observation made in July 2016 that indefinite deployment of armed forces in the name of restoring normalcy under AFSPA “would mock at our democratic process”[24] – made in reference to excesses in Manipur – holds true for Kashmir, too. Ordering a probe against fake encounters in Manipur, the Supreme Court, in its landmark judgement delivered in July 2016, remarked that, “ordinarily our armed forces should not be used against our countrymen and women” and that “every person carrying a weapon in a disturbed area cannot be labelled as a terrorist or insurgent.”[25] Today, these observations could well be equated with Kashmir. Indeed, popular sentiment in the rest of the country – fanned by political vested interests and a sense of misplaced nationalism – has come to largely view all Kashmiris, particularly its agitated youth, as misguided stone-pelters and terrorists.

Over the years, while the allegations of human rights violations under the AFSPA have gone down, similar incidents have increased under the PSA. The period 1990-99 saw 1,170 allegations against AFSPA, coming down to 226 from 2000 to 2004. In the period 2005-09, 54 cases were registered. The number came down to six in 2010, and four in 2011.[26] This was primarily a result of the guidelines issued occasionally by the Supreme Court that have been incorporated as part of the army’s standard operation procedures (SOPs).[27]

Meanwhile, in 2003 alone, 80 percent of the human rights violations cases registered with the J&K State Human Rights Commission were against the Special Operations’ Group (SOG), the voluntary anti-insurgency force of the J&K police. These cases ranged from custodial killings, custodial disappearances, arrests, rapes, molestations, harassment and extortion.[28]

The army has also taken cognisance of many cases and meted punishments to its personnel through army tribunals. In the 104 cases registered against the army in the northeast as well as in Kashmir up to 2013, cognisance was taken by the army within one year. More than 104 personnel, including 39 officers, nine Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs) and 56 other ranks (ORs), were convicted; their punishments varied from 14 years of rigorous imprisonment to dismissal and other penalties prescribed under the Army law.[29]

However, while the outcry against the AFSPA has become louder among the Pakistan-backed separatists, regional political elite and the local media, the PSA has hardly ever been debated. The high-decibel rhetoric has created an anti-AFSPA perception among the people and further widened the gap between the Kashmiris and New Delhi. Various tragic incidents owing to unethical behaviour by armed forces personnel have also added to the resentment. One example is the Machil staged encounter of April 2010, perhaps the biggest sore point for Kashmiris. The tragic episode was not because of excesses committed under the AFSPA, but a criminal act by an officer for his own vested interests that was twisted to portray the armed forces and its tool, the AFSPA, as draconian.

The infamous Machil “encounter”, in which three men were killed, became a tipping point for the Kashmir unrest in 2010; the ensuing violence left 120 people dead.[30] The army personnel who were involved in the incident claimed that the killings were a result of an armed encounter with terrorists in Machil, close to the LoC, in Kupwara district. A police enquiry, however, concluded that Machil was indeed a staged encounter and all three civilians who were killed were innocent labourers from Nadihal, in Rafiabad.[31] The army court, too, confirmed that the encounter had been simply orchestrated. Five personnel, including one with a rank of Colonel, were sentenced to life imprisonment. The memories of Machil resurfaced in July 2017 when the Armed Forces Tribunal in Chandigarh suspended the sentence on dubious grounds and the five convicts walked free. Though the Army laws are harsh and strictly implemented, arbitrary leniency shown toward delinquent officers, as in the case of the convicted personnel in the Machil fake encounter, has further amplified the demand for the revocation of the AFPSA.

III. The Implications of the PSA and AFPSA

The Shimla Accord of 1975 that came under the backdrop of Pakistan’s defeat and the creation of Bangladesh in 1971, was the “ultimate accession” of J&K with the Union of India. Sheikh Abdullah became the chief minister, but internal tussles between the Congress and National Conference (NC) hindered the smooth functioning of government. Mufti Mohammed Syed, the then J&K Congress chief, decided to topple Sheik’s government with the help of Jammat-i-Islami. Congress had 46 seats and the Jammat had five – a combination that left Sheikh without the required strength in the Legislative Assembly.[32] The Governor dissolved the assembly and fresh elections were conducted within three months.

The Congress – still grappling with the aftermath of the national emergency declared by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi – had just been defeated in the general elections, paving the way for the Janata Party to rule at the Centre. The Janata Party opened its own unit in J&K and received support of many prominent local political leaders.[33] In the first ever free and fair elections in the state in 1977, the Sheikh Abdullah-led NC won 47 out of 77 elective seats of the state. The Janata Party won 13, Congress was successful in 11, and Jammat-i-Islami bagged one.[34] Sheikh, who retained his position as chief minister, became an autocrat and muzzled the voices against him and his party on issues such as misgovernance, corruption, nepotism, and human rights violations. He abused his power for his ensconced and parochial ends.[35]

In November 1977, the Sheikh government passed the Jammu and Kashmir Safety Ordinance Act (SOA) to maintain public order and tackle Pakistan-sponsored adverse activities.[36] The Act put severe restrictions on newspapers and publications in the state. The Janata Party government at the Centre chided the state for stifling civil liberties. Sheikh was forced to dilute the Act, but he refused to abandon it. In fact, the SOA was morphed within a few months into the PSA. The PSA was given legal status in 1978 and made applicable across the state. Though the primary objective of the PSA was to curb timber smuggling, it soon became a weapon to supress political dissent.

Media and academic reports have revealed that Sheikh Abdullah’s real intention was to curb the rising peaceful political dissent against him, especially amongst the educated youth who had been exposed to the political views of their counterparts in mainland India. Thousands of those who voiced their opposition to Sheikh’s authoritative regime were detained under the PSA.[37] The first victim of the PSA was Ghulam Nabi Patel, President of Kashmir Motor Drivers Association (KMDA), who had lent support to the Janata Party in the state elections in 1977.[38]

Intolerance towards dissent, and the imprisonment of opposition leaders led to the erosion of faith in democratic institutions. The situation worsened with the corruption, nepotism and fraudulent recruitments that had become normalised alongside the rampant abuse of the PSA. For instance, recruitments to government posts were being done in the homes of ministers without the issuance of mandatory advertisements against bribes paid by the candidates. Most of the recruitments in the education department were dubious. Out of 400 teachers recruited, 60 were found to be lacking in the mandatory qualifications.[39] By 1985, admissions to premier institutions such as the Regional Engineering College in Srinagar and the Medical Colleges in Jammu and Srinagar were designed to serve political and bureaucratic patronage.[40] The lethal concoction of the PSA, misgovernance and corruption, caused severe social crises and unrest.

The disgruntled people of the Valley, especially the youth, adopted democratic means to challenge the system. In 1987, Islamic groups mobilised a broad coalition under the Muslim United Front (MUF) comprising Jammat-i-Islami, the Ummat-e-Islami and Anjunman-e-Ittehad-ul-Musalman. A large number of educated youth born in the 1960s in prosperous business families became MUF workers.[41] However, the blatant rigging at the hustings ensured that the popular will of the people was not to be realised. The outcome of the elections shocked the people of Kashmir, as the MUF, which was expected to sweep the polls, secured only four seats. The NC-Congress alliance got 66 seats, and NC, 40.

During the elections, the police and the administrative machinery resorted to strong-arm tactics to beat, maim and imprison the MUF candidates and their polling agents.[42] This trend continued long after the election. Members of the MUF were detained under the PSA for months without trial, and tortured.[43] Many of these MUF leaders and their cadres chose to embrace militancy rather than seek justice using democratic and constitutional means. Syed Salahuddin, for example, contested the elections in 1987 as an MUF candidate from the Amira Kadal constituency in Srinagar.[44] After being detained under the PSA for many months, he embraced militancy and eventually emerged as the supreme commander of Hizb-ul-Mujahideen. Like him, most of the first-generation militants were born in police stations, jails and police control rooms in the aftermath of the rigged 1987 election.[45]

As the situation worsened, civilian laws weakened in the face of increased violence and widespread deterioration of law and order. Governor’s Rule was imposed in January 1990. The Centre then invoked the Disturbed Areas Act, paving the way for the implementation of AFSPA. After the elections of 1996, the Disturbed Areas Act was formally enacted as a State Act by the legislature led by the NC government.[46] The AFSPA in J&K followed the tried and tested counterinsurgency methods used in the northeastern states and Punjab. In Punjab, and even in the northeast, the implementation of AFSPA had led to the signing of peace accords with some government concessions relating to grievances and new power-sharing mechanisms. However, the AFSPA has failed to achieve any such positive outcome in Kashmir. Instead of restoration of normalcy, the situation has worsened since 2014, and particularly following the killing in 2016 of Burhan Wani, the widely popular commander of the Kashmiri militant group, Hizbul Mujahideen.

Since the past decade, there has been a lot of debate about the continued enforcement of AFSPA in J&K. Regional parties such as the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and NC have fought elections promising its revocation. The calls for the law’s annulment have also come from several NGOs following allegations of massive human rights violations. This position has also been taken by Christof Heyns, the UN’s Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions. He said: “AFSPA allows the state to override rights. Such a law has no role in a democracy and should be scrapped.”[47]

At the same time, voices for the retention of AFSPA have been raised by the armed forces, officials of the Ministry of Defence, and some political parties across the country. They argue that AFSPA is needed as peace has not been restored. The armed forces argue that, to begin with, only some special categories of officers are allowed to exercise AFSPA and there are strong internal checks and balances to ensure that the law is not misused.[48] The government has also held many consultations since 2010; however, a final decision on discontinuance of the law has yet to be made.[49]



IV. Perception Survey: Methodology and Results

Between September to November 2017, one of the authors of this paper, Ajyaz Wani, conducted extensive field visits and surveys in the Kashmir Valley. The survey questionnaire was prepared based on deliberations between experts representing the political leadership of Kashmir, local business people and journalists, former diplomats and senior army personnel and academic experts at the ORF conference, ‘Kashmir – A dialogue for peace and integration’ held in Mumbai in July 2017 (see Annexure for the list of participants).

Field surveys were conducted using snowball sampling[50] in different colleges and universities of Kashmir (University of Kashmir, Islamic University of Science & Technology, Awantipora, and Central University, Nowgam) involving a cross-section[51] of students and faculty. Besides students and faculty, the survey included randomly chosen members of the business community, traders, women, local politicians, two senior members of the All-party Hurriyat Conference and members of the J&K People’s League. All 2,300 respondents were asked to answer brief objective-type questions (see Annexure for a sample questionnaire). The primary objective of the survey was to elicit free and frank responses from the youth who constitute an overwhelming majority of the Valley’s population and are stakeholders in the conflict.

4.1 Use of extrajudicial powers by the police

One set of survey questions referred to the roles of the military and the police apparatus in the state – particularly after the unrest of 2016. The question whether J&K police is using extrajudicial powers drew 66.1 percent answers in the affirmative, while 15.5 percent said ‘no’. ‘Cannot say’ was the answer given by 16.3 percent of respondents, while 2.1 percent did not answer the question (See Figure 1). It is not too difficult to ascertain that the ‘extrajudicial powers’ wielded by the police come from the blatant misuse of the PSA. According to respondent Tawseef, a PhD scholar of Political Science in Kashmir University, “people are detained everywhere in India, but Kashmiris are considered second class citizens by government in New Delhi. That is why the PSA was never sent for judicial review to the Supreme Court by the Centre. It is a tool in the hands of state officials and police to extort money.”

Despite Section 23 of the J&K PSA empowering the state government to make rules and standard operating procedures (SOPs) to implement the law, they have not been framed even after 40 years of the Act. This has been admitted by the state home department in response to an RTI.[52] District magistrates and divisional commissioners issue hundreds – sometimes thousands – of detention orders every year under the PSA, merely on the basis of reports and dossiers prepared by the state police, as there are no rules framed under the law for the courts to rely upon.[53]

What journalist Luv Puri wrote in 2010 while arguing for local self-governance in Kashmir as the key to conflict resolution, aptly surmises the “lawlessness” of this law:

“Democracy is not merely about electing the people who man the top echelons of power… J&K is a classic case of institutional failure as several institutions of democratic structure simply do not exist or have ceased to function in the way they are supposed to. In the state of J&K there is a yawning gap between the government and the governed.”[54]

4.2 Arrests for extortion

When ORF’s respondents were asked the question of whether the escalation in violence since 2016 was due to arrests of innocent people, often for extortion, more than 66 percent of the respondents agreed, while only 13.2 percent disagreed. ‘Can’t say’ came as a response from 13.6 percent respondents, while 6.7 percent did not answer the question (see Figure 2).

Extortion by the police through numerous detentions under the PSA has virtually become an industry in rural areas of South Kashmir.[55] Interacting with one of the authors of this paper, the residents of Pulwama and Shopian districts claimed that once the police arrest or detain any youth or minor, his father’s contact number is given to brokers who swarm around in the vicinity of police stations. The broker facilitates their access to their ward in the police station. He then demands ransom, which if not paid, would result in slapping of the PSA against the detainee. These young detainees, some in their teens, are then subjected to inhuman treatment and kept with hardline radicals in the police stations including agents of the separatists and even the arrested radicalised Pakistani terrorists, who indoctrinate them with fundamentalist ideology. They are beaten, humiliated and brutalised, until their parents pay the ransom money – typically about INR 20,000 – for their release.[56] Often, the poor parents are left with no resort but to approach the separatists’ camps to seek loans. They do get the money, but on the condition that the youth, once released, will participate in committing violence against the state. Such situations create a soft corner for the separatists among the restive youth, which in turn engenders new problems for New Delhi. The most recent case of extortion was reported from Qazigund. The locals complained that Muhammad Sadiq, a head constable, demanded a ransom of INR 50,000 from the parents of a boy detained for alleged stone-pelting in exchange for his release.[57]

Excesses by security forces, especially by the J&K police abusing their powers under the PSA, have driven many local boys to despair. Physically abused and mentally scarred, some of them have emerged as Kashmir’s second-generation militants, seeking recourse in violent revolt and uprising by joining Pakistan-backed terror groups.

Most of the respondents in ORF’s survey highlighted the examples of Zubair Turray, Sameer Ahmad and Reyaz Naikoo, who joined militancy after 2012. They alleged that Zubair Turray was continuously harassed and a number of false PSA charges were registered against him since 2008.[58] In 2016, he was “charged with instigating people to protest even when he was in custody”.[59] Zubair became a classic example of the ‘revolving door’ method of detention under the PSA and was kept “out of circulation” continuously for four years after his arrest in 2013. He escaped from the Keegam police station on 1 May 2017 and joined militant ranks. While the reason for Syed Salahuddin to embrace violence may have been different,[60] for many other boys like Zubair, the trigger was their arbitrary detention under the PSA and the ensuing torture in lockups. In a video available on the internet, Zubair has clearly said he joined militancy because of “tyranny” and “illegal detention” under the PSA.[61] According to Yasin Malik, Chief of Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), “the state is responsible for Zubair Turray. He was kept under illegal detention for four years and his family was abused in police stations… the police and the PSA are responsible for pushing Kashmiri youth to wall.”[62]

Zubair was killed along with 13 other militants in a joint operation at Dragad and Kachidoor villages of Shopian and Dialgam of Anantnag on 1 April 2018. [63] This operation was hailed by India as one of its most successful anti-insurgency operations in the past decade. Meanwhile, thousands joined in Zubair’s funeral procession, a trend that has become an everyday phenomenon following the 2016 killing of Burhan Wani. Indeed it might be said that funeral processions have become the new recruitment grounds for the Valley’s militants.[64]

Reyaz Naikoo, a close associate to Burhan Wani, was also detained under PSA and joined militancy after his release in 2012.[65] He was named the head of Hizbul Mujadeen after the killing of Burhan’s successor, Sabzar Bhat. He is wanted in several killings including of high-ranking police officers. He carries a bounty of INR 12 lakh on his head.

The other example of radicalisation through detention was Sameer Ahmad Bhat alias Sameer Tiger, who was eliminated by security forces in his hometown Drabgam in Pulwama district on 30 April 2018. He joined militancy in July 2016, a day after his release. He became the main recruiter of militants in Kashmir. According to reports, Sameer Tiger inspired more than 80 local boys to join the ranks.[66] According to his friends, Tiger was frequently asked to report to the police station even when there was not a single criminal charge against him except some cases of stone pelting. One of his friends, a law student at Kashmir University, said it was the police who were responsible for Sameer becoming a militant and not any other security agency. His only fault was that he pelted stones, but he was subjected to inhuman treatment in the police station. Even his father was beaten up by the police on many occasions, his friend said.

Such an “eye for an eye” approach under ‘Operation All-out,’ seeking to weaken the basis of militancy by eliminating the leadership, seems to have been a miscalculated strategy by the Centre. From January to mid-April 2018, 55 militants were killed, of which 27 were local boys.[67] During the same period, more than 45 local youth joined the militant ranks. The new recruits include Junaid Ashraf Sehrai, 26, an MBA degree holder from Kashmir University, and son of Mohammed Ashraf Sehrai, chairman of Tehrek-e-Hurriyat, and Manan Wani, a PhD scholar from Aligarh Muslim University. Most of them are believed to hail from South Kashmir. However, a steep rise in insurgency has also been witnessed in North Kashmir during this period.[68]

The number of militants joining the rebel ranks has increased enormously in the post-Burhan era. In 2010, 54 youths joined militancy, while the number dipped to 23 in 2011, 21 in 2012 and 16 in 2013. After 2014, the number of local youth joining militancy increased to 53, went up to 66 in 2015 and reached 88 in 2016.[69]

In the past four years, more than 680 militants were killed by armed forces in counterinsurgency operations including 72 in the first four months of 2018. During the same period, 291 security personnel have died in militancy-related incidents.[70] The reasons have been captured by the following media report in 2010:

“Kashmiris have lost the protection of their rights to speech, assembly and travel; they have lost all guarantees of their freedom from violence, harassment and unlawful detention. They have seen every single substantive attribute of democracy give way under the pressure of militarisation and the attitudes of those who administer Kashmir. The rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, and the civic responsibilities of elected politicians: as each of these protective pillars has been hollowed out, all that remains of democracy is the thin patina of elections”.[71]

4.3 What motivates local boys to become militants?

During the ORF survey, respondents were asked to rank prevailing factors that they thought were most instrumental in motivating local boys to join militancy (see Figure 3). The responses were multiple, and included factors such as corruption at local level, Islamic State’s ideology, and Pakistan-based jihadi groups. Two factors are most crucial. One is the influence of Islamic State’s ideology that has spread at an alarming rate because of the provocations of different religious groups omnipresent in the Valley. Indeed, data from Victor Force, Awantipora, in February 2018, shows that of the 117 youth who embraced militancy in South Kashmir in 2017, 18 were radicalised by Islamic State’s ideology in Madrassas, while 47 came under the influence of Islamic State’s ideology during the funeral processions through Pakistan-based jihadi groups. The data did not document the issues of highhandedness by the police under the PSA. However, a vast majority of the respondents in ORF’s survey clearly blamed “excesses by security forces” as the top motivational factor. The other drivers are the Islamic State ideology, and unrestrained behaviour by security forces. It is pertinent to mention that in the same ORF survey, respondents were asked another question: “Who is most ruthless among all security agencies?” Evaluation of the responses reveals an overall “positive” feeling about the role of the Army than the other security agencies, including the J&K police. More than 90 percent of the respondents are of the view that the Army follows SOPs more diligently than any other security agencies.[72]

According to noted criminal lawyer, Mir Shafqat Hussian who has handled hundreds of PSA cases, the divisional commissioners and district magistrates who have to pass the PSA order act largely as rubber stamps. He said that in his entire career, he has come across only two officials who scrutinised the documents carefully before accepting the PSA charges.[73]

Notably, since 2002, all the government interlocutors have recommended the immediate release of all political detainees in the state, as well as comprehensive amendments to the PSA or its abolition.

In September 2010, the Indian government announced the appointment of a group of interlocutors to “begin the process of a sustained dialogue with all sections of the people of Jammu & Kashmir”. The interlocutors advised to the state government that the arrested or detained youth should be freed and all charges should be withdrawn. According to their report, “attention was also drawn to the continuing arrest of youth and the indiscriminate use of PSA against them”. They remarked that “the wide use of the PSA by the state government was criticised by most of the delegations that we met”.[74] However, neither New Delhi was able to do away with draconian law nor the state government did anything to stop the alienation of youth. It remains unclear how many detainees were released on the recommendation of the group of interlocutors.[75]

Former Union Law Minister Ram Jethmalani, a member of the “Kashmir Committee” started by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee in 2002, said while addressing a press conference in Kashmir on 6 June 2011 that the random arrests, without any charge or trial was not only disgraceful, it was something akin to Nazi Germany. Advocating for the abolition of the PSA, he remarked:

“the need of the hour is to restore democracy, which is nowhere prevailing in Kashmir … maladministration and mis-governance are making people angry and if this is not stopped, Kashmir will boil again.”[76],

His predictions came true in 2016 as rural areas, especially in South Kashmir, which were earlier unaffected by violence, also became the hotbed of uprising. A report published in December 2016 by the Concerned Citizens’ Group led by former External Affairs Minister Yashwant Sinha, after its second visit to the Kashmir Valley, said:

“… There is a deep sense of anger and betrayal against India among the youngsters. Most do not see much of a future for themselves if the Kashmir situation does not settle down. Those arrested for stone-pelting and jailed with adult criminals for lack of juvenile homes are likely to come out as hardened radicals once they are released.”[77]

Dineshwar Sharma, the Centre’s special representative to Kashmir in November 2017, has also urged the quashing of cases against all detainees who have been wrongly apprehended.[78]

4.4 Centre’s soft approach

The people of Kashmir largely blame New Delhi for not influencing its power on the state government to make it accountable for its serious omissions. Nearly half of ORF’s respondents (49.5 percent) agree with this view. Only 19.7 percent disagree, 25.9 percent have no opinion to offer, and 4.9 percent did not answer the question (see Figure 4).

V. Conclusion

The faith of the Kashmiris, especially those born in the midst of conflict since the early 1990s, in democratic institutions and, indeed, in democracy itself, has eroded. The negligible voter turnout in several key constituencies in a series of elections in recent years bears testimony to this fact. The volatile situation has also led to the indefinite postponement of the process of elections, the fundamental prerequisite of any democracy. The by-elections for the Srinagar constituency held in April 2017 were marred by widespread violence and the constituency recorded the lowest-ever voter turnout of 7.13 percent. Not even a single voter turned up in 18 polling stations.[79] Eight persons died and scores were injured, including security forces, on the day of the election. The elections to Anantnag Lok Sabha constituency, scheduled in April 2017, have been postponed indefinitely by the election commission as “the situation is not conducive for conducting polls in the valley as the region is witnessing a spike in violence and protests”.[80] The Panchayat elections, scheduled to be held from 15 February 2018, have also been put on hold.

Things had been different in the past. Notwithstanding the calls for boycott by the separatists, J&K witnessed impressive voter turnouts in all elections held in the past four decades. Even in the contentious elections of 1987 that tarnished the democratic landscape and pushed the Valley into the grip of militancy, voter turnout was between 74.9 percent and 78.6 percent for men, and around 70 percent for women.[81]

It is becoming increasingly clear that the fabric of democracy in Jammu and Kashmir is in tatters. Today the situation is much graver than in the 1990s, as resistance has become totally indigenous. Most of the boys who continue to join militant ranks do not come from across the border. One of the big factors for such widespread alienation is “democracy without rights”, as written by Prem Nath Bazaz in 1978, after the enactment of the PSA. This statement holds true even today and to an even greater degree. Today, if the AFSPA is a necessity of time to control the situation, its rampant abuse has been fundamentally responsible for creating precisely the situation that it wants to control. Most scholars, jurists, government interlocutors, and the youth of Kashmir consider PSA as ultra vires or beyond legal authority. The PSA, as much as the AFSPA, is a strong reason for the negative perception generated among common Kashmiris toward India, the largest democracy in the world; this was not the case till 1980. It is worth noting that it was the common Kashmiris who helped Indian forces defeat the Pakistani raiders and its army in 1947 as well as in the 1965 and 1971 wars.

Digging deep into the recent causes of an unprecedented escalation of the “conflict in Kashmir” through surveys that covered the common Kashmiri people, the authors of this paper have found that the primary reason for a rise in homegrown insurgency is the rampant abuse and misuse of the draconian PSA by the J&K police. It is the PSA and not AFSPA – especially in the past couple of decades – that has driven the youth of the Valley towards radicalisation and alienated them from India and its mainstream sociopolitical framework. With the increasing number of local boys joining militancy because of the misuse of the PSA – and thereby changing the nature of violence in the state with such rise in homegrown insurgency – the state has inadvertently, but certainly, also played into the hands of Pakistan.

The manner in which the PSA has been enforced has served only the vested interests of both the separatists and mainstream politicians of Kashmir. It has thrown the youth against New Delhi. The people of Kashmir consider the law – a brainchild of the Centre, to begin with – as their biggest oppressor; this is evident in the repeated calls for the scrapping of the law. However, after the AFPSA’s review by the Supreme Court, the number of cases of human rights violations by the Army under the Act has declined considerably. On the contrary, despite the amendments, the blatant and arbitrary application of the PSA has witnessed a phenomenal increase and so have the complaints of human rights abuse of the PSA detainees.

There is an imperative to revive the so-called “Vajpayee magic” in the troubled state. Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, in power from 1998 to 2004, not only discussed with Pakistan the “conflict over Kashmir”, but also took important steps to de-escalate the “conflict in Kashmir”. That strategy worked as a crucial confidence building measure between the two countries. He forced the then Chief Minister Mufti Syed to disband the Special Operations’ Groups (SOGs).[82] Vajpayee’s approach was called “humanistic”, and because of this he is still revered in Kashmir, even in the separatist camps. Over a decade since Vajpayee’s prime ministership, the current situation has become even more volatile as India continues to rise as a global power, and politics in New Delhi has gone through a transformation in the last four years in an environment of increased polarisation and jingoism. Adding to the creation of such an environment is the Centre’s hardline approach on Kashmir, as well as its perceived silence on incidents of majoritarian violence.

It is time that the Centre make the state of J&K accountable once again. New Delhi must urgently refer the PSA to the Supreme Court for a judicial review. Unless the Act is amended, or better still, revoked, it is nearly impossible for either New Delhi or Kashmir to establish any sustainable CBMs and work towards the resolution of the “conflict in Kashmir”. The abolition of the PSA is an inevitable step to create an atmosphere for New Delhi to engage meaningfully with different stakeholders in the state. The interlocutors appointed by government after the uprising in 2010 have suggested that, “In cases of serious charges, the period under which people can be held under the PSA should be limited to one week and after this, due process of law should prevail.”[83] Such major dilution of the PSA, or its total abolition, will give a taste of democracy, and indeed a taste of “freedom” as citizens of India, to those who were born under the dark shadow of conflict, lived through conflict, and have now became victims of both – the “conflict over Kashmir” and the “conflict in Kashmir”.

The revocation of the PSA will help New Delhi prepare a firm timeline for the eventual annulment of the AFSPA. Reassessing the efficacy of both the laws and their eventual revocation must be regarded as inevitable to establish lasting peace and normalcy in the Kashmir Valley and for the real integration of Kashmiris with the rest of India.

Even as the AFPSA is being subjected to review, there is a need to make it more humane in present conditions prevailing in the Valley. For one, the Ministry of Defence should establish armed forces tribunals at the level of the General Officer Commanding (GOC) in South, North and Central Kashmir. A hotline should be set up at each of these GOC headquarters for the people to highlight the grievances against the armed forces in their respective areas. This will help in reducing the trust deficit between the people and work as a new CBM. The establishment of armed forces tribunals at the local level will lend greater transparency in dealing with the complaints of human rights violations. The Army’s proactive feedback to society and petitioners will improve the relations between society and armed forces in general. Furthermore, this law should be made compliant with international and national norms of human rights and humanitarian laws.

Furthermore, as ORF analyst Manoj Joshi has written, “the Army’s law can be harsh but going soft can make things worse.”[84] The Army law should not be softened when it comes to dealing with errant armed forces personnel. There are many examples in Kashmir where Army law was softened to save the armed forces officials – this has provoked resentment among the Kashmiris. Such a softened attitude can be misused by some military personnel to commit gross excesses without any fear of being punished, as happened in the Machil encounter.

All the “Dos and Don’ts” formalised by the Supreme Court should be incorporated in the AFSPA while taking into account the changing nature of counterinsurgency operations. Although the AFSPA has already been suitably amended to conform to the Supreme Court’s guidelines, the amendments should be strictly and honestly put into practice.

[50] In conflict environments, the population is marginalised to some degree, making it ‘hidden’ from and ‘hard to reach’ for the researcher. The marginalisation explains why it is difficult to locate, access and enlist the cooperation of the research populations, which, in a non-conflict context, would not have been difficult to do. The Snowball Sampling Method (SSM) is used to address the fears and mistrust common to the conflict environment and increases the facilitates an atmosphere of trust as the researcher is introduced through a reliable social network. For this study, the social network was provided by teachers of different colleges, Universities and academic institutions that helped the researcher generate a friendly and trustworthy environment. In some cases, SSM marks the difference between research conducted under constrained conditions and research not conducted at all.

By Manyang Mador Koch, Melbourne, Australia

Monday, August 20, 2018 (PW) — Discussing apology and forgiveness in a post violent conflict can be difficult if not impossible in most cases, it doesn’t work at all. However, there are needs for apology and forgiveness, which will advance reconciliation in any given society.

This essay will explore the implications surrounding apology and forgiveness and how difficult they are to achieve after violent conflicts on a societal scale. This means it will examine the role of ethnicity in political system by choosing Rwanda as case study. The paper will also consider the political establishment and the implications surrounding the Rwandan genocide in 1994.

Therefore, the definition of ethnicity which can be refers to an outdate terminologies such as the tribalism; cleansing conflict and even sub-clan were commonly used in the 1950-1960s during the Cold War (CW) period.[1] It is also significant to paraphrase colonial history and its connection to the Rwandan genocide of the 1994. The historical connection between Hutu and Tutsi, that this paper will technically consider the role of ethnicity in political context in Rwanda.

In most cases apologies are difficult after post violence conflicts simply because they are formal admission of crimes that one have committed throughout the time of violent. The healing process which can lead society to national reconciliation usually would start with open apology/apologies. But in different circumstances, apology and forgiveness can be difficult to some victims who see an apology as unhealable intention that the wrongdoers shall deliver after violent conflicts in spite atrocities they have committed.

The conflicts analysis indicates that there are many challenges which can delay apology in the post conflicts societies. For example, how to create a social dialogue among the former warring parties in order to close the widening gap and fear from one another is a problematic after violent conflicts communities. Zorbas has argued that “in the wake of violence on a societal scale, finding and forgiveness, tribunals and truth commissions, remember and ‘moving on’ is a messy if not impossible goal”.[2]

It is absolutely clear that in the “wake of violence on a societal scale” usually the level of misunderstanding present major threat on the society simply because of the post violence hangovers directly towards other group. The writing that touched Rwanda may not be easy because of its complexity since the Country became Independent in 1962. For many decades before and after the independence of Rwanda in the 1962, Rwanda was already divided along ethnic lines. The political system of Rwanda was a continuation of European model who had ruled Rwanda for decades before the Country officially gained its political Sovereignty.

Suzanne argues “Although forgiving does reduce negative emotions, Richards (1988) pointed out that the motivation behind forgiving another is not solely to feel better and rid oneself of strong negative emotions. That may be the primary motive, but during the process the injured person begins to take the well-being of the offender and the potential restoration of an important relationship more into consideration”.[3] However, Weyeneth as argues that “in recentyears, we have seen apologies for religious prejudice and persecution, racistpolicies and behaviour, colonialism, the dispossession and deaths of nativepeoples, slavery, political executions, complicity in the Holocaust, war crimes, medical experiments, the Red Scare, police violence, environmental contamination, and other historical events and government policies now out of favour”.[4]

The Rwandan genocide of 1994 was purely a cleansing ethnic conflict that came after long tension between Tutsi and the Hutu ethnic groups. Tutsis were favoured in terms of education and employment over the Hutus who were neglected. The Belgium authority introduced identity cards to distinguish one’s ethnic origin. These acts unsurprisingly led to tensions between the two groups Hutu and Tutsi ethnics.[5] In 1959, civil war led to the overthrow of the then ruling Tutsi King, and the granting of independence three years later opened way for a Hutu-led government in Rwanda in the 1962.[6]The independence of Rwanda became a cast as tension arise between Hutu and Tutsi and over the next several years, thousands of Tutsis were killed, and an estimated 150,000 were driven into exile in neighbouring countries like Uganda, Burundi and Zaire currently known as the Democratic Republic of Congo.[7]

The Rwandan diaspora Tutsi community became politically aware of their suffering in exiled and atrocities that are being committed against Tutsi population back in Rwanda. This sense of ethnicity belonging has led to the formation of the rebel group known as the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) which was predominantly Tutsi. The leader of the RPF Major General Paul Kagame who led the rebel forces to Kigali the national Capital of Rwanda automatically become President of Rwanda after genocide.[8] The Rwandan Patriotic Front was fighting to sustain democracy, good governance and the right of Tutsi refugees to return to Rwanda. In 1990, General Fred Rwigema led the RPF as a commander in Chief was killed in the first ever rebel attacked on October 1990.[9] More importantly however, the rebel’s aims and objectives were to overthrown Hutu led government of the ideological ruler of Rwanda president Habyarimana.

The Rwandan ethnic conflict immediately escalated as news reached the Hutu community after a plane carrying President Habyarimana of Rwanda and his counterpart of a neighbouring country President Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi were killed in a well design assassination plan. The prime suspects behind the assassinations of the two presidents were now the Hutu’s common enemies; the Rwandan Patriotic front (RPF) predominantly led by the Tutsi rebel and the Ugandan government whose President Museveni work in collaboration with the American CIA. The Republic of Rwanda (RR) has a long history of ethnic tension which has created a permanent political ethnicity where things are planned, using ethnical approach as the best way to deal with national issues in term of political stability in Rwanda.

The power of ethnicity involves in political structure has shocked the World as in the case of Rwandan discriminative genocide of the 1994. The political structure and social economic hierarchy brought in by German and Belgium colonies had established unfair political system which created inequality opportunities to all ethnic groups that are living in Rwanda. For instance, both colonies (German & Belgium) instead of establishing a fair political system which can accommodate all ethnic groups, than now colonial administration had deeply divided Rwanda into ethnic political unit community by relinquishing powers to Tutsi’ the minority group who form 14% of the Rwandan’s population. [10]

The Belgium power handing over to the minority Tutsi group created permanent tension and the Rwandan political system has been established along ethnic line. Some analyse believes that, Belgium thought that Tutsi were superior in Rwanda which allowed them freely to placed them in power.[11] The Tutsi ethnic group became dominant and superior in Rwanda. This means their dominant force had led them to establish some sort of ethnic authoritarianism against other ethnic groups such as Hutu and Twa. Therefore, Tutsi were successful by dominating all institutions in the Country which gives the Tutsi a great advantage over other ethnic groups to achieved high level of education as well as gaining the financial capability.

The cultural supremacy in Rwanda has increasingly become the dominant theory soon after the end of the Cold War era in 1990s.The failed of ethnic association in Rwanda was brought through colonisation. This sort of political structure established by both colonies German and Belgium has evidently created ‘instrumentalist’ contention that ethnicity was invented for political purposes.[12]

For instance, the classification of people into groups by Belgium authority who oppressed Hutu majority with promotion of minority ethnic group such as Tutsi was given especially treatment by the colonial governments. This means, Tutsi opportunities given by the colonial governments as first class citizens created a very big gap between the two ethnic groups. Politically, socially and economically Hutu and Tutsi were totally different. For example, Hutu had intensely less excess to school and achieve post primary education level than the Tutsi.[13]

The Rwandan history is always referring to colonisation and it deep ethnic political division brought in by its two colonies German and Belgium. In 1895, German officially became a colonial authority of Rwanda as European powers divided the African continent amongst themselves. After the defeat of German in 1918, the League of Nation had authorised Belgium to take over as a new colonial authority in Rwanda and with new colonial government in Rwanda, the Country’ main ethnic groups were subjected to social classes which was then created by both European colonies.[14] As Nancy Gibbs, argued that colonialism has destroyed the social and political structures in Rwanda.[15] This is because colonial authority has created a system which favours one ethnic group over the other simply because of their non-resistance policy against European colonies. The question of forgiveness in the absent of apology from the European empires that ruled Rwanda left deep scars in minds and the hearts of Rwandan community. Fundamentally, apology and forgiveness becomes difficult if justice is not fairly served by the authorities in power.

According toTaft, he argues that“healing must be understood in a nuanced way whenconsidered in a legal context. That is, while a legal client may be physicallyinjured, he/she may also be spiritually and psychologically broken”.[16] Morris has also argues “the slow of justice progress in Rwanda points need for protocols for prompts international assistance to national justice system; for permanent bodies, such as an International Criminal Court (ICC) that can be put readily into service when warranted and for clear articulation of the purposes of each international tribunal in order that both national and international jurisdictions may be as effective as possible in responding to crimes of mass violence”.[17] In contrast, the Southern Sudanese community became a divided society in thesplit of its Southern rebel leadership in August 1991. As Hutchinso argues “Ever since leadership struggles within the Sudan People’sLiberation Army (SPLA) split the movement into twowarring factions in 1991, rural Nuer (Neitinaath) and Dinka (Jieng) communities in the South have been grapplingwith an expanding regional subculture of ethicisedviolence”. [18]These two groups have supplied the bulk of the guerrilla forces that have been fighting since 1983 to over-throw a northern-dominated, national state government in Khartoum increasingly guided by Islamist political agendas and ideals. Furthermore, “the central government in Khartoum, of course, rejoiced over the collapse of SPLA unity and proceeded to fan the flames of conflict between rival southern military leaders”.[19]

However, the invasion of Bor and Kongor areas caused huge destruction and a humanitarian crisis that affected mainly the civilian population. Elhag argues that “apart from the Nuer, many civilians from other tribes also joined the Nasir faction, because they simply did not want SPLM and its leaders anymore, viewing it as a Dinka dominated movement”.[20]

On August 11th 2011 Vice President Dr Riek Machar, issued his apology to Dinka Bor Community by acknowledging his responsibility for incident in 1991 which resulted to the loss of hundreds of thousand lives in the community. The apology cause dramatic reactions from his Nuer community believing that their son had produced materials which will prepare him for a possible prosecution in the International Criminal Court (ICC). Up to date being remembered by many politicians, intellectuals and scholars as “Bor Massacre” of 1991 whichwas ethnically engineer by Dr Riek Machar who is currentlyserving as Vice President of the Republic of South Sudan. The Dinka Bor community have not accepted the apology as results of massacre wounded that are left after violent conflict.

In conclusion, apology and forgiveness are difficult if justice is not served fairly in the community. Ethnicity in form of political force in developing countries is a political uniformity of thought in term of mobilisation especially on ethnic base political society. For example, the Rwandan and South Sudanese political structures are pure ethnically base regimes since the foundation of their political systems. However, an apology can be difficult simply because of the fear justice. Again, the leftovers after the violent conflicts can make it even more difficult for the wrongdoers to apology. It is also important to establish an impartial truth reconciliation commission that will prepares the two warring communities in furthering reconciliation. Creating a social forum can prepare former warring parties to fully reconcile. Once the apology is accepted then forgiveness will furthering reconciliation after violent conflicts.

UN Member States adopted a political declaration that recognizes the period 2019 to 2028 as the Nelson Mandela Decade of Peace, and calls for redoubling efforts to pursue international peace and security, development and human rights.



The ‘Nelson Mandela Peace Summit’ was mandated by UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution 72/243 of December 2017, in which UN Member States decided to hold a high-level plenary meeting on global peace in honor of the centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela. The Summit took place in New York, US, on 24 September 2018, the day before the start of the UNGA 73 general debate. The Summit was preceded by the unveiling of a statue of Nelson Mandela, offered to the UN by the government of South Africa in recognition of Mandela’s lifelong efforts to promote peace and security and protect human rights.

Governments and other stakeholders praised Mandela for living by the principles that underpin the UN, and for representing the values of peace, solidarity, cooperation, equality and respect for all human beings. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, president of UNGA 73, remarked that the principle of multilateralism is currently being challenged, but moving away from multilateralism is to endanger our species and our planet. She called for a social contract based on shared responsibility, and said the only existing space to achieve this contract is the UN. She described the UNGA as the most representative and legitimate space for dialogue and reconciliation.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Mandela, also known as Madiba, was one of humanity’s great leaders and had devoted his life to serving his community as a lawyer, a prisoner of conscience, a peacemaker, a president and a respected elder. He remarked that as president of South Africa, Mandela expanded access to health care, education, housing, water, sanitation and electricity, and championed women’s rights and South Africa’s landmark 1996 Constitution, “which remains a beacon for human rights and equal opportunity.” Guterres noted that 2018 marks the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but that human rights are currently under growing pressure around the world.

Speakers from Africa shared stories about Mandela’s role in strengthening democratic institutions, and said he inspired generations to struggle against oppression.

Representatives of several African countries shared stories about Mandela’s role in helping strengthening the region’s democratic institutions, noting that he inspired generations in its struggle against oppression. Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the African Union (AU), noted that the AU declared 2014-2024 as the ‘Nelson Mandela Decade for Reconciliation in Africa,’ and said this celebration of the centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela is a marker of freedom, solidarity and peace. Cyril Ramphosa, President of South Africa, said since the formation of the UN, several crises that have tested the limits of diplomacy and the multilateral system, and the UN has endured as a force for stability, cooperation and the peaceful resolution of conflict. Nowadays, he said, the UN faces more intricate and complex challenges, such as terrorism, transnational organized crime, illicit flows of finance and the growing number of refugees. He called for a UN that is responsive, adaptable and able to deal with challenges its founders could not have imagined. He also called on the UN to not rely on the “political interests of a few,” saying an impasse between major powers often impedes the entire organization’s ability to act.

Leo Varadkar, Prime Minister of Ireland (Taoiseach), remarked that peace is made “not with your friends, but with your enemies,” and reconciliation is achieved by “moving beyond the hurt and pain of the past towards truth and forgiveness.” He called for renewing efforts to advance gender equality around the world, and to give young people a greater say in the decisions that will affect them and the future of our planet.

Graça Machel, founding member of The Elders, noted that global security has deteriorated “remarkably” in the past decade, and the number of armed conflicts has increased. She said there is no justification for the loss of life and suffering in places like Syria, Yemen, Palestine, South Sudan, Central African Republic and Myanmar, and cautioned against the Summit being “another talk shop.” She said that she and the president of South Africa launched the Global Peace initiative, an initiative of the African Centre for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes (ACCORD) to bridge the gap between peace and development. She referred to the publication ‘Sparks of Hope,’ a compendium highlighting the courage and leadership of “change agents across the world,” and asked participants to the event to take inspiration from this work.

Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General of Amnesty International, said Nelson Mandela spent the vast majority of his life as a civil society activist, but today, as people gather to honor him, thousands of activists and human rights defenders around the world are imprisoned or have been tortured and killed. Naidoo asked to not adjust to the deadlocks that “continue to haunt the UN Security Council,” as the five permanent members use their power “not to prevent and stop suffering but shield themselves and others committing the worst crimes.” He also called for averting catastrophic climate change, noting that thousands are regularly devastated by extreme weather events. He called on “the one leader who still denies climate change” to put himself “on the right side of history.”

At the end of the opening segment, governments adopted the ‘Political Declaration Adopted at the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit.’ The declaration is the result of intergovernmental consultations that took place from May to September 2018 under the facilitation of Jerry Matthews Matjila, Permanent Representative of South Africa, and Geraldine Byrne Nason, Permanent Representative of Ireland. Per the declaration, Heads of State and government and other representatives of UN Member States recommend that the UN explore means to systematically consider the needs of present and future generations, including through inter-generational dialogue, within its decision-making processes. They also welcome the establishment of the UN High-Level Advisory Board on Mediation, encouraging its further efforts and contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security and prevention of armed conflicts.

In the declaration, countries: note that sustainable development cannot be realized without peace and security, and peace and security will be at risk without sustainable development; commit to redouble efforts to build a just, peaceful, prosperous, inclusive and fair world; emphasize the importance of a comprehensive approach to sustaining peace; recognize the need to address threats to global peace and security, including challenges to the primacy of multilateralism; and reaffirm commitment to uphold the sovereign equality of all States, respect for their territorial integrity and political independence. They also: encourage parties to armed conflict to take immediate, concrete measures to end cycles of conflict and prevent relapse; recognize that there is no single template for peace, and commit to availing their best practices to those who seek different models for peace; stress the importance of the equal participation and full involvement of women and the meaningful participation of youth in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security; and resolve to ensure the protection, rights and well-being of children, especially in armed conflict.

Countries and groups of countries addressed the Summit during a plenary session throughout the day. Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, said there is no unilateralism or “happy protectionism” since the world needs openness, cooperation, rules and principles to resolve conflicts, eradicate poverty, reduce inequalities, and develop free and fair trade that creates jobs and new opportunities for all. He called for mobilizing energy to reform, modernize and revitalize multilateral institutions, rather than disengaging from them.

Singapore for the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), noted that since its inception in 1967, ASEAN has worked to create a culture of dialogue, cooperation and consensus, and to support a common effort to achieve sustainable development. Saudi Arabia for the Arab Group said Nelson Mandela made clear that the South African revolution will never achieve all its aims until all people, including the Palestinians, also gain their freedom.

As noted by Secretary-General Guterres, in 2015, the UN decided to award the Nelson Mandela Prize every five years to two individuals who have made significant contributions to the service of humanity. In addition, Nelson Mandela International Day is observed each July, and is an occasion for all to take action and to promote and engage in community service.

The Summit followed the International Day of Peace on 21 September 2018, on the theme ‘The Right to Peace – The Universal Declaration of Human Rights at 70.’ The UNGA is expected to resume its tribute to Nelson Mandela on 2 October.

To celebrate Peace Day here are 6 areas where ICC has been making a difference and contributing to United Nations Global Goal number 16, Peace and Justice.

1) Working as merchants of peace

ICC was founded in 1919 in the aftermath of the First World War when no world system of rules governed trade, investment, finance or commercial relations. Without waiting for governments to fill this vacuum, ICC’s founders acted on their conviction that the private sector is best qualified to set global standards for business. They called themselves “The merchants of peace.”

2) Promoting Global Goals for peace

ICC works to ensure that businesses actions and investments drive the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including Global Goal #16 for ‘Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions’. It is estimated that achieving the SDGs opens up US$12 trillion of market opportunities which is why we believe they should also be known as the Business Development Goals!

3) Taking a stand against protectionism

The multilateral trading system has helped improve the standard of living of billions of people worldwide. But trade tensions today are contributing to increasing pressures on the global economy. In the belief that reform not retaliation, is needed to avoid damaging trade wars, ICC is working to promote the benefits of trade and help governments chart a new course for trade policymaking.

4) Recognising businessworthy leaders

Each year ICC joins forces with the Oslo Business for Peace Foundation and partners to nominate candidates for the Oslo Business for Peace Award. The prestigious award recognises exemplary leaders who promote socially responsible and ethical business practices, benefitting both business and society. Previous winners include Paul Polman, CEO of Unilever and ICC Chair; Sarah Beydoun, Founder and Creative Director of Sarah’s Bag; Marilyn Carlson Nelson, Co-CEO of Carlson Companies Elon Musk, Founder and CEO of Tesla and SolarCity; Martin Naughton, Founder of Glen Dimplex Group; and Durreen Shahnaz, Founder and CEO of Impact Investment Exchange. The search is now on for 2019 Business for Peace nominees

5) Resolving commercial disputes

The ability to resolve commercial disputes peacefully has been a core activity of ICC since it created the International Court of Arbitration over 95 years ago. To date, the truly neutral and independent ICC Court has helped to resolve over 23,000 commercial disputes in over 140 countries and. In 1950, ICC submitted a first draft of the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. Described as the most successful treaty in private international law, the New York Convention is adhered to today by more than 140 nations.

6) Employing a global workforce

ICC employees hail from over 30 countries, and work in tandem to create solutions that promote international security and prosperity. Our tolerant and inclusive work environment attracts and develops talent from all over the globe and encourages all voices and perspectives to be heard.

Working in this diverse environment means that even the most skeptical among us can have hope that a day will come when conflict between countries is a thing of the past, as we enter a peaceful and more prosperous new world.","The International Chamber of Commerce has been championing to nurture peace, prosperity and inclusive growth for close to 100 years.

""The world must be ed­u­cat­ed to love peace, to build it up and de­fend it.—Blessed Paul VI

On Sep­tem­ber 21, the world will ob­serve the In­ter­na­tion­al Day of Peace. The theme this year is: “The Right to Peace—The Uni­ver­sal De­c­la­ra­tion of Hu­man Rights at 70.”

The UN Gen­er­al As­sem­bly has de­clared this as “a day de­vot­ed to strength­en­ing the ideals of peace, both with­in and among all na­tions and peo­ples”. UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­er­al, An­tónio Guter­res says “It is time all na­tions and all peo­ple live up to the words of the Uni­ver­sal De­c­la­ra­tion of Hu­man Rights, which rec­og­nizes the in­her­ent dig­ni­ty and equal and in­alien­able rights of all mem­bers of the hu­man race. This year marks the 70th an­niver­sary of that land­mark doc­u­ment.”

Since the Uni­ver­sal De­c­la­ra­tion does not in­clude a sep­a­rate ar­ti­cle on “The Right to Peace”. We are asked to re­flect on what “The Right to Peace” means to each of us. Coun­tries are a long way from im­ple­ment­ing the 17 Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals (SDGs) which UN Mem­ber States signed in 2015. To achieve mean­ing­ful peace, we must ad­dress the crit­i­cal is­sues out­lined in these SDGs eg, “pover­ty, hunger, health, ed­u­ca­tion, cli­mate change, gen­der equal­i­ty, wa­ter, san­i­ta­tion, en­er­gy, en­vi­ron­ment, and so­cial jus­tice”.

SDG16 Peace, Jus­tice and Strong In­sti­tu­tions calls for “pro­mot­ing peace­ful and in­clu­sive so­ci­eties for sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment, pro­vid­ing ac­cess to jus­tice for all and build­ing ef­fec­tive, ac­count­able and in­clu­sive in­sti­tu­tions at all lev­els. A peace­ful so­ci­ety is one where there are jus­tice and equal­i­ty for every­one. Peace will en­able a sus­tain­able en­vi­ron­ment to take shape and a sus­tain­able en­vi­ron­ment will help pro­mote peace”.

In Jan­u­ary this year, Pope Fran­cis, in his peace mes­sage, asked us to “em­brace those who en­dure per­ilous jour­neys and hard­ships in or­der to find peace. He urges peo­ple of faith to turn with a ‘con­tem­pla­tive gaze’ to­wards mi­grants and refugees, open­ing our hearts to the ‘gaze of faith which sees God dwelling in their hous­es, in their streets and squares’ ” (www.usc­cb.org). What more can you and I do to act on the four mile­posts for ac­tion he laid down: wel­com­ing, pro­tect­ing, pro­mot­ing, and in­te­grat­ing? It is en­cour­ag­ing to note the num­ber of parish­es that have es­tab­lished Mi­grants and Refugees Min­istries. These men, women, and chil­dren are al­so in search of peace.

And re­mem­ber, we will not at­tain peace un­til we rec­on­cile with God’s Cre­ation. On Sun­day, we ob­serve the In­ter­na­tion­al Day for the preser­va­tion of the Ozone Lay­er, that “frag­ile shield of gas, pro­tects the Earth from the harm­ful por­tion of the rays of the sun, thus help­ing pre­serve life on the plan­et” (UN). While we wel­come the new man­date of the 30-year-old Mon­tre­al Pro­to­col, let us cel­e­brate the ac­com­plish­ments gen­er­at­ed by this pro­to­col eg, the “phase-out of con­trolled us­es of ozone-de­plet­ing sub­stances and the re­lat­ed re­duc­tions have not on­ly helped pro­tect the ozone lay­er for this and fu­ture gen­er­a­tions but have al­so con­tributed sig­nif­i­cant­ly to glob­al ef­forts to ad­dress cli­mate change; fur­ther­more, it has pro­tect­ed hu­man health and ecosys­tems by lim­it­ing the harm­ful ul­tra­vi­o­let ra­di­a­tion from reach­ing the earth” (www.un.org).

Our world is sore­ly ill. There are count­less wars be­ing waged glob­al­ly at this mo­ment. Vi­o­lence seems en­dem­ic across the world. Coun­tries are spend­ing tril­lions of dol­lars on weapons of mass de­struc­tion while many of their cit­i­zens go hun­gry and live in ab­ject pover­ty. Arch­bish­op Desmond Tu­tu is right: “Sta­bil­i­ty and peace…will not come from the bar­rel of a gun, be­cause peace with­out jus­tice is an im­pos­si­bil­i­ty.”

You and I can make a dif­fer­ence. Join the Non-vi­o­lence Be­gins With Me Move­ment (call: 625 6730). Let’s cel­e­brate each small step we take to pro­mote peace. Ma­hat­ma Gand­hi was right when he said: “Non-vi­o­lence is not a gar­ment to be put on and off at will. Its seat is in the heart, and it must be an in­sep­a­ra­ble part of our very be­ing.” You and I can be part of the so­lu­tion. But first, we have to do as Pope Fran­cis says and “say ‘no’ to ha­tred and vi­o­lence—with ac­tion—and ‘yes’ to fra­ter­ni­ty and rec­on­cil­i­a­tion”.

The UN shares some sim­ple steps that we can take eg, seek peace­ful res­o­lu­tion of con­flict when dis­agree­ments arise around you; pre­vent an in­jus­tice at school or in your com­mu­ni­ty by adopt­ing a non-vi­o­lent ap­proach to prob­lem solv­ing and re­port­ing po­ten­tial crimes, in­clud­ing on­line bul­ly­ing; speak up when oth­ers are at risk and stand with oth­ers’ hu­man rights at work, at school, at home, in com­mu­ni­ties.","This year marks the 70th an­niver­sary of that land­mark doc­u­ment.”Since the Uni­ver­sal De­c­la­ra­tion does not in­clude a sep­a­rate ar­ti­cle on “The Right to Peace”.

This year’s observance has greater significance as 2018 also marks the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person. These inalienable rights, according to the United Nations, build the foundations for freedom, justice and peace.

In the Philippines, areas of armed conflict are the most impoverished. Those trapped in these conflicts can only dream of peace, justice and strong institutions – No. 16 in the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Social injustice has fueled insurgencies in this country. As the UN points out, peace thrives in inclusive societies where there is justice and rights are respected.

This year, as the theme of International Day of Peace on Sept. 21, the UN is emphasizing that peace is a human right, and is calling on the global community to take action for its attainment.

Peace building, the UN stresses, is not confined to ending armed conflict, adding that there are many small steps that contribute to peace. Seeking non-violent resolution of conflicts in the community or school is an example. Citizen vigilance against potential crimes and even cyber bullying are also such steps, the UN adds.

Filipinos can take these small steps even as various sectors continue working for the attainment of enduring peace with rebel groups. Around the world, events are being held until today to discuss and celebrate ways of standing up for inalienable human rights. These include the right to peace.","These inalienable rights, according to the United Nations, build the foundations for freedom, justice and peace.

The United Nations Interna­tional Peace Day observed on September 21 annually did not go unnoticed this year.

In Fiji, a group of writers decid­ed to write encouraging letters to people around the world. Brought together by Human Rights lawyer, Sabrina Khan, the group met at Pacifica Patisserie at TappooCity in Lautoka to make someone’s life a little better through writing en­couraging letters.

The United Nations General Assembly declared this as a day devoted to strength­ening the ideals of peace, both within and among all na­tions and peoples.

The UN Member States adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 because they understood that it would not be possible to build a peaceful world if steps were not taken to achieve economic and social development for all people everywhere, and ensure that their rights were protected.

The Sustainable Goals cover a broad range of issues, including poverty, hunger, health, education, climate change, gender equality, water, sanitation, energy, environ­ment and social justice.

Sustainable Development Goal 16 “Peace, Justice and Strong Institu­tions” calls for promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustain­able development, providing access to justice for all and building effec­tive, accountable and inclusive in­stitutions at all levels.

Each year Ms Khan brings the initiative to create something for Peace Day.

Before, while based in Brisbane, Australia, Ms Khan hosted a World Café uniting people to come togeth­er to discuss ideas on kindness and how best to reach out to others.

At Tappoo City, she encouraged the large crowd who had gathered there to write letters of peace and encouragement to send locally and worldwide.

At least that’s the way it seemed at the time. On this day, 25 years ago, the Oslo Accords—a framework for an interim agreement between Israelis and Palestinians—were signed on the South Lawn of the White House. President Bill Clinton, the host of the ceremony, was unable to sleep the night before. He told his peace team, of which I was a member, that he had read from his Bible instead, from the book of Joshua with its detailing of the battle of Jericho. The next morning, Clinton donned a blue silk tie with a pattern of gold trumpets. For him, the trumpets symbolized the clarion call that precipitated the walls of Jericho crumbling, just like he hoped the walls of Israeli-Palestinian conflict would come tumbling down as a result of the agreement between the modern-day equivalents of the Hebrews and Canaanites.

Martin S. Indyk Former Brookings Expert Distinguished Fellow and Director of Executive Education - The Council on Foreign Relations

The hundreds of dignitaries on the South Lawn on that sun-drenched fall morning were there to witness the historic handshake between PLO leader Yasir Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. As Clinton’s Middle East adviser on the National Security Council, I had organized the signing ceremony. Still, few of us knew what was in the Accords. They had been negotiated behind the backs of Clinton and his peace team. Mahmoud Abbas, then Arafat’s deputy, claimed that even the Palestinian leader hadn’t read them. But like Clinton, those who bore witness cared less about the details than the symbolism. The handshake was meant to signify the moment when Israeli and Palestinian leaders decided to begin the process of ending their bloody conflict and resolving their differences at the negotiating table.

In a carefully choreographed scene, Clinton stood behind the two leaders with his arms outstretched as they shook hands, signaling the United States’s embrace of their agreement and his personal commitment to helping them fulfill the politically risky undertaking.Twenty-five years later, the conflict continues, marked by bloody outbursts of terrorism and violence, rocket fire and retaliations. Thousands of Palestinians and Israelis have died, many more have been injured. Since then, one American president after another has tried to end it. The Oslo process was supposed to have provided the blueprint, with its requirement for a series of confidence-building interim steps that would help Israeli and Palestinian leaders absorb the political costs of the difficult compromises needed finally to achieve peace. The Oslo Accords did not spell out those compromises; they did not provide for a Palestinian state, nor for a solution for Jerusalem, which both sides seek as their capital, nor for the Palestinian refugees who claim a “right of return.” They only provided that the final-status issues were to be negotiated and concluded within five years of the signing.

Final-status negotiations actually began in spring 2000, in the Clinton administration’s last year, more than seven years after the handshake on the South Lawn. The delay was the result of Prime Minister Netanyahu’s dilatory tactics. He had won a narrow victory by running against Oslo and then took up more than two years negotiating agreements for redeployment from parts of Hebron and 13 percent of the West Bank. He was succeeded by Ehud Barak, who preferred to negotiate with Syria first.

By that time, both the sweet and bitter fruits of Oslo had been harvested. Much of the cost of occupation was lifted from Israel’s back as the Palestinian Authority assumed responsibility for governing some 90 percent of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, and the international community footed the bill. The Accords provided political cover for King Hussein of Jordan to conclude his peace treaty with Israel, and for several Gulf and North African Arab states to begin normalizing relations with the Jewish state. Syria’s President Hafez al-Assad concluded that he too was free to negotiate peace with Israel once Arafat had signed the Oslo deal. And Egypt’s peace with Israel was strengthened by President Hosni Mubarak’s active engagement in the effort to implement Oslo.

But when it came to relations between Israelis and Palestinians, trust had been severely eroded in the meantime. The Oslo Accords were silent on what should happen with Israeli settlements in the 60 percent of the West Bank Israel still controlled pending a final agreement. Accordingly, with final-status negotiations approaching, the settler hardliners pushed aggressively to expand the settlements by legal and illegal means in an effort to forestall any further withdrawal. At the same time, the Palestinian leadership had neither the will nor the capability to prevent terrorist attacks against Israelis perpetrated by Hamas and other splinter groups opposed to the Oslo Accords. Both sides felt betrayed. Instead of building confidence, these dynamics contributed significantly to each side’s questioning of the other’s intentions. In October 2000, mounting Palestinian frustration generated the intifada, or violent uprising, which in turn engendered Israel’s angry response.

Oslo as an interim, confidence-building process died on the battlefield of the five-year long intifada. But it gave birth to a new Oslo process: the effort to create a two-state solution in which an independent Palestinian state would live side-by-side but separated from the Jewish state (a concept that is nowhere mentioned in the Oslo Accords). This time, the United States was midwife rather than witness. From Camp David II to the Clinton Parameters, from the Bush Roadmap to the Annapolis Process, from Obama’s ’67 Lines to the Kerry Principles, successive administrations tried to fashion a rational solution to an irresolvable problem.The final-status negotiations that Secretary of State Kerry managed to forge by sheer force of will in 2013 revealed unbridgeable gaps on all the issues. For example, Netanyahu insisted on an IDF presence on the Jordan River and in the West Bank for at least three decades; Abbas rejected ever recognizing Israel as a Jewish state. The Israeli government claimed all of Jerusalem as its undivided capital; the Palestinians insisted that East Jerusalem had to be their capital. Netanyahu rejected admission of any Palestinian refugees to Israel; Abbas insisted that at least some be allowed to return. Less obvious, but no less real, was the decline in America’s ability to influence the outcome. With the interim approach discredited and the two-state goal unattainable, the “Oslo Process” died in 2014.

Then along came President Trump, determined to turn a dead process into “the Deal of the Century.” His plan has yet to be revealed but its purpose appears clear—to legitimize the status quo and call it peace. Trump has already attempted to arbitrate every one of the final status issues in Israel’s favor: no capital in East Jerusalem for the Palestinians; no “right of return” for Palestinian refugees; no evacuation of outlying settlements; no ’67 lines; no end of occupation; and no Palestinian state. And for good measure, no aid for the ungrateful Palestinians. Little wonder Trump has now shuttered the PLO legation in Washington. Since he has so effectively driven the Palestinians away from the negotiating table, who needs it?

Over 25 years, in shifting roles from witness to midwife to arbiter, the United States has sadly failed to help Israelis and Palestinians make peace, leaving them mired for the time being in what has essentially become a frozen conflict.

But the quest for that Holy Grail of Middle East peace never seems to end. It just reinvents itself. Perhaps when Mahmoud Abbas, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Donald Trump leave the scene, it will be time to try again. Perhaps then someone will dig up the video of that magical day in September 1993, when peace seemed within reach, and when an American president promised Israelis and Palestinians “the quiet miracle of a normal life.”","Syria’s President Hafez al-Assad concluded that he too was free to negotiate peace with Israel once Arafat had signed the Oslo deal.

General Assembly Plenary

Seventy-third Session, 12th & 13th Meetings (AM & PM)

As the General Assembly entered the fourth day of its general debate today, world leaders once again called to the fore the threats posed by climate change and unilateralism and their impact on international peace and security, while also highlighting several successful transitions from conflict to peace as proof that diplomacy and multilateralism are effective and offer a hopeful sign for the future.

First Vice-President Taban Deng Gai of South Sudan highlighted his country’s steady march to peace and the prospect of free and fair general elections after a transitional period of 36 months. Recalling the signing of the Khartoum Declaration of Agreement between the parties to the conflict, he said that the Government is also establishing wide-ranging mechanisms to encourage national healing. A cross section of community representatives and mediators set up his country’s National Dialogue and “people-to-people” peace initiatives, which allowed those who had not had an opportunity before to express their opinions freely without fear of repercussions.

Leaders from several Balkan countries also spotlighted recent positive developments in their region which had seen much conflict, the embers of some which were still burning.

Prime Minister Boyko Borissov of Bulgaria, noting the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War, said that, in spite of obstacles, the countries of South-Eastern Europe have managed to move forward on much debated issues, as illustrated by the signing of the agreements between Sofia and Skopje, and between Athens and Skopje. Describing these agreements as crucial steps towards stability and security in South-Eastern Europe, as well as towards the Euro Atlantic prospects of the Western Balkans, he said they represented remarkable progress.

Echoing that stance, President Ilir Meta of Albania also lauded the recently concluded agreement between Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Each new bilateral achievement among countries of the Balkans has the potential to become an historic achievement. Recalling the border changes, ethnic cleansing and violent massive displacements that are part of Balkan history, he underscored the tremendous transformation the region has undergone in the last two decades, thanks to United Nations support and the serious investments of the United States and the European Union.

Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, Prime Minister of Fiji, also spoke of healing from past divisions, acknowledging that the ugly historical experience of intolerance and repression in his country had corroded peoples’ trust in each other and the nation. Through reforms and actions, Fiji is in its ninth year of strong economic growth. Nonetheless, the disastrous impacts of climate change are affecting the country. Crops have been washed away and homes destroyed. Fiji, in its fight to save the planet and its people from the catastrophic impacts of climate change, is working to be a net-zero greenhouse gas emitter by 2050, he underscored, voicing his impatience with other world leaders who proclaim their deep concern and then do little or nothing.

As well, leaders, many from small island developing States, echoed the concerns of Fiji’s Prime Minister and, as on previous days of the debate where climate change came up repeatedly, urged the international community to tackle it immediately.

“Our people are waiting, the world is watching,” Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi of Samoa said, pointing out that climate change had been the focus of his message to the Assembly over the last 21 years. The global reach of climate change should unite the international community, he said, describing the Paris Agreement as a beacon of hope for vulnerable island States.

Mia Amor Mottley, Prime Minister of Barbados, said her island State had experienced a string of cataclysmic weather events just in the last 24 hours. “In good conscience, I cannot give the speech that I prepared”, she said, adding that she would have to cut her trip short to fly home tonight to deal with the floods. “I ask this global community to pause. Time is running out,” she warned. Some have banned single use plastic and other items that pollute, but these are decisions on a national level. “We, as a small State, are used to being treated as if we didn’t exist,” she said, urging sovereign countries to ask themselves if this is still the world that is promised in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Member States must reconsider the commitment of keeping global temperature rise to below 1.5°C, because 2°C is calamitous. She also urged for financing that speaks to the needs of small island developing States.

Prime Minister Charlot Salwai Tabimasmas of Vanuatu, the country most at risk in the world from exposure to natural disasters, emphasized that the Pacific region cannot afford to see the Paris Agreement relegated to the archives of the United Nations. That represented a real danger for the survival of his country’s future generations. While urging the parties to the Agreement to step up their determination, he also observed that developed counties had committed to mobilize $100 billion for climate finance for vulnerable countries by 2020, and he called for the adoption of a specific road map for the collection of those funds.

“I do not have the luxury to wait for the international system to adjust to the special needs of countries like my own while natural disasters continue to threaten and erode the gains we make,” Prime Minister Allen M. Chastanet of Saint Lucia stressed, informing the Assembly that his country had just been struck by both a hurricane and an earthquake today. He pointed out the significant gap between the $1.3 billion pledged for reconstruction following hurricanes Irma and Maria and the actual distributed amounts. Imagine how much better his country could do in a fair international environment, he put forth to the Assembly, cautioning that the multilateral system that had achieved the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is under threat.

Wang Yi, Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, also made a strong case for safeguarding multilateralism, lauding it as a “people-centred philosophy”. Outlining China’s long-standing commitment to it, he recalled the negotiations on the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. China fulfilled its promise and integrated itself into the world economic system, he said, adding that following the global financial crisis, it opted not to stand idly by but to work together with other nations. “International trade is complementary and win-win by nature,” he said, warning against zero sum mentalities, unilateralism and protectionism “that will only hurt oneself”.

Prime Minister Samdech Akka Moha Sena Padei Techo Hun Sen of Cambodia expressed deep concern over tensions resulting from the actions of a “first world super Power” and over that State’s brash decision to withdraw from international mechanisms, adding that such actions undermine State-to-State relations. Protectionism effectively closes the door on trade and investment, he pointed out, cautioning that unilateralism will make all countries poorer. Underscoring the benefits of rules-based international cooperation, he urged States to maintain and strengthen the principle of multilateralism.

Several countries, however, highlighted the importance of national sovereignty and jurisdiction over pertinent issues uniquely affecting their state of affairs and posing myriad challenges to their Governments.

Hungary’s Foreign Minister, Péter Szijjártó, said his Government would not sign the Global Compact for Migration because it promotes a multicultural society over a homogeneous one. From Hungary’s perspective, migration is a destabilizing force. Migration is not beneficial for everyone, especially not for those countries hosting a large number of migrants from different cultures. European Union institutions said that stopping migration was not possible, but Hungary proved them wrong by securing its borders with a €1 billion fence. “Migration is not a fundamental human right,” he added, underscoring that violating national borders should not be considered a right.

U Kyaw Tint Swe, Union Minister for the Office of the State Counsellor of Myanmar, expressed sympathy for the displaced persons from the Rakhine region, adding: “We have taken steps to effect the early repatriation of all displaced persons from Rakhine, who are verified as residents of the State.” He called on Bangladesh to allow the return of verified persons under voluntary, safe and dignified conditions. He updated Member States on recent developments, expressing concern over “premeditated and well-organized” terrorist attacks on his soil and designed to invoke fear among people. His Government objected to the formation of a fact-finding mission due to serious and genuine concerns over its composition and mandate. He further rejected the 6 September ruling of the International Criminal Court regarding the situation in the Rakhine State. Myanmar is not a party to the Rome Statute, and the Court has no jurisdiction over Myanmar whatsoever, he added.

Also speaking today were Heads of State and Government, senior ministers and representatives of Guyana, Malaysia, Andorra, Mauritius, Montenegro, Russian Federation, Germany, Tunisia, Iraq, Denmark, Saint Kitts and the Nevis, Bahamas, Lesotho, Antigua and Barbuda, Republic of Moldova, Solomon Islands, Mongolia, Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Monaco, Australia, Kazakhstan, Iceland, Azerbaijan, Chad, Guinea and Libya.

Speaking in exercise of the right of reply were the representatives of Qatar, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia.

The General Assembly will reconvene at 9 a.m. on Saturday, 29 September, to continue its general debate.

Statements

ILIR META, President of Albania, acknowledging the need for reform in the Organization, emphasized that his country remains faithful to the fundamental principles of the United Nations. Underscoring that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is relevant and applicable in all countries, he said the Albanian Parliament has unanimously expressed its firm commitment to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Those Goals and Albania’s European agenda are compatible and coherent with its European integration project. Further, Albania’s development and integration strategies rest on the principles of good governance, rule of law, a competitive and sustainable economy, and the promotion and respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms.

Regarding the ongoing peace and integration processes in the Balkans, he said every bilateral achievement among countries of that region contributes directly to increasing peace, security, stability and economic development. The recently concluded agreement between Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has the potential to become an historic achievement. He urged all political actors in the latter country — including local Albanian leaders — to remain actively engaged by supporting a vote in favour of the agreement on the 30 September referendum. Emphasizing the importance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) open door policy towards the Western Balkans, he said the positive momentum in the region could nurture further progress in the European Union‑led dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia. It is of paramount importance that this agreement fosters the European values of interethnic coexistence and harmony.

The history of the Balkans is notoriously linked to border changes, ethnic cleansing and violent massive displacements, he recalled. Yet, in the last two decades, the region has undergone a tremendous transformation thanks to the United Nations support and involvement, and the serious political, social and economic investments of the United States and the European Union. He said his country welcomes and encourages every effort of the United Nations Member States in continuing Kosovo’s international recognition and its membership in regional and international organizations. Noting the stability and positive development in that country, he expressed support for a reduction of the sessions held by the Security Council on the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) reports.

He went on to express support for the Security Council resolution 2242 (2015) and a more integrated peace and security architecture, adding his vote of confidence that Secretary‑General Guterres will be able to continue working towards revitalizing the Organization’s role with a focus on peace and security. Underlining that more than 6,500 members of the Albanian Armed Forces and civilians have participated in international peacekeeping operations since 1996, he reaffirmed his country’s pledge to continue its modest but firm contribution. He expressed deep appreciation for the close cooperation between the United Nations and the European Union on the platform of the Common Security and Defense Policy and welcomed the leadership of the United States on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, describing it as “a very positive step forward not only for that region but for the entire planet as well”.

However, the situation in Syria and Libya are concerning, he said, emphasizing that the crisis in Libya can only be resolved through an inclusive political dialogue between the two parties. He reiterated his country’s support for the Global Call to Action on the World Drug Problem initiated by the United States. Reaffirming its strong belief in multilateralism, he said Albania would seek to serve as a non‑permanent member of the Security Council for the 2022‑2023 term, adding that his country stands ready to engage constructively in conflict prevention and peace operations through the United Nations and other regional organizations.

CARL GREENIDGE, Vice‑President of Guyana, said his Government remains committed to multilateralism, a principle under attack in some parts of the world. Threats to global multilateral governance are present in the United Nations and evidenced in stymied Security Council reform. He urged States to explore comprehensive organizational forms and arrangements that simplify decision‑making, noting that global governance and peace are inexorably linked. Voicing his full support for the Secretary‑General’s efforts to reform the Organization’s security pillar with an emphasis on preventive diplomacy, he said that for Guyana, and the region as a whole, the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons poses one of the most serious threats to human security and he called for international action against transnational crime.

Underscoring that the principle of sovereignty is the most effective guarantee of peace, he called attention to boundary disputes with Venezuela and the Secretary‑General’s decision to have the matter be referred to the International Court of Justice. However, Venezuela refuses to participate in proceedings. Guyana seeks peace not only in its region, but throughout the world. He also stressed that conflict is an obstacle to development, calling for a two‑State solution to the Israeli‑Palestinian crisis. The people of Palestine, including Gaza, have the right to a dignified existence in their homeland. Turning to Myanmar, he deplored the suffering being borne by the Rohingya population. He also called for the lifting of the embargo on Cuba.

Guyana has fully embraced the holistic and people‑centred approach to development set out in the Sustainable Development Goals, he said, adding that efforts are underway to integrate the Goals into national development strategies. The Government is working to ensure development is not achieved at the expense of the environment. Notwithstanding the fact that Guyana will soon become a significant oil producer, there are initiatives aimed at weaning the country from its dependence on non‑renewable energy. He fully recognized the critical contribution of women and girls to sustainable development initiatives. Underrepresentation of the potential of women and girls amounts to a serious loss of resources in the global effort to promote human development.

He also expressed his satisfaction at the successful conclusion this year of intergovernmental negotiations on the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. As Member States participate in this year’s General Assembly debate, the planet faces grave threats on multiple fronts and there are many that question if the United Nations can unite and strengthen international peace and security. For its part, he emphasized Guyana’s strong commitment to doing its part to promote those principles within the limits of its capacity and resources.

TABAN DENG GAI, First Vice‑President of South Sudan, highlighted how his country is heading towards peaceful stability. With the continued support and goodwill of regional and international partners, it was on schedule to hold free and fair general elections after a transitional period of 36 months. The path forward began at the thirty‑first Extra‑Ordinary Summit of Intergovernmental Authority for Development (IGAD) Heads of State and Government on the Republic of South Sudan of 12 June in Addis Ababa. They aligned the need for a High‑Level Revitalization Forum of all the parties to the Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan. This process included new stakeholders and various groups including civil society, women’s groups, religious leaders, youth and eminent personalities as observers.

He went on to say that the purpose of the Forum was threefold, including instituting a permanent ceasefire, giving fresh impetus to the inclusive implementation of the provisions of the Agreement, and agreeing on new realistic timelines and implementation schedules towards democratic elections at the end of the Transitional Period. His Government embraced the Forum for the Agreement. Its objectives were clearly aimed at bringing about a comprehensive and lasting peace. The signing of the Khartoum Declaration of Agreement between the parties to the conflict took place on 27 June. On 12 September, all parties signed the final Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan. In addition, the Transitional Government of National Unity has embraced the Agreement’s full implementation and is ready to welcome forces from its guarantors to monitor implementation.

Along with the aim of achieving lasting peace is the establishment of mechanisms to tackle impunity and accountability, he continued. In the recently decided Terrain case, the Government interviewed the victims in order to hold the individuals responsible to account. With the support of the United States Government, a detailed investigation and evidence gathering process enabled victims to identify their attackers and ensure that the law was able to prosecute those accountable to the full extent possible.

As national healing is sought, President Salva Kiir has empowered a cross‑section of community representatives and mediators to set up the National Dialogue and other grassroots “people to people” peace initiatives, he noted. The National Dialogue was launched to conduct a multi‑layered approach to repairing the social fabric. It has been heavily criticized by some external observers, mainly because of the misconception that it was considered as a substitute to the peace talks.

However, he pointed out that that was not the case. At the launch of the National Dialogue in 2015, its aim was to create a forum in which the causes of conflict could be discussed, and among other things to ask the people important questions such as those of national identity, governance and the relationship between the communities, including causes of intercommunal conflict. The grassroots component has been the most effective. The process allowed those who had not had an opportunity to have their voices heard to put across their various viewpoints. The reports were candid in nature, as the communities were allowed to express their opinions freely without fear of repercussions.

BOYKO BORISSOV, Prime Minister of Bulgaria, stressing the central role of the United Nations in sustaining a world order based on rule of law, underscored that every country, large or small, has the responsibility to make a significant contribution towards security and prosperity in its own region. That was exemplified by his country’s commitment to fighting the global drug problem which had led it to co‑host the recent high‑level event on that topic. Further, the Bulgarian Presidency of the Council of the European Union invested considerable efforts to achieve progress and consensus among Member States, and during its tenure, the European Union adopted the mandate to start negotiations for the signing of a new partnership agreement with 79 countries from Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.

Highlighting some of the “idiosyncrasies” of his region, he said that the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War was a reminder of the importance of the Balkans and how they had often been the source of conflicts, the embers of some which were still burning. In spite of all the obstacles before them, the countries of the South‑Eastern Europe and especially those from the Western Balkans have managed to achieve remarkable progress on much‑debated issues. As compelling proof of that, he pointed to the recent signing of the agreements between Sofia and Skopje, and between Athens and Skopje. These agreements are crucial steps towards stability and security in South‑Eastern Europe, as well as towards the Euro‑Atlantic prospects of the western Balkans.

Further, he said, Bulgaria, during its tenure in the Presidency of the Council of the European Union initiated a process that put the western Balkans back on the agenda of European politics. An important and emblematic expression of this process was the Leaders’ Summit of the member States of the Union and the western Balkan countries in Sofia in May. Connectivity in all its dimensions was the focus of the discussions, as well as the joint response of the young and relatively small Balkan states, to the common challenges faced by the international community, including irregular migration, organized crime and terrorism, hybrid threats and cybersecurity issues.

Turning to migration, he added that the refugee crises are a consequence of a myriad of political and socioeconomic factors. Strengthening cooperation with all countries of origin, transit and destination is crucial and it is necessary to fully guarantee human rights and the sovereign rights of States to secure their borders. The international community must pay special attention to the different dimensions of development and the integral link between development and security. “If we do not back these efforts with active mediation and peacekeeping, and if we do not manage to resolve burning conflicts and prevent future ones, chances of success are doomed,” he cautioned.

Noting that this year marked the 70th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, he added that his country will be presenting its candidacy for membership in the Human Rights Council. This is not an end in itself, he stressed, but an expression of Bulgaria’s consistent policy of protection of human rights in the country and at the global level. Seventy-five years ago, in the darkest years of the Second World War, Bulgaria’s citizens, the church, enlightened leaders and intellectuals stood up to the attempts to deport close to 50,000 Bulgarian Jews to the death camps. That moment, he emphasized, carries a strong message relevant to the present moment and all people who feel threatened, he said, adding that it was his country’s mission to not allow the return of xenophobia.

TUILAEPA SAILELE MALIELEGAOI, Prime Minister of Samoa, pointed out that his message to the Assembly over the last 21 years has remained consistent: climate change constitutes a huge threat to small island developing States such as his. Action is urgently needed to mitigate that real threat, he said, adding that climate change encompasses the breadth of security issues facing the Blue Pacific region, including human, environmental and resource security, transnational crime and cybersecurity. It affects food security, access to safe water, and fundamentally affects Samoans’ ability to draw sustenance from the pristine ocean around them, he lamented.

The global reach of climate change, he added, should unite and strengthen the international community s resolve, not weaken and divide it. As a united community, there is a great deal it could do to arrest and even reverse climate change. But, no one country, or single group of nations, and no single organization can solely wage and win the war against climate change. Describing the Paris Agreement on climate change as a beacon of hope for vulnerable island States, he noted that it is based on shared responsibilities, trust, collaboration and principled action. It demonstrates “a new brand of cooperation” and a broad outlook, that set aside the narrow pursuits of self‑interest and the use of economic and political expediencies.

For vulnerable countries, “the issue is not about setting new targets, commissioning more studies and reports or even more polite talk shops and structured dialogue sessions”, he stressed. It is about adaptation now and long‑term survival. The United Nations remained their best hope to provide the political will to turn the tide against climate change. Outlining the destructive impacts of climate change that the Pacific region is already facing, he noted that cyclones, floods, droughts, sea level rise and ocean acidification are taking their toll on the health of people, environments and economies.

“Our people are waiting, the world is watching,” he said calling on each individual leader and country to raise the level of ambition, not just as an inspirational goal, but as deliverables of the Paris Agreement. For the Pacific people, urgent, ambitious action on climate change is the only option, he underscored, welcoming the determination resonated in the Secretary‑General’s remarks earlier this month to “sound the alarm” on the need for bolder action. These are big tasks, but when the future existence of sovereign island nations, populations and cultures is at stake, then there is a moral imperative for the world to act decisively and collectively.

Turning to the renewed geopolitical interests in the Pacific region, he said, suddenly the “Pacific is swimming in a rising tide of so‑called fit‑for‑purpose strategies stretching from the tip of Africa, encompassing the Indian Ocean and morphing us into the vast Blue Pacific Ocean continent”. The big Powers are doggedly pursuing ways in which to widen and extend their reach, inculcating a sense of insecurity. Noting that the renewed vigour with which a “Free and Open Indo‑Pacific strategy” is being advocated leaves the region with much uncertainty, he said there is a real risk of privileging “Indo” over the “Pacific”. Any approach for engagement with partners must be genuine, durable and premised on understanding, and mutual benefit, he stressed.

WANG YI, Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, underscored the importance of the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter as well as the vision and practice of multilateralism. Noting that a “people‑centred philosophy” has gained wide acceptance and broad consensus, he nevertheless warned that today the international order faces challenges and requires steady reform and improvement. “The world is changing,” he stated, emphasizing that international rules and multilateral mechanisms are under attack and the global landscape is filled with uncertainties and destabilizing factors.

Outlining the long‑standing support of China for and commitment to multilateralism, he said the country remained true to those commitments throughout negotiations on the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. China fulfilled its promise and integrated itself into the world economic system. More so, following the outbreak of the global financial crisis, it opted not to stand idly by but instead to work together with other nations to overcome rough times. “For years running, China has contributed to over 30 per cent of global growth,” he said, spotlighting its major role in helping to restore the international economy.

Vowing to continue to uphold those commitments, he also echoed President Xi Jinping’s calls to all nations to build a community with a shared future for humankind. In order to uphold multilateralism, the international community must pursue win‑win cooperation, understanding that no country can meet global challenges alone or remain immune to their impact. States must also act in line with rules and order, he stressed, urging inter‑State relations to be based on credibility — not wilful revocation of commitments. Urging nations to uphold the principles of fairness and justice and aim to deliver real results, he said multilateralism requires a strong United Nations, made more efficient and effective through reforms.

“The course of development and progress for humanity is unstoppable,” he continued, underlining that peace, reconciliation and harmony are the “surging trend”. China stands committed to the path of peaceful development and will continue to contribute to global peace and security — including by supporting diplomatic efforts on the Korean Peninsula and the nuclear programme of Iran. Voicing support for efforts to resolve the Palestinian‑Israeli conflict and the Rohingya refugee crisis, he said terrorism — including cyberterrorism — can never be justified. While every country is entitled to explore a development path that suits itself, economic globalization should not be a process for some to gain and others to lose. “International trade is complementary and win‑win by nature,” he said, warning against zero‑sum mentalities, unilateralism and protectionism “that will only hurt oneself”.

CHARLOT SALWAI TABIMASMAS, Prime Minister of Vanuatu, highlighted the many achievements of the United Nations in the past seven decades, noting that extreme poverty had been reduced by half and “more girls are in school than ever before”. Women, particularly in rural areas, are contributing to the global economy and the health of mothers and children have improved. However, overshadowing those achievements are the United Nations failures, including the inability of the Security Council to take decisive action on Syria. Calling on that organ to demonstrate leadership in preserving global peace, he welcomed the reform efforts of the Secretary‑General.

Turning to human rights, he noted that every country must have a resilient national human rights system to achieve meaningful success in development. The Pacific region has committed to strengthening its climate resilience. As the earth rapidly approached a point of no return as evidenced by heatwaves, extreme droughts and the frequency of weather phenomena, it was crucial to take concerted action. According to the World Risk Report of the United Nations University, Vanuatu is the country most at risk in the world in terms of exposure to natural disasters, which is putting tens of thousands of its citizens’ lives at risk. If greenhouse gas emissions remain at the present level, there will be increasing costs to deal with, he cautioned.

Developed counties had committed to mobilize $100 billion for climate finance for vulnerable countries by 2020, he continued. Yet, how this will be achieved remains unclear. Calling for the adoption of a specific road map for the collection of those funds, he stressed, “climate change will not wait”. In addition, more flexible access to climate funding was crucial. The Pacific region cannot afford to see the Paris Agreement relegated to the archives of the United Nations. That represented a real danger for the survival of their future generations. Calling on the parties to the Agreement to step up their determination, he noted that as the largest oceanic continent, the Pacific islands are focusing on sustainable policies for the sound management and conservation of the oceans. Welcoming proposals to support those regional efforts, he highlighted the work of the Pacific Islands Forum.

While 750 million people from more than 80 former colonies had achieved political independence over the past seven decades, the aspirations of millions of others were still denied, he noted. Commending the work of the Organization’s Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee), he said that decolonization must remain on the United Nations agenda. New Caledonia is in the process of determining its own destiny, he said, calling on the international community to support their right to participate fully in the upcoming referendum which must take place in a free and fair manner. Further, the Human Rights Council must investigate the human rights abuses in West Papua.

Ensuring national sustainable development was a priority for his country, he said, adding that Vanuatu’s Sustainable Development Goals are people‑focused and flexible so that it could achieve a balance between the three dimensions. Eradication of poverty is essential. Nonetheless, the country cannot shoulder that responsibility alone. The difficulty of that task is amplified because Vanuatu gets exposed to natural disasters in increasing number, including recent volcanic activity in one of the islands that led to evacuations. Expressing gratitude to development partners who helped the country at this time, he noted that Vanuatu would graduate from least developed status in 2020, and asked them to continue supporting the country.

ALLEN MICHAEL CHASTANET, Prime Minister of Saint Lucia, underscored the challenges faced by small island developing States which are also middle‑income countries. While the world acknowledges their acronyms — “SIDS” and “MICs”, small island developing States and middle-income countries, respectively — little or nothing changes. Economically vulnerable to “de‑risking” and the loss of correspondent banking relations, unable to access concessionary financing and unfairly tarnished by tax labels, Saint Lucia struggles under the weight of international frameworks that make it difficult to chart an effective path to sustainable development or even take control of its destiny.

“I do not have the luxury to wait for the international system to adjust to the special needs of countries like my own while natural disasters continue to threaten and erode the gains we make,” he said, informing the Assembly that Saint Lucia today was struck by both a hurricane and an earthquake. Stating that the resilience of Saint Lucians should never be used against them, he said there remains a significant gap between the $1.3 billion pledged for reconstruction following hurricanes Irma and Maria and the actual amounts that have been distributed. Welcoming plans for a high‑level meeting during the current Assembly session on the challenges of middle‑income countries, he said he hopes it will come up with actionable solutions, but fears it will be “business as usual”.

Emphasizing that the multilateral system is under threat, he said reforming the United Nations is critical. The international community can no longer operate within a framework of ideologies, policies, institutions and patterns of behaviour that were established a long time ago to deal with circumstances long gone. He called for an end to the embargo on Cuba as well as an end to restrictions on the legitimate aspirations of Taiwan for observer status in key international institutions such as the World Health Organization (WHO), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Describing the 2030 Agenda as a triumph of multilateral cooperation, he said the fulfilment of its promise will define the true measure of the collective will to develop as a global community. In that regard, Saint Lucia will be depositing the required instrument to ratify the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol before the next Conference of the Parties to the Paris Agreement. It will also present its voluntary national review on progress in implementing the 2030 Agenda at next year’s High‑Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.

To build peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, small island developing States — including those that are also middle‑income countries — must look to different courses of action to address their respective development challenges, he said. Saint Lucia has had two straight years of economic growth while increasing its tax revenue, and it is on track to attract a record level of foreign investment. However, imagine how much better his country could do in a fair and just international enabling environment, he underscored.

MAHATHIR MOHAMAD, Prime Minister of Malaysia, said a new Malaysia emerged in May when its citizens voted to change their Government, which had been in power since independence. That new Malaysia will firmly espouse the principles underpinning the United Nations, he said, adding that it is in that context that it will ratify all remaining United Nations human rights instruments. Doing so will not be easy, given the country’s ethnic, religious, cultural and linguistic diversity, but time and space will be given to all to deliberate and decide freely.

He said the world is in a worse state economically, socially and politically since he last spoke before the Assembly in 2003, with the international community feeling the pain of a trade war between its two most powerful economies and terrorist activity everywhere. Pointing to the situation in the Middle East, he said the only way to fight terrorism is to remove its root causes. “Let the Palestinians return to reclaim their land. Let there be a State of Palestine,” he said.

Fear of nuclear war has maintained peace in Europe and North America for more than 70 years, but conflict elsewhere has paid handsome dividends to arms traders and manufacturers, he continued. “The arms business is now the biggest business in the world,” profiting shamelessly from death and destruction. Turning to the situation in Rakhine state in Myanmar, he said he believed in the non‑interference in the internal affairs of nations, but questioned if independence gave a country the right to massacre its own people.

He went on to say that free trade means no protection for small countries and their infant industries, with the simple products of the poor subjected to clever barriers that prevent their sale to rich markets. The boycott of Malaysian palm oil is depriving hundreds of thousands of people from jobs and a decent life, he pointed out, emphasizing that 48 per cent of Malaysia remains virgin jungle and that from 2020 every drop of Malaysian palm oil will be certified sustainable under a new national sustainable palm oil standard.

Turning to the Security Council, he underlined that “five countries on the basis of their victories over 70 years ago cannot claim to have a right to hold the world to ransom forever.” Nor can they preach democracy and regime change when they deny democracy in the United Nations. He renewed his suggestion that a Council veto require a minimum of two dissenting votes from permanent members and three from three non‑permanent members. The Assembly would then uphold the veto with a simple majority. Asserting that a world without the United Nations would be a disaster, he said the Organization must get sufficient funding. “No one should threaten it with financial deprivation,” he stated.

ANTONI MARTÍ PETIT, Prime Minister of Andorra, said that 25 years ago, when his country joined the United Nations as a full member, it was a time of hope for everyone. The fall of the Iron Curtain and the end of the cold war gave way to a wave of unprecedented democratization. Human rights were consolidated, economies grew and inequalities were gradually reduced. Twenty‑five years later, many of the hopes of that time have become blurred. Freedom House has noted a constant decline in world democracy since 2006. In its last report it noted that in 2017, only 4 out of every 10 people live in free countries.

This slow decline in democratic regimes has been accompanied by an increase in inequality, intolerance and extremism, he continued. However, despite all the deceptions and faults, the international order should be defended because it is an order that is based on principles that are as elemental as they are universal. Representative democracy and multilateralism are the result of common values and it is therefore not surprising that they are facing a crisis at the same time and being threatened by populism and technocracy. In the face of complex problems, populism proposes solutions that are not really solutions because they end up creating new problems and questioning democratic principles and values. Technocracy, in the face of complex problems, proposes solutions that are as complex as they are elitist.

The actions of the United Nations must be inclusive and focused on the real problems of people, he said. This is why his country wants to participate in an active way in promoting and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. These objectives are focused on specific, tangible needs of the world population. They are large, global objectives that have local applications. If they are reached they will reinforce the bonds that are necessary between people and institutions. Andorra presented its first Voluntary National Review at the High‑Level Political Forum in July. Its Government has set up a campaign to involve the education community, civil society and private companies in the promotion and achievement of the various goals.

Andorra has also focused on measures to combat climate change, and support quality education, he said. Insisting that the international community comply with the agreements and commitments made in Paris in December 2015, he added that his Government is working to fulfil the commitments of the Paris Agreement. As far as quality education is concerned, Andorra is proud of having a rich, diverse and integrated education system that is available to all citizens. It is a system in which families can opt for Andorran, Spanish or French education and one which prepares the nation’s young people to become citizens of a global world.

The United Nations cannot afford the luxury of disconnecting from the problems, needs, expectations and hopes of the citizens of this globalized world, he said. Andorra offers support to the plans to reform the architecture of the United Nations that are being carried out by the United Nations Secretary‑General and his team. A more efficient management of resources is highly necessary, particularly management that is focused on people.

JOSAIA VOREQE BAINIMARAMA, Prime Minister of Fiji, spotlighting his country’s willing and energetic contribution to United Nations peacekeeping operations, said it is also “putting every ounce of energy we have into the fight to save this planet and its people” from the catastrophic impacts of climate change. Expressing pride in Fiji’s democratic process and its inclusive society, he highlighted its high literacy rate and strong social safety nets in particular. Meanwhile, the Government awards micro‑business grants in order to lift people out of poverty and reward and encourage self‑reliance and entrepreneurship.

Fiji has also strengthened its independent institutions, he continued, noting that they protect consumers, fight corruption, provide legal assistance and advocate for and promote human rights. Tolerance and personal freedom are also critical principles for the Fijian people, he said, adding that they drove its decision to seek membership on the Human Rights Council in an upcoming session. “Fiji looks to a future free of racism, nepotism and privilege,” he said, calling for all people to be guaranteed their rights and protected by robust constitutional frameworks.

Recalling that Fiji has seen first‑hand how intolerance leads to repression, violence and mass migration, he said its own ugly historical experience corroded peoples’ trust in each other and their sense in who they were as a nation. “We must remember it so that we do not repeat it, and we will never stop working to keep it in our past,” he said. Today, Fiji is in its ninth year of strong economic growth, due in large part to the democracy that has taken root and is flourishing. “When people see that they have opportunity, that they can get justice, that they can speak their minds and be heard […] they invest their money and sweat in their futures and in greater possibilities for their children,” he stressed.

However, he continued, that optimism must be nurtured and supported through intelligent Government actions. Fiji has reformed its tax laws to make them simpler and more just and is working to ease the burden on those who have little, ensuring that everyone pays their fair share. Also spotlighting critical Government support to small‑ and medium‑sized enterprises — resulting in explosive growth and extraordinary innovation in that sector — he went on to describe the disastrous impacts of climate change on his country. Crops have been washed away and homes destroyed. In that regard, he outlined national mitigation efforts, voicing impatience over other world leaders “who proclaim their deep concern […] and then do little or nothing”. Fiji will be a net‑zero greenhouse‑gas emitter by 2050, he stressed, urging other nations to commit to the same goal.

ALEXIS TSIPRAS, Prime Minister of Greece, recalled that his country faced three overlapping international crises in recent years. It was the country most hard‑hit by the eurozone crisis, and lost 25 per cent of its gross domestic product; it was the European country that carried the heaviest burden of the refugee crisis per capita; and it has been at the centre of a worsening destabilization in the Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean. In this context, nationalist forces became stronger, and succeeded in reframing the debate. The question is no longer whether we can count on international institutions to solve common problems based on shared values, but rather whether these problems and values are common at all. Yet, “not only did we manage to stay standing, overcoming these difficulties, but beyond that we became part of the solution,” he stated, stressing that his country avoided nationalist politics and resisted the directives of those who disregard the will of the Greek people to advance their own interests.

His country remained in the eurozone by carrying out tough negotiations for an economic program that centred on necessary structural reforms and eschewed the perpetuation of punitive and exhausting austerity, he continued. Greece also protected labour rights and established a respectable minimum wage, while guaranteeing fiscal space to support the welfare State and those who are most vulnerable. Highlighting growth rates now at 2.1 per cent and the unemployment rate’s 8 per cent fall, he emphasized that his country is becoming a regional energy, commercial and transport hub. “We are overachieving on high budget surpluses while investors’ interest is growing steadily,” he stated.

Greece dealt with the highest refugee flows in post‑war European history while respecting international law and human rights, he said. Without giving in to nationalist and xenophobic voices that called for push-backs, his country supported the difficult but necessary European Union‑Turkey statement, while accepting that those who do not need international protection return to transit countries where they are safe. “The people of Greece, despite their difficulties, opened their arms to incoming migrants, showing the world what solidarity means,” he stated. He also underlined that, while the Greek asylum authority did not exist five years ago, it deals today with the highest per capita number of applicants in Europe, adding that deaths in the Aegean have nearly reached zero and migrant flows have fallen radically.

Turning to the security crisis in his region, he pointed out that his country established trilateral schemes of cooperation with Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Palestine. In its difficult relations with Turkey, Greece has remained committed to the principle that cooperation and respect for international law is the only way to foster stable bilateral relations. Stressing the need to respect international law in the Aegean Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean, he reaffirmed his full support for a just and viable solution to the Cyprus issue based on United Nations decisions. Greece is actively promoting stability and economic growth in the Balkans through a dialogue with Albania and the Prespa Agreement with its northern neighbour, “a mutually acceptable arrangement that preserves the dignity of both sides”, he noted.

“The dilemma is not patriotism or globalism,” he went on to say. Rather, the choice facing the international community is leaving the world to a vicious circle of national reactions and regressions that leads to tragedy, or creating the conditions for collective, progressive solutions that respect the national and popular sovereignty of each country. “Challenges that are common by their very nature […] can only be dealt with collectively, on the basis of shared values,” he affirmed. In that spirit, he called on international organizations to be more accountable and respond to the needs of States and citizens. Further, he expressed support for the 2030 Agenda, the Global Compact on Migration, the Paris Agreement and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Stressing the need to push forward the human rights agenda, he pointed out that Greece has established citizenship for second‑generation immigrants, legal recognition of gender identity, institutionalized civil partnership and deepened rights for the Muslim community.

PRAVIND KUMAR JUGNAUTH, Prime Minister of Mauritius, declared: “We are living in troubled times, marked by uncertainties and complex threats to peace, stability and sustainability of our planet.” Citing increased tensions, intractable conflicts, expanding pockets of poverty, growing inequalities, the deterioration of the ocean, climate change, violent extremism and terrorism, cyberthreats, escalating militarization and forced migration, he welcomed efforts to reform the United Nations and make it fit for purpose to meet those challenges on behalf of the people it serves.

Noting that Mauritius will present its voluntary national review on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda targets during the 2019 High‑Level Political Forum held under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council, he hailed the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action — known as the Samoa Pathway — as a valid road map to measure how much progress has been made in addressing the special challenges facing those nations. “The stark effects of climate change are being felt all over the world” from the United States’ states of California and the Carolinas to the Philippines, Europe, China and elsewhere. The frequency of extreme weather events demonstrates that the impacts of climate change can affect every country on every continent, he stressed.

Warning that renewed commitments towards ambitious action are needed to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement, he said the planet’s future also depends on the ability to further protect the ocean and increase its ability to act as a buffer against climate change. Outlining Mauritius’ efforts to combat piracy and transnational organized crime in the Indian Ocean and surrounding areas, he spotlighted his Government’s chairmanship of the Indian Ocean Commission and its close engagement with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in those efforts.

He went on to spotlight other critical global issues, including war and conflict in the Middle East, the threat posed by terrorism and the need to reinforce global non‑proliferation regimes. “The continued existence of nuclear arsenals and the threat of a nuclear disaster represent a major impediment to the maintenance of peace and security,” he said, adding: “We must be cautious not to undermine the multilateral system, as this has served the community of nations well.” The United Nations was created to bring States together and it established conditions under which justice and respect for law can be maintained and strengthened.

Reaffirming his commitment to those ideas and values, he expressed Mauritius’ support for the Global Compact on migration to be endorsed in December as well as the United Nations continued decolonization efforts. In that vein, he said the decolonization of Mauritius remains to date incomplete in view of the unlawful exclusion of the Chagos Archipelago from the country prior to its accession to independence. Welcoming diplomatic developments in the Horn of Africa as well as signs that the continent’s overall growth is rebounding, he also reiterated calls to begin a text‑based negotiation to reform the Security Council including a permanent seat for India’s and Africa’s equitable representation.

DUŠKO MARKOVIĆ, Prime Minister of Montenegro, unequivocally confirmed his Government’s commitment to joint action within the United Nations system and welcomed the choice of this year’s General Assembly debate — “Making the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”. Joint action is essential in responding to the catastrophic consequences of terrorism, violent extremism and climate change. To address the many challenges facing the world, United Nations reform is necessary, he said, adding that the General Debate is of paramount importance to ensure confidence in the United Nations.

Montenegro is firmly committed to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals; a process he said complements the country’s European integration efforts. Although it is responsible for a small share of global emissions, Montenegro is committed to implementing the Paris Agreement. The international community often falls short in preventing crime and suffering. The situations in Syria and Myanmar point to the relevance of preventive and timely action in avoiding conflict. States have a moral responsibility to eradicate impunity for crimes committed. Montenegro regrets the ongoing stalemate in the resolution of the Israeli‑Palestinian conflict and the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. Violence resulting from conflicts in the Middle East must end immediately, he asserted, also calling for the strengthening of the United Nations prevention pillar.

Human rights violations pose a threat to democracy, the rule of law and are a step towards conflict, he said. Seventy years since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the world is witnessing an increase in grave rights violations. He acknowledged the role of the Human Rights Council in preventing violations, also urging that body to run more effectively and efficiently. Significant progress has been made at the national level in the promotion and protection of the rights of women and girls, children, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people. Montenegro’s commitment to gender equality is reaffirmed by its chairmanship of the Executive Board of United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women).

Pointing to rising humanitarian challenges, he said adoption of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration will contribute to better management of migration flows and will benefit States and migrants. Montenegro is working to improve migration‑related regulations and admits migrants and refugees into the country in line with international standards. In the 12 years since the restoration of its independence, Montenegro has made rapid progress in the State-building process based on democratic values. He said that as a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member, Montenegro is committed to issues of global security. Montenegro is also a front‑runner for European Union membership and commits itself to combating crime and corruption.

He said the Western Balkans is now a better place to live than it was some 20 years ago, adding that the best future for the region is in membership to the European Union. Montenegro continues to promote regional stability and welcomes the historic name‑change agreement between Greece and Macedonia. Montenegro will continue to be a responsible partner to the United Nations and to contribute to tackling global challenges. Montenegro has presented its candidacy for the upcoming Economic and Social Council, Human Rights Council and Security Council periods.

SAMDECH AKKA MOHA SENA PADEI TECHO HUN SEN, Prime Minister of Cambodia, said his country was a clear example of the successful transition from war to peace, adding that the country was enjoying the dividends of stability and rapid development. Previously infamous for its killing fields, Cambodia is now a peaceful tourist destination and is recognized as one of the world’s fastest growing economies. The country is governed by the rule of law and respect for multiparty, liberal democratic principles. In July, nearly 7 million Cambodians freely cast their vote to determine their political future. Twenty political parties participated in the election which clearly demonstrated legitimate representation of pluralistic politics. The legitimate results of the election are not subject to question or debate, he said, adding that external ambitions to interfere in the electoral process are an assault on the will of Cambodians.

Drawing attention to the vitality of the United Nations Charter, he said it was crucial to avoid interfering in, damaging or disrupting the sovereignty of independent States. He voiced regret that human rights have become a mission to impose specific politics and a pretext for interference by powerful nations. As a result, sanctions have become a popular weapon among certain States. Big countries must not attempt to install their administrative system on small countries because those small countries also possess sovereignty and legitimate aspirations.

He voiced deep concern over tensions resulting from the actions of a “first world super-Power” and over that State’s brash decision to withdraw from international mechanisms, adding that such actions undermine State‑to‑State relations. In an interconnected world, reverting to protectionism effectively closes the door on trade and investment, two paths to prosperity. Unilateralism will make all countries poorer and render them unable to implement the Sustainable Development goals, he said. With a small economy, he said that Cambodia believes in the benefits of rules‑based international cooperation, adding that global trade must not be hindered through the imposition of tariffs. Together, States must maintain and strengthen the principle of multilateralism.

Peace without development is not sustainable, he assured, adding that the Sustainable Development Goals can guide the world towards prosperity. The Goals are an important opportunity to mobilize efforts to reduce poverty and promote inclusive development. The Cambodia Sustainable Development Goals will soon be approved and that will guide medium‑ and long‑term policymaking. Conflict prevention is also a precondition for long‑lasting peace, he said, noting that United Nations peacekeeping efforts play a vital role in global peace efforts. Cambodia welcomes the Secretary‑General’s vision for the Organization’s peacebuilding and peacekeeping initiatives and his focus on conflict prevention.

Terrorism represents a severe and complicated threat and a barrier to long‑lasting peace, he said. Terrorist groups disintegrate communities, worsen conflict and weaken the stability of whole regions. As terrorists turn to cyberspace, counter‑terrorism efforts are forced to become more complex and go through modernization efforts. The cross‑border nature of terrorism requires States to foster concerted cooperation initiatives that include preventive measures. Climate change is another threat standing in the way of implementation of the 2030 Agenda. He pointed to the Paris Agreement as the foundation for action on climate change and asserted Cambodia’s commitment to participate in climate‑related mechanisms. Cambodia fully supports United Nations global leadership and commits itself to implementing its shared responsibility to build a peaceful and equitable world, he stated.

SERGEY V. LAVROV, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, said that, on one hand, there is the strengthening of the steady development of new centres of economic growth, and the aspirations of people to preserve sovereignty and choose development models that are consistent with their national, cultural and religious identities, among others. On the other hand, several western States want to retain their self‑proclaimed status as world leaders. These Powers do not hesitate to use any methods, including political blackmail, economic pressure and brute force, while calling into question the legal validity of international treaties. Such Powers declare the priority of self‑serving unilateral approaches over decisions taken in the framework of the United Nations. Attacks have been launched against the basic principles of the Middle East settlement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the commitments within the World Trade Organization framework and many more.

Commenting on the situation in the Middle East, among other things he stressed that the seven‑year conflict in Syria is a failed attempt of a regime‑change orchestrated from the outside which, relying on the extremists, has almost resulted in the disintegration of the country and the emerging of a terrorist caliphate instead. The energetic actions by his country in response to the request of the Syrian Government, supported by the diplomatic steps in the framework of the Astana process helped to prevent this fatal scenario. The Congress of the Syrian National Dialogue, initiated by his country, Iran and Turkey has created the conditions for a political settlement on the basis of Security Council resolution 2254 (2015). This is the basis for the “Inter‑Syrian Constitutional Committee” that is currently being established in Geneva. Its agenda includes the restoration of destroyed infrastructure to facilitate the return of millions of refugees to their homes.

The growth of radical nationalism and neo‑fascism in Ukraine, where criminals who fought under SS [Nazi Germany’s Schutzstaffel] banners have been declared heroes, is one of the main factors in the protracted intra‑Ukrainian conflict, he continued. The only way to settle the conflict is to ensure a comprehensive and consistent implementation of the Minsk Package of Measures approved by the Security Council. His Government supported the activities of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Mission in Ukraine and is ready to provide its observers with United Nations protection. Instead of implementing the Agreements, Kyiv holds on to the hope that it might be able to bring occupying forces to Donbass with the support of the West.

It has been 20 years since his country initiated the discussion on cyberspace abuses and international information security at the United Nations, he recalled. Against the background of recent developments, it is becoming even more relevant to elaborate under the auspices of the United Nations a set of global norms of responsible behaviour of States in the information space, including the principles of non‑use of force, non‑interference in internal affairs, and respect for State sovereignty.

HEIKO MAAS, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, said that the current crisis of multilateralism makes the many conflicts around the world appear unresolvable. However, Germany’s post‑war success story is evidence of the success of multilateralism. Its neighbours and the United States played a crucial role in Germany’s recovery. “We believe in the United Nations because international cooperation changed our own fate for the better,” he said. Multilateralism and sovereignty are not a contradiction in terms, he said. In fact, sovereignty can only be safeguarded when countries work together. If the United Nations community does not act to fulfil its Charter, to protect the freedom and dignity of all, especially marginalized people, the founding principles will be meaningless, he said.

As an incoming non-permanent member of the Security Council, Germany will be motivated by these principles, he said, also calling for more inclusion and diverse representation on the Council. The conflict in Syria is an example of the need for multilateralism, he pointed out, emphasizing the importance of fulfilling the Turkey–Russian Federation agreement to create a demilitarized zone in Syria’s Idlib region. Free and fair elections must be held in Syria, after which his country is willing to help with reconstruction. “However, there is one line we will not cross – we will not become accomplices to a regime that has forfeited its political legitimacy,” he said. As the second‑largest donor to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Germany will give another 116 million euros – half the requisite amount — to help Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon, he said, calling on other Member States to increase their donations.

Turning to the conflict in Ukraine, he said Germany is working with that country, France and the Russian Federation to implement the Minsk agreements aimed at maintaining the ceasefire and that discussions about creating a United Nations mission in eastern Ukraine continue. Warning Member States of the dangers of a “multipolar” arms race, he called on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to follow up its words with deeds and reaffirmed his country’s commitment to the Iran nuclear deal and to maintaining economic exchanges with Iran. The United Nations must tackle the root causes of conflict, including climate change. “Action based solely on nationalism, with the objective of putting ‘my country first’ reaches its limits here,” he said, affirming his commitment to the Paris Agreement and calling on the Security Council to make climate change a priority. He called for a “quantum leap” in post‑conflict peacebuilding and said Germany would give at least €25 million to the Peacebuilding Fund this year. He demanded accountability for human rights violations including the use of chemical weapons and called the International Criminal Court indispensable because of the message it sends to victims and their perpetrators that justice will prevail.

KHEMAIES JHINAOUI, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Tunisia, voiced support for efforts to render the United Nations better able to confront modern‑day challenges, build peace and security, and promote sustainable development. Those issues are a common responsibility of all people, he stressed, spotlighting the need to address conflict hotspots, bridge inequality and shore up efforts to combat terrorism and organized crime. Promoting human rights is also critical, he said, voicing support for the Secretary‑General’s major reform proposals in management, peace and security, and development – as well as for financial support to those reforms by all nations and the strengthening of the General Assembly’s role.

Tunisia continues to enhance its democratic governance and build up its national institutions, he said, noting that 2018 saw further steps to fight corruption and enhance good governance. Municipal elections were successfully held with the strong participation of women and youth. Noting that Tunisia views the protection and promotion of the human rights of all its citizens as one of its international obligations, he described the establishment of a new committee to promote the empowerment of women. Achieving economic reform and civic peace also requires the strong inclusion of young people, the continuation of reforms, accelerating the country’s growth rate, creating job opportunities and encouraging investment.

Despite recent regional developments and their impacts on Tunisia, there have been strides in each of those areas, he said. For example, the tourism sector has been recently revitalized and is drawing new foreign investment. Underlining the importance of partnerships with neighbours in the region as well as States around the world, he said such cooperation will promote all their interests. Noting that terrorism is one of the gravest challenges facing both his country and the international community as a whole, he expressed support for the United Nations Office of Counter‑Terrorism and other global efforts to combat that phenomenon. “Facing up to extremist ideologies and immunizing societies – especially youth – from the currents of terrorism is extremely important to us,” he said, voicing particular support for information sharing among States and for national efforts to strengthen security while fully respecting human rights and the rule of law.

Meanwhile, he said, the phenomenon of migration remains both an important exchange between nations as well as a global challenge. Calling for efforts to address the root causes of today’s forced migration - including exploitation, poverty and the absence of sustainable development – he said the two compacts on migration slated to be finalized in Morocco in December should become road maps forward on that critical issue. He said that while he understands some States’ apprehension, extreme ideas around the issue of migration must be avoided. He voiced support for the plight of the Palestinian people, the two‑State solution and the work of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), while also expressing concern about the situation in Libya and other parts of the African continent. Furthermore, he underlined his country’s readiness to take up a non‑permanent seat on the Security Council from 2020 to 2021.

IBRAHIM ABDULKARIM AL-JAFARI, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq, recalled that four years ago he stood at the podium to share an overview of the situation in his country, a third of which was occupied by ISIL/Da’esh with millions killed or expelled. “This could have been a historic catastrophe from which we might never have recovered,” he said. Instead, Iraqis stood together behind their faith and rose up to liberate their land. Thanking the United Nations for standing beside Iraq during that dark time, he said ISIL “is now breathing its last breath” in Syria before being snuffed out. Iraq is now working to help those returning home and to strengthen its State institutions. It has joined the club of democratic nations, built on an inclusive, constitutional consensus.

Urging countries to fulfil the financial commitments made to his country during a recent donor conference in Kuwait, he said “this is a new chapter in Iraq’s story”. A national economic, social and cultural plan is in place – with a focus on young people and women – in order to reduce unemployment, provide job opportunities, protect diversity and combat extremist narratives. Welcoming the work of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) as well as the Special Envoy of the Secretary‑General, he said displaced persons are being helped to return, while evidence of war crimes is being collected and those responsible will be held accountable.

The international community should continue to stand with Iraq, he stressed, voicing support for the universalization of all disarmament conventions and a strengthening of the global non‑proliferation regimes. Iraq suffered greatly from the use of weapons of mass destruction, namely chemical weapons, during its dictatorship. Moreover, peace will not be possible in the Middle East until Israel completely withdraws from the Occupied Palestinian Territory and an independent Palestinian State is established. Condemning the United States recent decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem – which he said will only further complicate the situation – he also warned against the unilateral imposition of sanctions that only hurt civilians, as was long felt first‑hand in Iraq.

Turning to Syria, he called for a balanced political solution that will allow for an end to the long‑standing bloodbath as well as attempts to impose a military solution. In Yemen, all external meddling must cease, he said, rejecting the presence of fighters from Turkey and calling on the latter to end its violations of the sovereignty of neighbouring States. Rejecting statements made by the Minister of the Zionist entity - who attempted in his speech to justify an attack on Iraqi sovereignty - he said Iraq will remain a cradle of peace and diversity. “We are proud of our society and our history,” he concluded.

ULLA TØRNÆS, Minister for Development Cooperation of Denmark, said the world needs a strong United Nations that delivers on its full potential. She called for the Secretary‑General’s reform agenda to be turned into reality. All parts of the Organization must embrace the opportunity to change. Member States must reinvest in the United Nations and take responsibility for multilateral cooperation and rule‑based international order, she said, noting Denmark’s candidature for a seat on the Human Rights Council for the 2019‑2021 term.

Gender equality is but a distant hope in several parts of the world and women’s rights are under increasing pressure everywhere, she said. “We cannot accept this. We must stand up and challenge this,” she said, emphasizing that gender equality and equal opportunities are not only fundamental rights, but preconditions for development, peace and prosperity everywhere in the world.

She underscored Denmark’s commitment to the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement, emphasizing that for more than 40 years it has delivered on the United Nations target of providing 0.7 per cent of gross national income in official development assistance (ODA). “Sadly, we are in a group that has too few members,” she said. She stressed the role to be played by young people, as well as the importance of education for girls. She welcomed the finalization of a Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, as well as the Global Compact on Refugees, and described the horrors in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere as examples of why humanitarian efforts are so strongly needed.

Denmark insists on accountability for the most appalling crimes in conflict situations, she said. The report of the Independent International Fact‑Finding Mission on Myanmar underlined the need for accountability vis‑à‑vis the Rohingya crisis alongside the enormous need for humanitarian and development assistance. In that regard, she announced an additional $7 million in extraordinary humanitarian assistance to that crisis, on top of the $46 million already provided since 2017. She went to call on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to take concrete steps towards denuclearization. Until then, sanctions and international pressure must continue, she said.

TIMOTHY S. HARRIS, Prime Minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis, called for urgent reforms to make the United Nations more responsive to the needs and concerns of Member States, particularly small island developing States. Though it is the smallest country in the Western Hemisphere, Saint Kitts and Nevis has made significant progress in the areas of poverty alleviation, free education and affordable health care. All those gains can be erased, however, by climate change, he said, calling on those States that participated in the United Nations high-level pledging conference following hurricanes Irma and Maria to make good on their outstanding commitments. States must also commit to reducing harmful emissions into the environment, he said, expressing regret that nations like his must pay dearly for a debt they did not create.

Emphasizing that climate change poses an existential threat to small island developing States, he wondered when the United Nations will help the Caribbean region to address the prevalence of sargassum seaweed, which is having an impact on fisheries and tourism. Welcoming funding mechanisms to help highly vulnerable small island developing States, he said they must be transparent and easily accessible, with donor countries fulfilling their commitments. That said, the international community cannot claim to help those States, on the one hand, then classify them as middle- and high‑income countries based on archaic financial models that deny them critical development assistance and hinder investment financing.

He went on to say that an unfair financial architecture, including the threat of de‑risking and loss of correspondent banking relationships, is thwarting development in small States. That is compounded by the blacklisting of countries forced to divert scarce resources to comply with the onerous demands of the European Union Council’s Code of Conduct Group, among others. It is unfair to subject some countries to evaluation and ever‑fluctuating standards while others are exempt, he said, calling on the United Nations to bring the plight of small States like his to the forefront of international debate and end such discriminatory practices.

He added that the Caribbean is suffering from an increase in crime related to the trade in small arms, light weapons and drugs. Such weapons flow into the region, where they are not manufactured, and they are linked to an insatiable appetite for drugs in the West, he said, calling for international assistance to address that scourge and emphasizing his country’s commitment to the Arms Trade Treaty. Turning to health issues, he said eight out of 10 deaths in the Caribbean can be attributed to non‑communicable diseases, with hypertension being the leading risk factor for death. “We are facing [a non‑communicable diseases] crisis in our region,” he said, reminding the Assembly that non‑communicable diseases and climate change are two sides of the same coin — “symptoms of the failure of the extant development paradigm”.

Affirming his country’s commitment to the 2030 Agenda, he said Taiwan should be given space to participate in international dialogue and development strategies. He called for the normalization of relations between Cuba and the United States, as well as peaceful dialogue to resolve rule of law and democracy issues in Venezuela.

HUBERT ALEXANDER MINNIS, Prime Minister of the Bahamas, said that although the United Nations is unquestionably relevant to the global community, it is imperative to strive to achieve more. Climate change is a clear and present danger to all, but especially low‑lying coastal nations like the Bahamas, as witnessed in rising sea levels, loss of coral reefs, increased ocean acid volume and more severe, frequent hurricanes and typhoons.

He recalled that his Government evacuated residents from southern islands to prevent loss of lives as Hurricane Irma approached. While there were no fatalities in the Bahamas, “our southern neighbours were not as fortunate”, and he therefore fully supports the Secretary‑General’s plan for a Climate Summit next year. Such discussions must generate more energy and resources to build the resilience and sustainability of island and coastal nations. He said the consecutive damage of major hurricanes has made it difficult to rebuild the Bahamas, an archipelago stretching some 600 miles from north to south, requiring them to replicate infrastructure many times with limited resources. While delivering humanitarian aid is essential, so is a comprehensive approach to sustainable development to address disaster risk reduction and the viability of seas and oceans for posterity.

Tourism is the world’s largest industry and the lifeblood of the Bahamian economy, he said, with millions of annual visitors. To protect its waters and biodiversity, the Bahamas will ban single‑use plastics by 2020. Looking forward to the successful review of the Samoa Pathway, he will also advocate an international legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction.

He noted that the Bahamas and its neighbours are “being beaten twice”: while island nations are not primarily responsible for the climate change which results in hurricanes, when they borrow internationally to restore basic human infrastructure, their debt‑to‑gross domestic product (GDP) ratio rises. Calling for the United Nations to facilitate international dialogue for a workable solution, he also pointed to “the distorted matrix of GDP per capita as a measurement of national wealth and viability” that causes the Bahamas to be assessed more favourably than it should for contributions to international organizations, and when international aid is needed when disaster strikes. Further afield, he reaffirmed support for Cuba to access resources to rebuild after disasters. Highlighting an uphill battle to avoid blacklisting as a non‑cooperative jurisdiction for tax purposes, he stated the country remains committed to international tax transparency and cooperation, regulatory standards and doing business in a fair, competitive manner.

In keeping with the Sustainable Development Goals, his Government seeks to revitalize urban centres with economic and poverty alleviation initiatives. As a member of the Council of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the Bahamas has presented candidature for re‑election to Category “C” and intends to continue working for safe and secure shipping and preventing marine pollution by maritime vessels. Although the Bahamas’ geographical location has made it particularly vulnerable to illegal migration, he stated the country will continue to fight it while adhering to human rights principles.

THOMAS MOTSOAHAE THABANE, Prime Minister of Lesotho, said the centrality and relevance of the United Nations cannot be challenged, from feeding over 104 million people in more than 80 countries annually, assisting millions of refugees, protecting women and children, fighting poverty and HIV and AIDS, and through peacekeeping. The Organization had also worked with the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and African Union to help Lesotho change its trajectory of instability and volatility and enact a comprehensive national reform agenda. He said his Government aims to “transform the Mountain Kingdom into a just, prosperous and stable country”.

He noted the important role of financing to achieve the goals of the African Union’s Agenda 2063 and Agenda 2030. While acknowledging that ODA remains a catalyst, he advocated for robust domestic resources mobilization, while providing space for private sector investment. The launch of an industrial hub in the north of Lesotho will eventually create 14,000 jobs.

Turning to migration, he said it offered opportunities to explore skilled and surplus labour. His Government is working with international partners and has established a National Consultative Committee to develop a strategic plan on the issue. He said plans include interventions related to the diaspora, as it is disturbing to see migrants worldwide facing challenges of unprecedented magnitude, and called on the international community to adhere to the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. Peace and prosperity are impossible when women and girls are marginalized; their role in advancing the global development agenda must be enhanced. It is equally important to avoid politicizing or redefining the protection of human rights or allowing the whims of a few powerful States to subject them to double standards.

Turning to Africa, he said the continent is more determined than ever to settle conflicts peacefully. Pointing to the peace deal in South Sudan, he noted developments in the Horn of Africa offer hope for a prosperous, peaceful region. Ethiopia and Eritrea have normalized relations, opening embassies in their respective capitals to usher in a new era of peace with concomitant economic, humanitarian and strategic implications. However, the situation in Western Sahara, the only colony in Africa, is saddening. Lesotho stands with the suffering Saharawi people. Highlighting worsening situations in Syria, Iraq and Palestine, he called a two‑State solution the only viable option. He also appealed for the embargo on Cuba to be lifted, reintegrating the country into the world trading system.

Stating that it is “indefensible and incomprehensible that decisions which bind us all are left in the hands of a few Member States”, he called for reform of the Security Council to take into account African aspirations as espoused in the Ezulwini Consensus. Of equal importance, gains made in disarmament are being eroded, with small arms and light weapons flooding the market. He noted the re‑emergence of the threat of weapons of mass destruction has left the United Nations paralyzed due to the size and power configuration of the Security Council, making the call for reform even more urgent.

GASTON ALPHONSO BROWNE, Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, emphasizing that a few privileged nations are making decisions that impact the lives of billions of people, said the General Assembly must be revitalized to become a place for action and results. For years, it has been marginalized by the Security Council and the notion that a small group of powerful nations should make decisions for the rest of the world. Until the Assembly is made relevant, the actions of the Council and other organizations will be endured but not embraced, accepted but not respected, and enforced but not legitimized.

He said that, as leader of Antigua and Barbuda, he puts its interests first. However, it would be foolhardy to stand up only for his country. Such a dog‑eat‑dog policy, if practiced by every nation, would result in short‑term gains for rich countries and, ultimately, losses for all. “Loyalty to myopic, nationalistic ideals cannot trump patriotism to our common humanity,” he said, emphasizing that peace, security and prosperity can only be achieved through international teamwork.

He called for the Caribbean to be recognized as a zone of peace, stating that for too many centuries, it has been a place for other people’s conflicts and ambitions. “We want no more to be the theatre of proxy wars by others,” he said. Welcoming the recent visit to Havana by the Chair of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he said it is time for the United States Congress to lift the trade embargo, thus putting Cuba’s talents in medicine, the arts, music and education at the disposal of all humanity.

He went on to say that when the Assembly debates the responsibility to protect, bellicose talk of military intervention must be discouraged. When the United Nations decides that democracy and human rights are emasculated by tyranny, then it must collectively agree upon the action to be taken. Turning to trade, he said the WTO is not perfect, but walking away from it or breaking it down will only destabilize the global trading system. Fifteen years after winning a WTO arbitration case, he added, his country still awaits compensation from the United States.

Injury to small island developing States in the Caribbean and Pacific due to climate change is continuing without compensation, causing their economies to decline, creating internal refugees, scaring away investment, escalating insurance costs and increasing debt levels, he said. With donors having delivered less than half of the pledges they made after Hurricanes Irma and Maria, reconstruction is far from complete. “The problem is global and the solution is global,” he said, urging a global policy dialogue integrating environment with development on the fundamental understanding that every country must do its part to combat climate change.

PAVEL FILIP, Prime Minister of the Republic of Moldova, welcomed the reforms of the Secretary‑General in the face of current global challenges and transformation. By repositioning the United Nations development system, they will be effectively contributing to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, a United Nations milestone. For the reforms to yield results, transparent and constructive dialogue between United Nations management and Member States will have to be sustained, he stressed, arguing the private sector will also need to be more actively involved in achieving sustainable development at the global, regional and national levels.

His vision for a new development strategy called “Moldova 2030”, including the Moldova–European Union Association Agreement, focuses on well‑being and human rights, environmental protection and cultivating an inclusive society. Concerns such as improving road infrastructure; connectivity and mobility of people; goods and services; innovation and technology; and the elimination of corruption are part of a recent ambitious national programme, he said, noting the agreement with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development towards the integration into the European energy market. Energy independence is crucial for his country’s social stability, he added.

While pointing out the persisting deficiencies in United Nations security, he emphasized that efficiency and relevance of the Organization can be fully achieved only through internal restructuring of its Secretariat. He regretted the delay of reforms in the Security Council, given its inability to take effective measures in violent conflicts around the world, thus raising a legitimate question about its relevance as a decisional organ for international security. He also advocated for the allocation of an additional non‑permanent seat for the Eastern European group of countries.

Referring to challenges to sovereignty, territorial integrity and national security, he highlighted the continued presence of the Russian military forces and armaments on the territory of the Republic of Moldova as a grave breach of international law and the United Nations Charter. He welcomed an Assembly resolution stating the Russian Federation’s non‑compliance to withdraw its military forces as a clear violation of sovereignty and territorial integrity of his nation. The joint military exercises of the Operational Group of Russian Forces, illegally on Moldovan soil, violate the 1992 Moldovan‑Russian Ceasefire Agreement, he stressed, noting that the increased exercises undermine international efforts aimed at the peaceful resolution of the protracted Transnistrian problem. In addition, he expressed deep concern that these exercises run contrary to the Russian Federation’s obligation in the framework of the “5+2” international settlement format, appealing to Moscow to discontinue those illegal and provocative activities and to resume unconditionally to withdraw its troops in line with the 1999 Istanbul Summit Outcome Document.

Turning to the application of the Association Agreement with the European Union, he expressed his aim to bring his nation closer to the European Union and ensure the sustainability of the modernization process, pointing to many collaboration opportunities within the Eastern Partnership such as free trade zones, political dialogue and intersectoral cooperation. He stressed that economically the Association Agreement is a big step forward with the European Union being the main trading partner, adding that its implementation is the best and most viable option towards delivering prosperity and sustainable development to the Republic of Moldova.

MIA AMOR MOTTLEY, Prime Minister of Barbados, began by talking about the string of cataclysmic weather events of the last 24 hours: tropical storm Kirk that hit Barbados and Saint Lucia, the earthquake that impacted Martinique, Dominica and Guadalupe; the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia; and an impending typhoon in Japan.

“In good conscience, I cannot give the speech that I prepared,” she said, noting that she was cutting her trip short to fly home tonight to deal with the floods at home. “Some wish that I would speak on denuclearization or non‑communicable diseases, or other [issues],” she said, but added that now the world is beginning to understand the impacts of climate change. “I ask this global community to pause. Time is running out,” she said, referring to taking concrete action on climate change. She added that yes, we have banned single‑use plastic and other items that pollute, but these are decisions on a national level. We can try to ensure fossil fuels are phased out by 2030, but this is against a background that is not putting mechanisms in place. “What does this mean to those who are relying on a green climate fund, but the capacity is simply not there?” she said, calling on all people of the world to look after one another.

“We, as a small State, are used to being treated as if we didn’t exist,” she said, adding that it is as if you can just cut off a region. She urged sovereign countries to ask themselves if this is still the world that is promised in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Underscoring the need for small States to have a corridor of stability to withstand the shocks of climate change, she noted the importance of the United Nations as a multilateral body. “It matters. It protects the small and constrains the large. When you take away multilateralism, who will hear us?”

But what is clearly required is behavioural change, she said, adding that we ask ourselves why we must come here year after year and speak about the embargo of Cuba again and again, as if it is pro forma. We speak about territorial disputes but see no gain. “It cannot be alright with the issue of climate change, because this is a matter of life or death,” she said. She called for a reconsideration of the commitment of keeping global temperature rise to below 1.5°C, because 2°C is calamitous, she said, adding that the world needed financing that speaks to the needs of small island developing States.

Our principles must remain constant, she said, adding that: “What happened in the last 24 hours is not a science fiction movie. We must have caring and empathy,” she urged, asking for the world to pause and get this one right. “It is not about Governments anymore, it is about people,” she said.

RICKY NELSON HOUENIPWELA, Prime Minister of Solomon Islands, said implementing the Sustainable Development Goals requires a unified global partnership, one which recognizes that together the world can conquer the inequities of today. However, the very foundation and strengths of multilateralism are currently being challenged and undermined by unilateral posturing and insular policies that have seen some countries reverse their commitments to international agreements. Yet, the United Nations allows its membership to consolidate collective resolve to achieve progress in all fields.

Citing examples of national progress on reaching the Goals, he said Solomon Islands completed a midterm review of the Samoa Pathway and has met two of three criteria for graduation from the group of least developed countries. Yet, as a post‑conflict State, his country will require prudent macroeconomic and finance policies to maintain threshold indicators. Expressing hope the General Assembly will grant Solomon Islands an opportunity to assess the potential impact of graduating from the group, he said a predictable, workable strategy would put the country on a continued upward trajectory. Calling on the United Nations for support during these processes, he noted with pleasure that a special task force has been established to ensure a smooth transition.

Raising climate change concerns, he called for collective global leadership and strengthened commitment towards the forthcoming twenty‑fourth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Poland. For its part, Solomon Islands remains committed to transitioning to renewable energy use and is, through partnerships, completing infrastructure projects and cooperating with other nations on a range of development programmes. Goal‑related efforts also include ocean management, developing an ocean policy and subscribing to the Blue Pacific Initiative, which sets the context for developing regional priorities.

Given the increasingly complex global security threats, he said, working together is more important than ever. Highlighting progress on the Korean Peninsula, he said efforts must now focus on achieving stability in the Middle East and peacefully settling the Israeli‑Palestinian conflict. Noting the Pacific Islands Forum’s outcome document on the region’s shifting security landscape, he expressed support for United Nations peacekeeping operations. Having benefited from the Peacebuilding Fund in 2017, Solomon Islands has facilitated dialogue with stakeholders on key issues. Recognizing the ever‑changing global security situation, he reiterated a call to reform the Security Council, adding that the small island developing States must have a voice through a dedicated non‑permanent seat.

Turning to other threats, he said action is urgently needed to address non‑communicable diseases, which cause almost 80 per cent of all deaths in the region and are placing a heavy burden on health‑care systems. On other issues, he called for the United Nations to recognize Taiwan as a Member State and pledged his Government’s commitment to work with Indonesia on areas of mutual interest, including human rights concerns in Papua and West Papua. To address national challenges, the Government passed anti‑corruption and whistle‑blower‑protection legislation and is committed to holding free and fair elections in 2019. “Without the United Nations, as a small island country, we will not be able to be heard,” he said, expressing ardent support for multilateralism. “The United Nations has flaws, but Solomon Islands continues to feel the impact of the power of working together on global issues.”

KHURELSUKH UKHNAA, Prime Minister of Mongolia, noted that today we are living in a flat, globalized, and interrelated world where our life is digitized, and life is greatly shaped by technological progress. Despite these developments, we encounter conflicts, poverty, hunger and inequality. In that vein, Mongolia supports reform initiatives in the peace architecture, aimed at ensuring stronger prevention and mediation. Referring to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute report, world military expenditure is estimated to have reached $1.7 trillion in 2017, the highest level since the cold war. The armaments race is not declining, and the use of technological advancements in armed conflicts is making the circumstances more dangerous than ever, he noted, citing Mongolia’s initiatives proving its contributions to peace and security, including bringing hun","That new Malaysia will firmly espouse the principles underpinning the United Nations, he said, adding that it is in that context that it will ratify all remaining United Nations human rights instruments.
Andorra offers support to the plans to reform the architecture of the United Nations that are being carried out by the United Nations Secretary‑General and his team.
To address the many challenges facing the world, United Nations reform is necessary, he said, adding that the General Debate is of paramount importance to ensure confidence in the United Nations.
By repositioning the United Nations development system, they will be effectively contributing to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, a United Nations milestone.
Given the increasingly complex global security threats, he said, working together is more important than ever."

If a state is facing a problem, solving it may be difficult but running away from it is no solution. Understanding the problem and resolving it for human welfare is a right decision. Today, our state is facing a problem but it seems to be running away from the problem and unexpectedly is at war with a huge section of its peace loving citizens.

What oxygen is to lungs, peace is to our state Jammu and Kashmir. Without peace, the state can never achieve progress and prosperity in any sphere of life. Peace can allow judicious utilization of our resources- both human and non-human- and accountability of those at the helm of affairs. Besides, peace creates no obstacles in progress, allows people to live in a safe and secure environment and saves the wastage of resources. Without peace, honest work ethics becomes very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.

For peace to prevail, every state needs strong institutions run by peace loving people. If any institution is not run by peace lovers, then that institution sows and waters the seeds of peacelessness through its actions. As a result, corruption and exploitation take the driving seat and run the institution counter to public expectations. Basically, corruption violates the rights of citizens which creates chaos and an insecure climate. Only people with honest work ethics make institutions strong by protecting the rights of their fellow citizens and so make way for peace.

J&K is gifted with lakhs of peace lovers who have no greed and lust for becoming rich and wealthy at the expense of the prosperity of their fellow citizens. These peace lovers are an asset of this state. They deserve medals for their peace loving attitude.

Through their exemplary behavior and selfless service to the weaker and disadvantaged sections of the children of this state, those peace-loving citizens of the state have taken education to the door steps of each habitation and village. Yes, these teachers may have weaknesses and may not have lived up to the expectations but degrading them and keeping them away from schools is miscarriage of justice.

Known as Rahber-e-Taleem (ReT) teachers, these patriotic citizens of the state have been appointed by the state under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) since year 2000 AD. They are mandated to teach at the elementary level in the state run schools across J&K. SSA simply has been a source of funds to the successive state governments which have been paying salaries out of those funds to these teachers.

It has been purely through their zeal, hard work and patriotic feelings that these teachers have spread education through the length and breadth of the state. In return, the state paid them Rs 1500 to Rs 3000 a month for five years without counting this service. A manual laborer earned more than these teachers. Later on, the state regularized these teachers as General Line Teachers.

Today, the state is at war with these teachers. In April, this year, the state raised the monthly salaries of its more than four lakhs employees but ironically has not done so for these teachers (under SSA). Worse, the state releases their salaries of one month or two months (after three to five months) on festivals. Facing miserable social and family conditions, these teachers appeal for the solution of their issues. But the state responds with violence and indifference. On Teachers’ Day (Sept 5), the teachers met with state violence when they observed the day as “black day”.

Some days back, these 41 thousand teachers began an indefinite hunger strike, a peaceful way to press for their genuine demands. However, no positive response has come from the authorities so far. Silence by the state and its claim of tasking a committee to report in November about the teachers’ issues, is failing to convince the teachers.

In this war like climate, education of about 12 lakh children and future of their suffering teachers is at stake. Moreover, tension is prevailing at these schools and in society and peace has taken a severe beating.

The state can send these peace loving teachers back to schools by either issuing an order promising a raise in their pay scale like the rest of the state employees or raise the pay scale with immediate effect. Or, it can promise the teachers’ leaders that the demands will be met on a certain date after 15 to 20 days. Then the state must keep the promise.

If not, the state needs to come clean on the future of these permanent teachers and save the future of lakhs of children whose annual exam is just some days away. With their teachers sad, demotivated and away from schools, the poor children are facing a threat of loss of their academic year. So do not be at war with the teachers; but be at war with the problems of the teachers. Resolve their problems; end the war with them.

The determination, courage and commitment of women religious and others working to bring peace to war-torn South Sudan should be honored daily.

But today is a particularly good occasion to do that. Sept. 21 is the annual observation of the United Nations' International Day of Peace, a day the U.N. describes as ""strengthening the ideals of peace, both within and among all nations and peoples.""

As I reflect on the day's meaning, I am struck by the word ""within.""

Wars between states are increasingly rare. But civil wars and internal conflicts and unrest continue to haunt the globe. Nowhere is this more evident than in South Sudan. As Amnesty International notes, 4 million South Sudanese have been displaced from a five-year conflict in which tens of thousands have died and as many as 7 million need humanitarian assistance.

Earlier this month, two South Sudanese political rivals, President Salva Kiir and former vice president and rebel leader Riek Machar signed a peace agreement many hope will end this terrible war.

Caution, though, is the watchword here. Previous peace agreements in South Sudan have been quickly broken.

""What can we say about it?"" Sr. Carla Magnaghi, a member of the Italian congregation Little Apostles of Charity, wrote in an email earlier this week. Magnaghi has worked two stints in South Sudan over 25 years. Her current ministry focuses on a center for mentally and physically disabled children providing rehabilitation, medical care and schooling. The center, called Usratuna, also provides training and education for those who want to provide care for the children.

""In spite of the peace proclamation, we do not see any signs of [peace]. Most of the local people are skeptical about it,"" Magnaghi told me.

(CNS / Reuters / Andreea Campeanu)

The extreme level of bloodshed is one reason for skepticism. The overall violence in South Sudan, to quote Amnesty International, has resulted in ""civilian suffering on a staggering scale.""

Neither side has availed itself well, with human rights abuses occurring by all military parties. In its most recent report on South Sudan, released this week, Amnesty International accused government forces and their allied militias of a military offensive earlier this year in Unity state. Amnesty International said what happened amounted to war crimes. According to the United Nations, hundreds of civilians were killed.

That's the rub: the deaths of so many civilians. People are tired of being victims of war.

""The people here cannot escape. They are too poor to become refugees. There are no boats here heading to foreign shores, but if there were, most of the South Sudanese could not pay to board them,"" said Br. Bill Firman, an Australian LaSalle Christian brother who heads Solidarity with South Sudan, a global network of religious congregations of sisters, brothers and priests who collaborate to train leaders, nurses, teachers, midwives and others in South Sudan.

I got to know Solidarity's fine work firsthand during assignments I had to South Sudan in 2014 and 2017. I interviewed a number of sisters, priests and brothers involved with Solidarity and was particularly moved by the work I saw in Wau, where sisters and priests assisted thousands of displaced who found refuge on the grounds of the city's Catholic cathedral. I also met dedicated teachers who, despite the violence, continued their work in training young medical personnel at the Catholic Health Training Institute.

Working to uphold human dignity in a war environment is never easy, particularly when it often feels like the country's rival political leaders don't share the same commitment.

""The situation in South Sudan is increasingly anarchistic and I sometimes wonder what is the point of endless peace talks between leaders who are not in control of the opposing forces they are supposed to be leading,"" Firman told me in an email earlier this week.

""The people long for peace but it has not come. No wonder people are weary of peace agreements.""

The news about the latest peace agreement comes as Solidarity marks its 10th anniversary. Firman, in a recent letter to religious congregations supporting the network, noted that when he arrived in South Sudan in 2009, ""there were 21 religious in South Sudan — 18 sisters, two brothers and one priest.""

Solidarity, he said, ""still has five of those religious sisters who arrived before me. Our numbers rose to around 35 in 2013 but since then have been reasonably stable around 30. As I write, we have 26 religious from 18 different congregations from 16 countries and three lay volunteers, 16 women and 13 men, plus many employees working in South Sudan.""

In his email to me, Firman noted that Solidarity and other groups are focused on young people, who he and others believe is the country's best hope.

""The real hope is in the next generation who will be better educated and better prepared for leadership,"" he said. ""In educating registered nurses, midwives, teachers, pastoral workers, farmers, in standing in solidarity with them, in sharing their burdens and in offering relief where we can, I see our Solidarity members as 'apostles of hope.' ""

He added, ""I salute my colleagues here in South Sudan who refuse to be diverted from their ministries by possible danger and threat of attack. 'Could you not watch one hour with me?' It was a call to all Christians down the ages that they are heeding.""

Placing work in the context of the larger history of Christian witness and commitment is striking; so is the fact that Solidarity's educational institutions — ""one for training nurses and midwives and the other for training primary school teachers, each with over 120 in residence,"" as Firman notes — have, despite the odds, ""continued to function well through all the troubled times,"" with students from varied ethnic backgrounds learning to live and study together.

That is important. Ethnic differences are sometimes blamed for the civil war. But as many South Sudanese told me during my assignments, political leaders have more often than not exploited those differences for their own political gain. The result is more violence.

""Our students are learning to live in peace with their neighbors,"" Firman said. ""Unity in diversity is possible. These future leaders of the next generation are the sign and promise there can be a resurrection — if we stay with them in their hour of greatest need. ""

In a special nod, Firman noted that five of the sisters who came to South Sudan in 2009 ""are still here. 'Solidarity with South Sudan' is our name and we are resolved to continue to work in solidarity with the people here.""

On an international day dedicated to peace, that fact is inspiring and worth celebrating. But so is Magnaghi's cautionary note: ""We need a prayer, strong faith and hope in God.""

What’s new??Pakistan has merged the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) along the Afghan border into an adjacent province, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a big step toward bringing constitutional governance and restoring peace to these lands. But the interim regulations governing FATA retain features of the colonial-era law previously in force, imperilling stability.

Why does it matter??Locals resent being in the crossfire of Islamabad’s war on FATA-based militants. Millions have been displaced. FATA’s civil society is more assertive than ever in demanding an end to these abuses and to militancy in the tribal belt. If Islamabad baulks, militants could exploit the ensuing popular estrangement.

What should be done??Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s legislature should repeal FATA’s interim regulations and lift restrictions on freedom of movement. In consultation with locals, both the federal and provincial governments should urgently establish an administrative and judicial system that respects civil liberties, provides professional policing and delivers needed services in the territories.

Overview

On 24 May, Pakistan’s National Assembly passed the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) Reforms Bill, merging FATA, a mountainous belt along the Afghan border, with adjacent Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Previously, the federal government had directly administered FATA through colonial-era laws that deprived locals of rights and subjected them to harsh punishment. Inept and repressive governance, together with the Pakistani military’s use of FATA as a haven for jihadist proxies, have long made those areas vulnerable to militancy and conflict. By formally incorporating FATA into Pakistan’s constitutional mainstream, the Reforms Bill took a major step forward. But more must be done to stabilise the tribal borderlands. In particular, the newly elected governments in Islamabad and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, led by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, should establish a legal and administrative system that delivers justice and services. The military should lift arbitrary restrictions on movement within, and outside access to, FATA so that elected representatives, civil society groups and the media can monitor progress.

Under the 1901 Frontier Crimes Regulations, the political agent, the senior-most federal bureaucrat in each of FATA’s seven tribal agencies, wielded unchecked executive, judicial and revenue authority. Article 247 of the constitution gave the president discretion to “make regulations” with respect to FATA’s “peace and good governance”, which denied the judiciary jurisdiction and circumscribed the national legislature’s authority. The FATA Reforms Bill, in essence the 31st amendment to the constitution, abolished this provision, and in his final executive decision under the article, President Mamnoon Hussain repealed the 19o1 regulations.

FATA’s merger with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa followed years of military operations against Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP, Taliban Movement of Pakistan) militants. Those operations broke TTP’s hold over most of the tribal belt but also displaced millions of residents, destroyed homes and ruined livelihoods. Security in those areas has improved but remains fragile. Afghan insurgents, including Afghan Taliban factions and allied militants, maintain sanctuaries in FATA from which they conduct operations in Afghanistan. Human rights abuses, particularly enforced disappearances, continue, and the military still controls virtually every aspect of public life.

FATA’s civil society, having long chafed at Islamabad’s and local elites’ misrule and at the military’s repression, has increasingly found its voice. The youth-led Pashtun Tahafuz (Protection) Movement flowered in early 2018, gaining strong civic support and demanding an end to militancy in FATA and to the military’s abuse of power, including enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings, as well as curfews and other restrictions on fundamental freedoms. These demands now shape public discourse in the tribal belt, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and among Pashtuns countrywide. They played a major role in pressuring the civil and military leadership toward reform, culminating in the passage of the 31st amendment.

The territorial merger, the abolition of Article 247 and the extension of judicial oversight create new opportunities to make FATA truly part of Pakistan, ending its status as a no-man’s land. Yet the military’s desire to use this strategic territory as a haven for militant proxies and the civil bureaucracy’s reluctance to relinquish the power it enjoys from the status quo remain obstacles to reform. So, too, do the economic and political prerogatives of the bureaucracies’ local clientele, FATA’s self-serving tribal elite. Moreover, former President Hussain, when repealing the 1901 regulations, simultaneously promulgated the FATA Interim Governance Regulation 2018, which resembles the cancelled regulations in all but name, empowering unaccountable civil and military bureaucracies and denying residents civil liberties and protections.

Tehreek-i-Insaf, which under Imran Khan’s leadership came to power in July 2018 elections and will form both the national and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial governments, has long been a strong advocate of FATA’s mainstreaming. It can now carry out that agenda, and by doing so reduce militancy and conflict risks and win local hearts and minds. The provincial government, in its very first sitting, should repeal the interim governance framework. It and the federal parliament should set up special bipartisan committees that consult local stakeholders in prioritising rehabilitation and reconstruction needs. These committees should also hold public hearings, including on human rights violations and other abuses of power.

Both federal and provincial governments should demand – and the superior judiciary should ensure – unimpeded access to the tribal belt, including to internment centres, for parliamentarians, civil society groups, human rights defenders and media outlets. The military authorities should lift all restrictions on residents’ movements in and out of FATA. The federal government should give the judiciary the finances it requires to establish the necessary infrastructure in FATA. Since Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s 2017 police act applies to the tribal belt, the provincial government should ensure that it has the resources it needs to exercise its additional responsibilities, while disbanding the tribal levies, the official tribal militias under the FATA’s administration’s control, and incorporating their personnel into the regular police force.

Peace in FATA: Real or Imagined?

A week after an 8 June 2014 jihadist attack on Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, the Pakistan military launched an operation called Zarb-e-Azb (Quick Strike) in North Waziristan. Following earlier operations that ostensibly had cleared other parts of the tribal belt, Zarb-e-Azb’s purpose was to eradicate the last vestiges of militant activity in FATA. In principle, it would not distinguish between “good” militants (those backed by the Pakistani military establishment, including Afghan Taliban factions and other groups fighting U.S. and Afghan government troops across the border) and “bad” (those, like the TTP, that had turned against the Pakistani state itself).

Even critics of the military operations recognise that they have disrupted TTP networks in FATA. The tribal areas are no longer the hub for transnational jihadists that they were some years ago, when militants from across the world rubbed shoulders with their Pakistani counterparts in training camps. Yet the military has neither killed nor captured all major TTP leaders. Some relocated to Afghanistan. Others moved to nearby Khyber Pakhtunkhwa districts, such as Tank and Dera Ismail Khan, and revived their networks there. These areas have seen increased extortion of local businesses, killing of leaders seen as anti-TTP and other perceived opponents, and kidnapping for ransom. Other TTP factions with close ties to the Afghan Taliban, such as those led by Gul Bahadur and Sadiq Noor, appear to have moved their militias from North to South Waziristan.

Well-informed sources contend that Afghan militants, too, first relocated to other parts of the tribal belt, such as Kurram, whence they had easy access to Afghanistan’s Khost province, and have now returned to sanctuaries in North Waziristan. “The Haqqani network [an Afghan Taliban faction long based in FATA] owns property worth billions of rupees in North Waziristan”, said Latif Afridi, a senior lawyer and Awami National Party leader from Khyber. “They started there and are still there. They only temporarily relocated to FATA’s Kurram and Hangu [an adjoining Khyber Pakhtunkhwa district]”.

To consolidate control, the military has relied on “peace committees”. In reality, these are pro-state militias, comprising what many FATA activists refer to as “local thugs”, that have fuelled conflict (as discussed below). While the military disbanded some of these militias due to local opposition, those that remain continue to target opponents and indulge in criminal activity, including drug and arms smuggling, with few restrictions.

That militant networks have revived is evident in the higher rates of violence and casualties in the past year. A FATA-focused NGO noted a 16 per cent rise in militant attacks and a 37 per cent rise in the number of casualties in 2017, compared to the year before. Many such attacks have taken place in tribal agencies that the military had supposedly rid of militants, such as Mohmand and Bajaur. Kurram, with its large Shiite population, was particularly volatile, with at least 115 people killed in three attacks in the first six months of 2017 – two of them targeting Shiites. Attacks have continued this year: in January, five civilians were killed in a bombing in Kurram; in February, a military convoy was attacked in North Waziristan; the same month in Bajaur, an anti-Taliban leader was killed. Militants have also resumed targeting girls’ schools and threatening families who send their daughters to school.

This increase in militant activity is no justification for stalling reform. In fact, the opposite is true: the best means of countering militancy would be for the newly empowered judiciary to enforce the law and the newly authorised Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police to replace blunt military operations with targeted, intelligence-based counter-insurgency efforts. Until the judiciary and police can fully exercise the prerogatives the 31st amendment grants them, the military should heed the concerns of a public deeply alienated by years of heavy-handed military operations.

For FATA inhabitants, what peace there is as the result of those operations has come at considerable cost. Many in FATA are angered by curfews, fences that hinder freedom of movement and a proliferation of checkposts. Attacks by TTP factions based in Afghanistan on targets in Pakistan have raised tensions with Kabul and been used by the military to justify the repeated closure of key border crossings. These closures impede the cross-border trade that accounts for most of FATA’s economic activity. “An already impoverished people, ravaged by years of war, instead of getting support and relief are further trounced into extinction without any remedial measures”, wrote a former North Waziristan political agent and author of a book on FATA. “Without alternate economic activity, the government is pushing an already desperate FATA into an inconsolable situation”. In Operation Zarb-e-Azb’s aftermath, residents were even prevented from travelling freely to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “They were blocked on both sides, north to Afghanistan and down country”, said the former North Waziristan political agent.

Military operations had displaced hundreds of thousands in the tribal belt. Most have returned, but to destroyed homes and livelihoods. Although Islamabad announced the establishment of funds for cash assistance to returning internally displaced persons (IDPs) as compensation for damaged homes, reconstruction and rehabilitation, little has been spent on the ground. Marketplaces resemble ghost towns, their infrastructure destroyed and inventories looted, allegedly by soldiers as well as militants. The lack of drinking water, shelter, electricity, education and health care has often prompted IDPs to again relocate to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and elsewhere. Soldiers continue to occupy homes and schools across the tribal belt, even in relatively safe areas such as Khyber Agency’s Tirah valley.

Rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and custodial deaths continue, as does collective punishment. For example, after a December 2017 killing of two soldiers, the military imposed a curfew in North Waziristan’s Hamzoni town, preventing access to hospitals and forcing women and children out of their homes during search operations. These and other heavy-handed measures sparked local protests. A North Waziristan resident said, “they beat men, women and children and ask, ‘Who does this?’”

The 2011 Actions (in Aid of Civil Power) Regulation, which remains in force in FATA, provides for internment centres to hold a suspect “in order to incapacitate him from committing any offence or further offences”, or if internment is “expedient for peace in the defined area”. There are at least seventeen known internment centres in FATA and other designed tribal areas, the Provincially Administered Tribal Areas (PATA) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The military has rebuffed parliamentary committees’ efforts to gain access. The Peshawar high court maintained a list of some 2,000 missing persons on its website, but removed it in early 2018, possibly under military pressure since civil society mobilisation on the issue (discussed below) was increasing. Activists believe the number is significantly higher. According to a well-informed senior Pashtun journalist, locals say, “knowing that your son is dead at least gives you closure. When your son is missing, it’s as if he is dying every day”.

Mobilising FATA’s Civil Society

Given the constraints on freedoms of expression and association, lack of legal recourse, widespread insecurity and the military’s intrusive monitoring, FATA’s civil society has long struggled to articulate public demands. Maliks, or tribal elders, also obstruct political and social mobilisation. Appointed by the federal bureaucracy, and often enjoying only limited local support, they are a main beneficiary of FATA’s status quo, including from the flourishing black economy. But FATA’s old guard – the civil and military bureaucracies and the maliks – now face their biggest challenge from a new generation that wants change and can mobilise society, as demonstrated by growing support for the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement.

This group has its origins in the Mehsud Tahafuz Movement, set up in 2016 by a student leader, Manzoor Ahmed, from South Waziristan. That movement initially protested against both the persecution of Ahmed’s Mehsud tribe, which had borne the brunt of collective punishment (top TTP leaders were Mehsuds), and against discrimination suffered by Pashtuns more broadly, particularly those from FATA, at the hands of state institutions and businesses. Ethnic profiling of Pashtuns extends beyond FATA. In February 2018, for example, the Punjab government issued a notification “asking the population to keep an eye on suspicious individuals who look like Pashtuns or are from [FATA], and to report any suspicious activity by them”.

A turning point for FATA’s youth activism was the Karachi police’s 13 January 2018 extrajudicial killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud, a North Waziristan resident and aspiring model on social media with no links to terrorism. The killing sparked national outrage. Thousands of Pashtuns participated in an Islamabad sit-in led by the Mehsud Tahafuz Movement, demanding accountability for Naqeebullah’s murder, and a halt to extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, curfews, locals’ humiliation at checkposts and restrictions on freedoms, as well as an end to militancy in FATA. They highlighted the destruction of civilian properties during and after military operations, the hardships faced by returning IDPs, and deaths caused by unexploded ordnance and mines. Given the fervent response among Pashtuns nationwide, the movement changed its name to the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement, with Ahmed adopting the moniker “Pashteen”. Since then, it has held massive rallies, despite police raids and arrests of activists, in all four provincial capitals and in hard-hit Pashtun-majority areas such as Swat.

The Pashtun Tahafuz Movement does not focus directly on FATA reform. “There are other organisations and forums for FATA reforms, but what the movement is raising no one was discussing”, said Mohsin Dawar, then a top movement leader and Peshawar high court lawyer. “Enforced disappearances are not just a FATA issue, they are also an issue in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and people are getting picked up in Swat and Bannu”. Yet by highlighting the military’s role in the tribal belt and demanding an end to its use of jihadist proxies, the movement is pointing to the major impediments to stabilising those areas. As a common slogan at the movement’s demonstrations goes: “Yeh kesi dehshatgardi hai, gis key pechey wardi hai (roughly translated, “What kind of terrorism is this, that has the man in uniform behind it?”). “All this generation has seen is war”, said Pashteen. “Unlike the maliks, it is not afraid to confront military officials”.

The movement’s leadership comprises educated urban youth from across the country and young professionals from FATA and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Even before it gathered steam, FATA’s youth groups, including women, were demanding the region’s merger with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with full political and constitutional rights, and challenging the authority and legitimacy of maliks perceived to be “pro-Frontier Crimes Regulation”. Conflict-induced displacement has played a role in mobilising FATA civil society. Some displaced FATA youth formed or joined community-based organisations. Women IDPs participated more in the socio-economic mainstream, obtaining national identity cards and opening bank accounts for the first time to benefit from assistance packages. Many now demand access to health care, skills training and credit so that they can earn independent livelihoods and participate in local public life.

The Pashtun Tahafuz Movement’s core leadership of around twenty is all men, but Pashtun women participate in its rallies in large numbers. A Pashtun woman activist said, “when the elders said that the movement is dishonouring the [Pashtun] culture by having women at the rallies, we said, ‘what about the dishonour to the culture by the [Pakistani] Taliban and the military?’” Another prominent (male) activist said, “what about women who are humiliated at checkposts and thrown out of their homes – was that not dishonourable?” A movement rally in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Swat district was well attended by women because, according to Sana Ejaz, an activist who canvassed women to participate, “so many of them have sons and husbands missing. [There are many] conflict-affected households, and that had a big impact on women”. In a widely circulated speech during a March rally in Balochistan, a woman activist implored women to demand their rights and “and rise shoulder to shoulder with the men. Only then will this national movement go forward”.

Technology, too, plays an important role. “In the old days, a person would write about a convention and activists would photocopy it and pass it around”, said movement leader Dawar. “Now, everyone is connected. Without social media, the movement would have been nothing”. With videos of speeches circulating on social media, amid a military-imposed media blackout of movement coverage, one affiliated activist described the rallies as “alternative reporting, from the stage”.

The military has responded with a mix of coercion and attempts at compromise, including allowing use of the national identity card for travel to and within FATA, as opposed to the Watan card (identification cards for IDP compensation), as was previously required; closing some checkposts, removing some unexploded ordnance and demining some areas; releasing around 300 detainees from internment centres; and engaging in dialogue with the protesters. The movement’s leaders and activists believe that the military expected that the release of a few hundred detainees would placate it. But accounts of mistreatment of those released have fuelled demands for an end to enforced disappearances.

With the movement gaining strength, military leaders have accused it of being backed by anti-Pakistan countries and forces, an implicit reference to India. In April, army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa said the military would not allow “engineered protests” to reverse the gains of its counter-terrorism operations in FATA and cautioned the nation not to forget the sacrifices of “real heroes”. A Peshawar rally the same month, widely believed to be state-backed, condemned the movement and praised the armed forces for protecting the country, amid chants of “Pakistan Zindabad” (long live Pakistan).

One Pashtun political party, the Balochistan-based Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party, has strongly backed Pashteen’s movement. But the movement has created a dilemma for it and other nationalist Pashtun parties, including the Awami National Party. Large numbers of grassroots party cadres are also Pashtun Tahafuz Movement activists. “Political parties have gone into the background, and [non-party] people taken the lead”, said a senior Awami National Party leader and former senator. Yet all major political parties, Pashtun or otherwise, and even the military, have had to respond to a galvanised civil society’s demands for constitutional protections and freedoms in FATA.

Reforming FATA

FATA reform was part of the National Action Plan against terrorism formulated after the December 2014 Peshawar Army Public School attack, an implicit recognition that FATA’s tenuous governance had contributed in large part to the spread of militancy. This effort built on an existing consensus among almost all major parties on the importance of extending the state’s reach and dispelling local grievances in FATA.

In November 2015, then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif established a committee on FATA reforms, chaired by his foreign affairs adviser Sartaj Aziz. The committee produced a report in August 2016, recommending “a gradual and phased approach”, including abolishing the Frontier Crimes Regulations and merging FATA with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The five-year transitional period foresaw the return of IDPs, reconstruction, socio-economic development and local elections as precursors to legal and constitutional reforms, while retaining Article 247 of the constitution. As with past reforms, the military resisted even this modest proposal, refusing to cede control over this strategic territory.

Pressure from FATA’s civil society, in large part propelled by the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement’s grassroots mobilisation, produced momentum for more comprehensive reform, persuading even the military that it would have to loosen its hold on the tribal areas. According to a senior Pashtun nationalist, “without any doubt the movement’s pressure has been the most decisive factor in forcing all players to stop blocking reforms … the security establishment, which was initially hesitant about the merger of FATA in Pakhtunkhwa, reconsidered in view of the ever-deepening alienation among the Pashtun youth of FATA. It was afraid of the backlash to the flawed state policies”.

In late May 2018, the week they were ending their five-year term, the national and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies passed the 31st amendment that repealed Article 247 of the constitution and merged FATA with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Article 247’s repeal allows those assemblies to legislate for FATA and extends the jurisdiction of the higher judiciary to the tribal areas, with any new government action, law or regulation reviewable by the Peshawar high court and Supreme Court. Elections in the tribal agencies (renamed “districts”) for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa legislature are to be held within a year of the 25 July general elections. Local polls are planned for October this year.

FATA’s merger with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa appears now to be irreversible; no party is likely to propose an amendment to turn back the clock because of the broad-based support the reform enjoys. But the region’s incorporation into the political, legal and constitutional mainstream has been adversely affected by the final presidential ordinance promulgated under Article 247, replacing the Frontier Crimes Regulations with an equally draconian FATA Interim Governance Regulation. The differences between the two are cosmetic. The senior-most federal bureaucrat in a tribal district (formerly tribal agency) is now called a deputy commissioner, rather than a political agent, but retains many of the same powers, including the authority to arrest men between the ages of sixteen and 65 who “are acting in a hostile, subversive or offensive manner towards the State or any person residing within the settled area of Pakistan”.

The government has started building judicial complexes – consisting of courthouses, bar councils and other facilities – in all tribal agencies. The Peshawar high court has set a requirement for 52 judicial officers to be deployed in FATA within six months of its merger with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Yet, according to the interim regulation, federal bureaucrats and deputy and assistant commissioners will continue to perform judicial functions, a provision which violates the constitution. Assistant commissioners will rely on their handpicked “council of elders” to adjudicate civil cases, on the basis of rewaj (customary law), a patriarchal set of rules that affirms group, not individual, rights. Customary law can even justify violence against women, such as in Kurram, where the codified rewaj permits the sale or exchange of women to settle disputes. Assistant commissioners designated as “judges” will also try criminal cases, with the authority to detain or pardon alleged offenders.

Political parties, backed by civil society, had thwarted an earlier bid in parliament (proposed by the Aziz-led FATA Reforms Committee) to replace the Frontier Crimes Regulations with a Rewaj Act. Mohammad Ali Wazir, a Pashtun Tahafuz Movement leader whose immediate family members were killed for opposing the TTP, said: “There are so many different power centres – maliks, political agents, militants, army, Frontier Corps, FCR, rewaj, each with a different set of rules – and all we get is chaos. Give us one system. Don’t have us running around like wild cats”. The onus of repealing the Interim Governance Regulation is now on the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-led Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assembly since the president, after signing the 31st amendment, no longer has jurisdiction over FATA.

Since Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s 2017 police act now applies to the tribal belt, the federal government should disband the tribal levies. Tehreek-i-Insaf’s provincial government should incorporate their personnel into the provincial police force, and also provide the police with the resources it needs for its additional responsibilities in the tribal belt. FATA residents, who will now vote for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assembly, will hold the provincial government accountable if they do not see improvements in the security of the tribal areas. Indeed, delaying FATA’s full political, administrative and legal integration into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa will further estrange many inhabitants of the tribal areas, who have little patience left after decades of living as second-class citizens in Pakistan. Failing to respond to FATA’s civil society demands for full citizenship rights and protections will erode the authority of the national and provincial governments and could allow militants to profit from the resultant alienation.

Moving Forward

The 31st amendment is a welcome step forward. In the words of one major daily newspaper’s editorial: “History has been made. FATA is no more … the people of the region now have formal access to the constitutional and political rights that are legally available to all citizens of Pakistan”. Yet much more needs to be done to end FATA’s political and economic isolation, reverse policies that have eroded rights and livelihoods, and prevent militants from taking advantage of disaffection. So long as the military maintains arbitrary restrictions on movement, elected representatives, journalists and civil society activists will be unable to assess the implementation of reforms.

The military and civil bureaucracies still seem unwilling to allow such access or even to let locals assemble freely, and instead appear bent on suppressing peaceful dissent. In early June, Pashtun Tahafuz Movement leader Mohsin Dawar was banned from visiting his hometown in North Waziristan for three months on the grounds that he was “acting in a manner prejudicial to public peace and tranquillity”. But the protesters at his rally had been peaceful, unlike the pro-state militia that attacked movement activists in South Waziristan’s administrative headquarters, Wana, killing two and injuring 25. Rather than discipline the militiamen, the state temporarily banned peaceful protests.

Superior court jurisdiction will likely check FATA’s unaccountable civil bureaucracy, whose actions can now be challenged before independent judges rather than executive tribunals. But the judiciary will have to prove it is capable of upholding the constitutional rights and protections now extended to FATA’s residents, including freedoms of movement, speech and association.

Moreover, the federal and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governments should take urgent steps to develop the region, which has the worst socio-economic indicators in the country, and has been devastated by conflict. There is a major plan for multi-year funding of FATA’s development but no guarantee that the money will arrive. The incoming National Financial Commission should quickly reach agreement on such funding. Islamabad and Peshawar should also consult FATA stakeholders on reconstruction, rehabilitation and development, and ensure the availability of fiscal resources.

Conclusion

The previous federal and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governments fulfilled a major commitment to ending FATA’s constitutional limbo. Their successors cannot blame insecurity or seek other justifications for delaying FATA’s integration into the mainstream. To be sure, the task will require resources, further reforms and, above all, stamina in the face of bureaucratic resistance. Though the principle of integration is now firmly established, the civil and military bureaucracies and the tribal elite will likely seek only partial reforms that retain the current governing structure. Yet, as the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement’s popularity demonstrates, those bureaucracies’ authority in FATA has waned. With public expectations raised by the merger and the repeal of Article 247, stalling would likely provoke significant backlash.

If the civil bureaucracy is averse to losing the benefits of the status quo, the military is averse to loosening its grip upon a territory that it still uses to promote what it perceives as Pakistan’s national security interests, including through support for the Afghan Taliban and local militant proxies. But opportunities for breaking its hold are greater today than at any time before, given the 31st amendment, and civil society’s demands for an end to conflict in the tribal belt, which have broad backing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and indeed countrywide. If the Tehreek-i-Insaf government prevaricates, it will squander a critical opportunity to strengthen its own standing in FATA and to stabilise the conflict-prone region.

UNITED NATIONS, Sep 27 2018 (IPS) - Reversing years of progress, global hunger is on the rise once again and one of the culprits is clear: conflict.

A high-level side event during the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly brought together, U.N. officials, governments, and civil society to assess and recommend solutions to the pressing issue of conflict-based food insecurity.

“The use of hunger as a weapon of war is a war crime. Yet, in some conflict settings, parties to conflict use siege tactics, weaponise starvation of civilians, or impede life-saving humanitarian supplies to reach those desperately in need."" -- Action Against Hunger’s CEO Veronique Andrieux



“Conflict-related hunger is one of the most visible manifestations to human suffering emerging from war…this suffering is preventable and thus all the more tragic,” said United States’ Agency for International Development’s (USAID) administrator Mark Green.

According to the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2018, the number of hungry people increased to over 820 million in 2017 from approximately 804 million in 2016, levels unseen for almost a decade.

The Global Report on Food Crises found that almost 124 million people across 51 countries faced crisis-level food insecurity in 2017, 11 million more than the year before.

Conflict was identified as the key driver in 60 percent of those cases.

The report predicts that conflict and insecurity will continue to drive food crises around the world, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.

Panellists during the “Breaking the Cycle Between Conflict and Hunger” side-event noted food insecurity is often a tell-tale sign of future potential conflict and can lead to further insecurity.

“Building resilience…is indeed fundamental for strengthening social cohesion, preventing conflict, and avoiding forced migration. Without that, there is no peace,” said Food and Agriculture Organization of the U.N. (FAO) director-general Jose Graziano da Silva.

World Food Programme’s executive director David Beasley echoed similar sentiments, stating: “If you don’t have food security, you’re not going to have any other security. So we have to address the fundamentals.”

In an effort to address conflict-based hunger and the worrisome reversal in progress, the U.N. Security Council for the first time recognised that armed conflict is closely linked to food insecurity and the risk of famine earlier this year.

The group unanimously adopted resolution 2417 condemning the use of starvation as a weapon of war and urged all parties to conflict to comply with international law and grand unimpeded humanitarian access.

While participants lauded the historic resolution, they also highlighted that it alone is not enough.

“Humanitarian action and technical solutions can mitigate the effects of food crises but we desperately need political solutions and we need to implement [resolution] 2417 if we are to reverse the shameful, upwards trajectory of hunger primarily resulting from conflict,” said Action Against Hunger’s CEO Veronique Andrieux.

In order to prevent food crises and thus conflicts from escalating, the international community must take a holistic, preventative approach and strengthen the humanitarian-development nexus.

Beasley pointed to the case of Syria where a seven-year long conflict has destroyed agricultural infrastructure, local economies, and supply chains and has left over six million food-insecure.

“The cost for us to feed a Syrian in Syria was about 50 cents a day which is almost double the normal cost because it is a war zone. If that same Syrian was in Berlin, it would be euros per day,” he told attendees.

“It is a better investment if we address the root cause as opposed to reacting after the fact,” Beasley added.

Before the long-running war began, Syria faced a drought which caused a spike in prices and led to food shortages. Many theorise that it was these very conditions that set off the civil war in 2011.

“Early action response to early warning is critical. We cannot wait for the conflict to start. We know that it will start,” said Graziano da Silva.

And it is data that can help establish early detection and prevent such crises, Graziano da Silva along with the other panelists stressed.

The Global Network against Food Crises (GNFC), which publish the Global Report on Food Crises, brings together regional and national data and analysis to provide a comprehensive picture of food insecurity globally.

It was the GNFC that enabled agencies to mitigate food crises and avert famine in northern Nigeria and South Sudan.

Just prior to the side event, FAO and the European Commission partnered to boost resilience and tackle hunger by contributing over USD70 million.

Panelists stressed the importance of such partnerships in addressing and responding to the complex issue of conflict-based food insecurity.

“At the ground, when we work together, it’s not only that we do better…we are much more efficient,” Graziano da Silva said.

Andrieux highlighted the need to uphold respect for international humanitarian law and that the U.N. and member states must hold all parties to the conflict to account.

“The use of hunger as a weapon of war is a war crime. Yet, in some conflict settings, parties to conflict use siege tactics, weaponise starvation of civilians, or impede life-saving humanitarian supplies to reach those desperately in need,” she said.

“We believe this is failing humanity,” Andrieux added.

Green pointed to the conflict in South Sudan where fighters have blocked desperately needed humanitarian assistance and attacked aid workers.

The African nation was recently ranked the most dangerous for aid workers for the third consecutive year.

“All the parties to the conflict are culpable, all the parties to the conflict are guilty, and they have all failed themselves, their people, and humanity,” Green told attendees.

Though the task of tackling conflict-based hunger is not easy, the solutions are there. What is now required is commitment and collective action, panelists said.

“All of us working together with effective solutions—we can truly end world hunger,” Beasley said.","The Global Report on Food Crises found that almost 124 million people across 51 countries faced crisis-level food insecurity in 2017, 11 million more than the year before.

Obama on McCain: We are all in his debt

McCain will be buried next to his 'wingman'

WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 1: Cindy McCain looks on as a joint military service casket team carries the casket of the late Senator John McCain following his funeral service at the Washington National Cathedral, September 1, 2018 in Washington, DC. Former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush delivered eulogies for McCain in front of the 2,500 invited guests. McCain will be buried on Sunday at the U.S. Naval Academy Cemetery.

(CNN) —

The idea of being buried next to a friend likely never crosses the mind of most Americans.

But for Sen. John McCain and Adm. Chuck Larson and many others, the decision to rest eternally by the side of a fellow military academy graduate is not an unusual choice.

McCain, who died just over a week ago at 81, was buried Sunday afternoon next to Larson, his US Naval Academy classmate and friend, near a bluff that overlooks the confluence of the Severn River and College Creek in Annapolis, Maryland. The ceremony at the academy’s nearly seven-acre cemetery was private.

The cemetery reflects other such friendships.

Close to where McCain rests are the remains of another US Navy hero, William B. Cushing, a daredevil officer who led units that were essentially the Navy SEALS of the Civil War, undertaking bold raids and sinking a Confederate ironclad by detonating a torpedo at close range. Near Cushing’s elaborate sarcophagus are the graves for two of his friends who attended the academy and were killed during the Civil War.

Although he has not been able to find documents, James Cheevers, retired curator at the Naval Academy Museum, said he believes Cushing, who died at 32 nearly a decade after the war, may have had his pals reinterred in Annapolis so they could be together.

Others who have chosen to be beside friends include World War II Fleet Adm. Chester Nimitz, who is buried near high-ranking academy comrades at Golden Gate National Cemetery just outside San Francisco.

“This is not uncommon,” said Cheevers.

Larson and McCain were classmates in the graduating class of 1958. But while Larson graduated toward the top of the class, McCain graduated fifth from the bottom.

The two forged a bond in youth that withstood the test of time, personal and family sacrifice and, in McCain’s case, spending more than five years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam.

Sarah Larson, who was married to Chuck for 52 years before he died in 2014, said she first learned 20 years ago that McCain and her husband wanted to be buried next to one another. The admiral, who twice served as superintendent at the academy, had selected four plots for the officers and their spouses.

“Chuck came home one day and he said, ‘I picked out my grave, and I went ‘Oh, OK,’” Sarah Larson told CNN’s John Berman in an interview on “New Day” on Friday. “So I just said, ‘That’s fine, good,’ and he said, ‘By the way, John is going to be next to me.’”

After graduation, McCain and Larson earned their wings together at the Naval Air Station Pensacola and shared living quarters during their advanced flight training at NAS Corpus Christi, before Larson entered submarine service.

“Chuck has his wingman back now,” Sarah Larson said.

About 500 midshipmen lined the route from the academy chapel to the cemetery Sunday, as McCain’s casket was carried by a horse-drawn caisson. Relatives walked behind. Navy jets executed a “missing man” formation in the blue sky in honor of the former military aviator.

In October 2017, just three months after his cancer diagnosis was made public, McCain spoke at the Naval Academy and began his talk by admitting to breaking rules during his time there.

“My superiors didn’t hold me in very high esteem in those days,” the senator said. “Their disapproval was measured in the hundreds of miles of extra duty I marched in my time here.”

Cheevers said the midshipmen “love him (and) anybody that gave the academy a hard time, particularly in the plebe year.”

(Cushing – the Civil War hero – also was known as a prankster and maverick. But, unlike McCain, he was forced to leave the academy and did not graduate.)

The McCain procession on Sunday passed other US Navy heroes, many of whom died in combat or in military accidents. Among those buried at the academy are Adm. James Stockdale and Fleet Adm. Ernest King, chief of naval operations during World War II.

To some, it may be ironic that McCain was laid to rest at an institution with which he admitted to having a “complicated relationship.”

Cheevers, the retired museum curator, said the Arizona senator’s description of his time at Annapolis speaks for many academy graduates.

“Most of them … find it very difficult while they are there to accept the place, to be accustomed to it and be happy,” Cheevers said. He has observed that most form a strong attachment to the academy after they leave it.

Over the years, McCain came to appreciate his Naval Academy education and lessons about courage, humility and sacrifice.

“My appreciation for those lessons and for the friendships I made here bring me back often,” he told midshipmen last year. “So does my gratitude for the life of adventure the Naval Academy prepared me for, and for the privilege of being a bit player in the story of America that the Navy made possible.”

INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND GAMBIANS ABROAD OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE GAMBIA ON THE CONTINENT-WIDE COMMEMORATION OF THE AFRICAN UNION DAY

THEME: “AFRICAN UNION: ACHIEVEMENTS, CHALLENGES AND NEXT STEPS”

Fellow Gambians,

Today, 9th September, 2018 the African Union Day is being celebrated throughout the African continent and the Diaspora. This is indeed a special occasion to collectively reflect upon and celebrate the successes of our continental organisation as well as analyse the challenges facing the African Union as we strive to achieve the objectives of AGENDA 2063 – the blueprint for the long-term development vision of the African continent anchored on our pan-African aspirations for a fully integrated, developed, prosperous and peaceful African continent.

My address today will therefore focus on the achievements that have been registered since the African Union evolved from its predecessor, the Organisation of African Unity; the role that the Gambia has played and continues to play in the attainment of continental goals and the challenges that need to be addressed if we are to overcome the constraints and impediments in the realisation of our noble goals and objectives towards making Africa a force to be reckoned with in the comity of nations, both politically and economically.

It was in pursuit of these noble aspirations that the Organisation of African Unity was transformed into the African Union. This evolution would ensure that the African Union has the legal, administrative and political impetuses of fast-track the implementation of the integration and development agendas of the African continent. Accordingly, the Constitutive Act that has been adopted by Member States, Including The Gambia, reaffirms the continents quest for democratisation, gender empowerment, good governance and accountability, preventive diplomacy, peaceful resolution of conflicts and full participation of all Africans, including those in the Diaspora in the political, financial and economic governance of the African continent.

Fellow Gambians,

As I mentioned earlier, the African Union blueprint for long term development has been enshrined in the document entitled AGENDA 2063. Since its adoption in 2015, all the integration and development programmes of the African Union are synchronised towards achieving its goals, which includes the following:

A prosperous African based on inclusive growth and sustainable development An integrated continent, politically united and based on the ideals of Pan-Africanism and the vision of Africa’s Renaissance An African of good governance, democracy, respect for human rights, justice and the rule of law A peaceful and secure Africa An Africa with a strong cultural identity, common heritage, shared values and ethics An Africa whose development is people -driven, relying on the potential of African people, especially its women and youth, and caring for children Africa as a strong, united and influential global player and partner

These are the seven principal aspirations of AGENDA 2063 and several programmes have been designed to actualise them. Amongst them is the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement which was signed by the majority of the Member States of the African Union including The Gambia at the 10th Extraordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union held in March 2018 in Kigali, Rwanda. The Agreement is an important mechanism for the full financial and commercial integration of the African continent. It is a fact that financial and commercial integration of the African continent cannot be attained if there are restrictions on the movement of peoples and goods within Africa. Therefore free and unhindered mobility of African citizens within the continent is indispensable to the realisation of the objectives of the Free Trade Area. It was for this reason that the Kigali Extraordinary Summit also adopted the Protocol on the Free Movement of Persons, Right of Residence and Right of Establishment as a clear expression of intent in instituting a regime of freer mobility of peoples and goods throughout the continent. The Gambia government is working on the processes to ensure that the necessary actions and policies are put in place for the implementation of the Protocol.

In the same vein, the African Union is spearheading a move towards greater integration in infrastructural cooperation and development in road, maritime and air transportation. With regards to the latter I would like to highlight the launching in January this year of the Single African Air Transport Market. This initiative is expected to accelerate the momentum in decreasing the legal, financial and infrastructural bottlenecks to a fully developed and integrated African aviation sector. A liberalised aviation industry will make air travel more efficient and reduce cost of airfares which would be a boost toward the desired goal of economic and commercial integration of the continent. The Gambia will seek to harness its strategic location in West Africa by taking full advantage of the opportunities offered by the Single African Air Transport Market.

Sustainable peace on the African continent is an important pillar to realising the goals of Agenda 2063. Through the African Peace and Security Architecture and other important initiatives such as “Silencing the Guns by 2020” and the African Union Amnesty Month, the sustainable peace agenda of the African continent is being pursued rigorously. The African Union is also playing an important coordinating role to ensure that the peace initiatives of the Regional Economic Communities and other Ad-hoc mechanisms are successful.

I will now turn to the relations between The Gambia and the African Union and the important role we continue to play in the continental body. For The Gambia, the African Union is a strategic partner in our foreign policy posture and orientation. We continue to be unswervingly committed to the ideals of the Union and shall strive to contribute towards achieving the goals and aspirations of the African Union. In return The Gambia has received and benefited from the strong support of the African Union during the political impasse of 2016 that threatened to usurp the democratic will of the Gambian people expressed in a free and fair electoral process. Through the support of the African Union and other institutions, the Gambian people were made the rightful and sovereign arbitrator of their political destiny.

In the “New Gambia”, the African Union continues to provide valuable support to the Gambia government’s reform programmes. A team of African Experts will soon be dispatched to the country for a period of 12 months to provide technical support to the reform programmes of government in the security and judicial sectors.

The Gambia continues to be the proud host to one of the key organs of the African Union in the promotion of good governance, accountability, respect for rule of law and human rights. The location of the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights in The Gambia is something that we take pride in because it is a manifestation of our democratic credentials and commitments to the respect for the human rights of our citizens and of peoples all over the world. The Gambia Government will continue to provide the right environment that will enable the Commission to be successful in the execution of its important mandate. Efforts will be intensified to implement the construction of a permanent headquarters for the Commission with adequate facilities and amenities commensurate with its status as an important institution of the African Union.

The Gambia has been actively participating in the efforts toward a peaceful, fully integrated and developed African Union. We continue to participate in AU sessions and make robust and meaningful contributions at various platforms, be it at the level of Permanent Representatives Committee, the Executive Council or the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union. At the last Ordinary Session of the Assembly held in Nouakchott, Mauritania and before that at the Extraordinary Summit in Kigali, Rwanda, His Excellency President Adama Barrow made several interventions on various agenda items. His statements were delivered in a considered and dignified manner and received genuine acclamations from his colleagues. President Barrow also had bilateral meetings with other Heads of State and Government thereby raising the diplomatic profile of The Gambia to a higher pedestal.

As a manifestation of this trend, The Gambia will be hosting in 2019 the 3rd Ordinary Session of the Ministerial Session of the Specialized Technical Committee on Migration, Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons. Fifty-five (55) African ministers are expected in The Gambia to discuss the way forward in fully implementing the migration agenda of the African continent and the plight of refugees and internally displaced persons. This Ministerial Meeting will be held at a moment when the African Union Theme of the Year for 2019 is “The Year of Refugees, Returnees and Internally Displaced Persons: Towards Durable Solutions to Forced Displacement in Africa”. As a consequence, efforts will be made to ensure that the outcomes of this Ministerial Meeting significantly influence the trajectory of the implementation of the 2019 Theme of the Year.

The Gambia currently chairs the Policy Sub-Committee on the Special Emergency Fund on Drought and Famine. This Sub-committee has the important mandate of giving financial support to African countries that are affected by drought and famine. Important activities are envisaged under the aegis of this Sub-Committee that would improve the versatility of the African Union in addressing both the causes and the effects of drought and famine on the African continent.

The Gambia is widely recognised as an important troop contributing nation in the maintenance of pace and security in Africa. Our gallant men and women continue to demonstrate selfless sacrifice and valor in the discharge of their duties in the various theatres of peace support operations on the African continent.

At the headquarters of the African Union in Addis Ababa and other cities in the African continent where the African Union has institutions and offices, I would like to acknowledge and recognize the immense contributions of Gambian nationals working with AU are making to the achievements of the Union. As a government and a nation we are always proud and delighted to witness the moments when their professionalism is recognised and validated.

Fellow Gambians,

I have highlighted the achievements and successes of the African Union since it was established and made reference to the contributions made by The Gambia in these endeavors. I have also mentioned the aspirations of our leaders and peoples to transform Africa into a powerful, peaceful and economically integrated continent. These aspirations are encapsulated in agenda 2063 which some cynics and ill-informed observers have called mere slogans. Far from sloganeering, the agenda 2063 blueprint is a well worked out document predicated on sober and objective analysis of the problems of our continent. Its adoption and the drive to implement the policies and programmes enshrined therein demonstrate the commitment and determination of our countries and peoples to build the “Africa we want.”","DR. MAMADOU TANGARA, MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS,INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND GAMBIANS ABROAD OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE GAMBIA ON THE CONTINENT-WIDE COMMEMORATION OF THE AFRICAN UNION DAYTHEME: “AFRICAN UNION: ACHIEVEMENTS, CHALLENGES AND NEXT STEPS”Fellow Gambians,Today, 9th September, 2018 the African Union Day is being celebrated throughout the African continent and the Diaspora.
It was in pursuit of these noble aspirations that the Organisation of African Unity was transformed into the African Union.
The Agreement is an important mechanism for the full financial and commercial integration of the African continent.

Participants underscored synergies between the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union’s (AU) Agenda 2063, and recognized the importance of collaborative efforts between the UN and the AU to strengthen multilateralism.



The ADS was launched by the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa (OSAA), and took place from 17-18 October 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US, alongside the UNGA’s debate on the development of Africa, on 19 October. The two-day series replaces the UN’s annual Africa Week, which had taken place since 2010.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres underscored inclusive, sustainable development in Africa as both “a goal unto itself” and “also a leading tool to prevent conflict and crises.” He observed the region’s progress towards improved governance, stability and resilience. At the same time, Guterres recognized that parts of Africa remain fragile, and expressed concern about high levels of debt in some countries, volatile financial markets and looming trade conflicts. He noted that climate change impacts will “create additional strains” in the future.

Speakers also underscored synergies between the 2030 Agenda and the AU’s Agenda 2063. Guterres observed that the approaches and policies of the UN and the AU “are more closely aligned than ever before” and both call for a prosperous, peaceful and secure continent based on good governance, human rights and the rule of law and aim to leave no one behind.

On gender equality, participants welcomed Ethiopia’s new government cabinet, which has achieved full gender parity among its ministers. The UN Secretary-General identified the AU as a crucial partner in the Spotlight Initiative, which aims to end violence against women and girls by 2030.

On climate change, the UN Secretary-General called for a “huge leap in investment” to implement the Paris Agreement on climate change in Africa, and called on developed countries to deliver on both finance and technology commitments.

On SDG follow-up and review, UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) President Inga Rhonda King said the July 2019 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) will focus on the SDGs related to climate change (Goal 13), education (Goal 4), inequality (Goal 10), justice (Goal 16), jobs (Goal 8) and partnerships (Goal 17). She called on African countries to share their lessons learned to ensure progress on the 2030 Agenda.

Speakers underscored linkages between peace, security and development, with several recognizing Africa’s contribution to UN peacekeeping missions. The UN Special Adviser on Africa, Bience Gawanas, said the region seeks to “achieve peace, prosperity and socio-economic transformation,” and urged all actors to respond to Africa’s challenges in a coherent, coordinated manner. UN Security Council President Sacha Sergio Llorenty (Bolivia) highlighted the role of young people and women in peace and development efforts in Africa. He called for high-level political support to ensure their meaningful participation.

Speakers also welcomed the African Continental Free Trade Area (ACFTA) and recognized the importance of financing for Africa to achieve the 2030 Agenda, Agenda 2063 and the Paris Agreement. The dialogue also reflected on reform processes within both the UN and the AU.

80,https://reliefweb.int/report/zimbabwe/global-study-spotlights-peace-driving-force-achieve-sdgs,"Thu, 04 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",ReliefWeb,Global study spotlights peace as driving force to achieve SDGs - Zimbabwe,"04 October 2018, Harare – The Vice President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Hon. Kembo Mohadi who oversees peace and reconciliation initiatives in Government has launched today the Pathways for Peace global study together with UN Resident Coordinator Mr Bishow Parajuli, World Bank Country Manager Mrs. Mukami Kariuki, and Ambassador of Sweden to Zimbabwe HE. Sofia Calltorp here in the capital, Harare.

The study launched under the theme, “Pathways for Peace: Inclusive Approaches to Preventing Violent Conflict” brought together around 80 representatives from Government, UN, Development Partners, Civil Society Organisations and the Media. The report is a joint United Nations and World Bank study published in 2018 to look at how development processes can better interact with diplomacy and mediation, security and other tools to prevent conflict from becoming violent.

Commending the Government and the People of Zimbabwe for embedding principles of peace, reconciliation and social cohesion as constitutional values and development imperatives, UN Resident Coordinator, Bishow Parajuli said, “the launch of the Pathways for Peace report comes at a key moment in Zimbabwe – where the cabinet has approved a two-year transitional stabilization programme for the country, which recognizes and prioritizes reforms related to the rule of law, access to justice, constitutional alignment, social protection, reconciliation, peace and national unity.”

Highlighting that the articulation of national unity, peace, social cohesion and reconciliation as the bedrock for sustainable social and economic development in Zimbabwe, the Hon. Vice President Mohadi said: “whilst sustainable development is our ultimate goal, the need to build sustainable peace architecture is a key enabler for the country’s sustainable development.”

The launch put a spotlight on the interconnectedness of Peace and Development - “no development without peace and no peace without development” – and the centrality of UN engagement to promote peace in line with the UN Charter across the globe.

Underlining that prevention of conflict is always better than cure and a pathway to enduring peace, Mrs. Mukami Kariuki, World Bank Country Manager for Zimbabwe said, “developing an enabling environment that seeks to prevent and resolve conflicts in all spheres – social, economic and political is essential and the World Bank looks forward to further dialogue that would contextualize the recommendations of the Pathways for Peace report.”

Stressing the critical importance of inclusivity in peacebuilding efforts, H.E. Sofia Calltorp, Ambassador of Sweden said: “Women are key agents in building more resilient and peaceful societies. It is therefore of fundamental importance that we all make an effort to include more women in peacebuilding and developmental processes.”

The study underlines that the resurgence of violent conflict in recent years has caused immense human suffering, at enormous social and economic cost. This has increasingly become an obstacle to achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. These goals aim to end poverty, hunger, inequality, and achieve quality education, universal health, water and sanitation, gender equality, economic progress and environmental protection for all by 2030. Of the total 169 targets of the SDGs, 36 targets are directly related and necessary to achieve peace, justice and inclusion. The commitment of these targets reflects the role of peace as an indispensable condition of sustainable development. To achieve the SDGs, the report alludes on the need to build and maintain strong global, regional, national and local/grassroot partnership.

There is also a strong business case, beyond human suffering for investing in prevention and maintaining peace. Noting the wellbeing of everyone would be served well by preventing conflict and directing resources to socio-economic progress and environmental prudence in line with the SDGs, Mr. Jago Salmon, Advisor to UN Peace Building Support Office and one of the authors of the study said, “Prevention investments in four countries experiencing high levels of violence would save the affected countries and the international community USD 34 billion per year.”

The report shows that global, regional and national development and economic strategies need to go beyond incremental changes to systemic transformation. The report further makes a case for capable institutions to be developed to balance individual and collective rights and freedoms at all levels.

The Pathways for Peace reviews the experience of different countries and institutions to highlight elements that have contributed to peace. Central to these efforts is the need to address grievances around exclusion from access to power, opportunity and security.

The report reiterates that member States hold the primary responsibility for prevention, but to be effective, underlines the need for the involvement of civil society, the private sector, regional and international organizations.

Brussels, Belgium

23 October 2018

On 23 October 2018, the European Union (EU) Political and Security Committee (EU PSC) and the African Union (AU) Peace and Security Council (AU PSC) held their 11th Annual Joint Consultative Meeting in Brussels, Belgium as part of their regular dialogue within the framework of the AU – EU partnership. The meeting was co-chaired by Ambassador Sofie From-Emmesberger, Permanent Chair of the EU PSC and H.E. Ambassador Lazare Makayat Safouesse (Republic of Congo), Chairperson of the AU PSC for the month of October 2018. The Joint Meeting brought together Ambassadors of EU Member States and AU PSC Member States, as well as Senior Officials from the EU External Action Service and Commission, and from the AU Commission.

The Joint Consultative Meeting was preceded by the 4th Joint Retreat of the EU PSC and the AU PSC, held on 22 October 2018, which provided the opportunity for an informal exchange of views on enhanced cooperation on aspects discussed in multilateral fora and sustainable financing of AU-led peace operations authorized by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and on cooperation on conflict prevention and mediation, on following up on the outcome of the 5th AU-EU-Summit in Abidjan in November 2017, the implementation of the AU-EU Memorandum of Understanding on Peace, Security and Governance signed in May 2018.

The EU PSC and the AU PSC underlined the importance of effective multilateralism and the rules-based international order with the United Nations at its core. They acknowledged the importance of strengthened AU-EU-UN cooperation and invited further reflection on how to follow-up on the high-level meeting of AU-EU-UN principals which took place in September, in the margins of the UN General Assembly.

The EU PSC and the AU PSC acknowledged the importance to translate their political cooperation in the area of conflict prevention into concrete initiatives such as joint field visits, joint sessions, developing shared understanding and analysis on crisis situations, as well as investigate avenues for joint early action. They underlined the important role of women and youth as active players in conflict prevention and mediation.

The discussion during the Joint Consultative Meeting focused on progress made on resolving conflict/crisis situations and threats to peace and stability in the Mali/Sahel, the Central African Republic (CAR), the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), South Sudan, Somalia and Burundi.

On the situation in Mali and the Sahel, the EU PSC and the AU PSC welcomed the peaceful holding of the presidential elections in Mali which took place on 29 July and 12 August 2018 and called upon all Malian stakeholders to work together to promote sustainable and inclusive peace and development in their country. The EU PSC and AU PSC noted the renewed commitment of the Malian signatory parties to accelerate the implementation of the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in Mali signed in 2015 as demonstrated by the signature of a Pact for Peace between Mali and the United Nations on 15 October 2018. However, they expressed concern over the slow implementation of the Agreement, in particular provisions relating to institutional measures, security arrangement and the development for the northern part of the country. They recalled the importance of the Agreement to achieve lasting peace and reconciliation in Mali. In particular, they stressed the need for concrete and urgent progress in the areas of Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) of former combatants in order to restore security to the northern region, facilitate the work of the interim authorities and allow for local development, as well as for the return of refugees and displaced persons. They commended the key role of Algeria in supporting the peace process in Mali as Head of the Mediation efforts and as Chair of the Comité de Suivi (CSA), and called for more inclusivity of women and civil society organizations in its implementation. They urged the Malian authorities to work towards a large political and social consensus with a view to undertaking the necessary reforms to tackle Mali's main institutional, security and development challenges, in order to improve the livelihoods of all its citizens, and re-affirmed their willingness to support the Malian Government in these efforts.

The EU PSC and the AU PSC expressed deep concern over the continued extension of terrorist attacks in the Sahel region, spilling over from northern Mali to the centre part of the country and into neighboring countries, and expressed particular concern over the deteriorating security situation in Burkina Faso. They strongly condemned the terrorist attacks against the civilian populations, the armed and security forces of Mali, the countries of the region, and the international forces of the UN Multidimensional Integrated Mission for Stabilization in Mali (MINUSMA) and Operation Barkhane. They reiterated their support to MINUSMA and called for further means and capabilities for the Mission so it can deliver its mandate in a safe manner. They also welcomed the role played by the troop contributing countries and paid tribute to those troops who have paid the ultimate sacrifice and those who sustained injuries in the promotion of peace, security, stability and reconciliation in Mali. They also recalled the framework allowing MINUSMA to provide logistic support to the G5 Joint Force and called for the swift disbursement of the funds dedicated to it under the African Peace Facility. They also noted the call by the UN Secretary General in April 2018 for the use of the UN assessed contributions and welcomed the progress made and the commitment to progress rapidly in the implementation of a human rights and international humanitarian law compliance framework for Africa peace support operations. They further welcomed the ongoing efforts by the AU to re-energize the Nouakchott Process in the context of the review process of the AU Strategy for the Sahel region.

The EU PSC and the AU PSC reaffirmed their partnership in support of regional security and development in the Sahel, as well as the cooperation on the ground between the EU Special Representative for the Sahel and the AU High Representative for Mali/Sahel. They saluted the contribution to the stability of the Sahel region made by the EU Training Mission (EUTM) Mali and EU Capacity Building Missions (EUCAP) Sahel Mali and Niger.

They commended efforts by the G5 Sahel and ECOWAS to reinforce regional cooperation to address the threats of terrorism and organized crime. They welcomed the progress made by the G5 Sahel countries towards the full operational capacity of a Joint Force to combat terrorism, transnational organized crime and all trafficking in the region under the mandate of the AU PSC and with strong EU support. They re-affirmed their commitment to support the G5 Sahel priorities, in particular to successfully implement the UN Security Council resolution 2391 that also needs to be sustained in the longer term. In this regard, they stressed the need to further mobilize political support from regional and international actors to follow up on the pledges made during the High Level Conference on the Sahel that was held in Brussels on the 23 February 2018. They further stressed the need for international support for the successful convening of the Conference on the G5 Programme d'Investissements Prioritaires in Nouakchott on 6 December 2018. In this regard, they underlined the need for the Conference to contribute for greater ownership by countries of the region. They stressed the importance of the full operationalization of the fiduciary fund set up by the G5 Sahel.

The EU PSC and the AU PSC noted the progress made in the Central African Republic (CAR) in the search of lasting solutions to the crisis in the country. They welcomed and reaffirmed their support to the AU sustained efforts through the African Initiative for Peace and Reconciliation in CAR, with the support of the countries of the region, through the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, DRC, Sudan and Chad. They urged all stakeholders in the Initiative to participate actively in the implementation of the Roadmap adopted in Libreville, on 17 July 2017. In this regard, they took note with appreciation of the work done by the Facilitation Panel, which, on 31 August 2018, handed over to the President of the CAR, Faustin-Archange Touadera, the list of grievances and demands expressed by the 14 armed groups of the CAR following extensive consultations with these groups in recent months. They acknowledged the African Initiative as the only viable framework for the promotion of lasting peace, security and stability in the CAR. They called on all CAR stakeholders, the UN, notably through CAR country specific configuration of the Peacebuilding Commission (PCB), chaired by the Kingdom of Morocco, the EU and other partners to assist the country in full coordination. They reiterated the need for an inclusive engagement of all CAR institutions and civil society actors, including women's groups, to allow for sustainable national healing and reconciliation in the country. ** They welcomed the inauguration of the Special Criminal Court (CPS) as an important step towards combating impunity and fostering peace, justice and reconciliation in CAR. **

They re-affirmed their support to President Touadera and his Government in their ongoing efforts towards a comprehensive political solution, including justice and reconciliation, essential to allow for stability, peace and development in the country. They called on the CAR leadership to prioritize joint work on the strengthening of democratic State institutions and of the Rule of law, on the reform of the security sector and on transitional justice, on good governance, as well as on the delivery of social services to the population, including security. They condemned the prevailing structural violence by armed groups against people from all walks of life, including women and children, humanitarian actors and security forces. In this regard, they urged the CAR Government to continue to provide protection, particularly to vulnerable groups and facilitate the work of humanitarian aid agencies.

They strongly condemned the destabilizing activities of the armed groups, as well as targeted attacks against civilians and the troops of the UN Multidimensional Integrated Mission for Stabilization in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) and reiterated their support to MINUSCA and to reinforcing the mission. They called upon all armed groups in the CAR to cease hostilities and to commit themselves resolutely to the DDR programmes and the pacification process of the country. They commended the EU and AU for their assistance to efforts being deployed by the CAR authorities to restore peace and rebuild their country, notably through the EU military training mission (EUTM RCA), and underlined that all actors engaged in this context need to closely coordinate their respective activities in full transparency. They acknowledged the support provided by the EU to the Government of the CAR in supporting the security sector reforms, including the provision of strategic advice to the Internal Security Forces through EUTM RCA following the request by CAR for additional assistance to the Internal Security Forces.

They expressed deep concern over the prevailing security and humanitarian situation in the CAR and called upon the international community to extend financial and other necessary forms of support to alleviate the humanitarian situation, as well as with and to fulfil the pledges made in May 2016 donors’ conference held in Brussels, Belgium. They stressed the need for close coordination of efforts by members of the international community.

On South Sudan, the EU PSC and the AU PSC commended the progress made in the search for a lasting solution to the conflict in the Republic South Sudan and welcomed the signing, on 12 September 2018, in Addis Ababa, of the ""Revitalised Agreement on the Resolution to the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan"" (R-ARCSS) as a step forward towards the pursuit of an effective peace process. They commended the efforts deployed by the South Sudanese parties and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and its member states to reach this result. They stressed that the successful implementation of the R-ARCSS would require the commitment of all parties and, in this regard, they urged them to do their part in building confidence with each other and with the international community. The EU PSC and the AU PSC called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and disengagement of forces throughout the country. They encouraged the IGAD to remain actively engaged and to work closely with the AU to ensure that the parties to the Revitalized Agreement honour their commitments and that spoilers are held accountable for their actions.

The EU PSC and the AU PSC expressed deep concern over the prevailing humanitarian crisis in the country and commended the countries of the region which continue to host large number of South Sudanese refugees, as well as the humanitarian actors who have continued to provide assistance in the most difficult conditions. In this respect, they called on the South Sudanese parties to ensure unimpeded humanitarian access throughout the country. Furthermore, they reiterated the need for the establishment of the Hybrid Court of South Sudan, the Commission for Truth, Reconciliation and Healing, and the Compensation and Reparations Authority, as provided for by the R-ARCSS. They called for the international community to stand ready to support the implementation of the Revitalized Agreement.

The AU PSC and EU PSC welcomed the commitment of the South Sudanese parties to give due consideration to national diversity, gender and regional representation in selecting their nominees to the various mechanisms outlined in the Revitalized Agreement. Therefore, they encouraged the Transitional Government of National Unity of South Sudan to ensure that the provisions of the Transitional Constitution of the Republic of South Sudan and the R-ACRSS on the 35% participation of the women in the Executive are adhered to.

The EU PSC and AU PSC welcomed the rapprochement between Ethiopia and Eritrea, including the Joint Declaration of Peace and Friendship of 9 July 2018 and the commitment to comprehensive cooperation made between Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and Djibouti. This provides new openings for regional cooperation on peace and security and economic integration.

On Somalia, in particular, the EU PSC and the AU PSC noted the recent positive regional developments in the Horn of Africa that will potentially have a positive impact on Somalia and the region as a whole. They welcomed the recent Somalia Partnership Forum, convened in Brussels on 16-17 July 2018 and, noting the progress, encouraged the country to positively move forward on political, security and economic reform efforts. They underlined the importance of the Federal Government of Somalia and the Federal Member States working closely together in order to make continued progress in the country’s peace- and state building process. They stressed that the domestic situation in Somalia still remains fragile as evidenced by the continued security threats being posed by Al Shaabab. In this regard, they stressed the importance of sustained international support to the Government of Somalia and the AMISOM. They commended the AMISOM and the troop and police contributing countries for their contribution towards peace and stability in Somalia, which is critical for the progress in Somali state formation. The EU PSC and the AU PSC congratulated the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) for the adoption of the Somali Transition Plan, which is internationally recognized and reiterated in UNSCR 2431 [2018]. They stressed the need to ensure that any security transition is in line with the Transition Plan, and emphasised the need for a reconfigured AMISOM to move towards the gradual handover of security responsibility to the country’s security institutions who progressively will need to take over responsibility for Somalia's own security, bearing in mind the need to avoid any security vacuum that may undermine the gains made so far. The EU and AU PSC called on the FGS, together with the Federal Member States, to pursue the reform of the security sector, with particular emphasis on the integration of forces and to increase transparency through greater engagement with partners of security, notably through the establishment of an improved coordination mechanism (""Fusion Cell""). The EU PSC and the AU PSC further emphasized the need for timely, predictable and sustainable financial support to deliver a phased and conditions based transition, including from UN assessed contributions to AMISOM and support to Somali security institutions during the transition phase. The AU PSC commended the longstanding and continued support provided by the EU to AMISOM and emphasized the importance of international burden-sharing in a joint and transparent effort. They saluted the contribution to the stability in Somalia made by the AMISOM and the EU Training Mission (EUTM) Somalia, the EU Capacity Building Missions (EUCAP) Somalia, as well as through the EU Naval Force (EUNAVFOR) Somalia, Operation Atalanta. They also emphasized on the need for enhanced support to the Somali National Army, with a view to preparing the SNA to gradually take over the security responsibilities from AMISOM.

The EU PSC and AU PSC affirmed their commitment to continue to follow the evolution of the situation in Burundi. They welcomed the announcement by President Pierre Nkurunziza, in May 2018, that he will not stand as a presidential candidate in the upcoming elections. The AU PSC and EU PSC further looked forward to the resumption of the inter-Burundian Dialogue which is scheduled to take place soon in Arusha, and urged all stakeholders to extend their full cooperation to the Mediator and the Facilitation team. They stressed that the only viable way forward for Burundi is finding a political solution through an inclusive inter-Burundian dialogue. They encouraged all actors to engage in the process in good faith and to make progress, especially in view of the 2020 elections and of the socio-economic situation in the country. They underlined that the support of the region for the inter-Burundian dialogue remains crucial and they expressed appreciation for the mediation and facilitation undertaken by the East African Community. They urged Burundians to respect the letter and spirit of the 2000 Arusha Agreement which is credited for promoting peace in the country and the region. The EU PSC and AU PSC took note of the adoption, on 28 September 2018, of a resolution which extends the mandate of the UN Commission of Inquiry for another year. They encouraged Burundi to cooperate with international human rights mechanisms and especially to sign a memorandum of understanding in view of the mission of the African Union Human Rights Observers and Military experts Mission in Burundi. They urged Burundi to ensure that all stakeholders providing support for the Burundi population can continue their work.

The AU PSC reiterated its appeal to the EU to lift the suspension of aid through the government imposed on Burundi, although recognising the continued important direct EU support to the population, with a view to facilitating socio-economic recovery in the country.

On the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the EU PSC and the AU PSC reaffirmed their commitment to lasting peace, security and stability in the DRC and the Great Lakes region as a whole.

They welcomed the decision of President Kabila to comply with the Constitution of the country, by not standing as a presidential candidate in the upcoming elections, and paving the way for a democratic and peaceful transition in the DRC. In this context, they stressed the importance for the DRC authorities to ensure that the elections are held on 23 December 2018 consistent with the 31 December 2016 Political Agreement, in order to achieve inclusive, transparent, credible and peaceful elections. Furthermore, the EU PSC and the AU PSC welcomed the visit of the UN Security council in October 2018 and expressed support for the role of the United Nations in facilitating the successful organization of the electoral process, at the request of the Government of the DRC, in line with the relevant provisions of UNSC Resolution 2409.

Bearing in mind the renewed security threats that may exacerbate the risks of the Ebola outbreak in the Eastern provinces of the DRC, the EU PSC and the AU PSC appealed the World Health Organisation to further strengthen and intensify its efforts towards the prevention of further Ebola outbreak and its outspreading .

But what would an illiberal Europe look like, and could it function?

With public support for the EU at its highest in ten years and Brexit becoming a nightmare, populists realize that exiting or destroying the EU are no longer viable options for them electorally. Even in Poland and Hungary, where radical right parties are in power, support for Brussels is high, at 74 and 67 percent, respectively.1

So anti-EU populists have changed tack. They want to shift more powers to the national level and prevent the enforcement of EU norms and standards that restrain their exercise of power. In their view, the EU should provide economic benefits and funds, while allowing governments to do what they want with their national democratic and judicial institutions. They depict EU institutions as part of a self-serving, corrupt elite that ignores the will of the people, destroys national identities, and exposes countries to the risks of globalization.

But the populist vision is full of contradictions. It does not offer a plausible way to turn the EU into a better functioning entity that serves its citizens. Yet the defenders of liberal democracy in Europe can no longer afford to ignore this vision in the run-up to the European Parliament elections in 2019; they need to expose its flaws and dangers and offer their own plan to develop a better EU.

The Rising Power of Populism in the EU

In this article, the term “populist parties” refers to radical right parties.2 Radical right populism is inherently illiberal because it rejects constraining how a strong leader exercises the will of the people, and it has a monolithic, predetermined conception of the will of the people that leaves no room for pluralism (including rights for minorities) or deliberation. This kind of populism is nationalistic because the political leader claims to be defending the nation against external and internal threats to national identity.3

Populist politics is on the rise in most EU countries and has already advanced far into the EU’s daily workings. Openly xenophobic, anti-EU parties now in government—such as Italy’s League, Hungary’s Fidesz, and Poland’s Law and Justice—are participating in decisionmaking at the EU’s top table, the European Council. They often set the agenda these days, with mainstream politicians following their lead. This is shown by the constant preoccupation of EU summits with migration, even though the number of arrivals has fallen dramatically in the past two years. They can also block the Council of Ministers’ decisions, which are most often made by consensus.

Over the past decade, populist parties have gained much higher support in most EU member states. In Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Finland, Greece, Latvia, and Slovakia, populist parties are now represented in their ruling coalitions, which affects their country’s positions at the EU level. And the populist presence in national parliaments is growing.

Feeling the momentum behind them, some populists are now aiming to impede integration and push the EU down a very different road: “Thirty years ago we thought that Europe was our future. Today we believe that we are Europe’s future,” proclaimed Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

Parties are now limbering up for the European Parliament (EP) elections to be held in May 2019. Usually mainstream parties consider these to be second-order elections, as they are primarily concerned about winning national races. Therefore, they rarely spend much time and money campaigning for the European Parliament—resulting in ever-falling voter turnout. But this time, populists are promoting the vote as a turning point in European history. Italian League party leader Matteo Salvini told a rally in Pontida, “The European elections next year will be a referendum between the Europe of the elites, of banks, of finance, of immigration and precarious work; and the Europe of people and labour.”

Meanwhile, Orbán asserted, “If we are unable to reach a satisfactory result in negotiations . . . on the issues of migration and the budget, then let us wait . . . for the European people to express their will in the 2019 elections to the European Parliament. Then what must be shall be.” Previously, only extreme Europhiles promoted the European elections as being so important.

Populists are likely to achieve greater electoral success in European elections than they have in national ones. The number of populist members of the European Parliament (MEPs) rose with the 2009 and 2014 elections, and they now comprise just over one-fifth of the chamber. But, so far, populist MEPs have assumed several different roles in parliament. Some have excluded themselves from its work, not turning up and just using it as a cash machine to fund and staff their national campaigns. Others use it as a platform for media appearances and propaganda. Very few seek to work on legislation and participate in parliamentary committees.

The response of the bigger parties has been to protect the decisionmaking machinery by excluding the populist MEPs as much as possible and concentrating power in the center-right and center-left through a grand coalition. The populist MEPs made it easier for them to do that by fragmenting into several different party groups.

However, the grand coalition strategy contains an inherent contradiction: the primacy that the big parties have given to efficient decisionmaking has enhanced the EP’s power but reduced the legislature’s role as a forum for political debate. The emphasis on efficiency has weakened parliament’s link with citizens and reinforced the perception that it is a part of the EU’s bureaucracy rather than an institution that ensures accountability of government to the people.

Populism is opportunistic, however, and populist leaders sometimes go pro-EU when real costs to intransigence emerge. For example, when he was Slovakia’s prime minister, Robert Fico shared many of his Hungarian and Polish counterparts’ positions, particularly in refusing to take asylum seekers under the burden-sharing scheme agreed to by the European Council. But his rhetoric turned pro-European when Slovaks reacted negatively to the prospect of their country being relegated to a second tier in a more flexible EU. In countries where there is still an active opposition to a populist government, positions on the EU can shift rapidly.

But the 2019 elections could significantly increase the number of populist MEPs, and they will have more opportunities to influence important votes and reports. Unlike in the past, when they made a lot of noise but had little effect on EU-level decisions, they could now cause a shift in the power relationships within each EU institution—thus profoundly affecting what the EU can do in the future. It is impossible to reform the institutions formally because changing the EU’s treaties is politically out of reach. However, the institutions could be changed from the inside as a result of the political dynamics unleashed by populism.

The European Commission has so far been relatively unaffected by the rise of populism, but it could now become the most vulnerable institution to deadlock. The few commissioners appointed by populist governments have gone with the mainstream once they arrived in Brussels. That could easily change in 2019 if several populist governments nominate candidates who oppose central EU policies and values.

Next year’s confirmation process for new commissioners could get blocked if MEPs object to populist candidates but prime ministers insist on their own picks. To appease the EP, the commission’s president could respond by asking the government for another nomination or allocating an insignificant portfolio of work to the controversial nominee once confirmed. But even just a couple active populist commissioners could disrupt the institution’s functioning significantly.

By tradition, the commission’s twenty-eight-member College of Commissioners makes decisions mostly by consensus, so even a commissioner with an unimportant portfolio can hamper the work of others. To counter this, the college could start voting more often on proposals to overcome the opposition of a few. But that would be very divisive and fundamentally change the working culture of the commission. National interests have always played a role in the commission’s work, but so far this has been handled discreetly and kept within bounds. If actively populist commissioners appear on the scene, the college will start to resemble the Council of Ministers, with national interests becoming the main basis for commissioners’ positions rather than their official responsibilities and the “common European interest” that is supposed to guide all their decisions.

Beyond all the EU institutional ramifications, the biggest impact of the 2019 elections could be psychological—further weakening the will to reform the EU, making hostility toward migrants a mainstream political agenda, and encouraging broader xenophobia in European societies.

Do the Populists Have a Vision for Europe?

Because of their patchy and sometimes contradictory positions on the EU and its policies, most populists are not interested in putting forward a coherent vision for Europe. For them, the EU is a convenient scapegoat. They often portray it as an external enemy when it constrains their ability to exercise what they claim to be the will of the people.

Their attitudes toward the EU reflect their belief that the national government is the only legitimate holder of power. As politician Heiner Merz of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party said recently, “We need to return to free, sovereign and diverse nation states that can determine their development without external interference.” Populists are only interested in a few aspects of what the EU actually does. In the populist view of politics, the EU is part of the corrupt elite that always appears in their political narrative.

But in recent years, the EU has drawn more fire from them because of three developments: the austerity policies that followed the euro crisis after 2008, the migration crisis of 2015–2016, and now the confrontations with illiberal governments accused of undermining the rule of law.

Populist parties are primarily focused on immigration. They blame the EU for failing to stop people coming in, and some populist leaders reject any scheme to share the burden of asylum seekers among the member states. In addition, they often disparage the notion of multiculturalism and some even advocate reducing ethnic diversity within their own countries. Although they differ on who should take responsibility for refugees, populists generally support “Fortress Europe”—building ever more barriers to entry into the EU. They prefer to shift responsibility for providing asylum to third countries in neighboring regions. In their view, national rather than common migration policies should take precedence, even at the cost of weakening the Schengen system of free movement and reintroducing internal border controls.

Once in power, populists attempt to consolidate their power by removing constraints, particularly the checks and balances put in place by their country’s constitution. They try to control state institutions and reduce freedoms for civil society and universities to reduce critical voices. They particularly dislike EU institutions that have a mandate to constrain national governments from breaking EU laws. When the European Commission complains that the current Hungarian and Polish governments’ actions are incompatible with EU norms and continent-wide rule of law, the governments insist on the primacy of their electoral mandate. Most populists characterize the commission as a group of “unelected bureaucrats” and advocate downgrading its role to that of a secretariat rather than the guardian of the EU’s treaties. Consequently, they prefer power to lie in the European Council, where they can exercise national vetoes.

Their hostility to the commission also stems from seeing it as an agent of globalization. The radical right, similar to many on the left, holds some nostalgia for the industrial era, when there was national control over economic policy. Former French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen launched her campaign with the slogan, “The divide is not between left and right anymore, but between patriots and globalists.” Populist parties generally prefer protectionist trade policies, but they rarely put forward comprehensive or coherent economic policies. Resisting any further deepening of European integration, they want a minimal framework for economic cooperation but also the benefits of trade and investment that come from being part of a single market.

Regarding EU foreign policy, populists support loose cooperation between governments but oppose any constraints at the EU level on implementing national policy. They have little use for effective multilateralism and a liberal world order. Like U.S. President Donald Trump, they see the world as one of clashing national interests. They consequently dismiss the promotion of values in EU external action and are prepared to block or undermine common decisions, consensus, and united action. Most admire Russian President Vladimir Putin. They want to cut special deals with external powers such as Russia, China, Israel, and Egypt on energy and investment, even at the cost of the common EU interest.

What Would an Illiberal Europe Look Like?

Imagine a continent where people identify themselves primarily with their nation and are wary of foreigners. To prevent any threat to their culture and views, these nations have harsh policies to ensure would-be immigrants are kept out and minorities are kept down. The ruling party runs the country according to the will of the people, as expressed by absolute majority votes in elections and referendums. It draws its legitimacy from elections and is accountable only to the parliament and judiciary that it controls. It rejects any outside interference, including international rules and standards.

The nations cooperate through a regional body, but it is fully under the control of national governments, which can veto every decision it makes, with minimal supranational powers. The governments avoid comprehensive regional trade agreements and remain free to enter into bilateral deals with outside powers (for example, on energy and infrastructure). They agree to rules for economic cooperation but not to significant limits on national sovereignty.

Drawing together their scattered positions on many issues, this is the kind of Europe that most radical right populist parties are promoting, including Austria’s Freedom Party, France’s National Rally (formerly National Front), Germany’s AfD, Hungary’s Fidesz, Italy’s League, and Poland’s Law and Justice.

Five Fallacies of the Populist Worldview

The illiberal worldview of populists contains many contradictions. Here are five fallacies that directly concern the EU.

“We Can Have Our Cake and Eat It, Too”

This illiberal vision of Europe is inherently contradictory because it assumes that the benefits delivered by European integration will continue regardless of the behaviour of national governments.

Populist leaders claim that they can reassert the primacy of national governments and drop inconvenient norms and standards while maintaining stability and prosperity. For them, core principles such as the rule of law, mutual recognition, and pluralism are impositions. But these principles are what support stability and prosperity, because they allow member states to trust each other, providing the legal certainty and institutional reliability needed for commerce and cooperation in both the public and private sectors. By rejecting supranational constraints that guarantee the rule of law, illiberal governments undermine mutual trust across the whole EU—and the single market.

When in government, populists usually want to take over state institutions to consolidate their own power and line their pockets. In the short term, businesses can avoid the problems caused by weak rule of law by striking cosy deals with authoritarian governments. But the centralization of power by one party and attempts to rein in independent judiciaries usually result in corruption that reduces economic potential over the longer term. It is no coincidence that illiberalism rarely results in sustainable economic success; the urge to control judges, journalists, and nongovernmental organizations is motivated by a desire to avoid public scrutiny and recourse to justice—which, in turn, reduces fair competition and undermines democracy. Corroding the rule of law ultimately reduces the prosperity of everyone. The populists who are trying to avoid the rules are free-riding on the EU’s legal framework.

“We Will Restore National Sovereignty and Take Back Control”

Populism typically contains a large dose of nostalgia. Europe’s illiberal leaders hark back to a simpler world when national governments could control economic and social conditions. But there is no way back to the 1950s. European prosperity depends on transnational supply chains and access to global markets, and technological change is rapidly reshaping all economies. Global trade has slowed down and some industrial production might revert to Europe, but protectionism and nationalist beggar-thy-neighbor policies—that prop up one’s economy at the expense of another—would ultimately destroy European jobs and result in economic decline.

Restoration of national sovereignty is an illusion in a globalized, interdependent world, especially for Europe’s smaller countries. Far from making economies more independent, attempts to weaken the European Commission’s lead role in trade and standards reduce the EU’s collective power internationally. That exposes Europe to greater pressure from external forces—from rising powers like China and India to tech monopolies like Facebook and Google.

Equally self-defeating are populists’ calls for more autonomous national foreign policies so that they can cut special deals with Russia, China, and other powers—outside of EU rules on fair competition and public procurement. The weight of individual European countries is falling on a global scale. Bundling influence and resources through common policies and collective action is the only way for Europe to maintain its influence on international developments. By competing for the favors of Russia, China and other powers, populists are weakening Europe’s collective leverage internationally.

In reality, the lack of a united front makes individual countries more vulnerable to external influence—just what the populists claim to want to prevent. Protectionism and special deals with foreign powers hurt small European countries the most, ultimately giving them less control and sovereignty than a united EU front would.

“National Interest First, No Compromise”

Because they view the will of the people as homogeneous and absolute, populists see compromise as betrayal. The EU’s endless negotiations and search for common ground are anathema to the populist worldview. For this reason, they often refuse to engage in finding solutions at the EU level and they are increasingly undermining agreements and breaking solidarity in international forums like the United Nations.

Even among themselves, populists show little solidarity. For example, Salvini wants other countries to share Italy’s burden of being the first arrival point of many migrants. But Central European populists are adamantly refusing to take any refugees, following a beggar-thy-neighbor logic of trying to keep migrants in the country next door. In another example, populist parties in Hungary and Poland want to continue receiving EU funds, but populist parties in net contributor countries like Austria prefer to reduce their bill. Similarly, Central European countries want to maintain the right of their citizens to live and work in other member states, whereas Austrian, Dutch, French, and German nationalist parties would like to restrict this freedom. The contradictory positions of Austrian, Italian, and Polish nationalist politicians on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline are another example.

A purely transactional approach to EU membership will not work. The EU needs a minimum degree of solidarity to function because member states are so deeply integrated. Countries with such a deep level of mutual interdependence have to give and take across a large range of issues. In the absence of any willingness for compromise, the EU will seize up. Zero-sum nationalism makes sustained cooperation impossible.

“Keeping Out People Who Don’t Belong Here Will Solve Our Problems”

Populist parties’ obsessive focus on migration is dividing societies, undermining trust, and destroying civility and tolerance. The daily speeches of politicians claiming that millions of foreigners are trying to overwhelm their native people creates a climate of fear. This fear creates a vicious circle that also fuels xenophobia toward other Europeans: it increases hostility toward foreigners from other European countries and minorities already living in the country.

Xenophobia then becomes self-perpetuating, with social tensions driving yet more fear and loathing of people who are different in any way from the majority population. That encourages ever more repressive policies and discrimination, further increasing social tensions.

These dynamics—and populists’ claim that there is a pure, homogeneous native people of their country—ignore the diversity that has characterized most European societies throughout history. Societies that have a high level of hostility toward minorities are not only more predisposed to violence but also bad relations with their neighbors—which can lead to interstate conflict. That lesson from the twentieth-century wars in Europe was the primary motivation for creating the EU in the first place. European integration started as a project to encourage trust across borders and the creation of common interests that made going to war less likely. Common rules that promote integration help states to avoid conflict. Xenophobia drives up international tensions and undermines the stability created over the past sixty years in Europe. It becomes self-perpetuating and harms all societies.

“We Are the Future of the EU”

If the illiberal vision of Europe prevails, it is unlikely to result in a stable equilibrium in which European integration can survive. Populism relies on the constant rallying of people against an external enemy. So populist leaders will never be satisfied; they will need to keep railing against the EU, regardless of what it does, because it is such a convenient scapegoat. No reform of the EU would reconcile populists with European integration. More radical forces will crowd out the less radical ones, and trust and cohesion between countries will unravel.

The vision of a sovereignist, yet prosperous and stable Europe assumes that national interests will somehow magically align without the compromises that member states now make every day. But this is not what will happen. Without the communal approach based on shared sovereignty, clashing interests will result in blockage and conflict. Loss of trust and cohesion will create a dynamic of disintegration that never stops. It will create a vicious circle with disengagement from the EU, resulting in an ever looser and ever angrier union.

From Exclusion to Persuasion—Move Over, Grand Coalition

The volatility in national politics across Europe is about to destabilize the EU level. The European Parliament will be a chamber of conflict—at risk of becoming deadlocked owing to populists who have few policies to propose but want to block the system.

The ancien régime is doomed: the grand coalition of center-right and center-left parties that has dominated the EU for decades is losing power. Its strategy of keeping the radicals at the edge of the system is unsustainable.

In the last decade, the center-right European People’s Party (EPP) Group and center-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists & Democrats (S&D) Group have acted as a grand coalition on the basis that they are the only possible defenders of liberal Europe. But this won’t work in the future. The Socialists & Democrats could lose many seats, as they have at the national level in recent years. They already face competition from new parties—on the left from Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s France Insoumise and Spain’s Podemos and on the right from French President Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche and his allies.

The EPP is deeply divided about its future orientation, even more so since it split over the vote on rule of law in Hungary on September 12. Orbán openly aims to pull it further toward the right and illiberalism, causing disquiet among its more moderate members: “Instead of desertion, we should take on the more difficult task of renewing the European People’s Party, and helping it to find its way back to its Christian democratic roots.”

The battle for the EPP’s soul could go on for a long time, rendering many of its members incapable of defending liberal Europe. The Liberal and Green parties could become more important players as the swing voters in shifting alliances within the parliament. But they would find it very difficult to support any EPP candidate who just wants to maintain the old order. That will make filling the top EU positions after the elections very complicated.

The biggest risk is that liberals become more fragmented and weaker, while illiberals—so far divided among several party groups—become motivated to unite because they smell power at the EU level. So far, populists have been successful in heating up the political discourse and in shaping the agenda. Now they could have a major impact on decisionmaking. Politics at the EU level is bound to become more confrontational, making it harder to find compromises. The current establishment could try to cling to power by using existing procedures and new rules to exclude newcomers. This would be a mistake, however, as voters would perceive these moves as the stubborn defense of entrenched interests—which would lead to a bigger crash down the road.

To pass legislation, the next parliament will have to rely on the cooperation of old and new parties united by a common commitment to the liberal values on which the EU was built. But this cooperation should not result in a consolidated power structure to rival the old grand coalition. The EP needs to overcome its fixation on the division between pro- and anti-EU forces and move toward a more vibrant political debate among the various party groups on the most urgent concerns of citizens—rising inequality, stagnating middle-class incomes, broken tax systems, and social and environmental standards.

The new constellations of forces within parliament could take some time to emerge, and the stability of earlier decades may be gone forever. The shifting constellations will reduce the effectiveness of the legislature, with consequences for the EU’s functioning. But a more open party system could emerge, with shifting party constellations and ad hoc coalitions that could include some of the nonmainstream parties like Italy’s Five Star Movement. That would enhance parliament’s role as a forum for political debate and hence its democratic legitimacy. It would also bring in original ideas that have been stifled by the old party machine, as well as fresh faces in a tired chamber.

Defenders of a liberal Europe should explore potential engagement across party lines, including with groups that are anti-establishment but not illiberal. Liberals cannot find common ground with xenophobic and racist parties like Golden Dawn in Greece. But in important new parties, such as the Five Star Movement in Italy and Ciudadanos in Spain, views are still forming, and there is much diversity among their members. On the left, there are Spain’s Podemos and Greece’s Syriza, which oppose austerity imposed by the EU but are not xenophobic.

A major impetus to mobilize voters will need to come from new forces who offer a strong new liberal and pro-European vision, rather than a weak version of the populist migration-focused agenda. A number of new parties based on bottom-up movements have the chance to enter parliament for the first time.

But mainstream politicians also need to rediscover how to appeal to Europeans’ core democratic convictions. There is still support for these values, as shown when Europeans are asked about specific issues like freedom of expression and nondiscrimination.4 They do not want to live in a society like Russia’s or Turkey’s. Sceptical voters need to hear the pragmatic arguments for liberal values and why the EU should defend them, as illustrated by Dutch Prime Minister Marc Rutte’s recent speech on European integration.

To find common ground, these politicians need to put their cards on the table about what kind of Europe and what kind of society they really want—not just talk in vague terms about being pro- or anti-European.

Populists have succeeded in triggering a genuinely transnational debate about issues that find resonance across many countries: economic insecurity and migration. Liberal forces need to respond with a renewed vision for the values on which the EU was founded. One force to mobilize is civil society, which in many EU countries is opposing illiberalism. There is great energy in the grassroots movements that have sprung up in recent years; they have traditionally focused on single issues but are now looking at a range of concerns.

Most voters understand that EU membership brings benefits, but many of them take for granted the legal system that delivers economic prosperity. They also underestimate the threat that illiberalism poses to democratic and open societies. Civil society is therefore a vital part of the renewal of liberal Europe—first and foremost to revive awareness of why European values still matter for protecting rights and freedoms.

This Time It Really Is Different

The 2019 European Parliament elections will be far from second-order. They will determine whether the EU can continue to function and whether it can live up to its values. The official slogan of the EP’s 2014 election—“This time it’s different”—seemed silly five years ago, but now it’s serious. Given the mobilization of the radical right ahead of 2019, it would be highly risky for mainstream parties to run the lukewarm campaigns of the past.

If mainstream liberal politicians do not take up the challenge, radical right populists will focus the campaign on migration and deepen the climate of fear, raising tensions in many parts of European society. Their electoral gains will give them a much bigger power base in EU institutions, making it harder for the EU to function.

An illiberal Europe of the kind promoted by populists would destroy itself through its own internal contradictions. It relies on free-riding on the legal order and stable institutions built at the EU level over sixty years and ignores the fact that chipping away at the rule of law and solidarity would ultimately destroy Europe’s prosperity and stability. Inherent in the populists’ varying visions of what is good for their own societies is the kind of interstate competition that led to conflict in Europe in past centuries.

Even if the populist vision of Europe is incoherent and self-contradictory, populists’ role in the EU is growing and could disrupt future integration significantly. Liberals need to face this challenge and expose the populist fallacies if they are to win back the voters who are disappointed by establishment politics and looking for new solutions to economic insecurity and social change.

Liberals of all stripes should focus their 2019 election campaigns on building the case for a values-based Europe on the basis of its track record in delivering benefits for citizens. Instead of continuing the false dichotomy of pro- and anti-EU, they need to talk much more about what kind of Europe people want to live in. Liberals need to make the case for cooperation, solidarity, and common rules and values as part of an organic whole that underpins a prosperous and open society.

Notes

1 According to the Pew Research Center’s survey, in nine of ten EU member countries, most people hold a favorable view of Brussels, with support being highest in Poland (74 percent), Germany (68 percent), and Hungary (67 percent). In the most recent Eurobarometer survey, 60 percent of Europeans consider EU membership a good thing, while two-thirds of Europeans believe that their country has benefited from being an EU member—the highest percentage since 1983.

2 Using Cas Mudde’s seminal classification, these are the parties that consider “society to be ultimately separated into two homogeneous and antagonistic groups—the ‘pure people’ versus the ‘corrupt elite’, and which argues that politics should be an expression of the ‘volonté générale’ (general will) of the people.” See Cas Mudde, On Extremism and Democracy in Europe (Abingdon: Routledge, 2016), 64.

3 The term “liberal” here refers to those mainstream politicians of the old center-left and center-right who adhere to the fundamental principles of democracy, rule of law, human rights, human dignity, gender equality, and the other values set out in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. Such liberals are not necessarily neo-liberal in their views on economics, nor are they all liberals in party terms or in U.S. terminology. The European liberal consensus lies around the need for constraints on power, checks and balances that make governments accountable to their people, tolerance and deliberation in political debate, and no discrimination within societies.

4 See, for example, Mónica Ferrín and Hanspeter Kriesi, How Europeans View and Evaluate Democracy (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016).","But what would an illiberal Europe look like, and could it function?
Populist politics is on the rise in most EU countries and has already advanced far into the EU’s daily workings.
Once in power, populists attempt to consolidate their power by removing constraints, particularly the checks and balances put in place by their country’s constitution.
Defenders of a liberal Europe should explore potential engagement across party lines, including with groups that are anti-establishment but not illiberal.
An illiberal Europe of the kind promoted by populists would destroy itself through its own internal contradictions."

Overview

Conflict has become a hallmark of the contemporary Middle East, forcing millions of individuals from their homes. Of the 60 million displaced people worldwide, close to 40 percent originate from the Arab region, mainly Syria and Palestine.1 Globally, the scale of the crisis has highlighted the deficiencies of international covenants for addressing the political and humanitarian ramifications of mass population movements. Regionally, it has placed frontline countries under considerable duress as they struggle to care for vulnerable and destitute populations. For the refugees, the crisis has resulted in a systematic decline in their rights, the quality of their lives, and in the educational standards and the future prospects of their children.

Broadly speaking, the dramatic growth in refugee population in the Arab region has fanned preexisting existential fears in host countries. In Lebanon and Jordan, governments in these two frontline countries have been left grappling with a mass influx of Syrian refugees at a time of diminished resources and depleted capacities. In the absence of regional frameworks to address this crisis, and amid fears of prolonged displacement, most countries in the region have responded with a nonintegration paradigm that seeks to return refugees to their countries of origin. This has meant policies that limit the access refugees have to services and undercut the rights accorded to them internationally. Despite being at the forefront of the crisis, municipalities in Lebanon and Jordan have also lacked the necessary support from central governments to meet the needs of Syrian refugees. The paucity of clear guidelines defining the scope of municipal authorities resulted in varied local responses shaped by municipal councils’ political affiliations and the localities’ sociopolitical specificities.

Meanwhile, because of security concerns, countries have sought to limit refugee flows. Previously open borders have been placed under strict control or closed altogether, severely restricting the cross-border flow of people and goods. The emergence of the self-proclaimed Islamic State in Iraq and Syria resulted in a collapse of border management between the two countries. However, these closures and restrictions have not prevented the informal flow of refugees but rather have fueled human smuggling networks across borders.2

To respond to this crisis, this chapter underlines three clusters of policy recommendations. While the analysis and these recommendations are focused on the Syrian context, which has generated the most refugees, the policy proposals have a broader applicability.

International and Regional Frameworks for Burden and Responsibility Sharing

International instruments for managing the refugee crisis fall short of current challenges, including protecting vulnerable populations and managing the impact on frontline countries. A transformative vision is needed, backed by a sustained political and financial global commitment, to protect people from the vagaries of their own governments and to ensure dignified lives for those escaping the horrors of conflict. This requires international systems of solidarity and clear principles for burden sharing, far beyond what has been the case thus far. Such principles would include commitments from governments to support refugees in keeping with their capacities. They would also include a clear regional framework of cooperation that allows refugees free movement and access to employment and services throughout the region. A precedent for such a framework already exists in the 1965 Casablanca Protocol, which was meant to address Palestinian refugee rights.

National Reallocation of Power and Resources

National governments also have a role to play in dealing with the fallout from this crisis. Addressing the burdens placed on them while supporting the fundamental rights of vulnerable—often at risk—populations requires a transformative vision and willingness to undertake the necessary change. For countries hosting large numbers of refugees, this is a difficult but not insurmountable task. Rethinking governance structures to address long-standing bottlenecks, devolve decisionmaking to the local authorities, and better institutional coordination at all levels are central to this process.

Safeguarding Refugee Rights

Finally, protecting the right of refugees to return to their homes should be a cornerstone of any discussion about a postconflict settlement. Empowering refugees with knowledge of their rights and with how to engage meaningfully in a postconflict Syria is central to a sustainable peace in Syria and the region. In the interim, the preservation of refugee status under specific conditions, as well as guarantees for the freedom of movement and labor rights, should also be a cornerstone for any durable solution.

International and Regional Framework for Burden and Responsibility Sharing

Amid vicious and increasingly intractable conflicts, individuals and entire communities have fled their homes in Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Most of those seeking refuge come from Syria. Around 5.6 million have been forced across the border into Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey while another 6.6 million have been displaced within Syria.3 Many reside either in makeshift refugee camps or in other people’s homes. Millions have risked their lives on treacherous journeys to Europe while hundreds of thousands have migrated to member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), seeking education or employment.

They are not alone. In the last three decades, Iraqis have also witnessed massive displacement. Close to 4.4 million fled their homes in the first and second Gulf wars in 1990 and 2003 and close to 3.4 million individuals were forced to leave following the emergence of the Islamic State in 2014.4 Today, almost 2 million remain displaced within the country, while tens of thousands more are in Syria and Jordan. In Yemen and Libya, a similar story has unfolded, although displacement has remained, for the most part, within national borders. Meanwhile, more than 2.4 million Sudanese have fled into neighboring countries, mainly Uganda.5

These mass population movements across national borders represent the fourth and most widespread wave of violent displacement that the region has faced since the end of World War I. These movements follow Armenians who escaped massacres in Turkey 1916–1918,6 1.2 million Palestinians forced out of their homes in 1948 and 1967.7

New global and regional instruments are needed to manage the fallout from this refugee crisis. The current system is unable to address the significant challenges posed by the sheer scale and expanse of conflict in the Middle East. The 1951 Refugee Convention and its related 1967 protocol, the main international instruments for safeguarding refugee rights and guaranteeing the principle of non-refoulement,8 were designed to respond to challenges faced by post–World War II refugees in Europe and the USSR. Then, around 11 million non-Germans sought refuge in areas under Allied control, while another 13 million Germans were expelled from the USSR, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. Responsibility for caring for refugees was implicitly assumed to be global, but no binding mechanisms were included.

Consequently, the absence of a global burden and responsibility sharing left frontline countries like Lebanon and Jordan with a disproportionate share of caring for the largest number of refugees. The nonbinding character of international instruments for refugee protection, and the lack of enforcement mechanisms to guarantee refugee rights, left vulnerable refugees in increasingly precarious conditions.

Regional instruments for addressing the crisis are also lacking. Only nine out of the twenty-two member states of the Arab League have signed the Refugee Convention and its related protocol, but none have actually ratified it (see the table in the appendix).9 A positive step came in 1965 with the adoption of the Casablanca Protocol for the Treatment of Palestinians in Arab States by the Council of Foreign Ministers of Member States of the Arab League. This protocol advocates for the right to employment for Palestinian refugees in host countries, as well as the right to obtain travel documents and to travel between Arab states, in accordance with standard visa and entry requirements for other Arab nationals.10 However, most of the rights accorded by this agreement have not been upheld by the different countries, particularly the rights to employment and freedom of movement.

In this broader context, all Arab countries have adopted a nonintegrative policy approach that considers refugees as temporary, unwanted guests; it denies them refugee status and basic rights and considers them to be both a burden and potential threat to the security and integrity of the nation. Diverse policies in different countries are for the most part driven by economic, political, security, demographic, and cultural considerations. While GCC member governments are concerned mainly with maintaining their current systems of governance and wealth distribution, countries of the Levant are worried primarily about the prospective challenge posed by incoming refugees to the political balance between different sectarian and ethnic communities as well as with the economic burden of caring for large numbers of newcomers to their countries at a time of depleted resources.

While GCC countries are listed among the top aid contributors to humanitarian operations dealing with the consequences of the Syrian conflict, they have been the most resistant to granting refugee status to individuals fleeing conflicts in the region. This position is consistent with the protectionist naturalization laws of these countries. In 2015, Saudi Arabia contributed $88.8 million, Kuwait $313.6 million, and the United Arab Emirates $71.9 million to humanitarian operations related to the Syrian crisis, including care for refugees.11 And even though several GCC countries argue that they have hosted thousands of Syrian migrant workers and students since 2011, none have agreed to grant refugee status to Syrians escaping conflict.12 Saudi Arabia, for example, indicated that it had authorized entry permits for 2.5 million Syrians since 2011, but scholars have noted these numbers are unsupported by official data, estimating that the actual number is closer to 420,000.13

In the Levant, Lebanon and Jordan, which share borders with Iraq, Palestine, and Syria, are hosting the highest number of refugees per capita worldwide.14 Both countries have a long history of taking in refugees, including successive waves of Armenians, Palestinians, and Iraqis. In both countries, refugee camps for Palestinians are still in place more than seventy years after they were established as temporary shelters for fleeing populations. Yet neither country has signed the Refugee Convention or protocol.15 While Armenians were eventually integrated into the countries they fled to, settling mainly in Lebanon and Syria, only Jordan granted Palestinians full citizenship rights. More than half of Jordanians today are of Palestinian origin.16 Yet thousands, mainly from Gaza, have not been naturalized and continue to live in deplorable conditions, such as in the Jerash camp, which hosts 30,000 refugees,17 while others have more recently had their nationality arbitrarily revoked by Jordanian authorities.18 Lebanon has not integrated Palestinian refugees, and 174,000 currently live in the country’s twelve refugee camps,19 with restricted mobility and limited access to employment, education, and health services.20 This situation is likely to worsen as international funding and aid through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) is cut.21 As for Palestinian refugees in Syria, they were forced out in the past two years, as the Yarmouk camp, their primary area of settlement, was besieged by Syrian government forces.22

Both countries are currently shouldering a disproportionate share of caring for the largest number of refugees. Lebanon’s resident population expanded from 4.4 million to more than 5.9 million in the space of two years as a result of the refugee flow, placing a tremendous strain on government institutions, local communities, and national infrastructure such as water, electricity, schools, and health facilities.23 In Jordan, a similar story unfolded as the country’s population increased by nearly 87 percent from 2005 to 2015, the majority of whom are non-Jordanians, namely Iraqis and then Syrians fleeing conflicts in their countries.24 The two countries hold the highest and second-highest number of refugees per capita worldwide; Lebanon hosts 164 refugees per 1,000 inhabitants whereas Jordan hosts 71 refugees per 1,000 inhabitants.25

This rapid increase in the population base also triggered a significant decline in access to services, aggravated preexisting socioeconomic and environmental pressures (such as scarce water resources), and led to increased urbanization. For example, today nearly half of non-Jordanians reside in Amman, significantly expanding pockets of urban poverty and further worsening the state of urban infrastructure and the ability of the government to provide requisite services.26

In response to the crisis, both frontline countries have also adopted similarly restrictive policies toward Syrian refugees, namely because of the significant financial burden of caring for millions of destitute individuals as well as serious concerns with the changing demographic balance. While East Bank Jordanians fear being outnumbered, the Lebanese are worried about the political ramifications if the country’s sectarian demographic balance is disrupted.27

Both governments have imposed significant restrictions on obtaining and renewing residency permits. Yet, refugee access to basic services such as education, health, employment, and justice is often limited to those who are registered or have legal documents.28 These restrictions render refugees highly dependent on international aid.

Policy Recommendations

Make the Global Compact a Binding Instrument

To address these shortcomings, members of the United Nations General Assembly should consider making the 2018 global compact for a Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF) a binding instrument with credible enforcement and implementation mechanisms.29 This global compact, issued in response to the current refugee crisis, attempts to mitigate its impact particularly for frontline countries through more equitable burden and responsibility sharing.30

Given the complexity of today’s conflicts and the difficulties of arriving and implementing plausible political solutions, the CRRF presents an opportunity for countries in the region to push for long-term, multiyear support that goes beyond humanitarian relief to include economic and infrastructure investments.31 Such multiyear commitments would take place through a ministerial-level Global Refugee Forum that would be held every four years. Lebanon’s foreign ministry has already expressed its interest in this aspect of the global compact. Jordan has also demonstrated interest in developing international burden-sharing tools, such as the 2016 Jordan compact adopted in partnership with the EU that seeks to open up employment opportunities for Syrian refugees in exchange of easing exports to Europe and development projects.32 Even though the Jordan compact did not meet its target of 200,000 work permits—only 37,000 Syrians had reportedly obtained these permits in 2017,33 while only seven companies have been allowed to export so far34—it still represents how this might work. Improving on this model could be both easy and effective.

The CRRF could allow the Arab region to turn the refugee crisis into an opportunity. By seeking to provide solutions in support of host countries, enhancing the self-reliance of refugees, and promoting their safe and dignified return to their home countries while expanding access to resettlement in third countries, the CRRF’s aims are compatible with the requests of host countries.35 Burden-sharing mechanisms included in the compact could potentially leave a positive impact on states themselves by enhancing their capacity in service provision, improving infrastructure, and boosting economic growth.

Improve Subregional Cooperation

Intergovernmental responses at the subregional level are an essential tool that countries in the region should use to mitigate the crisis. To that end, the CRRF also supports the establishment of mechanisms at the regional and subregional levels for addressing the refugee challenge; one that would allow more proactive coordination between Jordan, Lebanon, and also Turkey on policy options. Such coordination could include joint needs assessments and collective lobbying for long-term international commitments to humanitarian funding and for sustainable solutions to the crisis.

Global examples suggest that regional protocols and conventions have been used successfully by African as well as Latin American countries to address similar challenges. The Kampala Convention that was adopted by the African Union in 2012 was a major milestone for the protection of refugees and internally displaced persons in Africa, defining the responsibility of states in their protection and strongly condemning arbitrary displacement.36 Similarly, the Cartagena Declaration, adopted by a number of Latin American countries, reasserted the principle of the 1951 convention but adapted it to endemic regional challenges by extending the definition of refugees to include individuals fleeing gang-related violence.37

Develop a Multistakeholder Platform

The scale of the refugee crisis and the depth of its impact in the short, medium, and long terms on peace and prosperity in the Middle East requires the involvement of all sectors of society in the development of integrated and multifaceted refugee response plans. This includes international organizations, civil society organizations, municipal councils, the media, and the private sector.

An integrated plan may also minimize the duplication of initiatives among various organizations. Such plans would consider the fallout of the crisis on different fronts, such as access to education for refugees and to employment opportunities, the capacity-building needs at the national or local level for government personnel dealing with refugees, and the negative public rhetoric around refugees that only serves to undermine social cohesion. For example, collaborative efforts between media outlets and research centers could counter misinformation campaigns over the actual number of refugees or their impact on the labor market or on service-oriented sectors.38 Additionally, cooperation between international and local nongovernmental organizations (INGOs and NGOs) can help build the capacities of municipal personnel at the forefront of the crisis and, in the process, contribute to improved service delivery efforts. Private sector companies can also play a more proactive role in identifying employment opportunities best suited for refugees, reducing their dependence on government and NGO aid.39

Promote Long-Term Engagement for Development and Labor Inclusion

The international community should commit support that goes beyond current humanitarian relief to include development aid for host countries to rehabilitate and expand infrastructure networks and boost their economies. This aid should be accompanied by significant commitments from host countries to empower refugees economically by giving them access to the labor market and improving their living conditions. In turn, this would enable refugees to contribute positively to local communities and the economy.

National Reallocation of Power and Resources

Municipalities’ approaches to the refugee crisis have been molded by local politics as well as by the policies of central governments. The nonintegrative and security-driven approach toward refugees adopted by the central governments of Jordan and Lebanon left municipalities at the forefront of dealing with the refugee influx. However, it also opened the door, particularly in Lebanon, for local authorities to take on new roles, notably in security, and to use international donor support to build their own capacities and financial standing. This created considerable variations in locally generated measures to address refugee needs.

In both countries, local responses to the refugee influx were shaped by several factors.40 The crisis aggravated long-term structural governance challenges, including a highly centralized decisionmaking process as well as limited access to public funding for municipalities.41 In Jordan, for example, even the most minor decisions and expenditures require a signature from the relevant ministries, and dismissing a municipal employee on a permanent contract requires the prime minister’s approval. This is aggravated by the fact that the central government distributes funds to municipalities on the basis of their tax revenue (in Jordan) or registered population (in Lebanon) rather than on the size of the resident population or its development needs. This ultimately means that most funding goes to richer municipalities.42 Meanwhile, the jurisdiction of municipalities, over development and security issues, are ambiguous at best, especially in Lebanon. For example, it was unclear to municipalities how far their responsibilities extended toward Syrian individuals who were violating the Directorate of General Security’s residency conditions.43

These long-standing structural problems were further intensified in Lebanon by its recent political paralysis, epitomized by an inability to elect a president for more than two years (2014 to 2016). This meant that no clear, centrally led refugee policy was put in place, especially early in the crisis.44 While many municipalities restricted the movement of refugees through evening curfews, others provided them with work opportunities. And as some municipalities expelled refugees sponsored by individuals who did not reside within their administrative boundaries, others solicited international funding by adopting measures hospitable to refugees. Those that restricted the movement of refugees relied on circulars issued by the security cell established by the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities.45 So while the municipality of Kfar-Rimman in southern Lebanon applied restrictive measures, such as denying refugees access to public places and demanding the departure of Syrian refugees whose sponsor was not from the township, other municipalities such as that of Zghorta took a more cautious approach by refusing to impose curfews or to collect residency fees not mandated by law from refugees.46

In contrast, Jordan’s policies with regards to Syrian refugees were articulated in a government-led Jordan Refugee Response Plan and implemented by all relevant institutions. This meant that the response of Jordanian municipalities was somewhat more systematic.47 For instance, a specific directorate was created under the Ministry of Interior—known as the Syrian Refugees Affairs Directorate—to coordinate refugee issues in the country.48 Unlike Lebanon, the movement of Syrian refugees lacking valid identification documents is handled by the police rather than municipalities.49

Region-specific considerations as well as tribal or sectarian concerns, including the personality of the mayor, also played a role in defining local responses. For instance, the municipality of Mafraq has been more open toward refugees than other areas in Jordan, partially because of its stronger kinship ties with Syria’s Daraa. In Lebanon, Sunni-dominated municipalities are the least strict compared to Shia- and Christian-dominated municipalities when it comes to implementing curfews, in part because a majority of Syrian refugees are Sunni.50 This variation in municipal responses has meant that the impact of refugees at the municipal level has not been uniform. Refugees were more likely to settle in localities that were friendlier and more hospitable to them, especially when confronted with restrictive measures by the central government. As a result, these localities have faced more pressure on their infrastructure including waste disposal and water networks as well as social service delivery, while their financial resources remain limited compared to other less-welcoming municipalities.

The attitude of INGOs, shaped in part by central government frameworks for cooperation, also impacted municipal governance. While the crisis increased municipal access to financial resources and capacity-building opportunities from international nongovernmental organizations, the centralization of decisionmaking within specific ministries undermined their role in identifying policies based on local needs.51

Many municipalities are underresourced, have little control over their finances, and are unable to attract the skilled human capital needed to address the burgeoning pressure on their services. Meanwhile, the lead ministries chosen by the Lebanese and Jordanian governments as principal interlocutors with international organizations are often not the ones responsible for local governments. For instance, the lead ministries responding to the Syrian refugee crisis in Lebanon and Jordan were the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation,52 respectively, rather than the ministries that govern municipal affairs (the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities and the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, respectively).53 Moreover, even though both the Jordanian and Lebanese crisis response plans recognize the importance of supporting municipalities in capacity-building and service provision, both plans lack a well-defined coordination mechanism between international nongovernmental organizations and municipalities not only for project implementation but also for response planning.54

As a result, municipalities have faced several issues in dealing with INGOs. In Lebanon, mayors felt that the short-term emergency approach of INGOs did not address the long-term needs of their localities.55 They believed that an INGO program of action was more often than not shaped by donor priorities rather than local needs and believed them to be applying a one-model-fits-all approach to the refugee crisis, irrespective of local considerations. Some municipalities have grown increasingly skeptical of INGOs and believe them to be only interested in cooperating with local authorities for data collection rather than inclusive decisionmaking and planning.56

Policy Recommendations

Integrate Action Plans

At the national level, the government should promote an integrated approach to addressing the refugee crisis through a holistic action plan that outlines key challenges related to the crisis. Such a plan should involve all stakeholders engaged with addressing the ramifications of the refugee influx, including host communities and the refugees themselves. Through close collaboration with international organizations, the private sector, the press, academia, and civil society, such a plan can safeguard refugee rights, improve refugees’ well-being and their positive impact on the economy, and promote social cohesion by countering negative, fake news with regard to their impact on host communities.

Involve Local Governments in Refugee Policymaking

Ministries responsible for local governance should strive to build a platform for municipalities most affected by the refugee crisis; one that would allow such municipalities to discuss the challenges they face, learn from each other, pool financial and human resources, and present themselves as a unified front in national discussions or policymaking sessions related to refugee presence. Such a platform would also create a one-stop shop for other line ministries and for international organizations wishing to consult with local governments in the design of refugee-related policies. Such a platform could create an opportunity for municipalities to discuss their public investment priorities in ways that serve refugees and meet municipalities’ development needs. It would also allow international organizations to coordinate with municipalities throughout the different stages of the refugee response, that is, from planning through monitoring and evaluation to implementation. In time, this may rebuild trust between INGOs and municipalities and could facilitate municipalities’ collaboration with INGOs.

Provide Financial Incentives

Incentives should be provided to municipalities hosting larger numbers of refugees. In Lebanon, an example of such an incentive would be to allow municipalities that host refugees to keep a higher percentage of their collected taxes. Another option would be for central governments to transfer funds to municipalities based on their needs rather than their tax base.57

Enable Regional Planning

In addition, municipalities should be provided with more authority not only for service provision but also for strategic planning. Improving their planning capabilities would allow burden sharing between municipalities that could then pool resources to better cope with the refugee crisis and ensure synergies among their respective policies. For that to happen, central governments should set up the institutional framework for regional planning and regional coordination between municipalities. With better planning and implementation capabilities, INGOs are more likely to work with local governments as actual partners.

Enhance the Efficiency of Local Governance

Moreover, for local governance to be efficient, national governments and parliaments should simplify administrative procedures and introduce clear auditing measures to avoid corruption and increase transparency at the local level, especially during a crisis when there is a sudden increased demand on services.58

Safeguarding Refugee Rights: Exploring Durable Solutions

The paucity of durable solutions to the refugee crisis requires a brave and innovative approach. Currently available durable solutions, which usually involve three main options—repatriation, resettlement, or local integration—do not present a sustainable solution to the displacement of millions of people from their homes. This was already the case for Palestinian refugees.

The option of mass voluntary repatriation to Syria is unlikely to happen in the near future, given the persistence of multiple security and political challenges. These include a conscription law that forces young adults until the age of forty-two to enroll in the army,59 vetting procedures imposed by the regime,60 as well as the extensive destruction of Syrian cities.61 For refugees in Lebanon, where almost 70 percent are originally from the Homs, Idlib, Rif Dimashq, and Aleppo Governorates, this poses significant challenges because these governorates were among the most heavily destroyed during the war.62 In addition, the recently issued Law Number 10, which allows for the designation of property as a redevelopment zone, presents a real threat to refugees’ private property.63 And even though Assad has recently issued a presidential amnesty for military deserters and draft dodgers on the condition that they turn themselves over to the regime within four to six months and serve two years in the military, many Syrian refugees are wary that this amnesty, like the reconciliation deals, would be used to imprison them or even send them to their deaths. Other hurdles face refugees seeking to return to Iraq or Sudan, where the sectarian or ethnic aspects of the conflict and their displacement as well as weakened central authority pose specifically trying challenges to their return.

Since 2015, resettlement in European or other Western countries is also becoming increasingly difficult, if not outright impossible. Populist politicians and security incidents have contributed to the tightening of EU member states’ migration policy.64 European countries are eager to keep Syrian refugees in neighboring countries, as demonstrated by the European Union–Turkey deal whereby Turkey agreed to take back asylum seekers deported from Greece in exchange for $6 billion in aid.65 Similarly, the contribution of Gulf countries to the refugee crisis remains limited to humanitarian aid, and despite some flexibility toward Syrian migrants, GCC states have given no real signs they would be willing to change their asylum policies.

The option of integration in host countries is also a nonstarter for refugees. In Lebanon, public officials have loudly rejected the mere mention of naturalizing refugees,66 as they believe it would undermine the fragile sectarian demographic balance of the country. Lebanon’s foreign minister Gebran Bassil recently admonished the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for its call that all parties respect the voluntariness of return, and accused it of being “an organization which acts against (Lebanon’s) policy of preventing naturalization and returning the displaced to their homeland.”67 In a recent trip to Russia to discuss the return of refugees, Bassil also declared that “Lebanon refuses to tie the return of the refugees to the political solution [in Syria].”68 Even Turkey, which welcomed the largest number of Syrian refugees and naturalized about 12,000 of them, has recently called for the rapid return of refugees due to economic pressure and cultural differences.69

Finally, strict border policies imposed by neighboring host countries restrict the ability of refugees to move back and forth to Syria and impede the smooth, safe, and progressive return of refugees. As examples from other contexts indicate, repatriation often takes place progressively and is not immediately final. First, members of a household sometimes take multiple trips to the country of origin to ensure it is safe, and to secure the necessary arrangements for the family to return.70 Second, families often get split between those who stay in a host country for any number of reasons including fear for safety, continued education, or employment and those who return home to try it out.71 Movement back and forth allows families to ensure diverse income streams as some members of the family might try to work back home while others stay in exile to complete their education or a medical treatment. Currently, the UNHCR removes protection status from refugees the moment they cross the border to return to their countries of origin.72

As options for refugees become increasingly limited, and military actions take precedence over political solutions, international stakeholders involved in the Syrian conflict must seek a lasting political solution that would include the safe return of refugees to their homes with the requisite political and security guarantees. A strictly humanitarian approach to the refugee crisis that ignores its political roots cannot address the structural challenges that prevent mass voluntary return. As refugees feel increasingly trapped between host countries that want them out and a dangerous return home,73 significant efforts must be made by the international community to lessen the deplorable conditions faced by refugees on either side of the border. Such a plan should seek to alleviate the burden on host countries and improve refugees’ as well as their host communities’ living conditions while guaranteeing refugees’ rights to return voluntarily. Long-term aid for frontline countries should be increased and extended to economic and infrastructural aid. These measures aim to improve refugees’ living conditions, as well as their positive economic contribution to host countries. In parallel, concrete steps should be taken on the political front to ensure the safety and security of returnees.

Policy Recommendations

Safeguard the Right to Return

Recent policies and measures by the Syrian regime regarding property rights and mobility within Syria are imposing a de facto reality that could prevent millions from returning home. While non-refoulement and the voluntariness of return should remain key instruments of the international legal framework for refugees, an equal emphasis should be made on the right to return. International stakeholders should increase their pressure on the Syrian government to revoke measures that prevent refugee return, particularly potential donors to Syria’s reconstruction such as the EU. These measures include, as a priority, revoking or amending military conscription law , vetting procedures, and property laws to allow for the safe and sustainable return of refugees.

Advocate for the Legal Empowerment of Refugees

As restrictive legal measures against refugees are being taken on both sides of the border, access to legal knowledge becomes a necessity for refugees. In that regard, international organizations can help establish a cadre of Syrian lawyers or paralegals who would become familiar with Syria’s legal frameworks as well as the rights guaranteed through international conventions.74 In view of new urban development laws, these professionals could inform refugees about their rights particularly over housing, land, and property; these rights are likely to be at the center of key disputes in a postconflict Syria. This would also enable refugees to make an informed decision regarding return to Syria, as legislation regarding vetting and property rights remain complex and obscure.

Increase Cross-Border Mobility of Refugees

As the situation in Syria is likely to remain uncertain and unstable even after the end of hostilities, cross-border mobility will allow refugees to make an informed and aware decision about permanently returning to their areas of origin. Refugees should be allowed to move across the border within a specific time frame while preserving their refugee status. During that time frame, dependence on aid would decrease gradually as refugees restore their lives back to certain levels of normalcy. Mobility across borders also allows refugees to diversify their resources. This is especially important during prolonged conflict situations, when aid tends to drop with time and other, more recent conflicts take precedence.75

Concluding Remarks

The conflicts generating mass population movements from and within the Middle East have become global in nature, and their destabilizing effect can be felt far beyond its borders. Addressing their ramifications requires bold leadership and a sense of shared responsibility at the global, regional, and national levels. Without it, there can be no sustainable peace for the people of this region.

They were awarded the prize for their efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said.

“Denis Mukwege is the helper who has devoted his life to defending these victims. Nadia Murad is the witness who tells of the abuses perpetrated against herself and others,” it said in its citation.

“Each of them in their own way has helped to give greater visibility to war-time sexual violence, so that the perpetrators can be held accountable for their actions.”

Mukwege heads the Panzi Hospital in the eastern Congolese city of Bukavu. Opened in 1999, the clinic receives thousands of women each year, many of them requiring surgery from sexual violence.

Murad is an advocate for the Yazidi minority in Iraq and for refugee and women’s rights in general. She was enslaved and raped by Islamic State fighters in Mosul, Iraq, in 2014.

“Rape in war has been a crime for centuries. But it was a crime in the shadows. The two laureates have both shone a light on it,” said Dan Smith, Director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).

“Their achievements are really extraordinary in bringing international attention to the crime,” he told Reuters.

Yazidi women win Parliament's Sakharov prize Yazidi activists Nadia Murad and Lamiya Aji Bashar, victims of sexual slavery carried out by Islamic State, have won the European Parliament’s Sakharov Prize. EURACTIV Spain reports.

Mukwege, a past winner of the United Nations Human Rights Prize and the European Parliament’s Sakharov Prize, performed surgery on scores of women after they had been raped by armed men, and he campaigned to highlight their plight. He also provides HIV/AIDS treatment as well as free maternal care.

Although the Second Congo War, which killed more than five million people, formally ended in 2003, violence remains rampant, with militias frequently targeting civilians.

The hospital has also been the subject of threats, and in 2012 Mukwege’s home was invaded by armed men who held his daughters at gunpoint, shot at him and killed his bodyguard.

Shortly before that attack, he had denounced mass rape in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the impunity for it in a speech at the United Nations.

“He has risked his life to help women survive atrocity,” said SIPRI’s Smith.

Mukwege was in the operation room when he was told the news.

Congolese gynaecologist wins Sakharov Prize Dr. Denis Mukwege is the laureate of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought 2014, following the decision yesterday (21 October) by European Parliament President Martin Schulz and the political group leaders. Mukwege is a gynaecologist specialised in the treatment of rape victims and founder of the Panzi Hospital in Bukavu, in the Democratic Republic Congo.

“I can see in the faces of many women how they are happy to be recognized,” Mukwege told the Nobel Foundation in a recorded interview posted on the foundation’s Twitter account, referring to the patients at his Panzi hospital.

Wivine Moleka, a member of Congo’s ruling PPRD party, said Mukwege was more than just a doctor.

“He is a humanist who has taken the pain of women into consideration, pain in their flesh and in their soul. The prize sends a strong signal to everyone about these women who are raped every day,” she said.

Survival

“She’s crying right now. She’s crying, she can’t talk,” Nadia Murad’s brother told Norwegian public broadcaster NRK after the award was announced.

Later, a dazed-looking Murad declined to comment when approached by a Reuters reporter at a hotel in Boston in the United States, where she was staying a day after Harvard University gave her a humanitarian award. Her fiancé, Abid Shamdeen, said she would issue a statement shortly.

Murad had been scheduled to speak at Middlebury College in the state of Vermont on Friday evening, but the school said on Friday that she had canceled her appearance after winning the Nobel.

Murad was 21-years-old in 2014 when Islamic State militants attacked the village where she had grown up in northern Iraq. The militants killed those who refused to convert to Islam, including six of her brothers and her mother.

Along with many of the other young women in her village, she was taken into captivity by the militants, and sold repeatedly for sex as part of Islamic State’s slave trade.

She eventually escaped captivity with the help of a Sunni Muslim family in Mosul, the de facto IS capital in Iraq, and became an advocate for the rights of her community around the world.

Iraqi Kurdish diplomat: Helping Middle East now would be cost-effective for Europe Europe should engage in the Middle East by providing technical aid and promoting investment and programmes that enhance tolerance and peaceful coexistence, said Falah Mustafa Bakir in an interview.

In 2017, Murad published a memoir of her ordeal, “The Last Girl”. She recounted in harrowing detail her months in captivity, her escape and her journey to activism.

“At some point, there was rape and nothing else. This becomes your normal day,” she wrote.

The militants’ attack on Yazidi communities in northern Iraq was part of what the United Nations has called a genocidal campaign launched by the Sunni militants against the religious minority.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi congratulated her on the award, and Vian Dakhil, a Yazidi member of Iraq’s parliament, said: “It is the victory of good and peace over the forces of darkness.”

Murad, who is also a Sakharov Prize winner, is the second youngest Nobel Prize laureate after Malala Yousafzai.

Speak up

The award of the prize follows a year in which the abuse and mistreatment of women in all walks of life across the globe has been a focus of attention.

Asked whether the #metoo movement, a prominent women’s rights activist forum, was an inspiration for this year’s prize, Nobel Committee Chairwoman Berit Reiss-Andersen said: “Metoo and war crimes are not quite the same. But they have in common that they see the suffering of women, the abuse of women and that it is important that women leave the concept of shame behind and speak up.”

Norwegian Nobel Committee Secretary Olav Njoelstad said this year’s prize linked the effort to help war victims with those to rid the world of “evil, inhumane” arms by such organizations as anti-nuclear arms campaigner ICAN, last year’s laureate.

“This is one of the goals, hopes that this prize, and the efforts of those two people, as well as thousands of others will eventually lead to the abolishment of this practice of sexual violence against girls, women and sometimes men as a weapon in a military conflict, which is really, really inhumane,” he told Reuters.

The prize will be presented in Oslo on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who founded the awards in his 1895 will.","Denis Mukwege, a doctor who helps victims of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Nadia Murad, a Yazidi rights activist and survivor of sexual slavery by Islamic State, won the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize on Friday (5 October).

Burns on October 18, 2018 to honor the Civil Courage Prize recipient, Vladimir Kara-Murza.

There has never been a moment when civil courage, so brilliantly exemplified by Vladimir Kara-Murza, mattered more in our world than it does today. This is a moment when authoritarians feel the wind in their sails, and democracies—including the United States—are adrift and losing their way. This is a moment when the practiced repressive habits of autocrats seem ascendant, and the institutions that guard freedom and dignity are being hollowed out in too many ways in too many societies.

This is a moment when civil courage can seem an endangered species, with civil society embattled in autocracies of one stripe or another, and individual citizens in democratic systems trapped by fatalism and tribalism, and battered by rising inequalities and the endless cacophony of identity politics. Around the world, walls are coming up faster than they are coming down. The politics of fear is drowning out the politics of hope.

William J. Burns William J. Burns was president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He previously served as U.S. deputy secretary of state. More >

This is not an entirely new phenomenon. I’ve seen these corrosive trends building over the course of my checkered career as a diplomat.

I saw them in Russia, as the curious mix of hope and uncertainty that I experienced during my first tour in Moscow in the early 1990s gave way to the combustible combination of smoldering grievance, preening ambition, and cold-blooded repression that emerged in Vladimir Putin’s Russia, during my second tour as ambassador more than a decade ago.

I remember vividly speaking at the funeral of Anna Politkovskaya, shortly after her murder in 2006, only a year after she had received the Civil Courage Prize for her fearless reporting on Chechnya.

It was a cold late autumn afternoon in Moscow, with a few snowflakes falling as dusk settled, and long lines of mourners shuffling slowly toward the hall where her casket lay. Not a single senior Russian official showed up. So it fell to a couple of Anna’s courageous editors at Novaya Gazeta and me to try to honor her memory, and emphasize the significance of her life and work.

Nothing drove home to me more powerfully the callousness and oppressive bent of the Putin era than that bleak day. Putin made crystal clear where he stood. And it was important for the United States to make clear where we stood.

We could not afford to ignore our interests in Russia or forsake efforts to manage what was fast becoming an adversarial relationship. We definitely could not afford to give in to Putin’s aggression. And we certainly could not afford to give up on the Russia that lay beyond Putin, a Russia full of people proud of their complicated history, with no shortage of insecurities and challenges, but intent upon realizing their full human potential and dignity.

I also saw those difficult trends unfolding in the Middle East, through various professional incarnations over the past thirty-five years.

I stood in Tahrir Square in Cairo in February 2011, a week after Hosni Mubarak had been overthrown. It was impossible not to feel the sense of possibility that surged through Arab societies that spring, as decades of dysfunction and indignity seemed to be giving way to a more hopeful and more open future. But it didn’t take long for the forces of counterrevolution to gain momentum, and for that euphoric moment to fade. Peaceful popular uprisings gave way to a brutish civil war in Syria, bloody chaos in Libya, and a still-worsening human catastrophe in Yemen.

With growing impunity, Arab autocrats, often indulged by the United States and other foreign backers, have sought to stamp out rumblings of criticism and free expression. Like Anna Politkovskaya, Jamal Khashoggi was a stubbornly independent journalist, committed to realizing the best of which his country was capable, and unafraid to speak truth to power.

His abduction and apparent murder in Istanbul, in a Saudi diplomatic facility, reportedly at the direction of the Saudi leadership, is a horrific act. It demands that the U.S. government and others around the world offer strong condemnation and tangible consequences—not the tacit encouragement for overreach that has bred such horrendous conditions in Yemen and led to the awful fate of Jamal Khashoggi.

It has always been an illusion to think that stability is a static phenomenon, that strongmen and their closed political systems provide a prescription for sustainable societies. They eventually become brittle and break, and they invariably become less reliable partners. Failing to understand the deeper drivers of change in the Middle East, or any other part of the world, is a persistent weakness of American foreign policy.

The United States is hardly immune to those same troubling trends.

President Donald Trump did not invent the dysfunctions of our own society—the mounting sense of inequality of wealth and opportunity; the anxiety and frustration of people who feel their role and cultural identity is eroding; the wave of anger from citizens whose boats haven’t been lifted by globalization even as many of the architects of the 2008 financial crisis quickly righted themselves; the disconnect between wide swaths of the population who question American leadership after the costly and undisciplined military adventures of the post-9/11 era, and a Washington establishment that continues to preach the virtues of global engagement without acknowledging the mistakes we’ve made.

But I fear that this administration is making all these troubles much worse. Untethered to history or experience, the president has stirred a nasty brew of muscular unilateralism, mercantilism, and transactionalism. His is a diplomacy of narcissism and narrow dealmaking, not of institutions and alliances—the strengths that set us apart from lonelier powers like Russia and China. His is a rhetoric of mean spirit and division, of attacks on journalists as “enemies of the people” and public servants as a hostile “deep state.” That can only inhibit freedom of expression, undermine truth, and alienate citizens from their government.

Many years of representing the United States abroad have taught me that it is the power of our example, more than the power of our preaching, which can amplify all our other sources of military, economic, and political influence. Sadly, we are rapidly corroding that image, the idea of America that has so often proven, despite all our imperfections and failings, to be one of our most potent sources of power.

However much they may resent particular American policies, people around the world are drawn to the idea of America, to a place of possibility and mobility and openness, where the rule of law protects the less fortunate and preserves hope. What people see today is polarization, incivility, policy gridlock, images of immigrant children separated from their families, crumbling infrastructure, and fact-free public discourse.

In the Trump era, values have receded rapidly in the American foreign policy calculus. Human rights seem an afterthought, their significance discounted, sometimes used as a tool against dictatorial adversaries, but often ignored in the case of dictatorial partners we prefer to indulge.

I would be the last person to argue that our record in previous administrations has been pristine in this regard. I’ve made my own share of mistakes in prioritizing practical, near-term interests over full-throated defense of human rights. In administrations of both parties that I’ve served, we’ve often gotten the balance wrong. But I’ve never witnessed the kind of conscious, unapologetic disregard for human rights concerns that seems to be the norm so far in this administration. This is not only morally indefensible, but practically counterproductive, undercutting our own strategic interests over the long term.

There are two lessons we should draw from this depressing landscape.

First, the sooner policymakers realize the foolishness of a strategy devoid of values, and reverse it, the better. We will not always get the balance right, and we will inevitably produce disappointments and make unappealing trade-offs. But the willful Hobbesian dismissiveness of this administration toward many human rights concerns will only undercut our interests, and make our policies nasty, brutish, and short-sighted.

At its best, American foreign policy has been animated by a sense of enlightened self-interest, in which we see a wider purpose to enlarging the circle of countries and societies that share our values and interests, and have a common stake in just, workable international rules of the road. What we’ve seen over the past couple years is much more about the “self” part than the “enlightened,” and that is an historic mistake.

The second lesson is about the profound importance of civil courage in any society, democratic or authoritarian or somewhere in between.

Without brave individuals like Anna Politkovskaya or Jamal Khashoggi, without courageous exemplars like Vladimir Kara-Murza, societies wither and drift.

Their fearlessness should give us the hope and courage to stand up for justice and address the flaws and challenges of our world. Authoritarians traffic in fear, and depriving them of that weapon is our surest path to a better future. We all owe an enormous debt to those who show us the way, at grave personal risk, and we honor them not only by awards like this one, but by how we live their examples.","This is adapted from a speech given by Carnegie President William J.

87,https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/how-universities-can-help-peace-and-reconciliation-thrive,"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Times Higher Education (THE),How universities can help peace and reconciliation to thrive,"“There has never been a more pressing time” to ask questions about peace and reconciliation, according to Joanna Newman, chief executive and secretary general of the Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU).

In parts of the world, “borders [are] closing, and so are minds”, Dr Newman said. “Universities have a role to keep minds and borders open. Yet universities are also part of countries [and] regions that have experienced violent conflict, colonial oppression, the eradication of indigenous languages and rights.”

Such circumstances have raised a number of core issues, Dr Newman went on, about how universities should “reflect the world today in their curricula”, and “the role they should play in reconciliation”. It is such concerns that have led the ACU to develop plans for a new Peace and Reconciliation Network, launched last week at the University of Melbourne.

“There was a really big response to our call,” reported Dr Newman, and “more than 30 countries and 60 institutions wanted to attend”, although “visas for some of the African delegates were late or didn’t come at all”.

At the event, a highly diverse group of 30 delegates – from Australia, Canada, Fiji, India, Kenya, Malawi, New Zealand, Kenya, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka and the UK – were able to attend “a scoping meeting, to determine what the network is going to deliver and what we want it to do”. Host Shaun Ewen, Melbourne’s pro vice-chancellor (Indigenous), will serve as its first chair.

Some delegates already have extensive experience of addressing historic injustices.

Victoria Haskins is co-director of the Purai Global Indigenous and Diaspora Research Studies Centre at the University of Newcastle, Australia. This centre “provides a national and international network of researchers who work in the areas of indigenous and diaspora studies, and other topics that touch on issues of race and society”.

She and fellow director John Maynard have carried out research on the history of the New South Wales Aborigines Protection/Welfare Board and co-authored a book on “the experiences of non-Indigenous people who were taken in by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in the early colonial period”, which has “a strong reconciliation message and has reached a wider audience through the Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio podcasts”, Professor Haskins said.

Newcastle’s Centre for the History of Violence has produced an interactive map of historical massacres of Indigenous people in Australia, while architectural students, according to Professor Haskins, have been helping to “design infrastructure for community centres and town camps in the central Australian township”.

Yet although an “international network” is already at the heart of the work of the Purai Centre, she added, the new network would enable the centre to ramp up its activities through developing further research partnerships and “providing a collegial space for researchers visiting us from other Commonwealth countries for the purposes of researching indigenous topics and race/diaspora issues, including issues around refugees and transnational issues of race”.

For Krushil Watene, a senior lecturer on the philosophy programme at Massey University in New Zealand, an important thread of the discussions at Melbourne had been “addressing the need to recognise the significance of indigenous philosophies, and highlighting the importance of indigenous concerns. A central focus here centres on our willingness to face our histories and contemporary realities – of oppression, subjugation, persecution – in ways that create real space for new beginnings.”

Given that “reconciliation is centrally about improving and transforming relationships”, Dr Watene said she believes that “the network provides a platform for doing this by bringing together perspectives and experiences that might not otherwise have the opportunity to engage, leading to deeper conversations with scholars, activists and communities themselves – and to enhanced conceptions and understandings of reconciliation, restorative and transitional justice in Commonwealth countries”. It should also “generate important resources for teaching and learning at undergraduate and postgraduate levels”, she added.

While acknowledging “the specific benefits and specific learnings that can come from a regional approach to peace and reconciliation”, Professor Ewen said that the new ACU network still offers a “unique value proposition” through providing “a shared engagement with the [whole] Commonwealth”, based on “a historical experience of empire”, but also offering “a diverse, unique and local set of contexts within which to share, and learn”.

Yet this raises an obvious question. The “historical experience of empire” hardly played out in the same way across the different territories of the Commonwealth, so isn’t there a danger of a north-south divide within attempts at forging academic partnerships, particularly when addressing contentious political themes around the legacy of colonialism and indigenous rights?

In response to this, Dr Newman stressed that “many of the issues discussed [at Melbourne] were common across all continents and situations, whether rich or poor. They include issues like widening participation, [developing curricula that support] marginalised groups to engage with learning, and values such as how traditional knowledge systems are valued and taught in academia.” Indeed, peace and reconciliation seem to her to cut across “traditional dialogues of development”.

Dr Newman cited the case of a Kenyan delegate who “talked about how Africa’s rapid progress is sometimes at the expense of traditional languages and knowledge systems – whereas, for her, Canadian and Australian and New Zealand delegates were putting indigenous culture and language at the root and heart of university systems”. Developed countries also have much to learn from “the aftermath of recent conflicts in Sri Lanka, Rwanda and South Africa”, she added.

There are striking examples of learning and sharing across widely different cultures.

“When a house is totally self-destructing,” reflected Unaisi Walu Nabobo Baba, professor of education research at Fiji National University, “we can’t always resolve problems from within. The presence of this network might just bring about strength, and ideas about how we can work together…I had forgotten how interesting it is for all of us in the Commonwealth to come together – for example, when I started talking to someone from Papua New Guinea, someone from Sri Lanka added more insight from a completely different region and context.”

Meanwhile, Helen Pauline Ambasa Ombima, director of legal services at the United States International University-Africa in Kenya, “was going to take away the importance of staying rooted and grounded to who I am, and the African that I am. To be honest, I never thought I’d be at a forum where people who are not African would be speaking a native language and taking pride in that. It completely blew me away and renewed a sense of pride in my own identity.”

So how is it possible to maintain the momentum created by the Melbourne “scoping meeting”?

It was agreed, as Professor Ewen put it, that “universities have an important role to play in “nation-building”, and addressing issues that emerge out of post-conflict and/or colonial-settler contexts. These roles include research on peace and reconciliation initiatives, development of curricula that address these issues (including global comparative content), and universities themselves engaging in reform that helps to address issues of the past. Potential reforms could include employment and student recruitment plans for previously marginalised groups (such as indigenous communities).

“On the basis of this content, it was agreed that we will develop some key working groups to progress the above,” said Professor Ewen.

For her part, Dr Newman set out a number of other ways that the Melbourne meeting provided solid foundations for future initiatives. The network has already sketched in what she called a “conceptual framework”. This is based on a number of core principles: “a disruption of the colonial concept of the Commonwealth, redefining and reordering relations based on a ‘common weal’ and including indigenous perspectives”, “a consideration of universities’ ongoing and evolving role in ‘nation-building’”, and “an understanding that sustainable relations depend on restitution/construction of land relations and ownership”.

Picture by Hugh Russell

Former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton has urged Northern Ireland's politicians to ""put their quarrels aside"" and form an interim government.

Several rounds of talks aimed at restoring the institutions have failed since the power-sharing government collapsed in January 2017.

Mrs Clinton has now urged that an interim government be formed to steer Northern Ireland through the UK's exit from the European Union.

The former US presidential candidate made the call to a high-powered audience which included former first minister Peter Robinson and Sinn Fein deputy leader Michelle O'Neill.

""The policy disagreements dividing your political parties are deeply felt but the stakes of the Brexit process go way beyond politics as usual,"" she said.

""I wonder if would it be possible for the people of Northern Ireland and those who represent them both in Westminster and here could figure out a way to form an interim community government for the purposes of securing the best possible Brexit outcome for Northern Ireland.

""Back in 2016, Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness wrote a joint letter to prime minister May about their Brexit priorities and concerns, that's a long time ago in political years but a similarly unified voice could be valuable in the difficult days ahead.

""Imagine a functional executive that speaks for all the people of Northern Ireland, weighing in on the final negotiations and implementation of whatever plan emerges.

""Imagine an Executive reassuring companies and investors already skittish about Brexit, sending a clear message that no matter what happens, Northern Ireland is open for business.""

Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was in Belfast on October 10. Picture by Hugh Russell

The former US presidential candidate was at Queen's University, Belfast to receive an honorary degree.

Mrs Clinton first visited Northern Ireland in 1995 at a crucial time for the peace process.

She accompanied Bill Clinton as he became the first serving US president to visit Northern Ireland and they were greeted by huge crowds of well-wishers.

They switched on the Christmas lights in Belfast during a hugely symbolic visit. More than two decades on, Ms Clinton said the world was still looking to Northern Ireland for hope.

""The world is watching, Northern Ireland has been a symbol to people everywhere, democracy's power to transcend divisions and deliver prosperity, peace and progress,"" she said.

""We need that, that symbol, that reality now more than ever.""

Ms Clinton concluded her remarks by saying Northern Ireland will remain in her prayers.

""Peace not paralysis, you deserve that better future, you always have,"" Ms Clinton told the Belfast audience.

""I will pray and trust that it comes to pass. I and many of us in the United States will never stop standing with you, and cheering you on this journey.""

Earlier in the ceremony, Ms Clinton welcomed a new scholarship in her name which was announced by Queen's Pro Vice Chancellor Adrienne Scullion.

The Hillary Rodham Clinton scholarship will be available for post-graduate study in politics, human rights and peace building.

A small number of protesters, including People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll, gathered outside the university's grounds. Some of the protesters are carrying placards reading, ""no honours for war criminals"".","Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was in Belfast on October 10.

Many fast-growing cities create conditions of significant disparities in standards of living, which can set up a fertile environment for violence and conflict.

The World Forum of Madrid offers a timely opportunity to reflect on how we can build cities that promote a culture of peace, ensure equal rights and access to public goods and services, and ultimately, provide protection and safety to all.

Who can address urban violence and conflict?

Local governments are the primary actors that can tackle the roots causes of violence and conflict, and reduce inequalities in urban areas. They know the challenges that their citizens face. In most countries, they also have the mandate and responsibilities to find the solutions and take action.

Dozens of city leaders from around the world are already working hard in this regard by adopting policies and implementing strategies to localize the Sustainable Development Goals. They are striving to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable (SDG 11), while promoting peaceful and inclusive societies, providing access to justice for all and building effective and accountable institutions (SDG 16). But this is not an easy task that can be taken by local governments alone; it depends on the active engagement of all societal actors and coordination with central governments.

Local action as a crucial building block for the UN Sustaining Peace Agenda

In 2016, the General Assembly and the Security Council came together to express their commitment to building and sustaining peace. In the two resolutions (A/RES/70/262 and S/RES/ 2282) highlighted the need for national governments to work better together to sustain peace at all stages of conflict and in all its dimensions, and stressed that sustaining peace was imperative to prevent the outbreak, escalation, continuation and recurrence of conflict. The Secretary-General, in turn, has sought to develop a coherent vision, tools and approaches to better support member states and civil society in building more peaceful and just societies, as in his peacebuilding and sustaining peace report (A/72/707-S/2018/43).

Cities taking the lead

In organizing the second forum 2nd World Forum on Urban Violence and Education for Coexistence and Peace, the city of Madrid is setting the stage for many actors to discuss how more peaceful societies can be built by dedicated action at the city level, but also showing continued commitment to facilitate a city movement dedicated to foster a culture of peace. The forum will include a session - organised by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) - where UN (UNDP, UN-Habitat, UNICEF, PBSO) and global city leaders will discuss how can the local vision and initiative, and the international agenda for sustaining peace can be better integrated and mutually reinforce each other.

UNDP’s engagement

UNDP provides local governments guidance and support to foster an inclusive and accountable urban governance. Responsive local governments, inclusive local governance and local development arrangements are the building blocks of peace. Working with local governments, the aim is to foster social cohesion in divided communities, encourage participation in public life, distribute resources and opportunities equitably, and test new forms of participatory decision-making processes. For example, in partnership with the City of Madrid, Spain, UNDP is facilitating the sharing of innovative practices with cities of Latin America and Africa to promote participatory processes and engage citizens, also through the use of digital technology, and in the co-creation of public policies for inclusive and sustainable cities. By promoting such partnerships, UNDP connects committed local decision-makers with their counterparts from around the globe, so they can share vision, challenges and innovative solutions to achieve more peaceful and just societies.","Who can address urban violence and conflict?

The Forum convened with the aim of reviving and improving global governance, during which Heads of State and Government showcased their efforts in this regard. Initiated by Macron, the Forum, which convened from 11-13 November in Paris, France, brought together all stakeholders working on global governance issues to discuss the most pressing challenges the world faces nowadays and find concrete solutions.

Macron, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, World Trade Organization (WTO) Director-General Roberto Azevêdo, UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Director-General Audrey Azoulay, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Secretary-General Angel Gurría, World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Christine Lagarde and International Labour Organization (ILO) Director-General Guy Ryder issued a joint declaration following their meeting during the Forum.

Challenges for peace and security require collective action and global and multilateral solutions.

In the statement, the leaders welcome cooperation in such areas as maintaining international peace and security, protecting the environment and biodiversity, achieving the SDGs, international trade and investments, human rights and gender equality, and the fight against corruption and tax avoidance and evasion.

The statement notes that challenges for peace and security such as climate change, nuclear weapons proliferation, terrorism, pandemics, food insecurity, water scarcity and trade conflicts are global in scope and require collective action, with the participation of all countries, as well as global and multilateral solutions.

The joint declaration underscores:

the importance of multilateral policies focused on conflict prevention and the need to foster adapted tools and strategies in this regard;

the need to promote inclusive approaches that support the diverse range of missions and consider the peace nexus that includes conflict resolution, peacekeeping, peacebuilding, humanitarian aid, decent work and development;

the fostering of international cooperation to harness the potential of the digital transformation for the benefit of all citizens;

the need to enhance collaboration and partnerships, including with the business community, social partners, financial institutions, civil society and regional and sub-regional organizations; and

the need for innovation, reform and the provision of political support and adequate resources.

During the forum, 121 projects were presented, of which ten global governance solutions were selected for follow up and special support for a year, including those addressing climate resilient zero-budget natural farming in Andhra Pradesh, India, by the local government; data to combat torture by the World Justice Project; and youth by the African Union Commission and the EU.

91,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-secretary-general-details-new-elements-of-peace-and-security-architecture/,"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Secretary-General Details New Elements of Peace and Security Architecture,"14 November 2018: UN Secretary-General António Guterres has provided an update on reforming the UN’s peace and security pillar, particularly on the Standing Principals’ Group and the four stand-alone divisions for Africa that will operate under the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and the Department of Peace Operations.

The reform of the UN peace and security pillar complements two other areas of reform overseen by the UN Secretary-General, related to the UN development system and UN management. A recently launched UN website provides information, news and resources on the three areas of reform.

In resolution A/RES/72/262 C on ‘Special subjects relating to the programme budget for the biennium 2018–2019,’ the UN General Assembly (UNGA) expressed support for the reform of the peace and security pillar as envisioned by the UN Secretary-General, and endorsed the establishment of the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs (DPPA) and the Department of Peace Operations (DPO). The resolution notes the intention of the UN Secretary-General to establish and chair a Standing Principals’ Group (SPG) to provide unified leadership for strategic, political and operational responsibilities, and requests him to present information to the UNGA on its functioning and composition.

In response to this request, in a letter addressed to the UNGA President on 14 November 2018, Guterres notes that the SPG will be an internal management mechanism to ensure coherence and unified decision-making between DPPA and DPO, and to facilitate coherence at UN Headquarters and in the field. According to the letter, the SPG will be chaired by the UN Secretary-General with the participation of: the UN Chef de Cabinet; the UN Under-Secretaries-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and for Peace Operations; and the Under-Secretaries-General of the Offices of Counter-Terrorism and of Disarmament Affairs. The letter adds that other UN entities may be invited to participate as needed and in an advisory capacity.

On functions, the UN Secretary-General indicates that the SPG will meet quarterly, and on an ad hoc basis as required, to: facilitate coordination, communication and coherence in the implementation of peace and security priorities; support managerial and leadership coherence at UN Headquarters and in the field; and resolve possible differences on political and operational issues. It clarifies that the SPG will not duplicate existing strategic-level decision-making mechanisms in the UN Secretariat, but bring greater coherence and unified decision-making to peace and security matters.

The four divisions for Africa will operate “within the single regional political operational structure” of the DPPA and DPO, effective 1 January 2019.

UNGA resolution A/RES/72/262 C also decides to establish four stand-alone divisions for Africa, effective from 1 January 2019, within approved resources, and requests the UN Secretary-General to present information on the organizational structure of these divisions, taking into account views expressed by UN Member States. In this regard, Guterres’ letter provides a paper outlining specific responsibilities for the divisions of Northern Africa, Western Africa, Eastern Africa, and Central and Southern Africa.

Per the paper, the four divisions will be responsible for the broad spectrum of UN work in early warning, prevention of conflict, peacebuilding, mediation, sustaining peace, backstopping of special political missions, and peacekeeping operations in designated sub-regions or geographical areas. The divisions will operate “within the single regional political-operational structure” of the DPPA and the DPO, effective 1 January 2019.

The paper specifies which countries will be covered by each division, as follows:

the Northern Africa Division will cover Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia and Western Sahara;

the Western Africa Division will cover Benin, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Cote d Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo;

the Eastern Africa Division will cover Comoros, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Rwanda, Seychelles, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda; and

the Central and Southern Africa Division will cover Angola, Burundi, Botswana, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Sao Tome and Principe, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

The UN’s webpage on the peace and security reforms outlines the respective roles of the two new departments, the overarching goals of the reform, relevant resolutions and reports, and the five elements of the reform process.

92,https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/11/09/what-the-paris-peace-forum-tells-us-about-france-and-about-the-world/,"Fri, 09 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Brookings Institution,What the Paris Peace Forum tells us about France—and about the world,"On Sunday November 11, 60 world leaders will join French President Emmanuel Macron in inaugurating the first edition of the Paris Peace Forum, a few hours after commemorating the centenary of the armistice that ended World War I. Although President Donald Trump is attending the armistice commemorations too, he will be boarding a flight back to Washington at the time when the forum opens.

No one knows what to make of the snub—Trump’s participation in the Forum was still a mystery less than a week before the start date. French diplomats speculated sarcastically that the reason for the uncertainty is that no one in the Trump administration had dared mention the conference to the president.

Indeed, the “America First” leader will find very little to like in the Paris Peace Forum. One of the signature events of Macron’s presidency stands in direct contrast with Trump’s sovereignty message, and the unilateralist and interest-driven foreign policy that goes with it. The forum is not a summit or a conference, but a gathering of “actors of global governance,” coming to “debate” and garner support for collective “solutions” for global governance and peace. Not exactly your Trumpian cup of tea.

Beyond the feel-good mission statement, the forum is indicative of today’s times. In an era of strengthened nationalism and great power competition, the rest of the world is looking for new approaches to save global cooperation. France—and Macron—are taking the lead to empower a global “resistance” of multilateralists hoping to salvage, or rebuild, a dwindling rules-based order. The question remains open whether the multilateralists can do that without U.S. leadership. Under Trump’s “America First,” the United States is self-isolating, and risks missing the opportunity to orient the rules of tomorrow, leaving others a chance to fill the vacuum.

“The Rest” matters

In practice, the first edition of the Forum will host around 2,500 people in the Grande Halle de la Villette, a former slaughterhouse turned cultural center on the northeast edge of Paris. Attendees from government, businesses, NGOs, foundations, the media, think tanks, and religious institutions from all corners of the world will take part in dozens of simultaneous debates—or agoras—on global challenges, will wander around stands presenting and raising support for 119 global governance projects—selected from a pool of 848 applicants—or will join the live hackathon on global financial transparency.

France has decided to adjoin the first edition of the forum to the commemorative celebrations of the 1918 armistice, so as to ensure strong heads of state and/or government participation and offer some war-and-peace gravitas to the forum. The world leaders will attend a lunch at the Élysée Palace after the ceremonies, then travel by bus to the forum, where they will listen to opening speeches by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.N. Secretary General António Guterres, before participating, on a voluntary basis, in workshops, debates, and other gatherings within the Grande Halle. At the time of writing, it is still unknown who will do what.

The forum was born out of the ambition to secure France’s place on the map of arenas where the fate of the world is discussed—such as the Munich Security Conference, the Shangri-La Dialogue, or Davos. Most other forums deal with security and the economy, and France hoped to make a different kind of contribution. The country’s priorities as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and a major advanced economy are far from parochial, and there are few global challenges which France does not want to touch. “Peace,” a universal ideal, is the umbrella concept for the five themes of the forum: development, environment, inclusive economy, new technologies, and peace and security.

The forum is intentionally non-Western-centric. The 119 projects selected to be presented at the forum originate from 42 countries and 10 international organizations. The 15-member steering committee gathers prominent individuals from five continents. France views itself as a bridge between the North and the South in yesterday’s world, the West and the Rest in today’s. Its four-corners-of-the-world colonial past gives France a massive network of partners and allies, in the name of which the country enjoys speaking in international organizations—although, in their eyes, France remains most often a European power, suspect of grandstanding for the sake of its own grandeur.

The French state hardly contributes financially to the forum, and the organizers preferred looking for non-Western support. The Mo Ibrahim Foundation is a founding member and Abu Dhabi’s environment agency a “grand partner,” but American philanthropy (Microsoft, the Rockefeller Foundation) and German public and foundation money (Germany’s development agency GIZ, the Körber Foundation) end up being unavoidable—that is where the big bucks are. The French have also publicized the forum outside Europe and North America as much as possible—and ended up flying in participants from poorer regions to reach their objective of inclusivity. A diverse crowd will be one of the metrics of the forum’s success.

Reinventing global cooperation

The forum is meant to be a contribution to multilateral efforts and the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals. Macron has called repeatedly for “strong multilateralism,” and under his leadership, in line with a long French tradition, France is contributing to U.N. efforts on global challenges, in particular education and climate. However, compared to these more formal initiatives, the Paris Peace Forum has a distinct “Macron touch”: first, an implicit admission that the established multilateral system has failed, second, a brazen ambition that it can be fixed by betting on out-of-the-box solutions.

At the World Economic Forum, in January 2018, the French president warned that globalization was in “a significant crisis,” because of “the concentration of wealth” and a “new innovation and skills economy” that leave the middle and working classes on the curb. In order to make globalization acceptable to all, new “basic rules for the common good” needs to be negotiated—on labor, taxation, climate, trade, but also urbanization, migration, and technology. At the OECD in May 2018, Macron doubled down with proposals on reforming the World Trade Organization and introducing new topics for discussions at the OECD or the G20.

So far, Macron’s attempts to reform multilateral institutions have disappointed. A proposal by France to discuss reforming the WTO with China, Japan, the EU and the United States on November 11 has not led anywhere, mostly because America is uninterested. Frustrated and ambitious, Macron is looking for alternatives—the Paris Peace Forum is the venue to channel all that drive.

The forum is clearly oriented towards rules creation: Among the projects presented is a “Partnership for Regional Ocean Governance” that aims at fostering a better governance of the marine environment, and the “Digital Peace Project,” a Microsoft initiative to help lay the foundation of a safer digital world. The American tech giants are heavily invested in the forum—Microsoft is a major sponsor, Google and Twitter participate in debates, Google and Facebook each present three projects, including Facebook’s on “election integrity”—signaling their interest for innovative rule-making bodies.

The world without Trump

At this point, it is too early to tell whether the forum will have sustaining power. Will the press, the public, and the participants become interested enough in the projects that they are willing to see their progress through (10 projects will be honored at the end of the forum, and monitored afterwards)? Will participants from non-Western countries feel represented and valued, rather than being used by Macron to give the forum a veneer of inclusion?

Regrettably, the Paris Peace Forum will not address some of the most pressing issues regarding peace and security in the world today: civil/proxy wars in Yemen and Syria, North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, or rising tensions between the United States and China. Truth be told, these are long-term crises implicating great powers’ spheres of influence and high-stake military interests, hardly solvable by a bottom-up approach.

Yet, Macron, who likes to portray himself as a clear-eyed pragmatist willing to engage with autocratic or populist leaders, imagined the forum to be a platform where everything can be debated—including a very un-French ban on nuclear weapons. All leaders in attendance will have a chance to present their vision, including Russian President Vladimir Putin or Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The Chinese president is not in attendance, yet his big political project, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), will be presented by the Chinese embassy as a project under the label “inclusive economy.” Beyond the obvious understatement of BRI as a simple “project,” its inclusion is indicative of the ambiguity of the French approach: Should committed multilateralists be focused on the diffusion of liberal norms and standards? Or should the forum be truly inclusive, up to the point of presenting all worldviews, including those antithetical to the idea of a rules-based order?

The American president’s absence at the forum reflects the American unmooring from the world of multilateralism.

In that case, what about Donald Trump? In the most recent phone call between Trump and Macron in October, the French president did not even mention the forum to his American counterpart—and keep in mind that this is a presidential initiative gathering 60 world leaders, not a small event. The limits of the Macron-Trump partnership is on full display here: It works as long as they deal with bilateral issues, but they stand on opposite side of the political spectrum on everything else. So as to avoid jeopardizing their relationship, the Frenchman appears to be avoiding all irritants, including the forum.

Yet this is a mistake. Donald Trump needs to hear what the “good will powers,” as French minister of foreign affairs calls them, and civil society from all over the world have to say. At its heart, the Paris Peace Forum fundamentally aims to be a rejection of the world of Trump, Putin, and Xi, a “civil society” answer to the deficiencies of great powers, and a “populist” response to out-of-touch governments and sleepwalking institutions, in the hope of transcending the status quo and reviving multilateralism. American NGOs, think tanks, foundations and businesses are heavily invested in the project. But the American president’s absence at the forum reflects the American unmooring from the world of multilateralism and international institutions that it did much to shape since the armistice, from the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 to the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015, and a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of power in the 21st century. Once again isolating itself under President Trump, the United States is losing an opportunity for America to influence tomorrow’s rules of engagement, and gifting others, including China and Russia, a chance to advance their competing visions.","On Sunday November 11, 60 world leaders will join French President Emmanuel Macron in inaugurating the first edition of the Paris Peace Forum, a few hours after commemorating the centenary of the armistice that ended World War I.

With the new leadership of Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi and President Barham Salih—both widely touted as reformist, progressive, and Western-leaning—there are high hopes that the country will turn a new chapter after three bloody and arduous years of combatting the so-called Islamic State. Iraq has a multitude of problems, but with this new coalition government, which includes Iraq’s main communities and factions (Mahdi is a Shia politician, Salih a Kurdish one), there could be an important opportunity to seize the momentum and move the country forward.

Not out of the woods

There are still major challenges to preventing an ISIS comeback and addressing sectarian divisions, the grievances of Arab Sunnis, and weak institutions. Iraq continues to suffer from dilapidated infrastructure, endemic corruption, vulnerability to outside influence, a bloated public sector, and a rapidly growing population. In other words, reforming Iraq will take years, if not decades.

The new government takes shape amid widespread and vociferous public demands for reform. Iraq’s most recent prime minister, Haidar al-Abadi, failed to win another term amid public discontent and opposition from the powerful Shiite clergy, which stood against him because of his abysmal record in office. With Abadi out, it is the first time in 13 years that Iraq is no longer led by the Islamic Dawa Party, which in many ways failed to satisfy public expectations. It was under then-Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki’s sectarian watch that Mosul fell to ISIS in June 2014.

Prime Minister Mahdi, a compromise candidate, will have his work cut out for him in the face of a dysfunctional political system and institutional paralysis—problems that may take generations to rectify. He inherits a more than decade-old ethno-sectarian power-sharing structure. Furthermore, both Mahdi and Salih face pressures and constraints from their own respective communities: Mahdi, a longstanding member of the Shiite ruling class has still to complete his cabinet, amid pressure from rival powerful Shiite factions who may torpedo his efforts to govern or advance reforms; Salih, a longstanding senior member of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and former Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) prime minister was controversially appointed against the will of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), Kurdistan’s most powerful party.

A bright spot?

In spite of real challenges, there are areas where the country can capitalize on openings for peace and stability. On Friday, oil exports from Kirkuk were restarted—this, after being halted last October over the standoff between Erbil and Baghdad over the historic Kurdish independence referendum. If the two capitals—aided by the presence of a new face in Baghdad—can build on this momentum to address other disputes (related to territory, hydrocarbons, and revenue-sharing), there could be positive reverberations around the country. The politics won’t be easy, but economic realities can reinforce the peace-building process.

Resolving tensions would send the right signals to Iraq’s discontented and disenfranchised communities and could reduce polarization—developments that would help prevent an ISIS comeback. That would help kickstart Iraq’s much-needed reconstruction phase.

Last autumn, Kurds and Arabs became embroiled in a conflict in the coveted, disputed territory of Kirkuk. The immediate source of the clash was the Kurdish independence referendum, which took place despite strong opposition from the United States, Baghdad, and Iraq’s neighbors. (94 percent of Kurdish voters backed secession.) Under then-Prime Minister Abadi’s orders, Baghdad launched an offensive in October—involving the military and Shiite militias—against Peshmerga forces in Kirkuk. The Kurdish nationalist discourse was provocative, no doubt; at the same time, the Iraqi state—as the sovereign—bore the burden to respond responsibly, which it did not. The debacle did not just reinforce Kurdish nationalism and suspicions toward Baghdad, but it also worsened Arab-Kurdish relations.

Years of investments in reconciliation and peace-building can be destroyed in a matter of hours or days.

It should have never been so easy for U.S.-aligned officials (Abadi) to use violence to advance a political agenda against other U.S.-aligned actors (the Kurds). It’s an important reminder that years of investments in reconciliation and peace-building can be destroyed in a matter of hours or days. A peaceful settlement between Erbil and Baghdad, after three years of sacrifices by the Peshmerga and the Iraqi army, could have been within reach after the referendum. That could have established a new chapter of peaceful co-existence—a marked departure from past practices of coercion and punishment, especially toward Iraq’s discontented Arab Sunnis, who have endured Baghdad’s suppression for more than a decade.

Ultimately, the post-referendum period became a litmus test for whether Iraq and the United States had learned the most important lesson of all: that keeping the peace is more important than winning the war. That said, there is a new opportunity under the current government and important lessons to heed.

Washington’s role

The United States can never be a passive actor in Iraq. Sitting on the fence can itself sometimes embolden one side. In the case of the Baghdad-Erbil spat last year, Washington opposed the Kurdish referendum but lacked a policy in its wake, which empowered Baghdad’s mobilization of forces against the Peshmerga.

Moving forward, the United States remains strongly positioned to contain the fallout from disputes in Iraq, mediating tensions and establishing an environment that is conducive to peaceful settlements. Washington should view Iraq’s leadership change as an opportunity to heed past lessons—namely discouraging strongman approaches and making it more difficult for Iraqi actors to resort to force to advance political agendas—and truly turn a new chapter.

For now, Erbil and Baghdad have no choice but to live with one another—out of economic necessity, and because Baghdad cannot close the door on the Kurds without further straining the legitimacy of the Iraqi state after more than a decade of violent resistance from Arab Sunnis. This is an inconvenient but potentially constructive starting point for pursuing a fresh slate. With U.S. encouragement, the two sides can commit to genuine dialogue that seeks to prevent conflict relapse.

Iraqi leaders must remain vigilant

Crucially, Iraq must not repeat past mistakes, growing complacent when a post-conflict situation seems deceptively calm. That complacency enables the next round of conflict: ISIS, for example, emerged in 2014 after a failure to keep the peace following years of bloody sectarian violence between Arab Sunnis and Shiites. In other words, winning the peace only matters if it can be kept.

Aside from its governance challenges, Iraq remains highly susceptible to conflict relapse. Since 2003, Iraq has suffered countless sectarian conflicts and one recognized genocide. Of the 105 countries that suffered a civil war between 1945 and 2013, more than half (59 countries) experienced a relapse into violent conflict after peace had been established—in some cases more than once. Does Iraq have the leadership to insulate the country from further violent conflict? The record is not great. Iraq’s politicians, across the religious and ethnic spectrum, say all the right things—but have ultimately failed to keep the peace. President Salih and Prime Minister Mahdi have an opportunity to avoid that fate and to set the bar for future Iraqi leaders.","Prime Minister Mahdi, a compromise candidate, will have his work cut out for him in the face of a dysfunctional political system and institutional paralysis—problems that may take generations to rectify.

The one-day event, dubbed the Moscow Format Consultations on Afghanistan, is aimed at kick-starting direct negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government. But the November 9 event met with strong skepticism from former officials and politicians in Afghanistan.

In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he hoped the event would pave the way for direct negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government.

""Today's event should become an important contribution to the creation of favorable conditions for the launch of direct talks between the government, the Taliban movement,"" Lavrov told the opening session of the meeting.

Russia’s Foreign Ministry said representatives of Afghanistan, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, China, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and the United States were invited to the meeting at Moscow’s President Hotel. In September, Moscow suspended a similar event at Kabul’s request.

Lavrov said his country’s role is to facilitate a dialogue between Afghans, “together with Afghanistan's regional partners and friends who have gathered at this table today to extend all possible assistance to facilitate the start of a constructive intra-Afghan dialogue.”

It is not clear whether the meeting will turn into a sustained process led by Moscow. Kabul and Washington, however, appear keen on making it clear that peace talks should be led and owned by Afghans.

“The United States believes that all countries should support direct dialogue between the government of Afghanistan and the Taliban to reach an end to the war,” Robert Palladino, a deputy spokesman for the State Department, told journalists on November 7. “We’ve been clear that no government, including Russia, can be a substitute for the Afghan government in direct negotiations with the Taliban.”

Palladino said that in coordination with the Afghan government, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow will send a representative to observe the event. “The United States stands ready to work with all interested parties to support and facilitate a peace process.”

Four members of Afghanistan's High Peace Council, a group responsible for reconciliation efforts, are taking part.

“The agenda of these talks is to determine how direct negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government can begin soon,” Asadullah Barakzai, a spokesman for the Afghan peace council, told Afghanistan’s Tolo News TV.

The Taliban, however, have opposed negotiating with Kabul and instead insist on talking to the United States because they say the Afghan government is a puppet of Washington. Purported Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said their representatives in Moscow will not hold ""any sort of negotiations"" with the peace council.

In a statement this week, the Taliban said the conference was ""not about negotiating with any particular side"" but aimed at ""comprehensive discussions on finding a peaceful solution to the Afghan quandary and ending the American occupation.""

Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S envoy for Afghan peace, reportedly met with the Taliban in the Qatari capital, Doha, in October. A Taliban statement at the time said both sides ""agreed to continue such meetings.""

A U.S. State Department statement says Khalilzad is traveling to Afghanistan, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar from November 8 to 20.

“He will meet with Afghan government officials and other interested parties to advance the goal of an intra-Afghan dialogue and negotiations that include the Taliban and lead to a sustainable peace,” the November 8 statement noted.

Finding a negotiated settlement to the Afghan war has emerged as the preferred course for Washington as Kabul has continued losing territory to the Taliban and its security forces have sustained high casualties.

In its latest report, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) predicted more challenges for the government in Kabul. ""The control of Afghanistan's districts, population, and territory overall became more contested this quarter,"" its latest report said.

A new study by Brown University shows that more than 147,000 people have died in the war in Afghanistan since a U.S.-led military intervention toppled the hard-line Taliban regime in late 2001. The study, titled Human Costs of The Post 9/11 Wars, says most of the fatalities are Afghan soldiers, insurgents, and civilians. More than 7,000 U.S. and allied troops and contractors were also killed in the war.

The Afghan government, however, is not weighing the war in terms of losses. Given its dependence on international funding and military support, its most pressing problem is to ensure the current political system can survive.

Kabul is thus adamant that any peace process should be Afghan-led and Afghan-owned. In a November 9 statement, the Afghan Foreign Ministry said the High Peace Council was taking part in the talks ""in its own capacity as a national but nongovernment institution, with a view to discuss the dynamics and details of initiating direct negotiations.""

The council was established by former President Hamid Karzai as part of the internationally funded Peace and Reintegration Program. Its aim is to negotiate with the Taliban and other insurgent groups.

Barnett Rubin, a former senior adviser to the U.S. government adviser, says the Moscow meeting is based on the Kremlin’s belief that a peace process led by Washington or the U.S.-supported Afghan government will set conditions for a long-term U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, which Russia, Iran and Pakistan opposes.

“The Moscow process is meant to come from and align with the interests of these regional powers, who believe that a peace process in Afghanistan should lead to the withdrawal of the U.S. military presence,” he told RFE/RL Gandhara website. “It also is another sign of Russia's assertiveness and follows the model of the Russia-led peace process for Syria.”

Rubin, however, sees a significant shift in Washington’s thinking under the leadership of Khalilzad, who seeks to muster a regional consensus and support.

“The decision to send a representative from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow shows a significant shift,” he noted. “Under Khalilzad's leadership, the U.S. is willing to cooperate with anyone -- maybe even Iran -- to bring stability to Afghanistan, and it is no longer is looking for a way to assure a long-term military presence.”

Many former Afghan officials and politicians, however, are highly skeptical.

“This is an attempt to legitimize an illegitimate phenomenon,” former Afghan Foreign Minister Rangin Dadfar Spanta said in an apparent reference to the status of Taliban leaders and factions who are sanctioned and labeled by countries and international organizations.

The Taliban are banned in Russia because Moscow considers them a terrorist organization.

“How can the representatives of the Taliban and the ISI [Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence] be accepted as diplomats on international forums?” he asked while repeating the accusation that the Afghan Taliban are proxies of the Pakistani secret service.

Islamabad, however, denies supporting the Taliban. A senior Pakistani diplomat is representing his country in Moscow.

“We have always maintained that the most viable solution to the conflict in Afghanistan is an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned peace process. The role of Afghanistan's neighbors would be very important in such a process,” Mohammad Faisal, spokesman for the Pakistani foreign ministry told journalists on November 8.

He hoped a peace process with wider regional and global support will succeed. “It can be expected that this meeting would contribute to developing a regional consensus in support of the Afghan peace process,” Faisal said.

Pakistan’s archrival and neighbor India, however, is more cautious. It is sending two former officials to participate in the meeting at “non-official level” but insists that any peace talks “should be Afghan-led, Afghan-owned, and Afghan-controlled and with participation of the government of Afghanistan”.

Outspoken former Afghan spy chief Amrullah Saleh is highly critical.

“Twelve countries have their own so-called peace process for Afghanistan and they all call it Afghan-owned and Afghan-led,” he wrote on Twitter. “In reality much of it is aimed to connect with terrorists and buy safety for their homelands. Neither their intent nor their conduct of peace effort is helping Afghanistan.”

Mohammad Omar Daudzai, a former interior minister, questioned the logic of peace talks that apparently sideline the Afghan government.

“However weak or bad, it is our only government and it should not be sidelined,” he noted.","The one-day event, dubbed the Moscow Format Consultations on Afghanistan, is aimed at kick-starting direct negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government.
Kabul and Washington, however, appear keen on making it clear that peace talks should be led and owned by Afghans.
Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S envoy for Afghan peace, reportedly met with the Taliban in the Qatari capital, Doha, in October.
Kabul is thus adamant that any peace process should be Afghan-led and Afghan-owned.
“It can be expected that this meeting would contribute to developing a regional consensus in support of the Afghan peace process,” Faisal said."

Speaking at the foundation laying ceremony of Kartarpur corridor, Khan said, ""I don't know why was Sidhu criticised. What crime did he commit by coming here (on Khan's oath-taking ceremony)? Mashallah, let me tell you one thing, from what I have seen since yesterday, you (Sidhu) will win if you contest election here, especially in Punjab.""

Khan laid the foundation stone for a corridor linking Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan's Kartarpur - the final resting place of Sikh faith's founder Guru Nanak Dev - to Dera Baba Nanak shrine in India's Gurdaspur district to facilitate visa-free movement of Indian Sikh pilgrims.

Khan said he hoped that ""we don't have to wait for Sidhu to become Prime Minister for the two countries to become friends.""

""There are two types of politicians. One who takes bold decisions, who dreams and another who is scared of losing the vote bank. One who takes votes by spreading love and another who spreads hate. I hope that we don't have to wait for Sidhu to become Prime Minister for India and Pakistan to become friends. I hope a leadership comes who has the strength to take bold decisions,"" the cricketer-turned-politician said.

""The only issue between us is Kashmir, all it needs is just two capable leadership to resolve this issue. Just imagine the potential we have if our relationships get strong,"" he added.

Khan said his party and the country's influential army want to mend ties with arch-foe India.

""I the prime minister, my political party, the rest of our political parties, our army, all our institutions are all on one page. We want to move forward,"" Khan was quoted as saying by Reuters.

Khan said ""if India takes one step forward then we will take two steps forward toward friendship"".

Earlier, he laid the foundation stone for a corridor linking Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan's Kartarpur - the final resting place of Sikh faith's founder Guru Nanak Dev - to Dera Baba Nanak shrine in India's Gurdaspur district to facilitate visa-free movement of Indian Sikh pilgrims.

Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan is located across the river Ravi, about four kilometres from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine. It was established by the Sikh Guru in 1522. The first Gurdwara, Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib, was built here, where Guru Nanak Dev is said to have died.

The Kartarpur Corridor, which will facilitate the visa-free travel of Indian Sikh pilgrims to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur, is expected to be completed within six months.

The development comes ahead of Guru Nanak's 550th birth anniversary next year.

Thousands of Sikh devotees from India visit Pakistan every year to celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak.

India had proposed the corridor to Pakistan around 20 years back.

India was represented by Union ministers Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Hardeep Singh Puri at the event. Punjab cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu also attended the ceremony.

Sidhu called for an end to violence saying that peace should be restored between India and Pakistan.

Punjab's Tourism and Culture Affairs Minister also recited poetry in praise of Pakistan PM Imran Khan.

Mrs Badal, who also spoke at the ceremony, got emotional during her speech.

""When the wall of Berlin can be brought down, then hatred between India and Pakistan can be brought down too with the opening of Kartarpur Corridor. It can be a new beginning in the name of Baba Nanak who said 'na koi Hindu na koi Musalman lekin ek Onkar',"" she said.

Last week, Pakistan and India announced that they would develop the corridor on their respective side of the border to help Indian pilgrims visit Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur.

India-Pakistan ties nose-dived in recent years with no bilateral talks taking place. The ties between the two countries had strained after the terror attacks by Pakistan-based groups in 2016.

Pakistan had invited External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, who thanked her Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi for the invite and said she was unable to travel to Kartarpur Sahib due to prior commitments.

The issue of Kartarpur Sahib came into focus after Punjab Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu visited Pakistan in August to attend the oath-taking ceremony of his cricketer-turned-politician friend Imran Khan as prime minister of that country.

After his return, Sidhu said that Pakistan Army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa had told him that Pakistan may open a corridor to Kartarpur Sahib.

Sidhu has already arrived in Lahore with a group of Indian journalists to attend the ground breaking ceremony on Wednesday.

By Emeka Obasi

The world they say is made up of people who accomplish things and those who get all the credit. I doubt if Federal Government records will devote any space at all to the man who brought peace to the Niger Delta. His name is Allen Ifechukwu Onyema.

Knowledge is power. I must confess I did not know much about this man until I read the comprehensive interview conducted by Saturday Vanguard Editor, Onochie Anibeze.

Please, let’s unite for our unity, Ohanaeze Ndigbo begs IPOB

While our politicians were busy fleecing government and enjoying the destruction of oil installations in the Niger Delta by militants, Onyema took it upon himself to spend time, money and risk his life for normalcy to prevail.

It began right from cradle. He was born in Benin city to Igbo parents, Michael and Helen, from Anambra. Dad was pleasantly surprised when his eight–year old boy left for the village to live with an uncle in a far flung area along the River Niger.

The senior Onyema and his brother were involved in what could be described as family war. He could not understand why his own son should leave his comfort zone and pitch camp with this ‘foe’ of a brother. That was how the strife ended.

Falana asks Osinbajo to stop disobedience of court orders

The charity that Allen cultivated at home was going to lead to other parts of Nigeria. As a Law student of the University of Ibadan, he traveled to Kaduna to make peace in one of the ethnic crises.

That was the beginning of recognition by the traditional institution in Northern Nigeria. Sultan Maccido, a strong believer in one Nigeria and lover of the Igbo, was impressed.

One of Maccido’s younger brothers, Sadiq, who is presently the Sultan, was an Army officer and his first posting was Nsukka in the South-East. Among his Igbo friends and military course mates were: Azubuike Ihejirika, E.U. Nwanguma and Ofi Ihenacho.

Nigerian traders confirm reopening of shops by Ghanaian authorities

Another course mate, Bala Shagari, was son of Second Republic President, Shehu Shagari. Sokoto welcomed Onyema and he was also invited by the former president and commended for his peace efforts.

When the Niger Delta was boiling, the danger in relying on one resource became even more glaring. Crude oil production fell to an all time low.

Onyema moved in, spending his money. The flash points did not scare him. He made friends with the warlords and began to transform the different camps to meaningful grounds.

He brought in American scholars. Shell Petroleum Development Company[SPDC] was shocked to discover that just this one man brought them back to continue work.

Timi Alaibe was the Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission[NDDC].The militants wanted his head. He tried all means possible to get in touch with Onyema.

It looked like mission impossible until his wife met the peace crusader aboard a flight to Abuja. The woman was delighted to plead with Onyema to contact Alaibe as a matter of urgency.

The militants did not trust government officials. They also were wary of some of their Niger Delta brothers, but they believed in Onyema. At the same time, President Umaru Yar’adua wanted peace in the region.

It was when Alaibe took Onyema to Aso villa that the tide turned. At last, they found somebody who related with the dreaded militants and could also be trusted by government.

That was how amnesty was achieved. The hype of flying fringe self decorated militant generals to Abuja was not what sealed the Peace deal. It was Onyema’s earlier moves that restored calm.

And this man who spent so much from his pocket before Shell and the Federal Government intervened, did not walk a street paved with gold. He began as a squatter in some squalid part of Oshodi, Lagos.

Court fixes Dec 7 for hearing on EFCC vs Benue govt

When Onyema left Law School in 1989, there was an opportunity to join Shell. Another uncle, worked with the oil giants. He chose to move to Lagos instead without guarantee of a job, in 1990.

The unemployed graduate could have won a medal in the Olympic Walk event for he walked all over in search of gainful employment. His shoes bore the brunt of the ‘Great Trek.’

That lasted until Chief Vincent Nwizugbo hired him as a pupil lawyer on a monthly salary of 500 naira. The Marina office quaked when the new employee won his first case in court, flooring very senior lawyers.

It did not take long for cash to flow. Property was attractive and yielded more than enough to go solo. The young man also found a wife.

His love, Alice Ojochide Ejembi, is Igala, from the North Central part of the country. They are blessed with four children. The story of this man, born in the South–South, gives credit to national unity.

Onyema attended Urhobo College, Effurun and Government College, Ughelli respectively. He graduated from a university in the South-West. This experience has also kept him going.

Many thought that he set up Peace Airlines because Sultan Maccido died in an air crash in 2006. No. The driving force is creation of job opportunities for thousands of unemployed compatriots.

We can conveniently call Onyema, Mr. Nigeria. The man who helped Air Peace to get the Air Operator’s Licence was Director General of NCAA, Benjamin Adeyileka. Some of the people who helped on the way up include Gbolahan Abatan, Evelyn Tanko and Yakubu Dhazia.

Dr. Goodluck Jonathan was president yet it was difficult to get the licence. His wife, Patience has an Igbo mother. That did not help. Strange enough, the story was that Air Peace was owned by the woman because she was called:‘Mama Peace.’

How Nigeria moved from frying pan to fire in 2015 – Moghalu

Onyema has kind words for President Muhammadu Buhari for suspending the Air Nigeria project. It is good to hear something good about Mr. President. He saved jobs and local airlines.

“ I feel it was government involvement that killed Nigeria Airways. Government is only to regulate and take taxes.” This is coming from August Okpe, Chief Pilot, Biafra Air Force who retired as Deputy Chief Pilot, Nigeria Airways.

Onyema did the unimaginable. He brought IPOB, Fulani Herdsmen and OPC together for good. This prophet, decorated by the world, deserves honour in his own country.

* Norway partners with UNDP Sri Lanka to support peace, justice and strong institutions

Mon, Dec 10, 2018, 08:21 pm SL Time, ColomboPage News Desk, Sri Lanka.

Dec 10, Colombo: The Government of Norway entered into a partnership agreement with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Sri Lanka to extend support to UNDP Sri Lanka's flagship portfolio on SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions project for the period December 2018 to December 2020.

The Ambassador of Norway to Sri Lanka and Maldives, Thorbjørn Gaustadsæther and UNDP Sri Lanka Country Director Jorn Sorensen signed the partnership agreement amounting to NOK 12.6 million (USD 1.5 million).

Under the partnership, UNDP aims to strengthen select policymaking and oversight structures to perform core functions for improved accountability and inclusivity, provide marginalized and vulnerable communities increased and equitable access to justice, including demand-driven legal protection and gender sensitive services. It also aims to strengthen the capacity of national and sub-national level institutions to deliver equitable, accountable and effective services.

Through the implementation of this project, UNDP expects by 2022, people in Sri Lanka, especially the marginalized and vulnerable, benefit from more rights-based, accountable, inclusive and effective public institutions, to enhance trust amongst communities and towards the State.

Commenting on the project, Norwegian Ambassador Gaustadsæther said, ""Norway is pleased to support UNDP's Flagship Portfolio on SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions project, particularly because United Nations is globally accepted to promote human rights and Sustainable Development Goals.""

He further stated that effective public institutions are crucial to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development and to provide access to justice for all. ""At present when Sri Lanka is going through difficult times, some of the positive developments that we see in the country are due to the work done in the past to strengthen institutions. Therefore, as development partners, it is crucial that we continue to support the work that UN does to promote peace, justice and strong institutions.""

Also speaking about this project, UNDP Sri Lanka Country Director Jorn Sorensen stated, ""the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda is a call to action, and requires us all coming together to work towards a common goal of sustainable development. As such, UNDP is pleased to be extending our collaboration with the Government of Norway - a longstanding partner of UNDP - to ensure a sustainable Sri Lanka.""","Leading News from Sri Lanka::* Norway partners with UNDP Sri Lanka to support peace, justice and strong institutionsMon, Dec 10, 2018, 08:21 pm SL Time, ColomboPage News Desk, Sri Lanka.

Participants underscored the importance of inclusive, holistic and nationally-driven reconstruction processes, and recognized linkages between the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and sustaining peace.

President of Côte d’Ivoire, Alassane Ouattara, whose country holds the UNSC presidency for December, described how “holistic strategies for economic recovery and development—implemented from the very start of the post-conflict phase” helped avert a relapse of conflict and instability in Côte d’Ivoire. Ouattara highlighted the role of the private sector in transforming his country’s economy, describing how some 65,000 former combatants were disarmed, demobilized and reintegrated into society and provided with decent jobs, alongside anti-corruption measures, governance reforms and efforts to enhance social cohesion. Ouattara underscored that his country’s citizens now live “in peace and in tolerance” and can serve as a case study for the UNSC.

France and other speakers also recognized Côte d’Ivoire’s progress towards peace. African Union Commission (AUC) Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat observed that “Côte d’Ivoire’s experience is an eloquent demonstration that peace is within reach” when actors are determined to turn commitments into action. The UK also praised Côte d’Ivoire’s ongoing reforms, reflecting that meaningful institutional change requires patience and time.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres emphasized the importance of a focus on prevention, saying “peace cannot be sustainable without development, and lasting peace is essential for the preservation of development gains.” He said a holistic, inclusive approach is necessary to fight potential factors in instability, such as climate change-related competition for resources, inequality and corruption. He also underscored the importance of peace and development activities that “are owned, and led by national local actors,” including women, youth, the elderly, minority groups and those with disabilities. Guterres called for: building local capacities to prevent and respond to conflicts; forging partnerships to safeguard development gains, including partnerships with regional and sub-regional organizations and international financial institutions (IFIs); and ensuring adequate resources for peacebuilding and development during conflict, including by mobilizing foreign investment and supporting the UN Peacebuilding Fund. He concluded by saying the 2030 Agenda and the sustaining peace agenda “are complementary and mutually reinforcing” and encouraged Member States to embrace these frameworks “as our best guarantees against instability and insecurity.”

France called to integrate the 2030 Agenda into post-conflict development and reconstruction.

Other speakers called for integrated approaches to post-conflict recovery, including the AUC Chairperson and Sweden. Rwanda shared three core pillars from her country’s reconstruction period: the importance of security, peace and stability; institution building; and the development dividend. She further stressed the importance of inclusive reconstruction efforts, underscoring the importance of engaging women in the entire process. The Netherlands, for instance, stressed “environmental sustainability is no longer optional in economic development” and underscored the need to protect agriculture-based livelihoods to ensure food security during conflicts, saying such an approach requires innovative partnerships among the private sector, financial institutions and other key stakeholders.

Several delegates underscored the importance of predictable and sustainable financing for peacekeeping, including Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal. Equatorial Guinea said his delegation is participating in negotiations on a draft resolution that aims to provide financing for peacekeeping operations in Africa through the UN regular budget. The US called for voluntary contributions to the Peacebuilding Fund and emphasized the need to pair mandates with achievable exist strategies.

Several delegates supported nationally-led reconstruction processes. Kuwait said national ownership and “sincere political will for reconciliation” are necessary to avoid relapses. Poland highlighted the role of respect for human rights and social cohesion in contributing to stability, describing the participation of women and youth as critical in effective implementation of peacebuilding and sustaining peace. France said the 2030 Agenda should be integrated into post-conflict development and reconstruction, including as part of restoring the rule of law.

Additional concerns raised by delegates include: the potential of terrorist threats in West Africa and the Sahel to jeopardize efforts to recover from conflict; and the need to ensure justice for victims to address desires for revenge; and the importance.

100,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/peace-and-war-gender-equality-everyone-s-battle,"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",ReliefWeb,In Peace and in War Gender Equality Is Everyone’s Battle - World,"The United Nations and its agencies have prioritized women’s rights for decades and recognized the impediments to gender equality globally. Numerous resolutions, agencies, conferences, and declarations have been adopted, established, held, and written. Often, however, the actual work and effort expended towards achieving greater gender equality falls on women alone. Worse still, gender equality is viewed by some in a limited sense as a “women’s issue” that is not really of concern to men.

But whose battle is gender equality? It is everyone’s battle, and it is critically important that men understand that this includes them. Gender equality is a universal agenda and its absence has profound consequences for all of humanity. There is perhaps no area where this becomes clearer than in relation to matters of peace and security.

Research has found that “the very best predictor of a state’s peacefulness is not its level of wealth, its level of democracy, or its ethno-religious identity; the best predictor of a state’s peacefulness is how well its women are treated.” While we still do not fully understand the complex relationship between gender and security, we do know that there is a strong correlation between “gender inequality” and the occurrence and reoccurrence of armed conflict. This has been found in a number of empirical studies, whether measuring conflict between states or within states.

And we know that during conflict, dangerous gender dynamics are pervasive. There is an increasing recognition of the particular violence that is used against women and girls in conflict zones—both as a byproduct and as an intentional weapon of war, including the use of sexual violence, as recognized in the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize.

After conflict, or in the continuous process of building peace, the role of women is essential. Researchers, policymakers, activists, and practitioners are increasingly recognizing the potential for societal transformation in efforts to create and sustain peace, if only we ensure women are substantively engaged in these efforts.

Statistical reports have found that when women are included in peace processes as witnesses, signatories, mediators, or negotiators there is a 20 percent increase in the probability that any agreement will last at least two years, and a 35 percent increase that it will last at least 15 years.

So the research is clear: women’s security and gender dynamics are critical to preventing conflict, resolving conflict, and rebuilding after conflict. This is an issue that impacts us all. And we have known this connection for some time. In 1915, over 1,000 women gathered in The Hague to appeal for the end of World War I, forming the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom. In the intervening decades, understanding and support for women’s roles in all peace and security matters has grown. This includes, for better or for worse, the UN Security Council formal link between gender equality and the maintenance of international peace and security via its resolution 1325 in 2000.

What Should Be Done

While women’s involvement in peace processes is longstanding, we also now have a better understanding of why women’s substantive participation in peace processes increases the potential for these processes to succeed. This is in part because if women meaningfully participate, peace processes are less likely to be simply a negotiation about power among men with guns, but rather to include broader issues about how to build a sustainable peaceful society. The participation of women in this way does not mean trying to squeeze them into processes that are in and of themselves broken. Rather, it entails working with women leaders—from the local to national to regional to international levels—to seek creative, long-term solutions to seemingly intractable problems. Inclusivity is the key.

The fact remains, however, that women and girls are far too often targeted for violence in armed conflict, and are simultaneously excluded from efforts to prevent, resolve, and rebuild from these complex crises. We need to systematically listen to them, learn from their leadership, and ensure their voices are included in the prevention and resolution of conflict, and in the building of peace after conflict.

Fortunately, it is not all bad news. There has been progress. As nearly 20 years has elapsed since the adoption of UN Security Council resolution 1325 on Women, Peace, and Security, and 25 years since the Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women, we can reflect on the significant progress made globally on many aspects of women, peace, and security work. This includes political commitments at the national and multilateral levels to devote funding to increasing women’s leadership.

For example, the agreement of Sustainable Development Goal 5 on gender equality is a true milestone and is directly related to SDG 16 on peace, justice, and strong Institutions. But SDG 5 needs to be implemented. There is still a lot more work to be done, including in the crucial area of ensuring women’s leadership at all levels and in all peace and security fora. In an ever-more fraught international political landscape, it is increasingly important that national, regional, and multilateral actors focus on proven strategies to support women’s leadership. This means both formal leaders like Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallström, but also women community leaders who are, for example, negotiating humanitarian access on the frontlines of conflict, or working to ensure women voters and women candidates can participate freely in elections.

But women leaders face significant challenges, not least that women human rights defenders face increasing levels of threats and violence. Furthermore, as the multilateral system is itself attacked, the principal means for safeguarding and supporting the Women, Peace, and Security agenda is also increasingly compromised. This all underscores the critical importance of supporting women leaders.

Unfortunately, the data is not encouraging here. In peace efforts between 1990 and 2017, women made up only two percent of mediators, five percent of witnesses and signatories, and eight percent of negotiators. In 2015, the UN and member states were asked to double the number of women in military and police peacekeeping contingents by 2020. At the current rate of increase in women’s participation, this will take decades if not centuries.

We can and must do better. We cannot wait to let these changes happen on their own: reform needs to be purposeful and deliberate, intentional and determined.

We must recognize that we live at a moment of contradictory trends, and that our work does not happen in a vacuum: there are headwinds. We have forward—though insufficient—progress on women’s rights and political participation, at the same time as a rising, dangerous backlash in some quarters, with the potential to send the world precipitously backward on a number of indicators. Human rights, in general, are currently being challenged the world over.

Leadership is critically important both at the highest levels and at the grassroots, and so it is bridging these communities that can produce the most innovative solutions. Call it a hinge moment of history, call it a moment of both risks and opportunities, call it what you may, but make it a call for action.

The call was made by Coordinator for the Commonwealth Youth for Peace Ambassadors Network Jamaica, Neville Charlton.

He was one, among five panellists, offering up thoughts during a panel discussion on Sustainable Development Goal 16 (Peace and Justice Strong Institution) - Youth Participation: the Key to Peace and Security at a Youth Month Forum hosted recently by the National Integrity Action (NIA) and Equality Youth Jamaica at the UWI Regional Headquarters, Mona.

“Just like how they have Mathematics and English curricula, we want them to have one for peacebuilding. We want them to teach human rights as it relates to peacebuilding,” he implored while adding that, teachers would require training in how to carry out this curriculum.

Charlton also said there was a need to create a national movement for young people to advocate for peacebuilding as the security of all, was not the remit of any one person. It was time, he said, for all voices, especially those of the youth, to be heard,” he noted.

He stressed that in order to pursue advocacy, persons had to be committed, despite the challenges faced. “You want to see change and at the end of it, you don’t, when you are not committed,” he pointed out.

With the focus of the Commonwealth Youth for Peace Ambassadors Network Jamaica being youth development and volunteerism, Charlton said his organization was willing to collaborate with like-minded organisations. Time, he explained, had come the organisation to align with others given the scarcity of funds.

On hand also was panelist, Elizabeth Ward, chair of the Violence Prevention Alliance, who echoed a similar sentiment regarding the need for more collaborative effort as it pertained to peacebuilding.

“Many young people are doing wonderful work but I think one of the challenges is to get them all to work together and this has to be done because we are losing too many young people to violence. We have to save them,” she stressed.

The media, she added, had a role to play in supporting the peacebuilding initiatives pursued by youth. Dr Ward pointed out that on most occasions the media only appeared in marginalized communities when there was a tragic event, but failed to highlight and expose the positive work occurring within these communities.

“Young people need the media to listen and pay attention. There is the ‘Track on the Streets’ initiative which has been going on for years and getting bigger and better each year, and you don’t see anything about it in the media. Here is a young man making a difference,” she explained.

Dr Ward further impressed upon the media to hold the government more accountable for their promises to the youth. “It is great to get up in parliament and promise things, but we need a clear, strategic and consistent way to make them accountable,” she implored.

The Youth Month Forum, which brought together several stakeholders from the youth and educational sectors, was held under the theme,” Keeping Us More Accountable on the Sustainable Development Goals”.

Students from the secondary level also attended the event and were involved in questions and answers.

104,https://jacobinmag.com/2018/12/lopez-obrador-drug-war-mexico-hydrocarbons-capital,"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Jacobin magazine,Capital Versus Peace in Mexico,"After twelve years of the “war on drugs” in Mexico, a period when almost 260,000 were murdered and at least 37,000 disappeared, a new government has arrived with refreshing ideas about drugs, peace, and security. The new president Andrés Manuel López Obrador has promised to promote a pacification policy including conversations on justice and reconciliation, amnesty for minor offenders, and the decriminalization of marijuana and poppy crops. His program goes against the grain of mainstream narratives, which still depict an anachronistic image of 1980s-era drug cartels as the main source of violence in Mexico. Hit shows like Narcos portray megalomaniac narco-traffickers singlehandedly terrorizing whole countries, fueled by the North’s insatiable appetite for drugs. AMLO recognizes that a policy of confrontation against organized crime is not enough to address the violence in the country and proposes to tackle its deep causes, promoting education and work alternatives to youth and rural communities depending on illicit activities. Most researchers in Mexico argue that it is the state’s militarization that has escalated and preserved violence in Mexico. Researchers like Guadalupe Correa, Dawn Paley, and Oswaldo Zavala, point out that outbreaks of violence in a region tend to be triggered by the deployment of soldiers — tens of thousands of which have participated in Mexico’s internal security affairs since 2006. The US-funded drug war only encouraged cartels to buy more guns, recruit more soldiers, and fight dirtier. But these researchers point out something else: that the cartels no longer rely primarily on the drug trade for profit. Mexico’s criminal syndicates grew into complex, militarized organizations just as the country’s economy was opened up to international capital in the 1990s and early 2000s. This revealed new, lucrative frontiers off which they could parasitize. Today, the country’s heavily armed criminal networks don’t limit themselves to drug trafficking. They also profit from migrant smuggling, fuel theft, iron ore exports, extortion, illicit logging, or kidnapping for ransom in addition to drug trafficking. But what they’ve come to specialize in beyond any one profit stream is territorial occupation, through which they attempt to control all economic activity, both legal and illegal, within a certain area. Under this model, it’s rational for them to battle for control over areas richest in profitable natural resources, and position themselves accordingly towards the international capital these areas have been opened to. This is evident in the fact that territories hit by crime and extreme violence, such as Juarez Valley or the Tamaulipas border state, are usually the ones richest in hydrocarbons and mineral resources. Authors like Paley and Correa argue that, in light of these factors, the extreme violence in several Mexican regions actually benefits some actors in transnational capital, particularly the energy, hydrocarbons, mining, private security, finance, and arms trade sectors. One reason is that forced displacement caused by conflicts enables the occupation and buying of lands — even communal ones or ejidos, a Mexican collective form of land ownership that does not allow selling terrains — at low prices and avoids local resistance to extractive developments. According to the last annual report of the Comisión Mexicana de Derechos Humanos — an independent Mexican NGO — the cumulative figures of internally displaced people were at least 329,917 by the end of 2017. This is not to say that there was any planned, centralized effort to use the drug war to open up sections of Mexico to transnational extraction. The course of the war has been too chaotic, with too many shifting actors, to make this conclusion. However, that neoliberal restructuring occurred simultaneously with the increasing paramilitarization and sophistication of both “sides” of the drug war produced a dangerous outcome. Now, sections of international capital are codependent with the violence of Mexico’s narco-state — and its ability to displace, terrorize, and monopolize territories — to achieve its agenda. And capital’s collaboration with criminal paramilitaries, who exist on a spectrum with the corrupt state, has increased their sophistication and entrenchment within the Mexican economy. This means that to confront Mexico’s endemic violence and transform its security framework, AMLO will have to do more than reform drug policies. He will also have to take on international capital.

The War on Drugs In December 2006, Felipe Calderón took office as the president of Mexico. Days later he announced the Joint Operation Michoacán, named after his home state. It was a coordinated effort of the army, the Mexican Naval Infantry, and the Federal Police to attack organized crime and drug trafficking. It was a move by a president with little legitimacy in the need of an internal enemy — he won office by only 0.62 percent, narrowly defeating the current president Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who claimed electoral fraud. According to many, it was the foundational event of Mexico’s “war on drugs.” With that confrontation policy, Calderón intended to tackle the drug cartels and reestablish security in the country. Instead, the homicide rate doubled during his six-year tenure. Tens of thousands of soldiers were deployed over the country to perform internal security tasks. Other than the surge in troops, there was no significant strategic shift between Calderón’s and outgoing president Peña Nieto’s security policy. In 2007, George Bush and Felipe Calderón signed the framework agreement for Mérida Initiative, named after the city where the meeting took place. Inspired by the Plan Colombia — a US aid package to fight both drug trafficking and left-wing guerrillas signed in 2000 — the Merida Initiative committed millions of US dollars towards counter-narcotics, counter-terrorism, and border security; public security and law enforcement, including technology and training; and institution building. The Department of State delivered $400 million in 2008 alone. According to Dawn Paley and her book Drug War Capitalism, the US-Mexican cooperation on institution building under Mérida Initiative and other programs sponsored by USAID had a key role in boosting neoliberal and pro-business structural reforms in Mexico. During his tenure, the outgoing president Enrique Peña Nieto pursued structural reforms including constitutional changes in education, banking, the judiciary, energy, and the tax system. Institutional changes run parallel to extreme violence in several territories of the country far beyond the traditional corridors of drug production and trafficking. The “drug war,” consisting in the military and other federal forces performing police tasks in urban environments, as well as controlling rural territory, failed to stop violence. The initial strategy of beheading criminal organizations contributed to their division and further diversification into more illegal activities, boosting conflicts among criminal syndicates and violence against the population. Military repression also triggered the adoption of military tactics and heavy weaponry among criminal organizations. But as Paley writes, while military intervention was ineffective at stopping crime, it had side benefits for capital. Terror and violence, she explains, reduce workers’ mobility — both in their ordinary lives in the towns and in their ability to migrate. It also disciplines workforces, intimidates territory defenders, and displaces capital from small and medium-size companies to transnational ones, since the latter are less vulnerable to extortion. In many territories, the military’s presence brought peaks in homicides and forced disappearances, often justified by officials as collateral in the battle to eliminate crime. For instance, it is well documented that the military had a strong presence in the deadliest area of Mexico under Calderón’s tenure, the Juarez Valley, a frontier corridor just east of Juarez City. The Valley had an estimated murder rate of 1,600 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2009. Compare this to the rate nationwide, which reached a peak of 25 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants this year. Violence escalated after the military penetrated the area amid a conflict between two criminal syndicates. Mexican soldiers controlled all road accesses to the Valley during a period when scores of women, human rights activists, and other civilians were victims of murder, forced disappearances, and forced displacement. Many locals denounced the direct collusion of the soldiers in these crimes, as journalist Melissa del Bosque reported. In addition to a drug-dealing corridor, the Juarez Valley happens to be part of the Chihuahua basin, which is believed to be a huge shale gas reservoir. This has led to speculation that the military’s presence had more to do with suppressing opposition to fracking than interrupting the drug trade. There is no evidence of a reduction in drug trafficking to the United States, or of any success in defeating criminal organizations. At best, new ones flourished where some of the old ones declined. Instead, crime organization, security police, and institutional frameworks key to capitalistic development all became more sophisticated in this period.

The Transformation of Organized Crime Up until the 1990s, drug trafficking in Mexico was relatively controlled by political elites, who decided who could operate in each territory and took their part of the revenues. Some researchers argue that the increasing political plurality of those years — culminating in Vicente Fox’s 2000 election as the first president from outside the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in seventy-one years — broke these clandestine state-cartel monopolies and established new corrupt regional agreements. This brought about a transformation in organized crime that could be seen on the ground. Natalia Mendoza, an anthropologist who did ethnographic research in her town in frontier-state Sonora in 2005 and 2011, observed a huge change between those years, which were marked by an intensification of the drug war and militarization of the US border. Drug trafficking transformed from a locally controlled activity, sporadic for many, into a heavily organized economy under the monopolistic rule of a regional organization. This process required at least three major changes: the privatization of the smuggling routes to the United States, the creation of a “bureaucracy” of armed people permanently employed by organized crime, and the full control of migrant smuggling by these organizations. Mendoza, author of Conversaciones en el desierto (Conversations in the Desert, unpublished in English), called this process “cartelization.” Even if it had particular features and timing according to local particularities — such as proximity to the border — and previous development of organized crime in each territory, something similar would have happened almost nationwide. The development of The Zetas, for instance, was a watershed even where the drug trade was already heavily organized and controlled. They were created in the late nineties as the paramilitary wing of the Gulf Cartel in northeast Mexico, and grew rapidly in size and independence starting in 2003. They pioneered a model based on controlling territory and populations through military tactics — the foundational group of the Zetas were elite army deserters — to extract rents from a set of illegal activities such as drug trafficking, fuel theft, extortion, kidnapping, DVD selling, and so on. Its model created an extremely violent environment that suppressed freedom of movement and speech in the region. The Zetas, whose presence stretched over all the Atlantic coast and beyond, emerged as a transnational organization with strong political and police connections, a diversified business, and a useful brand based in terror. Even if they are now in decline, other groups adopted their way of doing things. And as Mexico sought to impose the new neoliberal order on its citizens, one based on the repression of labor and empowerment of international extractive capital, this new model of occupation and terror became useful to elites.

Natural Resources and Paramilitarization What seems remarkable is that some of the hot spots of the war, such as Tamaulipas, Juarez Valley, or Michoacán state, also boasted rich hydrocarbon reserves and mineral resources. Contrary to the common-sense idea that war is “bad for business,” private investments in mining projects in these areas never stopped. Nor did public investment for infrastructure development or bids for shale gas fields and other hydrocarbon resources. In her book Los Zetas Inc., Correa describes the conflict in Mexico as a war for its territory, particularly in areas rich in hydrocarbons or home to key infrastructure such as exporting ports. As she puts it, Dominating these regions would assure the domination of most of the supply chains in Mexico’s energy sector. Mexican TCOs [Transnational Crime Organizations], such as the Zetas, the Knights Templar, and CJNG, began establishing control over many of these zones. But in the end the resulting violence and government responses to it might bolster the participation of (and control by) new actors: transnational energy firms. Extreme violence in the state of Michoacán can also be explained according to key infrastructure and mineral resources. Aside from producing synthetic drugs, organized crime there has a very lucrative business in iron ore extraction and export to Asia through Lázaro Cárdenas, one of the main Pacific ports of Mexico. Forced displacement by organized crime has been repeatedly reported from communal lands and ejidos in areas where mining companies are establishing. As Paley writes, population displacement is useful to eliminate potential opposition to extractive projects. Moreover, military control of the territory guarantees that private investors are not disturbed. The same thing goes for North Tamaulipas — home to the shale-rich Burgos Basin — where 41 percent of land is communal or ejidos, as Correa notes in her book. Population displacement and a terror regime would have eased the buying and occupation of Tamaulipas lands and weakened the eventual resistance against fracking or land occupation by private companies. At the same time, the fuel theft business — believed to cost the Mexican state $1 billion in revenue per year — has become increasingly active. It’s especially affected the state-run oil company Pemex, who sued twenty-three US companies for buying stolen fuel from organized crime through three different lawsuits between 2010 and 2012 (they lost). This is bad for Pemex, which reported a $17 billion loss in 2017, but probably good for the private and transnational capital now dramatically increasing its participation in the sector. In this context, it’s not useful to look at the violence in Mexico through the lens of a narrow “drug war” focused on traditional South-North narco-trafficking routes.

This could be disastrous.

At last month’s Geneva Ministerial Conference on Afghanistan, it was clear that the presidential elections were less than five months away. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani put a lot of effort into making sure he appeared to be the right man for his job.

He took the opportunity to read out a list of achievements in the areas of security, women’s rights, justice and the anti-corruption effort. As usual, international donors applauded the achievements, re-affirmed their support for the Afghan government, and pledged more military and humanitarian aid.

But President Ghani did not stop there. He also announced a “roadmap to peace” his administration had prepared in order to launch peace talks with the Taliban. As part of that plan, he announced the formation of a 12-members team, headed by presidential chief of staff Salam Rahimi, to engage in direct negotiations with the Taliban. Ghani made it clear that the peace process has to be “Afghan-owned and Afghan-led”, implying his administration cannot be excluded from the process.

The Afghan president has been facing major challenges at home, suffering a number of major failures on the political and security fronts. Against the backdrop of a deteriorating situation at home, launching and owning a peace process seems to be the only achievement that can ensure his political survival and potential re-election next year.

In this sense, the conference in Geneva was an opportunity for him to convince the international community that the Afghan government possesses the operational capacity to bring the Taliban to political reconciliation through diplomatic means. Ghani also declared that he was running in the next presidential race in order to “finish the job” and warned the international community of dire consequences if his reforms and peace plan were abandoned.

But by linking his presidential bid to the success of peace talks, Ghani is making a risky move. Past attempts to start talks with the Taliban by both him and former President Hamid Karzai have failed and he is already facing a number of challenges that put his success in doubt.

First and foremost, the Taliban have demonstrated a number of times that they do not see a reason to negotiate with Ghani; they see him as a Western puppet and prefer to reach out directly to major international players, including the United States.

Second, Ghani’s peace initiative has been criticised by different stakeholders, including Afghan political figures and some factions of the civil society. The critics have repeatedly raised concerns about the lack of transparency over the terms of negotiations and have warned against concluding a deal that would roll back some of the achievements that have been made in recent years in areas such as girls’ education, political participation and economic development.

Third, there are some players in the international community who are already looking into direct engagement with the Taliban, bypassing Ghani’s administration. Russia and the US, for example, have recently held talks with the Taliban, without actively engaging the Afghan government.

Ghani tried hard to undermine the Moscow-sponsored conference on Afghanistan – initially scheduled for August – by refusing to participate; when Russia made clear its commitment to it, he asked for it to be postponed. In November, when the Russians pushed forward with the event, despite Ghani’s protestations, he was forced to send an unofficial representative.

A month earlier, the US strategically kept the Afghan government out of its meeting with the Taliban in Doha. US Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad met representatives from the Taliban and discussed a number of issues, including the withdrawal of US troops.

By engaging directly with the Taliban, countries like the US and Russia are able to pursue their own geopolitical interests. The US is eager to stabilise Afghanistan and secure its continuing presence in the country to stave off Chinese, Iranian and Russian influence in the region. And Russia is seeking to reassert itself in Afghanistan after a 30-year absence to potentially curtail the emergence of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) on its southern flank and to open another front in its soft confrontation with the US.

But by conducting direct talks with the Taliban, the two countries demonstrate that they perceive Ghani’s administration as weak and incapable of undertaking a viable peace process. Thus, the international community, led by the US and Russia, are effectively shunning the Afghan government and taking over negotiating peace on its behalf.

This is not only bad news for Ghani himself, who is hoping to use the peace talks as leverage for his re-election, but also for the Afghan state in general.

External actors bypassing elected bodies in the country could be significantly damaging to Afghanistan’s political institutions. It would delegitimise the Afghan government and legitimise an armed group which has wreaked havoc in the country for decades.

In other words, if the peace process proceeds along the unilateral paths that the US and Russia have taken up, this would result in a weaker Afghan government (whether Ghani-led or not) which would undermine whatever peace agreement is eventually reached. Afghanistan needs a strong state to ensure stability and security, not a weak one.

The only way forward should be for the international community to channel any peace initiative through the Afghan government and institutions. The Afghan people must be part of the process for peace to truly be achieved. They must also be free to decide who gets to lead this effort on their behalf – Ghani or someone else – when the elections are held next April.

The hope was to ease years of tensions over disputed islands in the South China Sea. Instead, the exercises gave an alarming preview of how Chinese hegemony would work.

During a briefing for officers from the 10-country Association of South East Asian Nations, the chief of China’s Southern Theater Command presented a map including the “nine-dash line” border long used by Beijing to claim dominion over nearly the entire South China Sea — claims the ASEAN members do not recognize. Despite an international tribunal declaring in 2016 that the nine-dash demarcation had “no legal basis” in international law, the Chinese official insisted to his ASEAN counterparts not only that the 9-dash line delineated Chinese sovereignty, but that as head of Southern Theater Command, he was responsible for enforcing those boundaries. According to U.S. officials, the ASEAN naval leaders were outraged — though not surprised — by what seemed like a deliberately insulting provocation by the Chinese.

China has done much more than talk, of course. It has built seven artificial islands on shallow reefs in the South China Sea, all in areas claimed by other countries, and claimed exclusive maritime zones around them in contradiction to international law. As recently as October, a Chinese destroyer nearly collided with the USS Decatur as it was conducting a routine “freedom of navigation” patrol in international waters near the Spratly Islands, prompting Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis to cancel a scheduled trip to China.

Back in 2015, Chinese President Xi Jinping tried to calm regional nerves by publicly promising not to “militarize” the man-made islands. Earlier this year, however, U.S. surveillance confirmed the islands now boast military airstrips and facilities and are bristling with anti-ship and surface-to-air (SAM) missiles.

“What my predecessor called a ‘Great Wall of Sand’ three years ago is now a ‘Great Wall of SAMs,’ giving the People’s Republic of China the ability to exert national control over international water and airspace over which $3 trillion in goods travel every year,” said Admiral Philip Davidson. (Davidson, new head of the recently renamed U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, spoke last week via video link to a CSIS conference on China). “The PRC says it’s militarizing these islands in order to defend Chinese ‘sovereignty,’ but in doing so they are violating the sovereignty of every other nation to fly, sail, trade and operate in accordance with international law.”

“The intensifying competition between the United States and China is not just driven by the traditional power politics between an established power and an emerging power, but rather I believe we are facing something much more serious,” Davidson said, in some of the most blunt and pointed rhetoric heard from a four-star theater commander since the Cold War. “I see a fundamental divergence of values that leads to two incomparable visions of the future. I think those two incomparable visions are between China and the rules-based international order.”

“China is looking to change the world order to one in which national power is more important than international law, reflecting a system in which ‘the strong do what they will, and the weak do what they must,’” said Davidson, quoting the ancient historian Thucydides.

What’s needed, many experts argue, is a more muscular U.S. strategy towards China — a strategy informed by the same kind of hard-nosed realism that drove U.S. policy towards the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The United States was able to check Soviet expansionism with a close web of alliances; a combined conventional and nuclear deterrent that matched Soviet capabilities and resisted coercion; and assertive propaganda — what today is called “information operations” — that broadcast the benefits of democracy over tyranny to the oppressed peoples of the eastern bloc. Despite the unavoidable tensions in such a strategy, the United States continued to engage with Moscow on arms control and other areas of possible cooperation., Most crucially, despite proxy wars in Korea, Vietnam, and Afghanistan, the strategy avoided direct conflict between great powers through four decades of the Cold War.

Accommodation Has Failed

Even before the Trump administration initiated a trade war with China involving hundreds of billions of dollars in punitive tariffs, there were signs of a fundamental, strategic divergence that echoes the Cold War. The U.S. had hoped that, by integrating China into a rules-based international order, exposure to Western values and increasing economic prosperity — including a nine-fold increase in GDP since joining the World Trade Organization in 2001 — would moderate the Communist Party’s authoritarian and mercantilist impulses. But a growing number of U.S. national security and foreign affairs experts have concluded that the decades-old strategy of accommodation and engagement with China has simply failed.

Instead, the party has used China’s rapidly accumulating power to crack down on dissent at home, bully its neighbors, and challenge the United States in Asia and worldwide. Engagement with the US has not stopped Beijing from persistently bending the rules of international trade in service to China’s voracious mercantilism, erecting steep tariffs, forcing corporations to surrender intellectual property or compromise their ethics for the privilege of accessing the Chinese market, and outright stealing proprietary technology from U.S. corporations through cyber espionage. Benefiting from other countries’ free markets has not stopped China from launching a 10-year plan to use government subsidies, state-controlled firms, and “military-civil fusion” between the armed forces and private companies to pursue dominance in high-tech sectors from electric cars to artificial intelligence. Entering the global economy has not stopped China from exercising “debt diplomacy” with its “One Belt, One Road” project, loaning hundreds of billions of dollars to often corrupt government officials in underdeveloped nations in order to bind them to Beijing. Exposure to liberal values has not stopped President Xi Jinping from centralizing power, extending his term of office, or — in an alarming echo of the Cultural Revolution — interning a reported one million Muslim Uighurs and other minorities in “re-education camps.”

“What’s happening in west China is a moral atrocity that only adds to Xi Jinping’s abysmal human rights record, even as Beijing is systematically trying to undermine U.S. alliances and expand an illiberal sphere of influence that is already taking root throughout Asia, accelerating a decline of democracy around the world,” said Ely Ratner, a former China expert at the State Department and the National Security Council. “The end result of these trends is a United States that is less secure and less able to exert influence in Asia. So the stakes are extremely high.”

Nor can Chinese pledges of restraint be relied upon. For instance, after promising the Obama administration to cease and desist an extensive hacking campaign to steal technological secrets from U.S. corporations, China has reportedly started up again. On Dec. 1st, Canada arrested the chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei on charges of subverting international sanctions on trade with Iran: Meng Wanzhou now faces extradition to the United States, where officials believe the company’s telecommunications and networking technology are being used to spy on Americans. On Tuesday, Trump administration officials revealed that they are going to publicly call out China’s aggressive campaign to steal U.S. trade secrets and advanced technologies, pushing back with measures such as having the Justice Department indict hackers working for Chinese intelligence services.

“Contrary to our hopes and expectations China has in the past decade revealed a revisionism and illiberalism that runs directly counter to U.S. interests,” Ratner said at the CSIS conference last week. “On issue after issue our policy of engagement has not only failed to curb this bad behavior, it has actually enabled it.”

The View From Beijing

For their part, Chinese officials openly express their dissatisfaction with the current international order, which they say favors values and interests of the United States and its allies, while overly constraining a newly rising power like China.

Chinese officials and advocates point out that as the lone superpower in a post-Cold War international order, the United States itself has flouted international rules and norms when it suited its interests. The United States and NATO engaged in military operations in Serbia and Libya, for instance, without the backing of the United Nations, where China has a permanent seat on the Security Council and a veto. Likewise, the United States bypassed both the United Nations and NATO in invading Iraq in 2003 with just a “coalition of the willing.”

“China has been a major beneficiary of the current international order, but to call it ‘liberal’ is only partially accurate. We see a liberal, hegemonic order created by the United States and giving you dominant power and the ability to ignore international institutions when they don’t suit your needs, such as when you waged war on Iraq,” said Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at China’s Fudan University, said recently at CSIS. “So the international order today is good, but we see too much U.S. dominance and too little respect for the sovereignty of smaller states. So from the Chinese perspective the current international order needs improvement.”

The other side of this Chinese narrative is the strong conviction that after two long and expensive wars and a global financial meltdown with its origins on Wall Street, the United States and the Western democratic model that it represents are in irreversible decline.

The global financial crisis of 2008 was a watershed moment. Fearful that the economic downturn could provoke social unrest, the communist party escaped the worst impact of the meltdown in global markets by engineering a nearly half trillion dollar stimulus package that kept Chinese growth humming. The profound struggles of the United States and Europe, meanwhile, reinforced Chinese convictions that the free market economic model underpinning the international order was deficient and that the West was in rapid decline. The result was a China that in recent years has been even more emboldened and aggressive on the world stage.

“After the 2008 financial crisis China started adopting a much more assertive posture based, as is so often the case throughout history, on a mixture of hubris and fear, ambition and anxiety,” said Princeton scholar Aaron Friedberg, author of A Contest for Supremacy: China, America and the Struggle for Mastery in Asia.

In the short term, Chinese leaders worried about their ability to maintain political control in a major economic downturn. “But after China emerged from the crisis more rapidly than the United States and its allies, the Chinese concluded that the western economic model was flawed in fundamental ways and that America was on the skids,” Friedberg told me. “The Chinese saw an opportunity to take advantage and started talking about their determination to fend off Western liberalization and restore China to its rightful place as the dominant power in Asia. That was always China’s long term strategy, but after 2008 they started dropping the mask.”

The Lost Decade

With the U.S. military distracted and stretched thin by more than a decade of counterinsurgency operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, China has launched an ambitious military modernization that will be able to challenge the US for dominance in “all domains of conflict – ground, air, sea, space, cyberspace and electromagnetic – throughout the Indo-Pacific” by 2035, according to the think tank RAND. It has built an expanded submarine fleet, a modernized nuclear arsenal, the first Chinese aircraft carrier, a greatly expanded array of advanced anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, and a modern command-and-control and surveillance network. Today, China has the world’s largest navy at approximately 350 ships, the largest coast guard, and a “maritime militia” of fishing boats who answer directly to the PLA Navy and routinely harass shipping in sensitive areas in the East and South China Seas. The seven newly militarized manmade islands are also major building blocks in China’s strategy to dominate its near seas, providing permanent forward basing for weapons that can threaten ships and aircraft traffic.

Acting as unsinkable aircraft carriers, “the manmade islands provide a persistent surveillance and weapons platform that could help China establish a regional air defense system, which would be a key element in controlling the South China Sea,” said Bryan Clark, a former special assistant to the Chief of Naval Operations who’s now with the thinktank CSBA. With its large navy and coast guard working in conjunction with a provocative “maritime militia,” he noted, China already has “escalation dominance” — the ability to answer any escalation by other powers with a greater escalation of its own — and thus de facto control of the South China Sea by constantly operating just below a threshold that might provoke a U.S. military response.

“China’s frequent harassment of U.S. Navy ships and the ships of other navies, and its wide array of forces, gives it the tools to climb up or down the escalation ladder as circumstances dictate,” said Clark. The goal is to increase the costs of U.S. operations in the region, he said, in hopes that the U.S. Navy will reduce its activities over time. “The Chinese want to habituate the idea that if you operate in the South China Sea without their approval you are inviting harassment and assuming increasing risk. They want that to be the new normal.”

U.S. military officials recognize China’s military modernization and operations in the South China Sea as pillars in an “anti-access, aerial denial” (A2/AD) strategy designed to impede U.S. operations in the Indo-Pacific, and call into question the U.S. military commitment to regional allies. They claim to have no intention of abandoning “freedom of navigation” operations in international waters despite the persistent threats and harassment.

“We have made clear to our Asian allies our continued support for a rules-based international order that requires the United States to uphold the principle of freedom of navigation by operating wherever international law allows,” General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Breaking Defense in an exclusive interview in Asia last year. “It’s also indisputable that China has militarized those artificial islands after promising not to do so in 2015, which tells me that they are trying to push the U.S. military further out to sea in order to prevent us from having free access to the region to meet our military commitments to allies. That’s a classic A2/AD strategy. If you combine that with China’s pursuit of long-range anti-ship cruise missiles and rocket systems, it’s clear they are attempting to deny the United States the ability to operate freely in the region.”

A Colder Peace or Thucydides’ Trap?

The biggest shift in U.S. strategy towards China came with January’s release of the new National Defense Strategy, which ended the post-9/11 focus on counterterrorism to prioritize countering revisionist great powers like China and Russia. The Trump administration has followed that by initiating a bruising trade war with China by imposing hundreds of billions of dollars in punitive tariffs on Chinese goods, with Beijing retaliating with its own tariffs in a tit-for-tat that is already destabilizing global markets. The administration has also taken steps to restrict Chinese purchases of U.S. tech firms and exports of U.S. technology to China, with indictments and possible arrests in the offing.

Just this November, two congressionally mandated reports highlighted the stakes in what is rapidly becoming a Cold War- style relationship of confrontation, suspicion, and containment. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission said that “China’s state-led, market-distorting economic model presents a challenge to U.S. economic and national security interests” and its military modernization means “the United States and its allies and partners can no longer assume achieving air superiority in an Indo-Pacific conflict.” Likewise, the National Defense Strategy Commission warned that the U.S. military “might struggle to win, or perhaps [even] lose, a war against China or Russia.”

“These reports independently confirm what The Heritage Foundation had separately concluded – that the U.S. military is far weaker than is commonly appreciated,” wrote Dean Cheng, a senior research fellow at Heritage. “As currently postured, the U.S. military is only marginally able to meet the demands of defending America’s vital national interests.”

Other analysts worry, however, that a U.S. shift to a more Cold War-like posture of pushback and containment of China risks falling into “Thucydides’ Trap.” The reference is to the ancient Greek historian’s recounting how the rise of Athens challenged the established power of Sparta, with an intertwining of “fear, honor, and interest” leading both city-states to mutually destructive war. Thucydides’ Peloponnesian War has been a model for strategists ever since, with Germany’s challenge to Great Britain in two World Wars the most-cited example of his thesis in bloody action.

Graham Allison, in his 2017 book Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides’ Trap?, calculated that in 12 of the 16 cases throughout history in which a rising power confronted a ruling power, the end result was war. (The great exception is how Britain, the global superpower of the 19th century, overcame tensions with the rapidly rising United States and made the U.S. an ally — but that alliance is based on a unique shared heritage of language, culture, and democratic principles).

“Based on the current trajectory, war between the United States and China in the decades ahead is not just possible, but much more likely than recognized at the moment,” Allison wrote. “Indeed, judging by the historical record war is more likely than not.”

Botching The Strategy

Managing the rise of China without either appeasement or open war will take a strategic sophistication the United States hasn’t exercised since the end of the Cold War. The Pentagon’s sobering National Security Strategy and the Trump administration’s more confrontational stance on trade with China are a start, but they have yet to coalesce into the kind of “whole of government” response needed to successfully manage a dangerous great power competition. President Trump’s own mercantilist instincts, disdain for multilateral institutions and agreements, preference for the company of dictators and transactional approach to allies are also undermining America’s alliances at a time when they need bolstering for the competition to come.

“I’m sympathetic to the general direction the Trump administration is moving vis à vis China, but picking fights with our traditional allies in Europe and Asia over trivial trade issues is shooting ourselves in the foot,” said Princeton’s Friedberg. “Crucial to formulating and implementing a new China strategy will be our ability to articulate the democratic, liberal values that draws us together with our allies and differentiates us from China.”

But will the end of accommodation inevitably lead to a Thuycides-trap conflict? Ratner rejects the idea. “No one is arguing we should cut off diplomacy and dialogue with China, which will be critical in maintaining stability in the coming era of competition, but the National Security Strategy explicitly states that the United States is seeking equilibrium that makes it impossible for any one country to dominate Asia, and that is already happening today,” Ratner said. “Rather, this permissive environment that the United States has allowed to form in the South China Sea is encouraging China to further impose its will in the region, radically increasing the likelihood of conflict down the road when the stakes will be even higher.”

Stapleton Roy, a former U.S. ambassador to China, believes the goal of a revitalized strategy of realistic engagement with China should be an equilibrium that blocks Beijing’s military domination of Asia, curbs China’s worst mercantilist policies, and concedes that outside forces have rarely been able to change the domestic policies of great powers. With the United States still possessing the world’s most powerful military and innovative economy, he said, that should still be well within our reach.

“But don’t underestimate the challenge,” Roy said at CSIS. “China is eager to step into the global leadership role that the United States has largely abandoned, and it’s outspending us in every sphere of power. The harsh reality is the United States poorly used its post-Cold War period of dominance with conflicts in the Middle East and the Great Recession straining our resources and polarizing our politics. Clearly U.S.-China relations should now be at the center of our foreign policy concerns, and handled with great creativity. So far we are not passing that test.”","“The end result of these trends is a United States that is less secure and less able to exert influence in Asia.
“So the international order today is good, but we see too much U.S. dominance and too little respect for the sovereignty of smaller states.
If you combine that with China’s pursuit of long-range anti-ship cruise missiles and rocket systems, it’s clear they are attempting to deny the United States the ability to operate freely in the region.”A Colder Peace or Thucydides’ Trap?

Council also welcomes the signing in September 2018 of the Revitalized-Agreement for the Resolution of Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS), under the facilitation of IGAD and the Government of Sudan, which has led, among other things, to an improvement in relations between Sudan and South Sudan. Furthermore, Council welcomes, in particular, the decision of the UN Security Council 2444 (2018) to lift the sanctions against the State of Eritrea in response to these positive developments in the region;

Commends the members of the AUHIP, H.E. Thabo Mbeki, H.E Abdulsalami Abubakar and H.E. Ramtane Lamamra, and their support team for their diligent discharge of its broad mandate conferred by Council to assist Sudan and South Sudan to address their challenges relating to conflict and democratic transformation, as well as in the promotion of peace and security in the Horn of Africa. Council also commends the Chair of IGAD, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, for his support to the efforts of the Panel. Council also expresses its appreciation to the United Nations and all other partners for their continuous efforts extended to the activities of the AUHIP and to the countries of the Horn of Africa;

Further commends the Government of Sudan for the progress made in addressing the challenges in the country and urges the Government of Sudan and the other Sudanese interlocutors to engage and cooperate with the Panel in its efforts to re-energise the Roadmap process. In this regard, Council further urges the Parties, particularly the Government of Sudan, to ensure and sustain an environment conducive for the opposition and all Sudanese to participate freely and effectively in all of the stages of the national elections of 2020 and the constitution-making process;

Appeals to the Government of Sudan and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and Sudan Liberation Movement/Army-Minni Minawi (SLM-MM) to energise their engagement with the UNAMID, with the Panel and the State of Qatar, in order to find a comprehensive solution to the conflict in Darfur, on the basis of the Darfur Document for Peace in Darfur (DDPD), and in the context of the Roadmap Agreement;

Welcomes the continuing renewal by the Sudanese Parties of the ceasefire and cessation of hostilities that they have unilaterally declared in Sudan, and urges the Parties to build upon these decisions by finalising formal agreements for durable cessation of hostilities and complete final security and political negotiations in the context of the Roadmap process.

In this regard, Council calls upon the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army-Abdul Wahid (SLMA/Abdul Wahid) similarly to declare a cessation of hostilities and urgently to join the political process seeking to end permanently the conflict in Darfur;

Commends the Transitional Government of South Sudan and all parties to conflict in the country for their commitments to finding lasting solution to the conflict and the signing of the R-ARCSS. Council welcomes once again the signing of the Revitalized Agreement for the resolution of the conflict in South Sudan (R-ARCSS) by the members of the AU Ad Hoc Committee for South Sudan as Guarantors and invites all the Guarantors of the Agreement and other stakeholders to assist the people of South Sudan in their quest for lasting peace.

Council urges the parties to the R-ARCSS to maintain their commitment to peace by cooperating with each other in the implementation of the Agreement;

Council welcomes the assistance that the Republic of South Sudan is extending, in support of the Panel, in engaging the Sudanese parties as they seek resolution of the conflicts in Darfur and the Two Areas and urges the parties therefore to engage diligently in order to reach credible, just and lasting agreements to resolve the conflicts;

Encourages the Panel to continue its engagement, in close collaboration with other AU mechanisms, to complement the efforts of IGAD, in support to the democratic transformation of South Sudan and the vital task of nation building, especially through implementation of the processes envisaged by the R-ARCSS;

Urges the Governments of Sudan and South Sudan to continue to implement their obligations under the Cooperation Agreement (2012), particularly, the implementation of the Safe Demilitarized Border Zone (SDBZ), the demarcation of the international boundary and the completion of the negotiations on the disputed and claimed areas, and requests the AUHIP to intensify its engagement with the Parties to encourage timely implementation of those commitments;

Calls upon the Presidents of Sudan and South Sudan to re-energise their engagement in cooperation with the Panel to address the Final Status of the Abyei Area and encourages the leadership of the two States, and the two Communities of the Ngok Dinka and Misseriya to engage each other to continue to contribute towards addressing the Final Status of the Abyei Area in a manner that will ensure the stability of the Abyei Area. In this regard, Council urges the two States to engage each other and mandate their representatives in Abyei Joint Oversight Committee (AJOC) to discuss and take decisions on the establishment of the Abyei Area interim institutions, in accordance with the Agreement on Temporary Administrative and Security Arrangements for the Abyei Area of June 2011;

The elders had exercised comprehensive informal systems and regulations to address the community conflicts including clan conflicts, land disputes and livestock fights. Traditional elders practiced the Xeer-Law to govern the social issues, harmonize the conflicting interests of the community and building consensus to their differences. Sultans and Aqils particularly have been the main source of upholding reconciliation processes, bringing stabilization initiatives, maintaining peace and building safer lives to Somali community. They served as a connection bridge between the government and the communities and built sustainable relationships to collaborate their respective roles.

After the collapse of Siyad Barre’s regime in 1991, Somaliland successfully passed different stages of conflicts and encountered a period of civil wars that led to the emergence of number of clan violence triggered by the lust for power and worldly resource allocations. During that episode, they actively engaged in the processes of peace-building, disarmament of rebel groups, re-building of government institutions and healing the trauma of civil wars. For instance, one of the most remembered tasks of Somaliland traditional elders was the holding of Somaliland peace forums from 1991 in an attempt to mark the return of Somaliland Independence from Somalia all the way to setting up the foundations of nationhood to total independent governance. They co-organized peace forums held in the six regions of Somaliland including Burao, Borama and Sahil peace-making conferences. Since then, they have been a point of reference to end any disagreements, and this has made Somaliland to effectively exercise traditional mechanisms of conflict resolution that have many times worked to create a lasting peace and harmony among the parties.

Since the adoption of multi-party systems in 2002 according to the referendum of Somaliland Constitution on May 31, 2001, the role of traditional elders substantially changed as it marked the introduction of new formal governance systems. Somaliland tried to combine democracy and traditional governance structures and this formed the basis of the traditional elders’ confusion to adjust their role in order to maintain their significant leadership position within the community. Yahye Xanas, the Executive Director of Somaliland Journalists Association (SOLJA) argues that “…the leaders shifted their role to align themselves with the new system and the hybrid governance system brought a system of confusion to clearly create borders between the two systems”.

They failed to keep their original role and dived to the politics, engaged in political campaigns, thereby creating a source of tensions to the community – as most of them have nepotistic in they styles and manners of leadership. They now place their interests to come before the interest of the public and the government. Nowadays, traditional elders talk about sensitive issues through media and spread wrong messages to their target audiences bringing divisions and destroying the peaceful cohabitation of Somaliland community.

Also, a significant number of postgraduate students of University of Hargeisa opined that the involvement of traditional elders in the politics is a means of paving ways for political conflict as they bring divisions to their followers. For instance during the 2017 Somaliland Presidential Election, some of the most prestigious Sultans publicly came out to open up long forgotten sensitive hidden issues that created political conflicts, and consequently put a long-lasting negative impact at both regional and district levels. Some of the traditional elders are official agents of political parties and as a result directly perform political party tasks, for example by mobilizing and indoctrinating voters to enable the party to win the election.

However, a few of them are working on their original mandate(s) and have the trust of the wider population, whereas majority of them are no longer working with the values and customs of the people. Barkhad Batun, a senior political and civil right activist, once said, “It seems that society have lost their trust to the traditional elders as public institutions are getting strong to take the role of conflict resolution, arbitration and problem solving.”

It is pathetic to note that the shifting of the majority of traditional elders’ role didn’t occur overnight, but the main reasons contributing includes the following:

1. Politicization of membership: For the last two decades, many elders have been elected without considering their knowledge, experience and leadership qualities. Previously, elders were elected based on unbiased selection criteria which ensured that every leader meets the minimum requirements to traditionally lead that clan. However, nowadays most of the newly elected elders are wrongly position and have not come through the unanimous vote to represent their community. This has questioned the legitimacy and representation of the elders, and this is why most so called traditional elders act out of the norms and values of core Somali society.

2. Insufficient Knowledge: Majority of traditional leaders had rural background and didn’t come through the formal system of schooling. Hence, this makes hard for them to adjust to modern democratic governance systems, and become unable to cope with the desired changes. They remain seated with traditional way of dealing conflicts and are reluctant with democratic values and principles.

3. Economic Opportunities: the Ministry of Interior provides inadequate budget to finance the operations of the traditional leaders and their personal needs, so they always seek other sources of income to counterbalance their needs. They shape the politics in any manner that suits their interests and use politics as a source of money. This is where the new name of “Koofiyad Bacle” originated describing that they are money oriented rather than providing leadership to their followers. “Previously, when the traditional elders were elected, they were given number of livestock as source of wealth but now that habit is no longer common. Most of traditional elders are now involved in politics as economic shelter and as source of wealth.” said by one the Aqils who resides in Hargeisa.

4. Misrepresentation: About 98% of Somaliland politicians always use the traditional elders as a tool of passing their message to the community and engage them in wide and bastardized politics to serve their interests. In fact, Politicians finance the traditional leaders to mobilize the community to get acceptance and convince them on their ideologies and principles. Both ruling and opposition parties heavily rely on the traditional elders to convey their message, and even sometimes involve them in issues which could have otherwise been officially handled and solved by an institute under formal governance systems. In a nutshell, it seems that majority of traditional elders are a point of extremely standing with one party which has actually divided their followers.

Way Forward

It is obvious that there are still few traditional elders who are working on the basis of values and norms of Somaliland community, however there are significant unpalatable changes when compared to the trend of traditional leadership in the past. The government institutions need to be strengthened to limit the role of elders in the decision making processes, and direct their operations toward peace, security, justice and development of the state. In addition, Somaliland traditional elders should be selected on the basis of defined leadership criteria to positively influence their followers and guide them toward the right direction. More so, the government should organize education programs of conflict resolution, peace and Justice to the traditional leaders and train them on their ideal roles and responsibilities to align the informal Justice system with that of formal system. Lastly, Elders must play within their mandate and desist from acting as politicians who negatively engage through dividing the community and fuelling conflicts. This would help the nation to create peaceful and just societies in accordance with Somaliland National Development Plan II and global Sustainable Development Goals","Similar to many other African countries, Somaliland enjoyed traditional mechanisms of conflict resolution and peace-building processes led by Somali traditional elders in the past centuries.
