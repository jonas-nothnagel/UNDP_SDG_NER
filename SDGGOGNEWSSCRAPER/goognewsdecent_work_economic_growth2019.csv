The ""Decent Work"" agenda is not new. The International Labor Organization (ILO) has been promoting decent work standards since 1919, and we have come a long way since. The workplace today is safer and fairer, and employment has lifted millions out of extreme poverty and created a sizeable middle class in developing economies.

Here's the definition the ILO uses:

Decent work sums up the aspirations of people in their working lives. It involves opportunities for work that is productive and delivers a fair income, security in the workplace and social protection for families, better prospects for personal development and social integration, freedom for people to express their concerns, organize and participate in the decisions that affect their lives and equality of opportunity and treatment for all women and men.

Yet, the fact that Sustainable Development Goal 8 calls out ""Decent Work and Economic Growth"" as an area of focus is a helpful reminder of how much progress is still to be made on persistent issues, including unemployment, social mobility, and gender and wage inequalities.

At the same time, new norms, challenges and opportunities keep emerging. Companies increasingly need to act in response to new regulation and civil society expectations. Employee well-being, living wages, the gender pay gap and human rights are only a few of the complex social challenges companies are expected to tackle.

Evidence suggests that the complexity and sensitivity of social issues can leave companies unsure where to start and reluctant to set goals. As part of the ""Targeting Value"" research, we examined how corporate sustainability goals are addressing the evolving decent work agenda and its complex issues. To understand the landscape of goals that drive positive impact we examined the approaches of known leaders on the agenda and created a database of goals from the top 65 Fortune 500 companies from the energy, finance and food sectors.

We found that companies generally have some goals around decent work and labor standards that align with the ILO and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) agendas; however, the scope of issues addressed varies. The majority of companies in our sample have set goals that focus on:

Health and Safety — such as reduction of employee and contractor injuries and implementation of best practice or prevention culture.

— such as reduction of employee and contractor injuries and implementation of best practice or prevention culture. Diversity — including gender equality, such as targets to achieve specific percentages of female employees at senior levels of company management or in the talent pool.

— including gender equality, such as targets to achieve specific percentages of female employees at senior levels of company management or in the talent pool. Employee Development, Training and Skills — that promote investments in existing and future talent through education and mentoring programs.



To some extent, the goals seem to reflect sector-specific priorities; for example, the energy sector heavily features health and safety goals.

Differences also reveal a range of maturity regarding not only goal-setting but also approaches towards specific decent work sub-issues. For example, while many companies have been working towards health and safety and diversity for a number of years, they may be relatively new to managing human rights or mental well-being.

Anecdotal evidence and our broader research into goals also suggest that the complexity and sensitivity of social issues can leave companies unsure where to start and reluctant to set goals.

However, we are seeing first examples of companies setting goals and targets on complex and emerging social issues including living wages, the gender pay gap, inclusion, the future of work and human rights.

For example, Marks & Spencer’s Plan A 2025 (PDF) has set a goal on the future of work and disruption due to technological advancement: ""By 2020, we'll complete collaborative research into the likely employment impacts of next-generation technologies. We'll then provide an annual update on our actions to prepare our people for the future, whether they work for M&S or other employers.""

Nestlé's ""Gender Balance"" commitment goes beyond traditional diversity goals (percentage of female employees at board level) and recognizes the need for ""creating the enabling conditions in our work environment to achieve annual increases in the percentage of women managers and senior leaders."" Nestlé launched a new diversity and inclusion framework, including unconscious bias training to support delivery against this ambition.

The nature of these goals reflects that companies do not fully know yet the answer to a particular challenge, but they commit themselves publicly to working towards a solution. They undertake or commission research and collaborate with NGOs and other experts to develop an understanding of root causes and define step-by-step responses.

Companies that do not fully know yet the answer to a particular challenge are committing themselves publicly to working towards a solution. For example, Unilever worked closely with the Fair Wage Network to develop the company's approach to a living wage. In another example, Mercer is convening a Responsible Employer Forum which aims to raise industry awareness on fair wage issues and share best practice on how multinational organizations can implement fairness in workplace initiatives.

This way of working brings to life what experts refer to as social theory of change or context-based methodology. Traditionally, non-profits have applied this approach to demonstrate their impact on particular social challenges, for example, how an education program is driving social mobility. SustainAbility's ""Targeting Value"" report identifies a theory of change as one of the best practice attributes in corporate goal setting, and other social issues experts advocate the methodology as the equivalent to the science-based approach for environmental goals. Other strategies that should continue to be leveraged going forward include:

The ILO and the SDGs provide internationally respected frameworks, indicators, insights and recommendations that can help companies develop their understanding of social issues, set appropriate and meaningful goals and roll out action plans.

SDGs and Partnerships with experts and NGOs, as well as industry collaboration at the global and local level will help companies develop meaningful interventions and targets that will drive impact.

With rapidly changing norms and emerging regulation around decent work issues that enhance corporate accountability not only towards employees but increasingly also suppliers, we expect more companies will be publicly committing to the agenda and setting goals on complex social issues. Long-term success will depend, in part, on effective multi-stakeholder collaboration, wider uptake and evolution of current best practice and courage to address difficult questions to which we don't yet have the answers.","This is the final part of a six-part series revealing findings from SustainAbility’s recent report, ""Targeting Value,"" with a focus on how the landscape of sustainability goals around the decent work agenda is evolving.

1,https://www.equaltimes.org/in-uganda-unions-are-helping-to,"Fri, 09 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Equal Times,"In Uganda, unions are helping to drive transport workers into decent work","According to estimates there are anything between 100,000 and 250,000 boda-boda drivers in Kampala alone.

Three years ago, Samuel Mugisha almost quit his job. As the driver of a motorbike taxi (known locally as a boda-boda) in the Ugandan capital of Kampala, rampant police harassment was having a huge, negative impact on his daily earnings. But today, Samuel is thriving as a member of the 38,000-member Kampala Metropolitan Boda-Boda Association (KAMBA).

Launched in January 2014, the association is one of the newest members of Uganda’s oldest trade union, the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers’ Union (ATGWU), which today is leading the drive to represent informal transport workers and help secure decent work for all of its members.

After decades of ever-declining numbers of formal transport workers, the ATGWU is on the up. It now has close to 60,000 members, with the significant intake of informal transport workers such as minibus taxi drivers, bicycle taxi drivers and boda-boda drivers giving the union a new lease of life.

""It hasn’t been easy. Many hurdles stood in the way of this formalisation, but we have covered a lot of ground so far,"" says Usher Wilson Owere, the national chairman of the ATGWU. ""The journey is still long but we are taking one step at a time.""

Since it was founded in 1938 as the Uganda Motor Drivers Association, the ATGWU has faced various hurdles, but perhaps the biggest threat to its existence came from the plummeting membership numbers that followed the collapse of state-owned passenger road transport services.

Like elsewhere in Africa, the imposition of Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs) in Uganda during the mid-1980s resulted in mass job losses, particularly in the public sector. For the ATGWU, large-scale redundancies at the public bus companies that formed the bulk of its membership base decimated the union.

By 2006, things were so bad that membership fell to an all-time low of around 2,000 (mainly airport worker) members.

""After structural adjustment programmes and privatisation, Uganda was [facing] a new form of raw capitalism, in which you were either rubbed out or [you had to] build your own power,"" explains Owere in a report by the German foundation Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung (FES). It’s titled ’’Transforming transport unions through mass organisation of informal workers: a case study of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers’ Union (ATGWU), Uganda.’’

Regroup and rebuild

It was at this point, sometime in the mid-2000s, that the ATGWU decided to regroup and rebuild - and the inclusion of informal workers was key to this. Although it wasn’t until 2015 that the International Labour Organization (ILO) adopted the landmark Recommendation 204 to help facilitate the formalisation of the 50 per cent of workers in the world who operate in the informal economy, in 2006 the new ATGWU general secretary, Aziz Kiirya, did just that.

Kiirya knew that in order to regenerate the ATGWU, his trade union would have to organise and represent informal workers - estimates put the number of boda-boda drivers in Kampala alone at anywhere between 100,000 and 250,000, in addition to the capital’s 50,000 minibus drivers - and so he changed the union’s constitution to include them.

""The ATGWU strategy for organising informal economy workers was based on an understanding that these workers are in many cases already organised, not within the trade union movement, but through credit and savings cooperatives, informal self-help groups, community-based organisations, and, most importantly, associations,"" says the report.

The Airport Taxi Operators Association was the first such association to affiliate with the ATGWU back in 2008, closely followed by a number of other national and regional organisations such as the Long Distance Heavy Truck Drivers Association and the Entebbe Stages and Conductors Association.

For Uganda’s informal transport workers, unionisation has ""had a dramatic impact"" according to the report, including ""a reduction in police harassment, substantial gains through collective bargaining, reduced internal conflict within the associations, and improvement of visibility and status for informal women transport workers"".

Kampala’s airport taxi drivers, for example, have secured standardised branding for their taxis, an office and sales counter in the arrivals hall, proper parking facilities, and rest areas, amongst other collective bargaining gains. Meanwhile, other members have benefited from having union membership cards, particularly when crossing borders.

The ATGWU received a major boost in 2013 when the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) launched a project to improve the capacity of unions across Africa, Asia and Latin America to represent informal transport workers.

Key objectives included training organisers and also improving work conditions for women in the sector. The number of women working in the very male-dominated transport sector in Uganda is very small; KOSTA, for example, only has 45 women conductors and just 13 drivers out of a membership of approximately 36,000.

Juliet Muhebwa is one of KOSTA’s female conductors. Although the AGTWU has formed a women’s committee to support the needs of female transport workers, Juliet says they still face the same issues affecting informal women workers across the world, namely long working hours, low pay, dangerous working conditions and the threat of violence, harassment and intimidation.

She describes the attitude towards women working in the sector as ""largely negative, which discourages new workers"" although the workshops and training has been held by the AGTWU for women workers to deal with some of these issues.

More work to do

In February 2015, the union established the ATGWU Informal Sector Committee, comprising the chairs and secretaries of all the affiliated associations. This has helped the members not only get to know one another but also to improve systems and procedures within their respective organisations.

There is still more work to do but the AGTWU has experience in overcoming major challenges. In 2013, Ugandan authorities passed a law prohibiting gatherings of more than 10 people. Although trade unions were officially exempted from the law, in August of that year, police occupied and later shut down the ATGWU’s offices where taxi drivers and conductors had gathered for a meeting the police considered illegal because they weren’t not considered ’workers’.

The ATGWU responded strongly, threatening to call a strike and bring the whole of Kampala to a standstill if the legitimate rights of these workers were not recognised. The ITF even wrote to the Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni and as tensions threatened to escalate, the police backed down and the union called off the strike.

""The confrontation and subsequent victory proved to be a pivotal moment in the organisation of informal workers for the ATWGU,"" says the report.

""It was not only a victory against police interference in the business of the associations, but against the day-to-day police harassment and extortion suffered by informal transport workers.""

But even the ATGWU recognises that it has ""only just scratched the surface"" of what still needs to be done, ranging from the huge number of people still in the informal economy to tackling the reluctance of white collar unions to accept informal economy members as workers of equal standing.

At present, affiliated association members still do not enjoy full union membership and a lack of voting rights deprives informal workers of the right to fully participate in trade union activities. There are a number of barriers preventing this: for example, full ATGWU members must pay 2 per cent of their salary in union dues. This poses a very real problem for informal workers who experience daily income fluctuations - many don’t even have bank accounts.

""We are members but in a way we are more outsiders,"" says Juliet, the bus conductor. ""We want to be brought closer. It’s the only way we will get more empowered.""

The reform of the ATGWU constitution to ensure the total integration of informal workers into the ATGWU was a key topic at the 2017 Quinquennial Delegates Conference of the ATGWU.

But for informal workers like Frank, the difference being affiliated to the AGTWU has made to his life has been huge.

""Previously, almost half of my earnings were going into bribing police officers to let me operate. That pressure is off my back now,"" says the 32-year old father-of-three.

Because he is able to save more money, Frank says he can now pay his children’s school fees. He has also been able to help his wife start a grocery business to supplement their household income.

""I was more pessimistic about the future three years ago,"" he says while leaning on his crimson-red bike. ""Now I see better times ahead"".","After decades of ever-declining numbers of formal transport workers, the ATGWU is on the up.

A paper in this week’s Nature Sustainability says: kind of.

It should be possible to meet the basic physical needs of everyone on the planet without using up physical resources too quickly. But it wouldn’t be possible to extend a first-world standard of living to everyone without needing “a level of resource use that is two-six times the sustainable level,” researcher Daniel O’Neill and his colleagues report. Only a drastic improvement in efficiency would allow the planet to manage this higher standard of living.

O’Neill and his colleagues looked at the resources that humans use a lot of and that are critical for the planet’s health: things like fresh water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Exceeding the “planetary boundaries” of these resources risks global environmental stability—and we’re not doing well on that front.

Pushing boundaries

The new paper assesses around 150 countries for their performance at meeting a series of human needs, ranging from the very basic (nutrition, sanitation, and freedom from extreme poverty) to the more advanced (like equality and democratic quality). They used the data to assess how well countries are doing at meeting their citizens’ needs and how much they’re eating into the planet’s resources to achieve this. To achieve global utopia, every country on the list would need to meet all of its citizens’ needs without exceeding its share of planetary resources.

Instead, unsurprisingly, an interactive graphic shows that the countries that are doing well on quality of life are hogging the resources, while the countries that aren’t hogging resources generally lag on well-being. Wealthy countries like the US, Canada, France, and Japan are generally doing well by their citizens but are blazing through planetary boundaries. Countries like Malawi and Nepal aren't gobbling up resources, but they also aren't meeting well-being thresholds.

The relationship isn’t perfect, though: some countries have to deal with the worst of both worlds. Turkey, Mongolia, South Africa, and Swaziland are doing particularly badly—they’re transgressing on five or six of the seven planetary boundaries the researchers assessed, while meeting well-being targets on zero (Swaziland) to three (Mongolia) of the 11 well-being thresholds.

On the other hand, some countries get high marks with much less. Vietnam stands out of the crowd, meeting six of the well-being targets while transgressing only two planetary boundaries. Germany does a smidge better than other wealthy countries, hitting all well-being targets but only five of the seven planetary boundaries.

O’Neill and his colleagues point out that the efficient countries give reason for hope: “Some nations are able to achieve the social thresholds at a much lower level of resource use,” they write. “These results give a sense of the possibility space for achieving the social thresholds within planetary boundaries.”

Unsustainable

On the other hand, they add, if population growth continues on its current path, the problem will become more and more complicated. It may be possible to meet the basic physical needs of everyone on the planet—as long as “everyone on the planet” is still less than seven billion people. As the population increases, the need for efficiency increases, too.

Things like democratic quality and equality don’t directly produce high standards of living, but they are associated with them. These items have less of a clear relationship to resource use: getting everyone food and healthcare is linked strongly to physical resources, but getting everyone social support is a different ball game. Extra consumption of resources isn’t as closely tied to advanced needs, the researchers suggest.

This implies that wealthy countries should be able to reduce their consumption without reducing their quality of life. But this would require a shift from the pursuit of GDP growth to what the researchers term “alternative economic models such as a steady-state economy.”

This grading system has some rough edges—for instance, it makes the assumption of an average per-person distribution of resources, when the reality is that some regions will always have a higher need or footprint than others. Water-scarce areas, for example, have to use more resources in maintaining their water supply.

Future research will need to address some of these complications if we want to come up with more precise estimates. But this is a start at answering the question of what a sustainable world that takes care of everyone could look like and what it would take to get there.

Australian wage growth appears to be bottoming following years of constant declines

While wage growth may start to pick up in the quarters ahead, Westpac says there is very little for workers to get excited about

Recent trends in new Australian EBA agreements and wage pressures abroad suggest wage pressures will remain weak for some time yet

Australia’s latest wage report was released last week, revealing a quarterly rise in hourly earnings of 0.55%, leaving the increase on a year earlier at 2.08%.

While barely ahead of inflation, meaning growth in real wages was next to nothing, the annual rate was above the recent-record low of 1.9% struck in mid-2016, suggesting that after years of constant declines wage growth may have turned the corner.

The question many are now asking is how far will wage growth lift, and how soon it will occur?

On that front, Justin Smirk, Senior Economist at Westpac, has some bad news for those banking on a return to the giddy days of annual wage growth in excess of 4% seen before the global financial crisis.

“Wage inflation may have found a base but there is very little to get excited about,” Smirk says.

“At a national level, the only real sign of any lift in wages is from the public sector, particularly in Victoria, with a focus mostly in education and training and health services.”

Outside of those sectors, Smirk says “wage growth remains quite weak and remarkably so across industries, sectors and states”, noting that of the 18 industries tracked by the ABS only two — healthcare and social assistance and arts and recreation services — had annual wage growth greater than 2.5% in the December quarter report.

For those employed in the private sector — accounting for the vast majority of the Australian workers — Smirk says the wage report provided little reason for celebration.

“Annual growth in private sector wages was flat at 1.9% year-on-year, close to the record low of 1.8% and much lower than the ten year average of 3.0%,” he says.

“Wages growth in the private sector hit a peak of 4.4% in mid-2008 from where it slowly trended down to the historical low in 2017.”

And while public sector workers enjoyed a faster increase in wages than their private-sector counterparts, lifting by 2.4% over the year, Smirk says there’s few signs that suggest wage inflation is accelerating.

“Public sector wages growth was a little stronger, lifting 0.6% in Q4, but this was on par with the average of 0.6% for the previous four quarters,” he says.

“So even in the public sector, it is really a bit of a stretch to argue that we have seen an acceleration in wage inflation.”

But what about the record level of employment growth in Australia last year, seeing over 400,00 new jobs created? Surely hiring of that magnitude — if sustained — will help to bring down unemployment and boost wage pressures?

In theory, yes, it should, says Smirk.

But this is 2018 — not 1998 or even 2008 — with the relationship between unemployment levels and wage growth diverging significantly from what was the case in the past.

Just look at this chart from Westpac for evidence as to just how much this relationship has changed since the GFC.

Source: Westpac Bank

Unemployment has slowly fallen over the last few years yet private sector wage growth has not responded, continuing to decelerate despite tighter labour market conditions.

“This relationship has shifted significantly over the last few years and is less reliable,” says Smirk.

“The muted reaction in wages to date could be because there is more slack in the labour market than that indicated by unemployment alone.”

To better understand why wage growth remains lower than what would have otherwise been the case in the past, Smirk says you need to look not only at the number of unemployed Australians but also those who are in employment but who want to work more hours, known as underemployed workers.

Combined, these two groups are defined as underutilised workers.

As seen in this next chart from Westpac, Australia’s underutilisation rate currently sits near the highest level on record, indicating that despite a recent decline in unemployment there’s still an abundance of workers available for employers to chose from, helping to keep wage pressures incredibly muted.

Source: Westpac Bank

And, creating even further doubt as to whether workers will start seeing a meaningful lift in wages ahead, Smirk says current wage outcomes are still well below the levels that you’d normally expect given underutilisation levels.

“At the national level this measure generates a better fit [on wage pressures] but nevertheless it still continues to overestimate where wage inflation should be,” he says.

“Based on an underutilisation rate of 14.2%, wage inflation should be around 2.75% year-on-year, quite a bit higher than where it currently is.”

That anomaly is captured in the faint red points clustered in the bottom-right of the chart.

Westpac says this may reflect structural factors relating to technology and globalisation which is potentially weighing in wage growth.

It’s also a similar scenario to that seen in the US, UK and Japan where extremely tight labour market conditions have not resulted in pickup in wage growth to anywhere near the magnitude seen in prior periods.

Creating further headwinds for Australian wage pressure, and ensuring uncertainty over the prospect for a meaningful lift in wage growth in the coming years, Smirk also points out that newly-inked enterprise bargaining agreements have also been far lower than those they are replacing, something that not only places downward pressure on wage growth now but potentially in the future.

Source: Westpac Bank

“In the September quarter 2017, the average wage rise paid by new agreements registered was just 2.0% year-on-year, well down from the recent peak of 3.4% in late 2016,” he says.

“It is starting to drag down the average wage rise paid for all agreements from a recent peak of 3.5% per annum at the end 2014 to 2.9% at the end of the September quarter last year.

Enterprise bargaining is the process of negotiation generally between the employer, employees and their bargaining representatives with the goal of making an enterprise agreement, according to Australia’s Fair Work Ombudsman.

It sets out the terms and conditions of employment, including pay rates, between an employee or group of employees and one or more employers.

According to analysis from UBS, EBAs cover around 36% of all Australian workers.

Given the downtrend in EBAs, a lack of wage pressures for private sector workers and what’s been seen in other advanced economies over recent years, it’s understandable why Smirk suggests there very little for workers to get excited about for wage growth in the years ahead.

New discoveries of oil and gas are accompanying the expansion of renewable energy generation. What does the continent’s energy transition hold for jobs and sustainable development?

Because of its vulnerability to climate change, Africa as a whole is facing the double challenge of tackling climate change and coping with its consequences on production, growth, and employment in all economic sectors. While adaptation efforts are already, and will continue to be needed, preventing the worst possible impacts of climate change from materialising is also critical. Otherwise, the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development may be compromised. Indeed, over the past decade, climate change and extreme weather events have caused unprecedented damage in African countries, ruining infrastructure, threatening economic activity, and destroying jobs. The most visible manifestations are the droughts in southern Africa, floods in West Africa, and desertification of entire areas in the Maghreb region.

To be sure, African countries focus most of their attention on adaptation to climate change. At the same time, however, an increasing number of governments across Africa consider a sustainable energy transition as a central aspect of their climate strategies. In this regard, several questions remain to be answered. How to achieve a sustainable energy transition that delivers inclusive growth and jobs? How to reduce the gap in skills in order to unleash the potential for vibrant enterprises and green jobs? And finally, how to develop public policy frameworks that are conducive to a just transition for workers, enterprises, and communities? This article touches upon these issues.

Context and issues in Africa’s energy transition

Compared to the majority of fossil fuel-dependent industrial countries, the energy transition in Africa presents a distinct feature. With the exception of a few countries such as South Africa, most African countries are not in a situation of pressure where they need to phase out of coal to meet their energy needs through alternative energy sources. Africa’s energy transition rather faces two important challenges: modernisation and expansion.

Modernisation is about exploiting the continent’s vast endowment of renewable energy resources, including biomass, wind, solar, and hydro-power potential. It also implies moving away from the use of inefficient and hazardous forms of energy by over 700 million people and towards the deployment of modern fuels and sources of energy for cooking, heating, and lighting. In the fossil fuel sector (especially oil and gas), both resource and labour productivity need to be improved. Expansion is about bringing to scale adapted technologies to meet the energy needs of a growing population of 1,2 billion people, of which only 30 percent have access to reliable electricity.

Globally, we are witnessing a shift in the energy landscape, away from fossil fuels and towards less-polluting sources of energy. In Africa, however, a closer look reveals a different picture. On the one hand, there is an expansion in energy generation from renewables. For example, the recently launched Taiba Ndiaye Wind Project in Senegal will generate 158-megawatt of additional capacity. In Ghana, the planned Nzema Solar Power Station will be the largest installation of its kind in Africa, and it is expected to increase Ghana’s electricity generating capacity by 6 percent and allow nearly 100 000 homes to benefit from clean energy. Morocco, a pioneer in this area, seeks to deploy about 1,5 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity across the country to meet its goal of increasing the share of renewables in its energy mix to 42 percent by 2020. In April 2018, South Africa signed contracts with 27 independent renewable energy power producers, worth US$4,6 billion, to produce 2 300 megawatts of electricity over the next five years.

While the African energy landscape is changing, it is not in a single direction. The energy transition is complex and has important ramifications for the structure of economies and future development prospects. Climate change is an essential aspect to it, but so are many other key aspects of the sustainable development goals, such as reducing the health impact on women and children of the use of inefficient cooking fuels; powering productive industries in rural areas and modernising agriculture; and the overall improvement of living conditions.

What are prospects for new job creation?

Studies by the International Labour Office and other institutions have pointed to four types of possible impacts of climate change and greening policies on labour markets. Firstly, the expansion of greener products, services, and infrastructure will translate into higher labour demand across many sectors of the economy, thereby leading to the creation of new jobs. Examples include jobs in renewable energy, energy efficiency, manufacturing, transportation, and building and construction. In addition to direct jobs, indirect employment is created along the supply chains, including in the building of necessary infrastructure. And as new income is generated and spent across the economy, further employment is created.

Secondly, some of the existing jobs will be substituted as a result of transformations in the economy from less to more efficient, from high-carbon to low-carbon, and from more to less polluting technologies, processes, and products. Examples include the shift from the manufacturing of internal combustion engines to the production electric vehicles, as well as the energy transition itself, as clean energy replaces fossil fuels.

Thirdly, certain jobs may be eliminated, either phased out completely or massively reduced in numbers, without direct replacement. This may happen where polluting and energy- and materials-intensive economic activities are reduced or phased out entirely, such as in the closing of inefficient coal mines.

Finally, many, and perhaps most, existing jobs (such as plumbers, electricians, metal workers, and construction workers) will simply be transformed and redefined as day-to-day workplace practices, skill sets, work methods, and job profiles are greened. For instance, plumbers and electricians can be reoriented to carry out similar work with solar water heating or solar photovoltaic systems.

On the energy transition more specifically, two common questions are whether clean energies generate more employment than fossil fuels, and whether this applies in the context of Africa. Several studies indicate that renewable energy technologies create more jobs than fossil fuel technologies. One study concludes that per dollar of expenditure, spending on renewable energy can produce nearly 70 percent more jobs than spending on fossil fuels. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimated that the renewable energy sector employed nearly 10 million people worldwide in 2016, with 62,000 jobs in Africa. Nearly half of these jobs are in South Africa and a quarter in North Africa.

In relation to the notion of modernisation mentioned above, replacing the millions of kerosene lamps, candles, and flash-lights used in many African countries with modern solar lighting can provide a cheaper alternative and stimulate green jobs. A study found that replacing these lighting systems with modern solar lighting technologies for people living outside the grid could create 500 000 new jobs related to lighting in countries of the Ecowas region.

More than 10 million young African men and women are expected to enter the labour market each year over the coming years. Most analysts tend to agree that the traditional public sector will not be able to absorb this new work force. Entrepreneurship and self-employment are indispensable to create quality jobs in large numbers, and the energy transition can play a central role in this regard. For that to happen, skills development and upgrading, entrepreneurship promotion, and enabling policy and governance frameworks are required.

Various intervention models and programs to promote job creation in clean energies have shown a clear advantage of combining technical and vocational training with entrepreneurship training. Particularly for African countries, entrepreneurship and self-employment are becoming priorities in youth employment strategies and policies. — ITCSD.","Context and issues in Africa’s energy transitionCompared to the majority of fossil fuel-dependent industrial countries, the energy transition in Africa presents a distinct feature.
Africa’s energy transition rather faces two important challenges: modernisation and expansion.
The energy transition is complex and has important ramifications for the structure of economies and future development prospects.
Examples include jobs in renewable energy, energy efficiency, manufacturing, transportation, and building and construction.

Ministry of Labour, Youth, Sports and Manpower Development, Francis Kasaila made remarks Wednesday during discussion on employment promotion in Malawi breakfast meeting at Bingu International Convention Centre (BICC) in Lilongwe.

He said the project is response to the global jobs crisis in supporting young men and women in jobs creation and enterprise development.

“The principles of decent work, sustainable livelihoods and community participation guide the project to assist local communities in selected districts of rural and urban areas, in collaboration with the government, employers’ and workers’ organisations, to create one thousand decent jobs in the countries,” the Minister pointed out.

Kasaila added that the project supports entrepreneurship development through vocational skills and business training, offers technical and financial support to local job creation schemes, and strengthens small enterprises and cooperatives.

United Nations Resident Coordinator, Maria Jose Torres said over the past decade, Malawi’s economic growth has been fairly robust with the exception of few crisis years due to financial shocks or adverse weather growth has consistently ranked above five percent.

“This growth has hardly translated into a reduction in poverty, with poverty rates remaining stubbornly high regardless of the chosen poverty metric in rural areas,” said Torres.

She said it is clear that systematic and concerted employment promotion is urgently needed, especially for more vulnerable labour market participants, such as women and the youth.

The government in partnership with United Nations Malawi and International Labour Organisation (ILO) with an aim to help communities and youth groups to come up with solutions to poverty alleviation with 50 percent of its target group being young women.

Finding pragmatic and action-oriented ways in which to operationalize and implement the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS) III and the NELP will be crucial steps in order to move from ‘good intentions’ to results and impact.

Government launched MGDS III and National Employment and Labour Policy. The latter articulates very clearly a range of policy areas and priorities for employment promotion.

Employment Specialist in Decent Work Team for Southern Eastern Africa, Bernd Mueller said the UN has the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) framework in general, which clearly articulates the imperative to “leave no one behind”.

“We includes eighth SDG on inclusive growth and decent work for all and fourth SDG on inclusive and equitable quality education and promotion of lifelong learning opportunities for all,” he said.

In partnership with another ILO project, COOP Africa, YES-JUMP has developed a Youth Fund which works through a competitive call for proposals and provides increased access to financial services for young people along with business development services.

The project strategy is to create a broader partnership between local stakeholders to implement priority projects for youth at the community level with their skills.

7,https://opinion.inquirer.net/113114/decent-work-decent-life,"Sat, 12 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Inquirer.net,"Decent work, decent life","In 2015, the Philippine government adopted a United Nations resolution titled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.” The document listed the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that all member-states should strive to achieve in or before 2030 based on their national circumstances and capacities. One of the SDGs is “Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.”

Since 2015, the Philippine economy has been posting an annual average growth of 6 percent, which is one of the fastest in Asia. The continuing economic expansion is a welcome development, although it is still not enough to cover the many unemployed, and to provide full employment to the many more underemployed Filipinos. Also, the fruits of economic growth are not equitably distributed; wealth remains concentrated in the hands of a few corporations, families and individuals.

The most challenging goal is promoting “decent work for all.” The International Labor Organization (ILO), of which the Philippines is a member, defines decent work as “work that is productive and delivers a fair income, security in the workplace and social protection for families, better prospects for personal development and social integration, freedom for people to express their concerns, organize and participate in the decisions that affect their lives, and equality of opportunity and treatment for all women and men.”

Unfortunately, decent work in the Philippines remains elusive for millions of Filipinos, who are joining the new class of precarious workers.

Precarious employment refers to “non-standard or non-regular forms of employment” which include “short-term or seasonal or casual job, some forms of fixed term or project employment contracts, seasonal employment, and employment through contracting or subcontracting arrangements” (ILO, 2017). End of contract or “endo” is just one form of precarious employment in the country.

In 2015, 30.7 percent of all employees were classified under precarious work, which translated to around 7 million workers (ILO, 2017). Precarious work in the public sector is manifested by the existence of around 500,000 “job orders” and “contract of service” employees who have no “employer-employee relationship” with the government.

Those workers have no security of tenure, which keeps them from effectively exercising their fundamental rights at work; they cannot join unions and are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. Most of them are not given social protection by the Social Security System (in the private sector) or Government Service Insurance System (in the public sector), or PhilHealth, Pag-Ibig and other mandatory benefits. Most of them belong to the working poor who lag far, far behind the much-vaunted GDP growth.

President Duterte’s recent Executive Order No. 51 will not totally end precarious work in the country. The prohibition of “illegal contracting and subcontracting” does not really change the fundamental and unjust employment relationship that is becoming more and more prevalent—the indirect hiring of workers through manpower agencies and job contractors. With the new EO, a trilateral employment relationship will still continue, which makes Filipino workers vulnerable. Workers who are under agencies, contractors and subcontractors have no real job security because their employment is still tied to a service agreement that can be arbitrarily terminated by the principal employer. And after a few months without a prospect for redeployment, the unemployed worker will just have to move on and try to find another manpower agency where he or she will remain a precarious worker.

The administration’s objective to reduce the poverty rate from 21.6 percent in 2015 to 13 percent by the end of the President’s term in 2022, and its public statements on promoting “shared prosperity” to give Filipinos opportunities to have a decent life, are all good in words and on paper. But the prospects for decent work will remain abstract for millions of Filipinos if the present oppressive and exploitative system is not changed. Now, it is Congress, particularly the Senate, that must step up to the plate and craft legislation that will make the policy of direct hiring the norm and not the exception, as it is at present.

Workers agreed with then presidential candidate Rodrigo Duterte that change is an imperative for Filipinos to have a decent life. But Filipinos will not have a decent life without decent work. The President has said he is not a legislator and cannot change the Labor Code, but the labor sector is still hoping that he would use his influence, political capital and moral suasion for Congress to pass a law that will really contribute to the achievement of decent work for all Filipinos.

Vicente C. Camilon Jr. is assistant general secretary and spokesperson of the Trade Union Congress of the Philippines.

In an op-ed Monday, Joe Davis said bitcoin BTCUSD, +0.69% is not a currency, it makes for a poor investment choice and its biggest threats are the very institutions it was meant to overthrow.

“Over the past few months, I’ve gotten this question more than any other,” wrote Davis. “As for bitcoin the currency? I see a decent probability that its price goes to zero.”

The head of the Vanguard Investment Strategy Group argues that bitcoin does not meet the criteria of a currency — which its creator(s) and proponents believe it to be — saying it’s a dubious medium of exchange and its excessive volatility does not make it a suitable store of value.

Read:Bitcoin bull argues for rally to $20,000

Davis, who works for the largest mutual-fund provider and second-largest provider of exchange-traded funds, said bitcoin doesn’t stack up as a traditional investment. “Unlike stocks and bonds, currencies generate no cash flows such as interest payments or dividends that can explain their prices,” wrote Davis.

He added that by adding bitcoin to a portfolio, you would have to reduce a “tried and true asset class.”

While supporters of bitcoin and other digital assets see the technology as an alternative to central banks, Davis said bitcoin is not a true threat to them, arguing that there’s a good chance central banks will eventually adopt their own digital currencies, and will have the upper hand because they impose the regulations on exchanges.

Like many cryptocurrency naysayers, Davis was more positive on blockchain, the distributed ledger technology that underpins bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but said the two do not go hand-in-hand like some argue.

“Although cryptocurrencies are built using a blockchain, they are not necessarily tied to the value of blockchain applications that may improve the cost, speed and security of executing transactions or contracts,” wrote Davis.

Annual growth in hourly pay currently sits well below the levels seen when unemployment was at 5.5% in the past.

This suggests unemployment may have to fall significantly further before workers will be receive a decent pay increase.

Australia’s unemployment rate currently sits at 5.5%, above the 5% level many estimate to be Australia’s non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, or NAIRU for short.

This level is seen as the point in which wage pressures should start to build as worker shortages increase.

That helps explain why Australian annual wage growth remains stuck in the mud at a little over 2% at present, barely keeping up with inflation.

However, something odd is happening at present.

Even with unemployment sitting at 5.5%, wage growth would normally be faster than what it currently is.

This chart from JP Morgan shows the unusually low wage outcomes seen in recent years, plotting annual growth in hourly pay rates against Australian unemployment, known as the Phillips Curve.

JP Morgan

As highlighted by JP Morgan, even with the gradual improvement seen in unemployment in recent years, wage growth still remains well below the levels seen in the past when unemployment was at similar levels.

At 5.5%, the curve suggests annual wage growth should be somewhere just below 3.5%, not the 2.07% level it sits at today.

“[This is] consistent with the view that although the cyclical low in the annual rate has most likely past, wage growth is still considerably weaker than the historical relationship with unemployment would suggest,” said Tom Kennedy, economist at JP Morgan.

“The weakness in the wage data is particularly striking given the strength of labour demand over the past year. Indeed, the economy added 415000 new jobs in 2017, the strongest year of outright job creation since records began in the late-1970s and in the top-five when scaled by the size of the labour force.”

Kennedy says a major reason unemployment hasn’t fallen further is a sharp increase in the number of available workers, due in part to stronger immigration and more Australians not previously in the labour force looking for work.

“The conflicting wage and employment growth outcomes can be squared by factoring in the strength of the supply side, evident by the rise in the participation rate,” he says.

“These supply and demand dynamics mean the unemployment rate has been relatively unchanged at 5.5% in recent history, comfortably above our estimate of NAIRU (5%) and an indication that slack remains across the labour market.”

While Kennedy, like the RBA, estimates Australia’s NAIRU level sits at 5%, given recent wage outcomes, even with a small improvement in unemployment, some believe Australia’s NAIRU level could be substantially lower.

That means that rather than wage growth picking up when unemployment falls to 5%, it could require unemployment to fall below this level before wage pressures begin to build.

RBA Deputy Governor Guy Debelle touched upon this subject in a speech earlier this week, telling the CFO Forum in Sydney that “the experience of other countries with labour markets closer to full capacity than Australia’s is that wages growth may remain lower than historical experience would suggest.”

“There is a risk that it may take a lower unemployment rate than we currently expect to generate a sustained move higher than the 2% focal point evident in many wage outcomes today,” he said.

While we won’t know the answer to where Australia’s NAIRU level is until wage pressures accelerate, if it is lower than many currently estimate, it could be quite some time yet until workers enjoy a decent pay rise.

Jivi is a smartphone brand of Magicon Impex. The New Delhi-based company has witnessed decent growth over the years. Recently, it launched Jivi Revolution TnT3 smartphone. Priced at Rs 3,950, the device comes with a 2300mAh battery, 8GB of internal storage and runs on Android 7.0 but the feature that makes it apart is integration of touchscreen display and physical keypad.

Out of the box, the overall design looks simple and appealing. The front of the device is dominated by a 4-inch touch screen display with a resolution of 480 pixels by 800 pixels. In usage, the display quality is satisfactory with sharp and crisp resolution—icons look sharp and pixels are visible but reading is a bit of a challenge in direct sunlight. It also houses a front camera on the top, while capacitive touch keys and physical keypad are placed in the bottom.

Power and volume rocker keys are placed on the right edge while the left is completely free from any distraction. While a 3.5 mm headset jack and Micro-USB port are on the top edge, the bottom is dedicated for speaker grille. The rear panel is home to Jivi branding along with rear camera and LED flash.

Jivi Revolution TnT3 runs on Android 7.0 and is powered by 1.3GHz quad-core processor and 1GB RAM. The phone packs 8GB of internal storage that can be expanded up to 64GB via a microSD card. During the review period, the smartphone handled browsing and reading smoothly.

On the camera front, Jivi Revolution TnT3 has nothing unique to offer. It comes with 5-megapixel rear camera and 2-megapixel front camera. Both the cameras are average and take pictures with decent details in regular light but same could not be repeated in low-light conditions.

The Jivi Revolution TnT3 is a dual SIM smartphone that accepts two SIMs. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB OTG, 3G and 4G. Sensors on the phone include proximity sensor and accelerometer. The 2300mAh battery helped the device clock around 6-8 hours of use. Overall, the Jivi Revolution TnT3 is a decent entry-level smartphone with physical keyboard plus touch input and a fingerprint scanner.

“Through this partnership we are looking to support SDGs and Agenda 2030 in Jordan, a step that is highly appreciated by UNDP,” UNDP Jordan Country Director Sara Ferrer Olivella commented during the signing ceremony held at UNDP’s offices in Amman on July 2 nd .

“Economic development is central to the long-term success of businesses and implementing the Baqala Program will create job opportunities and generate rising incomes and thus new market opportunities”, Olivella concluded.

Sanjiv Kakkar, Executive Vice President for Unilever MENA, Turkey, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus said:

“Our business contributes to the economic livelihoods of many people and communities across our value chain. Through skills development, increased access to markets and employment, we believe we can help people unlock their potential - so they can support themselves, their communities and our business.”

“The Baqala Program and our partnership with UNDP will support building resilience among vulnerable communities in Jordan while driving economic value.”

In line with Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) and its ambition of enhancing livelihoods of millions, the Baqala Program was first developed by Unilever with the aim of building the capabilities of small grocery owners to run their business in a sustainable and profitable manner and successfully executed in Oman. In 2017, the program was reintroduced with the goal of creating positive social impact through developing merchandising and sales skills of unemployed young people and refugees by providing on-the-job training and internship. UNDP will identify the young beneficiaries, as well as the potential small grocery owners that would benefit from Unilever’s retail management business training. UNDP will manage the selection process, while the trainings will be provided by Unilever.

UNDP and Unilever envision scaling up the Baqala Program by enhancing access to long-term employment opportunities and targeting more vulnerable Jordanians and refugees in different areas in Jordan.

In June, Johan Rockström and Pavan Sukhdev presented a new way of viewing the Goals, showing ‘how food connects all the SDGs.’ Inspired by this challenge to find the connections among SDGs and following recent headlines that highlight shortcomings in the food supply chain, this brief explores the food sector’s relationships with health (SDG 3), decent work (SDG 8), life below water (SDG 14) and zero hunger and sustainable agriculture (SDG 2), particularly in relation to responsible consumption and production (SDG 12).



In the US, reports that an herbicide (glyphosate) is present in common breakfast food products have stunned consumers. While similar findings have previously been made public by earlier studies that found the product in Cheerios, a US court judgment this month that awards US$289 million to a cancer patient who was exposed to high levels of the chemical has again focused global attention on glyphosate and food supply chains more broadly. In Africa and other developing country contexts, processed and nutrient-poor foods are seen as being correlated with malnutrition and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), as noted in two op-eds (here and here) on IPS News and an article on Devex.

A group of more than 25 experts, researchers and heads of organizations published an article in Agronomy for Sustainable Development calling for a “profound four-part transformation” of food systems in line with the SDGs. The first and second transformations, on healthy food and on sustainable production practices, address the issues exposed in the headlines mentioned above. They also speak to the early aspects of a four-stage approach to implementation 1) where arbitration processes must balance tensions between diverse actors’ interests and 2) governance of food systems must prioritize human development alongside resource stewardship, ecosystem health and equitable economic growth. To measure food systems’ contributions to the SDGs, the authors propose a framework that takes into account “interactions between food and nutrition security, environmental health, climate and social justice.”

SDG target 12.3 aims to halve food loss and waste by 2030. A thought piece by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) considers ways of tackling the issue, noting that each year, 1.6 billion tons of food representing over US$1 trillion in value is lost or wasted. The authors identify five key drivers of food loss and waste: awareness, supply chain infrastructure, supply chain efficiency, collaboration and policy environment. They highlight 13 initiatives that companies can take to address them, building on research by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and World Resources Institute (WRI). Companies that take on these initiatives, the article notes, will reduce their environmental footprints while achieving higher profit margins.

UK company It’s Fresh! came out with a food waste calculator, as summarized on Sustainable Brands. The calculator is aimed at households and individual consumers, to demonstrate the amount of money wasted and environmental harm caused when food goes in the trash. Generation 2030 author Mira Piel also addressed the state of food waste in Europe, noting that policy measures must acknowledge connections between multiple SDGs with regard to environmental impacts and health. She reports that at the EU level, the main policy targeting food waste is the Waste Framework Directive, which sets the framework for policy action regarding food waste until 2030, but includes only a vague definition of food waste, and postpones the introduction of a common EU methodology and legally binding reduction targets.

None of the profiled retailers feature comprehensive commitments to phase out single-use plastics, Greenpeace reports.

As with SDG 12, food plays an important role in trends that will support or undermine SDG 14. Greenpeace USA examines seafood sustainability in the tenth edition of a report titled, ‘Carting Away the Oceans.’ The report features a scorecard for major retailers’ sustainability practices in categories of policy, initiatives, labeling and transparency, and inventory (Whole Foods tops the list). Greenpeace notes an overarching theme of progress: whereas all companies profiled in the inaugural 2008 report received failing grades, 90% in the 2018 report earned passing scores. However, the report highlights, none of the profiled retailers feature comprehensive commitments to phase out single-use plastics, and many still source from seafood suppliers that have come under fire for human rights abuses in the Asia Pacific region. A summary article is available on Sustainable Brands.

SDG target 8.7 calls for immediate and effective measures to be taken to eradicate forced labor and end modern slavery, among other abuses. In May 2018, Greenpeace East Asia launched an investigative report that links human rights violations to Taiwan’s distant water fishing (DWF) fleet. Titled, ‘Misery at Sea,’ the report delves into legal and regulatory frameworks that inform the fishing industry’s low-cost business model. The publication features case studies based on interviews and other investigative reports to examine violent instances and deaths that occurred at sea, and to issue recommendations for action and systemic change. A recommended area of action is to reduce the fishing industry’s overcapacity and eliminate subsidies that contribute to this, per SDG target 14.6.

Also linking food supply chains to decent work, the recently-released 2018 Global Slavery Index examines risk factors for modern slavery in the fishing and cocoa industries. Fishing outside of national waters, dependence on distant water fishing, current practices around subsidies, significant unreported fishing and low productivity or low value of catches are all prominent risk factors that the Index notes reflect two overarching sets of drivers: national fisheries policy and wealth/institutional capacity.

In the cocoa industry, the Index applies the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) measurement framework for forced labor of children (also covered by SDG target 8.7) to help determine the prevalence of modern slavery in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. Key drivers for the industry include chronic poverty of farmers and their inability to influence the value chain, price instability of cocoa, low levels of education, and low oversight of small-scale farms. The Index also looks at global, regional and country data to show modern slavery’s prominence and trajectory. It finds that slavery is most common in Africa and the Asia Pacific region, particularly in areas marked by conflict, though “the prevalence of modern slavery in highly developed, high-income countries is higher than previously understood.” On Devex, Kelli Rogers covers “a new roadmap” for the private sector to combat slavery in its supply chains.

One potential way of improving food supply chain sustainability is through voluntary standards. Sustainable agriculture, one facet of SDG 2, may be partially achieved through such standards, as Kimberly Ann Elliott examines for the Center for Global Development. Her policy paper titled, ‘What Are We Getting from Voluntary Sustainability Standards for Coffee?’ finds that evidence remains thin for determining whether voluntary certification schemes for agricultural commodities such as coffee are indeed delivering on-the-ground impacts in terms of price farmers receive, quality of product, working conditions and environmental impacts. She does find that certification, although context-dependent, can have modest positive effects and few negative impacts, but the cost of compliance can negate economic gains.

A blog by Carol Gribnau on Hivos’s website notes that the plethora of actors in the food system need to come together to facilitate change. She outlines multi-stakeholder approaches such as Hivos’s promotion of “Food Change Labs,” describing a recent pilot in Zambia. She also describes Hivos’ 2018 Coffee Barometer, which measures the coffee sector’s sustainability.

On palm oil, a news article on Sustainable Brands notes that institutional investors representing US$6.7 trillion have called on the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) to strengthen its draft production standards. A key ingredient in not only food items, but also cosmetics and cleaning products, palm oil certified by the RSPO is a major determinant in improving agricultural practices and food sustainability, in addition to commodity production and land management (SDGs 2, 12 and 15). As the investors recognize, making progress on the range of SDGs to which the palm oil sector is connected demands both an increase of ambition to meet environmental targets and the scaling up of support to ensure that local producers are able to meet the tighter standards without compromising in areas such as decent work (SDG 8).

She reports that at the EU level, the main policy targeting food waste is the Waste Framework Directive, which sets the framework for policy action regarding food waste until 2030, but includes only a vague definition of food waste, and postpones the introduction of a common EU methodology and legally binding reduction targets.

Several Palestinian children are among the wounded.

The violence on Friday has been described as some of the worst seen in Jerusalem for many years. Some 200 Palestinians and 17 Israeli Police were reportedly injured in fighting around Haram Al-Sharif/Temple Mount. On Saturday, protesters reportedly threw stones at police, who responded with stun grenades, rubber bullets and water cannons and, on Sunday, fighting continued in East Jerusalem, ahead of a planned march by an Israeli group through the Old City.

The official spokesperson for Mr. Guterres, Stéphane Dujarric, said in a statement published on Sunday evening, that Israeli authorities must exercise maximum restraint and respect the right to freedom of peaceful assembly.

“All leaders have a responsibility to act against extremists and to speak out against all acts of violence and incitement”, the statement continued. “The Secretary-General reiterates his commitment, including through the Middle East Quartet, to supporting Palestinians and Israelis to resolve the conflict on the basis of relevant United Nations resolutions, international law and bilateral agreements”.

The Envoys of the Middle East Quartet (from the European Union, Russia, the United States, and the United Nations), released a press statement on Saturday, in which they expressed their alarm at “the provocative statements made by some political groups, as well as the launching of rockets and the resumption of incendiary balloons from Gaza towards Israel, and attacks on Palestinian farmland in the West Bank”.

Imminent risk of eviction

The Quartet representatives went on to declare their concern regarding the possible evictions of Palestinian families from homes, in which they have lived in for generations, in two neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem – Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan – and their opposition to “unilateral actions, which will only escalate the already tense environment”.

This is a reference to a court case involving several Palestinians who face eviction due to a legal challenge by the Nahalat Shimon settler organization. The risk is considered to be imminent for four of the families.

The UN has called for on the Israeli Government to halt all forced evictions and on Thursday, Rupert Colville, the spokesperson for the UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR), warned that, if they take place, the evictions in the Sheikh Jarrah case would violate Israel’s obligations under international law.

Saturday’s fighting took place on Laylat-al-Qadr, the most holy day in the Muslim month of Ramadan, after large numbers of worshippers had prayed at the Haram Al-Sharif/Temple Mount compound. In their statement, the Quartet

Envoys called on the Israeli authorities to exercise restraint and to avoid measures that would further escalate the situation during this period of Muslim Holy Days.

“We call on all sides to uphold and respect the status quo at the holy sites”, the statement continues. “All leaders have a responsibility to act against extremists and to speak out against all acts of violence and incitement”.

The statement concluded with a reiteration by the Quartet Envoys of their commitment to a negotiated two state solution.

37 Palestinian children injured and arrested

On Sunday, the UN Children’s Fund, UNICEF, urged the Israeli authorities to refrain from using violence against children and release all those children detained.

In a joint statement, Ted Chaiban, UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa, and Lucia Elmi, UNICEF Special Representative in the State of Palestine, noted that 29 Palestinian children have been injured over the past two days, and a further eight arrested. “A one-year-old toddler was among those injured. Some children were taken for treatment at hospitals, with injuries in the head and the spine. This comes amid reports that nearly 300 people were injured in the area”.

The senior UNICEF officials said that the agency had received reports of ambulances being restricted from arriving on location to assist and evacuate the injured, and that an on-site clinic was reportedly hit and searched.

The statement called for all children to be protected from violence and kept out of harm’s way at all times, for families’ rights to access all places of worship to be preserved, and for those injured to be assisted without restrictions.","Several Palestinian children are among the wounded.

Targets



8.1 Sustain per capita economic growth in accordance with national circumstances and, in particular, at least 7 per cent gross domestic product growth per annum in the least developed countries.

8.2 Achieve higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading and innovation, including through a focus on high-value added and labour-intensive sectors.

8.3 Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services.

8.4 Improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation, in accordance with the 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production, with developed countries taking the lead.

8.5 By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value.

8.6 By 2020, substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training.

8.7 Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms.

8.8 Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment.

8.9 By 2030, devise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products.

8.10 Strengthen the capacity of domestic financial institutions to encourage and expand access to banking, insurance and financial services for all.

8.A Increase Aid for Trade support for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, including through the Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries.

8.B By 2020, develop and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment and implement the Global Jobs Pact of the International Labour Organization.

Progress to date

Progress against every target set out under SDG8 is continuing, but there are worrying signs that rates of improvement across several key metrics have slowed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.

General GDP per capita growth remains solid, with the global average annual growth rate for real GDP per capita hitting 1.6 per cent between 2010 and 2015, up from 0.9 per cent for the previous five years. However, in 2016 global growth only reached 1.3 per cent and the longer term trend amongst the least developed countries (LDCs) also raises cause for concern. The average annual per capita growth rate for LDCs rose from 3.5 per cent between 2000 and 2004 to 4.6 per cent between 2005 and 2009, but it then slowed to 2.5 per cent from 2010 to 2015. Overall average annual GDP growth in the least developed countries followed a similar trend, decelerating from 7.1 per cent in 2005-2009 to 4.9 per cent in 2010-2015, well below the Sustainable Development Goals target of seven per cent.

Improvements in labour productivity experienced a similar slowdown. The annual growth rate of real GDP per worker dropped from an average annual rate of 2.9 per cent from 2000 to 2008 to 1.9 per cent from 2009 to 2016. The UN's assessment is stark: ""The slowdown represents a negative development for the global economy, with adverse effects on living standards and real wages."" However, more recent data points to an encouraging uptick last year with labour productivity growing 2.1 per cent in 2017, the fastest growth registered since 2010.

Progress in tackling unemployment follows a similar trajectory. The global unemployment rate has improved significantly from 6.4 per cent in 2000 to 5.6 per cent in 2017, but again progress has been slower since 2009. Youth unemployment also remains a major challenge with young people three times more likely to be unemployed than older people and youth unemployment rates hitting 13 per cent globally.

Moreover, even where people are in employment that work often fails to meet development goals. Globally fully 61 per cent of workers were in informal employment in 2016 and as such were at risk of ""decent work deficits"" and working poverty. In almost all cases rates of unemployment and low pay are worse for women than men.

The number of children engaged in child labour has fallen sharply from 246 million in 2000 to 168 million in 2012 and progress continues, but more than half of those still facing child labour are estimated to be working in hazardous occupations.

Access to banking services has improved globally, aided by the development of digital financial services. However, the most recent data found that while access to bank accounts is nearly universal in industrialised economies only 35 per cent of people in low income economies hold an account.

Business implications

For both businesses and the wider sustainability sector SDG8 is one of the hardest to navigate, and yet it could still have major implications for corporations around the world.

The targets' focus on economic growth and their use of GDP as their main metric glosses over the whole lone-running debate over the difference between economic growth and sustainable economic growth, as well as the debate over whether blunt GDP figures are a useful measure of progress.

Similarly, the goals' simple focus on labour productivity and employment has nothing to say about emerging trends in automation and the nascent debate about whether political and business leaders' understanding of work will have to evolve in the coming decades, as technology develops and environmental constraints bite.

As such SDG8 is the goal that carries with it the biggest risk of entrenching current economic models that prioritise short term boosts in GDP and employment over long term shifts to sustainable approaches that can deliver more sustained green growth and job opportunities.

However, there are also targets that have direct and broadly positive implications for green businesses. For example, target 8.4 and its stated goal to improve ""global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation"" through to 2030 is a ringing endorsement of circular economy thinking.

Meanwhile, pledges to tackle workplace discrimination and the gender pay gap, end child labour and forced labour, and improve access to financial services all point to improved policies in these areas and increased pressure on businesses to enhance employment practices and strengthen safeguards throughout their supply chains.

Business risks

The risks for businesses associated with SDG8 arise from the wide-ranging nature of the economic growth and employment targets and any failure to respond to the policy measures that are likely to result from the more specific targets on working practices and resource efficiency.

Most businesses would instinctively argue that continued economic growth can be made sustainable and reliant on circular resource flows in such a way that it will not inevitably smash into physical and environmental limits at some point in the future. They are also likely to contend that GDP may be an imperfect metric thanks to its failure to distinguish between sustainable and unsustainable activity, but it remains a useful proxy for measuring economic performance.

However, the risk for businesses keen to pursue sustainable development remains that the blunt use of real GDP growth per capita as the primary metric for measuring progress against SDG8 steamrollers all other metrics, as has so often been the case in the past, leading to a prioritisation of policies that boost GDP in the short term without adequate consideration of their long term consequences.

Similarly, the failure to define 'decent job creation' leaves open the possibility of policies that prioritise the defence of jobs in unsustainable industries and a failure by policymakers to adjust to the challenges and opportunities rapid advances in automation will bring.

More specifically, the target to improve global resource efficiency and pursue ""sustainable consumption"" could present a major challenge to businesses that continue to operate through a linear extract-manufacture-use-dispose resource model. The likely tightening of standards and imposition of new resource taxes could have a major impact on those industries that fail to embrace more circular resource flows.

Finally, the targets' focus on equal pay and improved labour rights suggest an acceleration of the trend that has already seen many businesses face legal action and reputational damage over everything from workplace discrimination to supply chains where child or forced labour are found to occur.

Business opportunities

The counter argument to any concerns about the risks associated with GDP growth for sustainably-minded businesses is that GDP growth does, by definition, create more commercial opportunities.

Similarly the supporting targets 8.3 and 8.4 to ""achieve higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading and innovation, including through a focus on high-value added and labour-intensive sectors"" and ""promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services"" are arguably two of the most pro-business targets in the entire SDG portfolio.

Delivered effectively these targets herald sustainable industrial policies that drive the development of highly innovative and balanced economies that allow businesses to prosper in pursuit of wider sustainable development goals.

More specifically, SDG8.10 focus on expanding access to financial, banking, and insurance services in emerging and developing economies promises to accelerate the development of one of the world's most important industries and unlock rapid progress in multiple other sectors.

Similarly, SDG8.9's pledge to ""promote sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products"" promises to create new opportunities to the tourism industry as long as it can adapt to ever more demanding sustainability standards.

Targets to deliver equal pay, end workplace discrimination, and tackle forced labour may all lead to higher costs in the short term, but they also provide businesses with an opportunity to guard against reputational damage, boost productivity, improve skills bases, and aid development and the advance of human rights, creating new markets in the process.

Finally, SDG8's focus on labour and resource productivity holds out the potential for significant cost savings for businesses that invest in enhancing their productivity, as well as the creation of entire new industries through the advance of circular economy business models. SDG8 is one of the areas where one of the core messages from the SDGs is most obvious: unsustainable industries are ultimately unsustainable and as such sustainable development paths are the only logical option.","The BusinessGreen guide explores the pledge to 'promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all'Targets8.1 Sustain per capita economic growth in accordance with national circumstances and, in particular, at least 7 per cent gross domestic product growth per annum in the least developed countries.

Productivity and fair wages are just two factors that the International Labour Organization (ILO) use to define a term known as ‘decent work’.

The ILO is pushing their ‘decent work’ agenda in the Caribbean region and, according to the organisation, decent work is achieved when employment opportunities provide other qualities such as “security in the workplace and social protection for families, better prospects for personal development and social integration, freedom for people to express their concerns, organise and participate in the decisions that affect their lives, and equality of opportunity and treatment for all women and men”.

BVI doing ‘decent work’ since hurricanes

The BVI has shown signs of those characteristics in its labour community, Dr Pickering suggested while speaking in Panama at a high-level meeting about the future of work in the Caribbean.

“Following the disasters, it was quickly realised that all work was decent work, as persons were faced with displacement from their regular jobs due to the destruction of the Tourism industry, namely hotels, yachting and restaurants,” Dr Pickering said at the meeting held on October 1.

Dr Pickering also spoke of recovery efforts that the BVI put into effect to adapt to territory’s labour needs following the 2017 hurricanes —Irma and Maria.

His statements come nearly two months after he prompted for an investigation to be launched in relation to reports that a number of expatriate workers in the BVI are being subjected to modern versions of “enslavement”.

Policies to advance ‘decent work’ agenda

Meanwhile, a media release from government said the aforementioned meeting in Panama also entertained discussions about policies and practices that would ‘advance the decent work agenda in the Caribbean’.

Below are other things that the government said were discussed at the meeting in Panama:

Policies for sustainable, productive development for sustained and inclusive growth, with more and better decent jobs.

Policies to promote the transition from the informal to the formal economy and to respond to accelerating technological change and to diverse forms of employment.

Measures and policies to strengthen and redesign institutions in the world of work, including social security, and to ensure that trade union and labour rights are fully upheld.

The digital economy and labour skills and competencies.

It is not yet clear how the matters discussed in the meeting will be applied to the BVI.","Labour Minister Dr Kedrick Pickering has suggested to the regional community that the BVI is fostering work environments that are productive and that deliver fair income to workers locally.

Yet Filipinos continue to leave the country in droves, in search of employment that provides better pay, other forms of remuneration and social protection.

There may be enough work for all in the Philippines, but what people want is decent work. Labor organizations define decent work as one that provides a fair income, security in the workplace, social protection for both workers and their families, and freedom for social dialogue, with gender equality as a parallel objective. Decent work has become part of the United Nations’ agenda for Sustainable Development for 2030.

Since 2008, the international community has been observing Oct. 7 as the World Day for Decent Work. This year’s theme emphasizes the need to “change the rules” to achieve the four pillars of the decent work agenda: job creation, rights at work, social protection and social dialogue. Labor unions are set to hold rallies today in the Philippines to demand better jobs.

The Philippines has achieved some progress in promoting workers’ welfare. But the task has always involved a delicate balancing act, with the needs of workers considered along with those of employers as well as the business and labor environments in neighboring countries. Such considerations mean that significantly higher pay in wealthier economies will remain irresistible for many Filipinos.

Improving the investment climate and developing more sectors such as tourism and agribusiness for local job creation can stop the exodus of Filipinos for overseas work and help make growth inclusive. Change won’t happen overnight. But the administration can lay the groundwork for making it easier to do business in this country. Through reforms, the government can provide the infrastructure and institutional strength to create decent jobs.","There may be enough work for all in the Philippines, but what people want is decent work.

The Syston-based Dunelm chain has warned over retail and consumer uncertainty despite reporting a resilient last three months of trading.

The group, which has 169 out-of-town superstores and three high street outlets, reported a 4.2 per cent jump in like-for-like sales – which does not include growth from new stores – as an impressive online performance offset weaker shop trading.

The homewares group said like-for-like store sales rose 1.3 per cent in the 13 weeks to September 29, boosted by tablet-based sales for home delivery.

With this stripped out, like-for-like shop sales fell 0.4 per cent.

But its online sales leapt 33 per cent higher in the quarter.

Shares jumped after the update and were 5 per cent up at 11am.

Chief executive Nick Wilkinson said: “We delivered a good trading performance in the first quarter.

“We continue to improve the multichannel experience for our customers and our stores play a vital role in this.”

But he added that the group remained “cautious about the months ahead due to the level of market and customer uncertainty”.

Dunelm, which employs around 10,000 staff, recently posted a 6.7 per cent fall in underlying pre-tax profits to £102 million for the year to June 30.

It blamed management upheaval, an £8.4 million loss from its recent Worldstores acquisition and difficult trading conditions for the second year in a row of falling profits.

But recently-appointed boss Mr Wilkinson, who started in February, is leading a further push online, including a new IT system for Dunelm.com, which will see it launch a click and collect offering and improved delivery.

His appointment follows a shake-up at the top, with chairman Andy Harrison forced to step in last year after former chief executive John Browett stepped down at the end of August for “personal reasons” following a brief stint in charge.","Never miss another Leicestershire story by signing up to our free email updates Invalid Email Something went wrong, please try again later.

Asia Pacific – Decent work deficits cast a shadow on region’s labour market growth, ILO says

19 November 2018

Working poverty, informality and vulnerable employment are amongst the persistent challenges of Asia Pacific labour markets, according to a report from the International Labour Organisation. The report states that despite two decades of economic growth, Asia Pacific still faces structural weaknesses in its labour markets.

The report, entitled, Asia-Pacific Employment and Social Outlook 2018: Advancing decent work for sustainable development, found that although the regional unemployment rate is projected to remain at 4.1% through 2020, the vulnerable employment rate is expected to creep up towards 49%, reversing a downward trend of at least two decades.

One-fourth of all workers in the region that is 446 million, lived in moderate or extreme poverty in 2017 and nearly half of the workforce, 930 million people, were making a living in vulnerable employment as own-account or unpaid contributing family workers.

“High employment ratios and productivity gains in the region mask persistent and worrying decent work deficits,” Sara Elder, the lead author of the report and Head of the ILO Regional Economic and Social Analysis unit, said. “Many people, in particular in the region’s developing economies, still have no choice but to take jobs with poor working conditions that do not generate stable incomes nor safeguard them and their families against poverty in the longer term. What is especially frustrating here is that despite the region’s important economic gains, there are still so many workers just barely getting by. Any household crisis – injury or death of a breadwinner, loss of job, natural disaster, crop failure, etc. – threatens to push them backwards into poverty.”

The report highlighted recent threats of increased trade protectionism which ILO states is already having an impact on investments in the manufacturing sector, which many workers in the region continue to rely on for their livelihoods and, for women, occasionally their first foray into paid employment.

ILO also pointed to ageing societies, technological disruptions, and environmental factors, as adding uncertainty to the region’s future growth trajectory.

In 2017, the Asia Pacific region had 1.9 billion workers – 1.2 billion men and 700 million women – which represented 60% of the global workforce in 2017. The employment-to-population ratio stands at 59.7%, compared with 58.6% at the global level.

The report also showed that more than two in three workers were in informal employment in 2016, which is closely linked to the 48.6% of workers still in vulnerable categories of employment. The informal employment rate is particularly high in Southern Asia, where almost 88% of workers were informally employed.

According to the ILO, large numbers of workers in the region, especially those in low-paid jobs, work more than 48 hours per week. The average hours worked in Southern Asia and Eastern Asia in 2017 was the world’s highest, at 46.4 and 46.3 hours per week, respectively.

Meanwhile, the APAC’s regional unemployment rate at 4.1% is the world’s lowest and well below the global rate of 5.5% in 2017. However, while the global unemployment rate has held steady since 2015, the rate in the Asia-Pacific region has increased slightly by 0.1%. In total, there were 80.9 million unemployed persons in Asia and the Pacific in 2018.","Home »Editorial »Daily News »Asia Pacific – Decent work deficits cast a shadow on region’s labour market growth, ILO saysDaily News View All NewsAsia Pacific – Decent work deficits cast a shadow on region’s labour market growth, ILO says19 November 2018Working poverty, informality and vulnerable employment are amongst the persistent challenges of Asia Pacific labour markets, according to a report from the International Labour Organisation.

The 3G is a 30-member grouping of small and medium-sized countries that seek greater engagement in G20 processes. Its 11th ministerial meeting took place on 28 September 2018, in New York, US, in the lead-up to the G20 meeting, which takes place from 30 November to 1 December in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

The 3G ministers emphasized the importance of maintaining “an open, rules-based multilateral trading system as embodied by the World Trade Organization (WTO).” The 3G ministers also reaffirmed the role played by international organizations with universal membership in global standard setting. In a press statement on behalf of the 3G, Singapore highlights concerns about rising global trade tensions, and welcomes the G20’s: creation of a Climate Sustainability Working Group, reinstatement of its Trade and Investment Working Group, and reconvening of its Trade and Investment Ministerial Meeting.

Espinosa commended the 3G for maintaining the annual dialogue between the UN and G20, and welcomed the G20’s extensive consultations under Argentina’s leadership in 2018.

India, a fast-growing middle-income country, is at a critical juncture in its development trajectory.

It has the world's largest youth population, sees overlapping shades of industrialisation and has a large informal economy. There have been persisting challenges such as workers in low-paid jobs , poor working conditions and the risks of climate change that can put millions in danger of job losses.

ILO's The Decent Work Country Programmes has outlined a strategy to deliver on the three priorities:

Promoting, adopting and implementing international labour standards for the protection of workers from unacceptable forms of work Creating sustainable, inclusive and decent employment for women and youth, especially those who are vulnerable to socio-economic and environmental exclusion and are working in the informal economy Fostering tripartite mechanisms to protect the rights of workers by promoting labour administration, occupational safety and health (OSH) and social protection.

Manish Gupta, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Labour and Employment said, ""creating employment opportunities, gender equality, social protection for informal workers, ensuring occupational safety and health (OSH), strengthening social dialogue, tripartism, workplace compliance, labour administration are priorities of the ministry.""

He elaborated on many national initiatives the government has taken in the recent past that are in alignment with ILO's principles of decent work. He cited the recent amendments to the Maternity Benefit Act of 2017, launch of a dedicated portal that aims to check child labour in the country by involving state, districts, civil society members and others, national codes on OSH, among other.

Tomoko Nishimoto, Assistant Director-General and Regional Director, ILO Office for Asia and the Pacific, drew attention to the dynamic economic growth of the Asia and Pacific region and India's strategic role. She shared positive and negative storylines from the recently-released flagship report of the ILO: Asia and the Pacific Employment and Social Outlook (APESO ).

Between 2007 and 2017, countries in this region have had 7.6 per cent annual GDP growth. Labour productivity has grown, outpacing the global average. Yet grave challenges exist such as pervasive poverty, vulnerability in employment, and wide gender gaps.

In fact, reaching the Sustainable Development Goal targets is getting difficult. ""Can India turn this around? Can India find solutions and approaches to its many Gordian knots such as-a large informal economy, challenging youth unemployment, inequalities, access to social security, skills development, entrepreneurship, gender gaps, and transition to a greener economy? We have gathered here to say ""Yes"" to these questions,"" says Nishimoto.

Addressing the issue of informalisation, Amarjeet Kaur, General Secretary, All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), says how the trend towards contract labour has increased- fallout of neo-liberal economic models that must be checked. She says that trade unions were also hoping that with the focus on International Labour Standard promotion in this Decent Work Country Programme results in the ratification of Convention 87 Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention and Convention 98: Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention , among others.

26,https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2018/12/24/responding-to-globalization-the-decent-work-agenda/,"Mon, 24 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Modern Diplomacy,Responding to globalization: The Decent Work Agenda,"Women rights and gender discrimination have been a problem for many years in china. Various restrictions were imposed on women to suppress them in society. Income discrepancy and traditional gender roles in country aim to place women inferior as compared with their male counterparts.

There are diverse sectors where women face discrimination. Women of the past and present in china have dealt with unfair employment practices. They have had to jump over the unnecessary hurdles just to keep up with their male counterparts in the society. The Chinese government claims to better prioritize the promotion of gender equality but in reality it does not seem appropriate to say that there is not a single department of life where women are not being suppressed. In jobs, mostly men are preferred over women at high positions. There are a number of contextual examples which demonstrates this discrepancy in the status of women throughout china, and whilst there has been a great deal of the popular sphere, others have been brutally repressed by a government dominated by male families. For example, women who have children do not always receive support from their pay when maternity leave.

China’s history has seen a higher focus on men being the core of not just their families but also they play crucial role in in overall country’s growth and development. Post Confucius era, society labeled men as the yang and women as the yin. In this same vein, society views Yang as active, smart and the dominant half. This compared with Yin, which is soft, passive and submissive. These ideologies are not as prominent today but persist enough that there is a problem.

The tradition begins at birth with boys being the preferred children compared to girls in China. A consensus opinion in the country is that if one has a male child versus a female child, they believe the son will grow into a more successful member of the family. The sons are more likely favored because the issue of pregnancy is a non-factor and they can choose almost any job they desire. Of course, this is something that does not support efforts for gender equality nor women’s rights in China.

A survey done just last year found that 80% of generation Z mothers did not have jobs outside of the home. Importantly, most of those surveyed were from poorer cities. The same survey found that 45% of these stay-at-home mothers had no intention of going back to work. They simply accepted their role of caring for the house. Gender equality and women’s rights in China have shifted toward cutting into the history of patriarchal dominance within the country.

Women’s Rights Movement in China

Since the Chinese government is not completely behind gender equality in China for women, the feminist movement is still active and stronger than ever. In 2015, the day before International Women’s Day, five feminist activists were arrested and jailed for 37 days. They were just five of an even larger movement of activists fighting against the traditional gender role ideology that has placed females below males. These movements have begun to make great progress towards gender inequality within the country. From 2011 to 2015, a “12th Five Year Plan” had goals of reducing gender inequality in education and healthcare.

The plan also was to increase the senior and management positions and make them accessible for women to apply for said positions. Xi Jinping, the current President of the People’s Republic of China, has proclaimed that the country will donate $10 million to the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women. During the next five years and beyond, this support will help the women of China and other countries build 100 health projects for women and children. March 1, 2016, the Anti-domestic Violence Law of the People’s Republic of China took effect. This law resulted in the improvement in legislation for gender equality in China. In June of that year, ¥279.453 billion was put forth toward loans to help women, overall.

‘’There are a number of contextual examples which demonstrate this discrepancy in the status of women throughout China, and whilst there has been a great deal of progress made in some elements of the popular sphere, others have been brutally repressed by a government dominated by male influence.

Mao Zedong’s famously published collection of speeches entitled ‘the little red book’ offers a glimpse into the People’s Republic’s public policy in relation to women, as Mao himself is quoted as saying ‘Women hold up half the sky’ and more overtly.’’

In order to build a great socialist society, it is of the utmost importance to arouse the broad masses of women to join in productive activity. Men and women must receive equal pay for equal work in production. Genuine equality between the sexes can only be realized in the process of the socialist transformation of society as a whole.

The china has been widening the gender discrimination gap in the society through legalized way and there is desperate need to raise the voices in gender equality.","Women rights and gender discrimination have been a problem for many years in china.
Of course, this is something that does not support efforts for gender equality nor women’s rights in China.
