The country study is part of a compendium of good practices for advancing SDG target 16.9 (provide legal identity for all, including birth registration) published by the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data and the Centre of Excellence.

According to the publication, Armenia’s experience shows that the two building blocks of identity – CVRS and identity management – do not need to operate under one agency to be done successfully, but can work well even if different agencies are responsible, as long as the respective systems are interoperable so they can share information.

The case study highlights how the country’s Ministry of Justice, which is responsible for civil registration, and the Police have developed “a solid framework” for working together. The publication notes that Armenia’s modern CRVS is fully digitized, with all registered information being entered directly into the electronic civil register. This system enables the digital vital events records that belong to a specific person to be linked, so their up-to-date identity information is available any time. The identity management system is managed by the police, its population register being an electronic database that serves as the main tool to manage identity data and issue national ID cards and travel documents.

The country study also reports that each time a new birth is added to the civil register, the information that includes identity attributes of the newborn is automatically sent to the population register, where a new personal record is created. Also, every time a new vital event is registered and the names of informants are added to the civil register, this digitized platform automatically pulls identity information for the informants from the population register. This way, the publication explains, the two interoperable systems can provide up-to-date information to other users of identity data from these registers.

Some of the good practices identified in the Armenia case study include:

Digitizing civil registration processes to enable easier data sharing and registration of vital events;

Including an e-health platform that can be accessed at hospitals, where digital and paper-based medical certificates are produced;

Linking the civil and population registers electronically to the civil register to copy identity data of informants or applicants from the population register, instead of copying that data from an identification credential that a person presents; and

Using an innovative platform to verify if civil registration certificates and documents are authentic.

The publication highlights data interoperability among government-operated information and communications technology systems as essential to the effectiveness of the holistic approach taken with regards to the CRVS and identity management systems, as it allows the government to decide which types of data each service can access. The text explains that when a nation-wide layer of data interoperability was added, specific procedures were instituted to regulate cooperation between the two agencies.

Overall, Armenia’s framework to fully digitize government services by 2030 focuses on cybersecurity, digital infrastructure, government efficiency, tech-oriented private sector, and tech-savvy workforce. According to the framework, once the proposed E-Gov is fully in place, it will reduce the cost of government services by 50%, significantly reduce corruption and increase competitiveness, and add up to 3% to the growth rate of Armenia’s gross domestic product.

According to the case study, like most countries that emerged from the former Soviet Union, Armenia inherited a well-developed system for registering vital events, thus investment was needed for the system’s digitization, which was done with support from the EU. The total amount invested in digitizing so far is estimated at around USD 2 million, with the digitizing of historical records being estimated at USD 1 for each vital event record.

The publication titled, ‘Compendium of Good Practices in Linking Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) and Identity Management Systems,’ also features five other country case studies: Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan, Namibia, Netherlands and Peru. The authors note that the benefits of a holistic approach to CRVS and identity management span several aspects of governance, including ensuring people’s rights, improving service delivery, reducing corruption, and leaving no one behind.

1,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/report-highlights-identity-management-practices-to-advance-sdg-target-16-9/,"Tue, 07 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Report Highlights Identity Management Practices to Advance SDG Target 16.9,"To support the achievement of SDG target 16.9, “provide legal identity for all, including birth registration,” the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data and the Centre of Excellence have published a compendium of good practices on civil registration and identity management. The compendium features country case studies from Armenia, Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan, Namibia, the Netherlands and Peru.

The ‘Compendium of Good Practices in Linking Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) and Identity Management Systems’ was launched at the Fifth Conference of African Ministers Responsible for Civil Registration, which took place from 14-18 October 2019, in Lusaka, Zambia. In September 2019, a synthesis report of the six case studies was introduced at a side event during the 74th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA).

One billion people cannot legally prove who they are because they lack recognized identity documentation.

According to the compendium, current birth registration coverage is not adequate to meet SDG target 16.9, even among countries with functioning civil registration systems. It reports that: the average birth registration rate globally is 73%; only 46% children in Sub-Saharan Africa have had their births registered; and only 25% of the world population live in countries where more than 90% of the births and deaths are registered, most of these countries being high-income countries. The authors also note that according to the latest data from the World Bank, 1 billion people cannot legally prove who they are because they lack recognized identity documentation. The World Bank has also found that approximately 50% of the world’s deaths are not registered.

The compendium aims to provide evidence and raise awareness of the benefits of a holistic approach to CRVS and identity management, where civil registration and identity management systems support each other. The publication is also aimed at shedding light, for civil registration authorities, of the opportunities for advancing CRVS and increasing registration coverage through tighter cooperation or integration with identity management systems and other “identity ecosystem” actors.

The compendium focuses on the experiences of six countries that have pursued a holistic approach to CRVS: Armenia, Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan, Namibia, the Netherlands and Peru. The case studies reflect varied experiences in building identity ecosystems with different constitutional and legal systems, administrative traditions and institutional arrangements. The studies present good practices, underlining how the countries’ different starting points were not an obstacle to building their identity system around a holistic approach, as well as their various ways of working.

Five recurring messages were identified across the six case studies:

A strong CRVS system that registers all vital events from birth until death for the whole population is an essential precondition for the implementation of a holistic identity system;

Other components of an identity ecosystem, including the issuance of identification credentials and functional government systems, rely on civil registration records as the only source of up-to-date identity data;

The digitization of CRVS and identity management systems, together with other government functional systems, enables more efficient ways for processing identity information;

The benefits of a holistic approach span several aspects of governance, including ensuring people’s rights, improving service delivery, reducing corruption and leaving no one behind; and

The four key elements essential to a conducive enabling environment for pursuing a holistic identity system are: political commitment; a legal framework that enables data sharing; a data privacy and protection framework; and technology ownership from the outset to mitigate possible vendor lock-in.

The six case studies (Armenia, Ecuador, Kazakhstan, Namibia, Netherlands and Peru) also show that technical interoperability provides a range of benefits in ensuring that all categories of population from birth to death reflect their identity information in the system.

The country study is part of a compendium of good practices for advancing SDG target 16.9 (provide legal identity for all, including birth registration) published by the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data and the Centre of Excellence.

The Peru study reports that after operating a disperse system of civil registration and an identification system closely tied to electoral purposes for more than 100 years, in 1993 Peru established a single national agency in charge of both functions, el Registro Nacional de Identificación y Estado Civil (RENIEC). Since then, RENIEC has articulated a decentralized system, increasing the coverage of vital events registration, identifying citizens, and integrating CRVS and identity management systems. The integration was realized through establishing standard processes and guidelines, introducing digital technology, and digitizing civil registration and identification records.

Throughout the integration process, RENIEC has increased collaboration between public and private organizations through the exchange of data, and has become Peru’s primary resource for identity authentication. The case study notes that, in order to make civil registration the backbone of identity management, RENIEC focused its efforts on:

Constitutional independence and autonomy;

Digitized records;

Information exchange between public and private sectors;

Integration strategies combined with information technology; and

Online services at health facilities for birth and death certification and registration.

To reflect the benefits of CRVS and ID management, the publication highlights the example of nutrition subsidies where the integration improved service provision and saved time and money: RENIEC has ensured that more newborns get nutrition support in time by reducing the application process from two months to 72 hours, and reaching 71% of beneficiaries within the first month, up from 36%.

As data gaps in registration still remain, especially related to the most vulnerable segments of the population, RENIEC has taken measures to improve services for Indigenous communities, set inter-institutional alliances and cooperation, and launch mobile registration units.

The publication also notes that, as part of the efforts to serve Indigenous communities, the Identity Restitution and Social Support Department is developing a project to provide customized training to civil registrars in Indigenous communities. As Peru has 48 Indigenous languages that are spoken by approximately 16% of the population, since 2014 RENIEC has worked to promote the use of Indigenous languages in civil registration services. The institution also provides an online registration platform, civil registry books, civil registration forms, dissemination and training material, and certified copies of civil registration records in Indigenous languages. These measures have helped reduce registration errors, promote inclusion, reduce under-registration, and contribute to reaching the SDG target 16.9.

Two of the additional indicators are for SDG target 10.7 on responsible and well-managed migration policies.

New indicators are proposed for improved measurement of the following SDG targets (see Annex II of the IAEG’s report for the indicator text):

SDG target 2.2, By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons;

SDG target 3.d, Strengthen the capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks;

SDG target 4.1, By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes;

SDG target 10.4, Adopt policies, especially fiscal, wage and social protection polices, and progressively achieve greater equality;

SDG target 10.7, Facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies (two new indicators proposed);

SDG target 13.2, Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning; and

SDG target 16.3, Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice for all.

The proposals were generated through the 2020 Comprehensive Review process undertaken by the IAEG. The report of the Review has been submitted ahead of the 51st session of the UN Statistical Commission in March 2020. The Commission is invited to adopt the proposals of the Review.

The indicator framework developed by the IAEG was adopted in 2017. The Comprehensive Review aimed to improve the indicator framework and in turn global monitoring of the 2030 Agenda, and to provide better guidance to countries for their own national frameworks and reporting platforms. The Group kept changes as limited as possible in order to avoid disrupt existing monitoring systems or overburdening national statistical systems. The Group’s report to the Commission notes that “the Global Indicator Framework is designed to provide a global overview/summary of progress on implementing the SDGs and cannot contain all indicators relevant to the SDGs.”

The Review process examined the entire global indicator framework. It was met with wide interest; during an open consultation in August 2019, over 600 inputs were received from organizations, countries and individuals.

After the IAEG’s tenth meeting, which convened in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in October 2019, the Group decided on a tentative initial list of proposals to be considered by the UN Statistical Commission in the 2020 Comprehensive Review, and held virtual meetings to finalize those proposals.

The IAEG-SDG agreed on 36 major changes to the current framework: 14 proposals for replacements of existing indicators; 8 proposals for revisions of existing indicators; 8 proposals for additional indicators (for the targets listed above); and 6 proposals for deleting existing indicators. The Group is also proposing 20 minor refinements, which can be seen in Annex III of the report to the Commission.

In addition to the update on the Comprehensive Review, the Group’s report to the Commission also provides an update on the status of the SDG indicators that are currently classified as ‘Tier III,’ which means they require further development before they will be included in global progress reports. In 2019, the Group identified several indicators for which sufficient progress had been made on their methodology, and moved them out of Tier III.

As an example, Indicator 4.7.1 on mainstreaming sustainability education, was moved from Tier III to Tier II, which will allow its custodian agency, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), to begin collecting the data needed from countries in 2020, and results can be submitted for publication in 2021. UNESCO says this will “kick off the systematic, periodic, comprehensive, and official data collection on [sustainability and citizenship education] for the first time in the world.

As of 6 December 2019, 20 of 232 indicators remained in Tier III. All remaining Tier III indicators are supposed to have a work plan for the completion of their needed methodological work. Tier III indicators that lack a custodian agency and therefore a workplan were included in the 2020 Review, so that replacement indicators could be proposed.

For one Tier III indicator – 11.c.1 – the Group was unable to come up with a suitable replacement, despite “repeated consultations with UN Agencies, regional organizations and other interested stakeholders.” SDG indicator 11.c.1 is the “proportion of financial support to the least developed countries that is allocated to the construction and retrofitting of sustainable, resilient and resource-efficient buildings utilizing local materials.” This is the only indicator in the framework for measurement of SDG target 11.c, to “Support least developed countries, including through financial and technical assistance, in building sustainable and resilient building utilizing local materials.”

As a result, the Group writes, “this target has no suitable global indicator to monitor progress.” The Group encourages countries, international and regional organizations and stakeholders to attempt to monitor this target in whatever way they can identify that is relevant to their national, regional or thematic context.

An update on the reclassification of remaining Tier III indicators is expected to be provided orally when the report is introduced to the Commission in March.

The report to the Statistical Commission also describes the IAEG’s efforts on data disaggregation and integration, and the proposed establishment and a work program of a working group to further develop and refine a measurement of support to developing countries that goes beyond Official Development Assistance (ODA), also known as TOSSD. The timeline is provided in Annex IV of the report.

As of IAEG 9, the cochairs are Viveka Palm, Sweden, and Albina Chuwa, Tanzania.","The UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on the SDG Indicators has proposed 36 major changes to the global indicator framework for the SDGs, including eight additional indicators and six indicators to be deleted.

Speakers at the event, which took place on the first day of the Minamata COP in Geneva, Switzerland, on 25 November 2019, highlighted that the biodiversity and chemicals and waste-related MEAs cut across all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and address a number of interlinkages. Given that there are ongoing processes to develop both a post-2020 framework for the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) and a post-2020 global biodiversity framework, speakers highlighted that there are opportunities to enhance policy coherence and cooperation for both processes.

Moderator Jacqueline Alvarez, UN Environment Programme (UNEP) Chemicals, introduced the event.

Inger Andersen, Executive Director, UNEP, highlighted that 2020 will bring, among other activities, the delivery of updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement on climate change, key events addressing global policy for biodiversity, chemicals management and oceans, and the IUCN World Conservation Congress. She highlighted the importance of recognizing interlinkages among all of the 2020 activities, and illustrated the possibilities for thinking about synergies in terms of operational and programmatic linkages such as combining customs training related to mercury and international trade in endangered species.

Rossana Silva Repetto, Executive Secretary, Minamata Convention on Mercury, noted that there are cases in which mercury issues negatively interlink with other topics, such as when waste is not properly managed or released into water bodies and the ocean. She suggested that a way forward could include: working at the national level through intersectoral processes, with the 2030 Agenda providing a framework for such coordination; highlighting specific pollutants and adding related targets to the post-2020 biodiversity goals; strengthening national action plans for the Minamata Convention that also support biodiversity plans; and addressing illegal trade in environmentally sensitive commodities. She also said the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA) is a platform for collaboration, and suggested stronger MEA participation in UNEA preparations, during UNEA and in implementing relevant UNEA resolutions.

Martha Rojas Urrego, Executive Secretary, Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, emphasized that the IPBES Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services indicates pollution is one of five drivers of biodiversity loss, which has implications for mercury management. She said areas in which collaboration could take place include plastics, water and water-related ecosystems, and land pollution. She noted that wetlands are filters, citing one area in which biodiversity can contribute to the solution. She suggested adopting common indicators for the biodiversity and chemicals conventions as a way to promote collaboration.

Felix Wertli, Head of Section, Global Affairs, Federal Office for the Environment, Switzerland, said shared indicators can help facilitate discussions among government departments and ministries.

Carlos Martin-Novella, Deputy Executive Secretary, Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm (BRS) Conventions, encouraged giving attention to the structure of the interlinkages among the post-2020 Aichi targets and post-2020 chemicals agendas.

The event was organized by the UNEP with the objective of showcasing the interlinkages between clusters and facilitating and interactive dialogue on way forward. Participants were informed that the Chemicals and Waste Branch of UNEP in consultation with Inter-Organization Programme for the Sound Management of Chemicals (IOMC), among others, is drafting an Assessment paper that seeks to assess the linkages between chemicals and waste management and other international policy agendas and to identify opportunities for coordination and cooperation.

The framework “builds on the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020” and aims to bring about a “transformation in society’s relationship with biodiversity and to ensure that, by 2050, the shared vision of living in harmony with nature is fulfilled.”

The ‘Open-ended Working Group on the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework’ requested at its first meeting that a zero draft text of the global biodiversity framework be provided six weeks prior to its second meeting, which will be held 24-28 February in Kunming, China.

Speaking on the zero draft, the Open Working Group Co-chairs, Basile Van Havre and Francis Ogwal, pointed out that they, “tried to create a framework for all, one that sets the stage for an inspirational, ambitious, realistic, and achievable framework.”

The proposed framework, published on 13 January, comprises background information, an introduction, and a draft recommendation for consideration by the Open-ended Working Group at its next meeting. These are followed by two annexes the contain, respectively, the initial draft of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework for the consideration of the Working Group, and elements of a draft recommendation to the Conference of the Parties (COP) at its fifteenth meeting. The document is complemented by two addendums, containing appendices to the draft post-2020 global biodiversity framework and a glossary of terms.

The framework presents five long-term goals for 2050 related to the CBD’s 2050 Vision for Biodiversity, and each of these goals has an associated outcome for 2030. The five goals address net loss and ecosystem resilience; reductions in the percentage of species threatened with extinction; the maintenance and enhancement of genetic diversity; the benefits of nature to people; and increasing the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits from the use of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge.

The framework also includes 20 action-oriented targets for 2030 that are meant to contribute to achieving these five goals. The 20 targets are presented under the categories of reducing threats to biodiversity; meeting people’s needs through sustainable use and benefit-sharing; and tools and solutions for implementation and mainstreaming.

The draft includes a preliminary list of indicators that may be used to assess progress towards the goals and targets. It considers elements of guidance on goals, SMART targets, indicators, baselines, and monitoring frameworks, relating to the drivers of biodiversity loss and for achieving transformational change. It also “takes into account the various consultation processes that have been undertaken, including the views expressed during the informal briefing by the Co-Chairs on 24 November 2019, which presented a preliminary overview of the zero draft of the framework.”

The Open-Ended Working Group on the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework was tasked with advancing preparations for the development of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.

According to a press release by the WEF, “for the first time in the survey’s 10-year outlook, the top five global risks in terms of likelihood are all environmental.” The Global Risks Report informs the WEF’s multi-stakeholder initiatives throughout the year.

The report derives from the results of an annual ‘Global Risks Perception Survey’ that is sent to approximately 800 members of the WEF community. Respondents are asked to assess: (1) the likelihood of a global risk occurring over the course of the next decade, and (2) the severity of its impact at a global level if it were to occur.

The report frames the global economy as facing increased risk of stagnation, rapid climate change, a “fragmented cyberspace that threatens the full potential of next-generation technologies,” and global protests against political and economic conditions and systems that worsen inequality.

The top five risks by likelihood over the next 10 years include: extreme weather events (e.g. floods, storms, etc.); failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; major natural disasters (e.g. earthquake, tsunami, volcanic eruption, geomagnetic storms); major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse; and human-made environmental damage and disasters.

The top five risks by severity of impact over the next decade are: failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; weapons of mass destruction; major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse; extreme weather events (e.g. floods, storms, etc.); and water crises.

Respondents also assessed the interconnections between pairs of global risks. The topmost strongly connected global risks include: extreme weather events and failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; large-scale cyberattacks and the breakdown of critical information infrastructure and networks; high structural unemployment or underemployment and adverse consequences of technological advances; major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse and failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; and food crises and extreme weather events.

The World Economic Forum will convene from 21-24 January in Davos, Switzerland under the theme, ‘A Cohesive and Sustainable World.’ The meeting aims to “shape global, regional and industry agendas at the beginning of each year.” The Four global issues that will feature prominently on the agenda include environmental challenges, sustainable business; technologies driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution; and demographic, social and technological trends reshaping education, employment and entrepreneurship.

At the same time, a centerpiece decision on the effectiveness evaluation was reduced in scope during a compromise at the end of the meeting, resulting in a related reduction in the programme of work and budget.

In addition, a decision on international cooperation on the eve of an important year for policy making on related issues, including chemicals management beyond 2020 and the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, did not advance. While most Parties supported a related proposed decision on collaboration with international organizations, consensus was blocked on the grounds that it was a “political statement” that called for collaboration outside the scope of the Minamata Convention.

During opening statements at COP3, which took place in Geneva, Switzerland, from 25-29 November 2019, high-level officials and regional representatives identified entry points in global sustainable development policy processes that can be used to leverage the success of the Minamata Convention, and encouraged delegates to strive to reach agreement on all agenda items in order to set the Convention on the right track. Among these statements, Inger Andersen, Executive Director, UN Environment Programme (UNEP), highlighted four areas needing action to reduce mercury exposure globally: artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM); stemming mercury trade; reducing emissions from coal burning, with linkages in climate policy; and e-waste.

The Earth Negotiations Bulletin reported that COP3 delegates were pleased with progress on some institutional agenda items, including the decisions taken on the sharing of secretariat services between the Secretariat of the Minamata Convention and the Secretariat of the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm (BRS) Conventions and the operationalization of the Implementation and Compliance Committee.

However, an early morning compromise at the end of the meeting that reduced the scope of the decision on the effectiveness evaluation, which had a direct bearing on the programme of work for the coming biennium, left many participants believing that COP3 had missed an important opportunity.

Discussions on additional operational issues resulted in decisions on:

guidance for completing the national reporting format;

the financial mechanism, including the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the Specific International Programme (SIP), enhancement of the SIP, and review of the financial mechanism; and

capacity building, technical assistance and technology transfer.

The COP reviewed cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO).

The COP also addressed technical issues that resulted in decisions on:

releases of mercury;

customs codes;

mercury waste, in particular consideration of relevant thresholds;

dental amalgam;

the review of the Convention’s Annexes A (mercury-added processes) and B (processes using mercury or mercury compounds), which is due by 2022; and

guidance on the management of contaminated sites.

In addition, the COP discussed issues relating to emissions of mercury resulting from the open burning of waste.

COP4 is expected to review the Convention’s Annexes and financial mechanism and conduct an effectiveness review of the Convention. It will take place from 30 October to 5 November 2021, in Bali, Indonesia.

Burden of malnutrition unacceptably high despite world being better equipped to fight it. Credit: Getty Images

India’s standing vis-a-vis United Nations-mandated goals has improved marginally, but the country has slipped in key areas, related to food security, livelihood and standard of living.

The country’s overall score of 60, according to the Sustainable Development Goals Index 2019-20 released by NITI Aayog, was three points above its 2018 standing. This was primarily due to better performance related to water and sanitation; affordable and clean energy as well as industry, innovation and infrastructure.

But the country was worse off in several goals (SDGs):

SDG 1 – Alleviating poverty

SDG 2 – Ending hunger

SDG 8 – Decent work and economic growth

SDG 10 – Reducing inequality

SDG 15 – Preserving life on land

SDG 16 – Upholding peace, justice and strong institutions

A hungry nation

India’s worst performance was towards SDG 2: Ending hunger by 2030, where its score has fallen to 38 in the current year from 48 in the previous year.

This was also highlighted by Global Hunger Index 2019 released in October 2019, which places India 102nd among 117 qualifying countries.

As many as 25 states and Union territories failed to address “hunger and malnutrition”, according to the NITI Ayog index. Jharkhand led from the bottom, scoring 22 off 100, followed by Madhya Pradesh (24) and Bihar (26).

Gujarat, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Meghalaya and Uttar Pradesh were among the states that lagged.

Top performer Goa scored 76, a dip of four points. Scores also dipped for five of the top 10 states: Manipur, Punjab, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu and Jammu and Kashmir.

The Centre-backed think tank considered three new indictors:

Children (6-59 months) who are anaemic

Children (0-4 years) who are underweight

Gross value added in agriculture per worker

Those apart, there were four existing indicators:

Rural households under public distribution system

Stunted children (under five)

Pregnant women (15-49 years) who are anaemic

Rice, wheat and coarse cereals produced annually per unit area

Climate challenge

The index recognised climate change as a challenge to ensuring food security in India as it turned food production highly vulnerable.

It stressed on climate-smart sustainable agriculture and called for widening climate-adaptive farming practices, new technology and plans that involve land owned by small farmers, who constitute more than 82 per cent of India’s farmers.

Poverty, gender parity

India slipped four points to 50 vis-a-vis ending poverty, with 22 states unable to reduce poverty. The situation was dismal for gender parity too.

Goa ranked last there, with its score plummeting 31 points to 19.

The index, in its second year, ranked the states and UTs based on 100 indicators for 54 targets across 16 goals.

His announcements included the co-facilitators he has appointed for several processes: preparations for the Biodiversity Summit, preparations for the Second Ocean Conference, preparations for the UN’s 75th anniversary, and the intergovernmental review of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

Addressing delegations on 13 January 2020, Muhammad-Bande outlined concrete actions to galvanize action and partnership in the coming weeks, including:

In preparation for the Biodiversity Summit in September 2020 (SDG 15), he said the co-facilitators for the preparatory will convene the first meeting on 16 January. The co-facilitators are the Permanent Representatives of Costa Rica and Italy. Muhammad-Bande urged Member States to “build on the political momentum generated by the Paris Agreement in 2015” and the UN’s Climate Action Summit in September 2019 to “accelerate action to save the planet” following the inability to reach consensus on important issues during UNFCCC COP 25 in December 2019.

On education (SDG 4), he will convene an event to celebrate the second International Day of Education, on 24 January 2020. The event will focus on transforming the education system through partnerships, and enable stakeholders to network and share best practices. Muhammad-Bande noted that he held a ‘Morning Dialogue’ on education.

On zero hunger (SDG 2), the President will host an event in February on ‘Targeting Hunger: South-South and Triangular Cooperation for Transforming Agriculture.’ He expressed hope that governments will discuss deepening their cooperation to achieve Zero Hunger, particularly through partnerships in the agricultural sector. He pointed to the value of modernizing the agricultural sector, and in particular increasing the availability and affordability of industrial machineries, irrigation systems, high-yield seedlings and access to finance.

In March, the President of the UNGA and the President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) will hold a High-Level Youth Plenary. Muhammad-Bande highlighted problems facing youth including lack of quality education, unemployment and underemployment. The dialogue will convene on 31 March 2020.

Muhammad-Bande has appointed the Permanent Representatives of Denmark and Palau as co-facilitators for the preparatory meeting for the Second UN Ocean Conference (SDG 14). The Ocean Conference will convene from 2-6 June 2020, in Lisbon, Portugal. The preparatory meeting will take place in New York, US, from 4-5 February, and is expected to determine the themes for seven interactive dialogues during the Conference, and to provide inputs on the Conference declaration.

On desertification (SDG 15), the UNGA President and the Secretariat of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) will convene a high-level dialogue on 9 June 2020 to review progress made in fighting desertification, land degradation and drought.

In addition to these events, Muhammad-Bande said he is working with the President of ECOSOC on an initiative on international financial accountability, transparency and integrity (SDG 17).

He also called for active involvement in celebrating the 25th anniversary of the fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing+25), along with the 20th anniversary of Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security, and the tenth anniversary of UN Women (SDG 5).

He noted that he has appointed the Permanent Representatives of Qatar and Sweden as co-facilitators for preparations for the UN’s 75th anniversary.

Finally, he said he has appointed co-facilitators for the review of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). These are the Permanent Representatives of Benin and Georgia, according to the President’s letter on 13 January 2020.

Reflecting on the first part of the 74th session, the President said that the active engagement of countries’ leaders during the High-level Week in September 2019 shows that “they attach much importance to multilateral cooperation, despite the fears of some regarding its deterioration.” He added that, following some difficult negotiations in the UNGA’s Main Committees, “I am not under any illusion that all that was decided is resolved, or that we will not have differences in the remaining part of the Session. I note the reservations by some delegations on specific issues.” [UNGA President’s briefing on 2020 priorities]","UN General Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande briefed UN Member States on the UNGA’s priorities for the remainder of the 74th session, which will run until mid-September 2020.

The resolution “calls on the Commission and the Council to set a clear spending target for biodiversity mainstreaming of at least 10% in its Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for 2021-2027, in addition to the target for spending on climate mainstreaming.”

In the resolution of 16 January the EU Parliament calls for increased ambition in the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, which the CBD COP 15 is expected to adopt in October. The resolution calls for Europe to lead by example to address global biodiversity loss, noting with concern the findings of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Global Assessment on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, which “underlines the magnitude of the ecological crisis and the need for urgent and concerted efforts fostering transformation change” to tackle biodiversity loss and halt species extinctions. EU Parliamentarians also express deep concern on the impact of climate change in driving biodiversity loss, concluding the world is “facing an environmental emergency, which requires significant action.” They stress that COP 15 must agree on ambitious, legally binding targets, detailed timelines, performance indicators and reporting mechanisms to stop the current trajectory of biodiversity loss.

COP 15 must agree on ambitious, legally binding targets, detailed timelines, performance indicators and reporting mechanisms to stop the current trajectory of biodiversity loss.

The EU Parliament identifies the upcoming EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 as an opportunity to demonstrate European leadership on biodiversity. Parliamentarians support taking biodiversity objectives into account in all EU policies and earmarking a minimum of 10% of the EU’s 2021-2027 long-term budget towards efforts to improve biodiversity. Parliamentarians further call for ensuring that natural areas make up at least 30% of the EU territory; restoring degraded ecosystems by 2030, by restoring natural forests, peatlands, floodplains, wetlands, grasslands, and coastal zones and marine areas; and promoting more sustainable agricultural and forestry practices, including binding reduction targets on pesticide use in the EU. They also call on the European Commission (EC) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) to include biodiversity-proofing components in their financial instruments to avoid adverse impacts on biodiversity.

The resolution coincides with other steps the European Commission is taking towards implementing a European Green Deal. In her keynote speech to the World Economic Forum, the President of the European Commission Ursula Gertrud von der Leyen said that the European Union will mobilize EUR 1 trillion of investment that will “create a green investment wave.” [EU Press Release on EU COP 15 Position] [European Parliament Resolution] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on Green New Deal] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on EC Annual Sustainable Growth Strategy] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on IPBES Assessment] [Keynote European Commission President Speech]","COP 15 must agree on ambitious, legally binding targets, detailed timelines, performance indicators and reporting mechanisms to stop the current trajectory of biodiversity loss.

The Global Compact on Refugees was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 17 December 2018.

More than 3,000 representatives of governments, the UN system, civil society and the private sector as well as 70 refugees participated in the Forum, which convened from 17-18 December 2019, in Geneva, Switzerland. The event was organized by the governments of Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Germany, Pakistan and Turkey, in partnership with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). It was co-hosted by the government of Switzerland.

Delivering opening remarks, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recalled that during his experiences as the High Commissioner for Refugees he saw “a fundamental human trait: the will to kindness” and the impulse to help a person in trauma. He said he also learned that generosity is not always proportional to wealth, and “the world owes all countries and communities that welcome large numbers of refugees a debt of gratitude” as well as the shouldering of that responsibility. He said the UN will advocate for including refugees in regional frameworks and national development plans and reviews, as well as in the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework.

The Forum reported the widest range of commitments ever for the forcibly displaced, including through employment, legal support and education.

UNHCR Filippo Grandi linked the Forum to the SDGs’ goal of leaving no one behind. He said refugee situations only become crises through short-term thinking, failing to work together across sectors, and neglecting the communities where refugees arrive.

The Forum had six areas of focus: burden and responsibility sharing; education; jobs and livelihoods; energy and infrastructure; solutions; and protection capacity. Each area was supported by a coalition of co-sponsors who formed alliances of support and advocacy, and identified opportunities for making pledges and contributions. More than 30 “whole-of-government” and “whole-of-society” consultations took place at the country and regional levels to identify possible pledges and contributions.

The Forum’s official summary reports that around 770 pledges and contributions were submitted during the event by a broad range of actors, including governments, humanitarian actors, private sector entities, educational institutions and international organizations. This composition of supporters represents “a considerable increase” in the level of engagement of many states and organizations in the Global Compact’s implementation. Per the summary, more than 350 pledges relate to improving laws and policies, such as pledges to:

continue to receive and admit refugees;

adopt “out of camp” policies and strengthen asylum systems;

allow refugees and asylum seekers to work and access financial services; and

include refugees in countries’ national development planning and national systems for education and health.

The summary also notes a commitment “to further and deeper engagement” by development actors and multilateral development banks, expressed through a range of financing and policy instruments, with almost 250 pledges containing “some form of financial component.” An initial analysis presented in the Forum’s summary indicates: USD 2.2 billion pledged by the World Bank Group, through a dedicated funding and financing window for refugees and host communities, in addition to a separate window of USD 2.5 billion aimed at supporting private sector investment in creating jobs in countries affected by fragility, conflict and violence; USD 1 billion committed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB); and over USD 2 billion in financial commitments by “a broad range of States and other stakeholders.”

The Global Refugee Forum also registered more than 200 pledges and contributions from the private sector, representing “the widest range of commitments ever for the forcibly displaced.” These commitments include more than USD 250 million in funding, the direct employment of more than 15,000 refugees, a joint legal community pledge with NGOs to provide more than 125,000 hours of pro bono legal services per year, and other pledges related to education and training, women’s economic empowerment, connectivity, business development services and innovative financing.

By the Forum’s summary, more than 130 pledges were made towards expanding access to education for refugees, focusing on supporting the inclusion of refugees in national systems.

The good practices, pledges and contributions announced during the Forum are featured on a digital platform launched at the Forum. The Platform will continue to collect and share good practices.

The first Global Refugee Forum also featured the launch of Support Platforms to reinforce three regional refugee responses, namely the MIRPS in Central America and Mexico, the Nairobi Process facilitated by The Intergovernmental Authority on Development in the East and Horn of Africa, and the Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees. The Support Platforms are situation-specific arrangements for burden and responsibility sharing provided for in the Global Compact on Refugees. Their purpose is to galvanize political commitment, mobilize assistance, facilitate coherent humanitarian and development responses, and support comprehensive policy initiatives.

Other launches at the Forum included the Asylum Capacity Support Group and the Global Academic Interdisciplinary Network, which seek to make the best use of, build upon and expand existing knowledge and expertise on refugee protection, in support of the objectives of the Global Compact on Refugees. The UN Development Programme presented its SDG Impact Accelerator (SDGIA), launched with the Government of Turkey, which aims to accelerate entrepreneurs for market-creating innovations that tackle the challenges of refugee populations and host communities in Turkey. Subsequently, SDGIA’s solutions and best practices could be replicated and applied to Least Developed Countries (LDCs).

The Forum was preceded by a day of special events dedicated to the refugee cause. It was supported by a social media campaign that emphasized that #EveryoneCounts.

UNHCR has developed a mechanism to track the implementation of pledges and contributions, and the next Global Refugee Forum will take place in 2023. A mid-term review meeting in 2021 also will serve as a tool to assess progress and maintain momentum for implementation of the Global Compact on Refugees.","The first-ever Global Refugee Forum – an opportunity to “rally behind the aspirations of the SDGs of leaving no one behind” – generated hundreds of pledges and contributions towards implementing the Global Compact on Refugees.

Ministers and high-level representatives from Burkina Faso, Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, Seychelles and Zimbabwe showcased their climate leadership efforts, shared stories and best practices, highlighted gaps in support, and discussed requirements to achieve their climate objectives and the SDGs. Grenada’s minister shared his country’s experience in developing its previously submitted NDC Partnership Plan.

During the 9 December event, representatives from the UK and Germany also expressed their commitment to help countries implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and raise ambition.

Burkina Faso’s minister said development of his country’s Partnership Plan began in early October 2019 with a multi-sectoral consultation meeting to review and identify national and sectoral priorities. The government outlined six components for consideration, including capacity building, mitigation, adaptation, progress reporting, financing and communication. He noted that ten partners are interested in providing support for Burkina Faso’s NDC implementation.

Jordan’s minister outlined Jordan’s NDC Action Plan, which includes the energy, water, health, agriculture and transport sectors, noting that by 2020, 20% of Jordan’s energy is expected to be generated from renewable resources. The minister described government-led Sector Working Groups, which identified each sector’s interventions and transformational pipeline projects based on emission reduction potential, sustainable development benefits, implementation readiness, and degree of alignment with national development priorities.

Zimbabwe’s representative said her country’s Partnership Plan outcomes include: local climate change mainstreaming; capacity strengthening for climate finance; reducing water vulnerability; engaging micro, small and medium-sized enterprises; increasing the adoption of low-carbon and clean technologies; scaling up climate-smart agriculture; and strengthening early warning systems. Twenty-seven partners are involved in implementing the Plan, she noted, with financial contributions of USD 23 million.

Seychelles’ representative informed the participants that her country’s Partnership Plan focuses on: the energy and transport sectors; monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV); national and international climate finance; adaptation planning and climate resilience; adaptation and institutional capacity; and the blue economy and blue carbon (seagrass mapping).

Pakistan’s representative shared that his country’s Partnership Plan was developed through a whole-of-society and participatory approach, and prioritizes eleven investment areas to promote a low-carbon and climate-resilient development pathway. Plan outcomes include: increasing the renewable energy share and energy access in underserved areas; scaling up low-carbon and climate-resilient land management practices in the agricultural and forestry sectors; and establishing climate-resilient “green” eco-industrial parks.

Lebanon’s minister said Lebanon is still finalizing its NDC Partnership Plan. The country is working with the NDC Partnership and sectors such as energy, waste, transport, forestry, water and agriculture on consultations, to form the basis of the Plan. Lebanon will also be receiving the Partnership’s Climate Action Enhancement Package to help the country establish a Green Financing Facility.

NDC Partnership Plans are used for coordination, planning, transparency, progress tracking and resource mobilization for NDC implementation. They match country needs for NDC implementation with resources from Partnership members and international stakeholders to create a results-based action plan that is country-owned. While country contexts and needs vary, according to the NDC Partnership website, all the Plans have a common operational framework.

14,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/2020s-buzzword-is-nature/,"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: 2020's Buzzword is Nature,"The ‘Super Year for Biodiversity’ is underway and Nature is trending. Relatable, universal, and cross-cutting, Nature will be a dominant and uniting theme for many of the milestone events leading up to the adoption of a new, post-2020 framework for biodiversity in October.

With half of humanity living in urban areas, where biodiversity often comes in the forms of roaches, rats, monkeys, and mosquitoes, any push to save the planet needs a concept everyone can embrace. The messaging this year will be broad and it will be accessible. From slum to skyscraper, Nature is all around. Air to breathe, fresh water and food. A stunning sunset. A vicious storm. Nature envelopes us, and for better or worse, it ‘leaves no one behind.’ Communications will encourage the reconnection of people to Nature, like for instance the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services’ (IPBES) emphasis on ‘Nature’s Contributions to People.’

Going into 2020, data show that we won’t achieve the Convention on Biological Diversity’s (CBD) Aichi Targets by their deadline in December. Evidence will come from the fifth Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO-5), which is tasked, inter alia, with reporting on each of the Aichi Targets and is due out in May. Last year, the IPBES Global Assessment of the State of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service report, which will serve as the scientific basis of the post-2020 biodiversity framework negotiations, informed that approximately a million species are a risk of extinction and that nature continues to decline due to human activities. The report warned that current trajectories will not achieve the global goals on nature as articulated in the Aichi Targets and the SDGs.

Perhaps a wider and softer net – one woven by Mother Nature herself – can help. Anchoring biodiversity to Nature may make it easier to incorporate biodiversity considerations into the everyday decisions of people, governments and companies. This has long been a CBD priority, with the Convention dedicating its 2018 meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to mainstreaming biodiversity into the agriculture, fisheries, forestry and tourism sectors – recognizing that these sectors depend on nature’s contributions. Without a doubt, the plight of biodiversity must be universally understood and addressed, if humanity is to solve the ecological crisis. As the 2019 World Economic Forum, Conservation International, the World Wildlife Fund are saying, it’s time for a “New Deal for Nature.”

Further, the adoption of the 2030 Agenda and SDG implementation has demanded an end to siloed development approaches and encouraged a focus on the linkages between the environmental, economic and social aspects of development. No more is biodiversity to be considered in a vacuum – not if it is to be truly integrated into the universally agreed, global development platform. Arguably, the concept of Nature offers a way to link biodiversity more easily into the SDG framework. Nature’s systems, of which biodiversity is a critical component, sustain life on Earth and offer a touchstone for the achievement of all the Goals. Nature is cross-cutting.

The theme for biggest meeting on biodiversity in ten years does not contain the word biodiversity.

When the CBD does convene its COP in October to adopt the post-2020 biodiversity framework, it will do so under the theme of ‘Ecological Civilizations: Building a Shared Future for all Life on Earth.’ Note that the theme for the biggest meeting on biodiversity in ten years does not contain the word biodiversity. Instead it links people (civilizations) to nature (ecology). Ecology is the branch of biology dealing with the relations of organisms to one another and to their physical surroundings. By its theme, the CBD COP won’t just be talking about conserving biodiversity for biodiversity’s sake. It will be talking about the core of humanity – our civilizations – and their relationship to the natural world all around. It is an approach that strikes an additional nail into the coffin of siloed approaches to conservation.

The other major biodiversity-related COP in 2020, that of the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) in February, will also have ecology at the heart of its theme. For its part, the CMS will present the concept of ‘Ecological Connectivity,’ which it defines as “the unimpeded movement of species and the flow of natural processes that sustain life on Earth.” With a concept that links the migration of species to the sustenance of all life on Earth, the CMS is calling for both an Ecological Connectivity stand-alone target as well as integration of the concept into other relevant targets of the new biodiversity framework.’ Will the bigger pictures sync? Can our “ecological civilizations” be “ecologically connected”?

In addition to ecology, nature-based solutions are also likely to feature in the big biodiversity-related and climate meetings this year. These approaches, which offer a linked way to incorporate biodiversity considerations into multidimensional development problems, rose to global attention in 2019. They were stressed in parallel to the Climate Action Summit, especially with regard to forests, as well as at the UN Convention on Desertification COP (UNCCD COP 14) and the High-level Panel on Oceans, during Climate Week. Nature-based solutions have been framed as a way to address multiple priorities at once – for instance mangroves offer protection from climate-related disasters like storm surges, while fostering the biodiversity that supports fisheries (food and employment) and sequestering carbon.

In announcing the theme of the next World Environment Day, which will take place in June 2020 and focus on biodiversity, the Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said, “2020 is a year for urgency, ambition and action to address the crisis facing nature; it is also an opportunity to more fully incorporate nature-based solutions into global climate action.” It is likely that nature-based solutions will also receive attention at the forthcoming meetings of the World Conservation Congress, the second UN Ocean Conference, and the Climate Change Conference in Glasgow.

As a final point of reference for the 2020 word of the year, when world leaders convene in New York for the UN General Assembly, they will have an opportunity to participate in a ‘Nature Summit.’ The meeting will offer one more step towards achieving the CBD’s long-term (2050) Vision of ‘Living in Harmony with Nature.’

We are all touched by her hand, and for the Biodiversity Super Year, we will see that our hope lies in Nature.","The ‘Super Year for Biodiversity’ is underway and Nature is trending.
Evidence will come from the fifth Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO-5), which is tasked, inter alia, with reporting on each of the Aichi Targets and is due out in May.
The report warned that current trajectories will not achieve the global goals on nature as articulated in the Aichi Targets and the SDGs.
Anchoring biodiversity to Nature may make it easier to incorporate biodiversity considerations into the everyday decisions of people, governments and companies.
Arguably, the concept of Nature offers a way to link biodiversity more easily into the SDG framework."

Niti Aayog’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Index 2019-20 has improved to 60 in 2019—three points more than that in 2018. The improvement is largely on the back of progress made on the water & sanitation, clean energy, and innovation fronts. Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh are the best performing states while Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh fare the worst. India also has had a poor showing on SDG1 (alleviating poverty), SDG2 (ending hunger), SDG8 (decent work and economic growth). It also does badly on SDG 10 (reducing inequality), SDG15 (preserving life on earth), and SDG16 (upholding peace, justice and strong institutions. However, as per the index, the performance on ending hunger and gender disparity cast a cloud over India’s overall performance.

India’s score on ending hunger dipped to 38 from last year’s 48 points. Given how only around 30% of POSHAN Abhiyaan funds were utilised by the states—India ranks a low 102 in the Global Hunger Index—the government must take urgent steps to combat this. Jharkhand was the worst performer in terms of ending hunger; around 25 states and UTs failed to address the issues. The states did poorly on gender equality, too. Apart from Kerala and Himcahal Pradesh, every other state performed poorly on this aspect. Indicators such as low sex-ratio (896 per 1,000 males), wage gap, lack of political representation, poor labour force participation and large scale informality of labour have contributed to India doing badly with respect to gender equality. What’s worse, it is now clear that certain states always fair poorly—a Jharkhand is always somewhere at the bottom, while a Kerala is always on the top. Therefore, the Centre needs to calibrate its policy and implementation to bridge these gaps.","India also has had a poor showing on SDG1 (alleviating poverty), SDG2 (ending hunger), SDG8 (decent work and economic growth).

The report also addresses interlinkages between progress in SDG 7 and SDG 13 (climate action).

The report titled, ‘Tracking SDG 7: Energy Progress Report,’ seeks to help build capacity in the Arab region through access to information, with the aim of strengthening policies to improve energy security, enhance climate resilience and mainstream the SDGs into regional and national policy processes.

According to the report, SDG target 7.1 (by 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services) has seen progress, and the Arab region is on track to achieve universal access to electricity by 2030 (SDG indicator 7.1.1) and improved access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking (SDG indicator 7.1.2). The region’s electrification rate rose from 88.4% in 2010 to 92.5% in 2017, making it the most electrified region in the developing world. By 2017, electrification access was almost universal in all but three Arab countries (Mauritania, the Sudan and Yemen), and the number of people without access fell from 40 million in 2010 to 30 million in 2017, although increasing conflicts in the region have impacted on energy access in affected areas.

The share of renewable energy has been plateauing at around 10.2% of the Arab region’s total energy consumption since 2010.

However, the report warns, progress on other SDG targets is not on track. Regarding SDG target 7.2 (increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030), the share of renewable energy has been plateauing at around 10.2% of the region’s total energy consumption since 2010, with Arab least developed countries (LDCs) accounting for a large proportion of renewable energy use through traditional biomass. Increased solar energy deployment has contributed little to the total primary energy supply in most non-LDCs. Regarding SDG 7.3 (doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030), energy intensity in the region has continued to decline, but not enough to align with the need to decouple economic growth and energy consumption.

The report explains that to achieve both the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change, Arab countries must:

equip local markets with effective policy frameworks, including incentives, such as availability of finance, investments in sustainable and clean energy, education infrastructure and services, and the removal of market barriers;

ensure inclusive, transparent and competent state-level institutions to guarantee sustainable energy policies;

update Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that include renewable energy and energy efficiency goals;

strengthen regional cooperation; and

promote an energy transition that fosters more inclusive and sustainable societies.

The report also urges better use of development aid to support scalable, replicable projects that benefit local communities.

""To help close the gap between technology's potential and the slow rate of progress, the Forum is supporting the launch of Frontier 2030 at the 2020 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos,"" said WEF in a media statement on Thursday. The Frontier 2030 would be a roadmap to mobilize technology companies, governments, international organizations, investors and civil society to tackle the barriers that prevent 4IR technology from being scaled up to address the Global Goals. ""We have a good reason for technology optimism, but we also need a good dose of technology realism,"" said Antonia Gawel, Head of Innovation and Circular Economy, World Economic Forum.

Vineet J Mehra

While India is already making rapid strides in the area of sustainability, there is an urgent need to engage our nation’s youth in enabling us to meet our sustainable development goals. Sustainability has become one of the most definitive buzzwords of the 21st century and for good reason too — the modern world is currently grappling with the effects of uninhibited patterns of production and consumption. Simply put, even our population is exploding and technology advancing in leaps and bounds, our quality of life is rapidly declining.

India, which stands at the cusp of a new era of development, is at an interesting juncture with regards to its take on sustainability. While our country’s per-capita emissions are amongst the lowest in the world, we are also the third-largest generator of emissions. Further, despite being the third-largest economy in the world, we are also home to the largest number of people living below the international poverty line. Our sheer size and the rapid pace of our growth are the two biggest challenges with regards to our approach to sustainability.

A conscious aspirant

India has taken on a leading role as an aspiring change-maker in tackling climate change and in framing developmental schemes that are aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals — these goals were adopted in September 2015 and encompass social, environmental and social dimensions of development, including ending all forms of poverty. To this end, efforts have been made to involve all stakeholders – from the public and private sectors — in framing effective policies, implementation strategies and best practices. For instance, in February 2018, a national workshop on capacity development was held with the intent of localising the sustainable development goals. In August 2018, a government and business partnership conclave aimed to sensitise private businesses and industries about sustainable development goals, and to analyse their programme strategies in accordance with these

goals. The NITI Aayog – a policy think-tank by the Government of India focused on sustainable development goals — released the SDG India Index — Baseline Report 2018 in December 2018, to track the progress made by all the states and union territories on the interventions and schemes initiated by the central government.

Up the ante

India is one of the least wasteful economies. The country has been as a key player in shaping the Paris Agreement and has adopted various energy-efficiency measures. Sustainability is also an integral part of Indian culture, its philosophy and its values. Rural communities, which comprise roughly 70 per cent of the country’s population as of 2011, continue to live a simple and frugal lifestyle. As per Greendex, an international report on sustainable living

that measures the way consumers are responding to environmental concerns in their housing, transport, food and goods choices, India occupies a top spot among 18 contenders, which also include China and the US.

India has had one of the most successful campaigns on shunning off single-use plastic and amplifying Swachh Bharat. This has helped in creating awareness from the primary school level, with kids questioning their parents for their right to cleanliness. We need to make more conscious effort to create more sustainable jobs, and embark for children to live their right to a happy childhood. We need to focus on economic sustainability to make all aware that

any form of slavery, trafficking and organ trafficking, bonded labour and sexual slavery though large businesses in volumes of trade but are desperate reasons for lack of sustainable job creation and economic development at a block level of India or Bharat.

However, as the economy continues to develop and grow further, there is a marked shift in socio-economic trends. The country still faces tremendous environmental concerns, especially when it comes to developing sustainable communities. India’s booming population, which is often cited as its most valuable resource, can present considerable challenges of scale in terms of policy implementation, as a July 2019 report released by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. The report finds that India has a “long way to go” to achieve its target of public health spending. The country’s primary health infrastructure was also found to be inadequate and there exists a severe dearth of data to track the progress made on achieving the sustainable development goals for health by 2030.

Agents of change

Sustainability, especially in the national context, cannot be targeted in silos and calls for a collaborative, community-based effort. As per estimates, India is likely to have a GDP of USD 4 trillion and a population of 1.5 billion by 2030. This will lead to a corresponding increase in demand for critical resources such as coal and oil, as well as an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Considering that 80 per cent of India of 2030 is yet to be built, we have been presented with a unique opportunity to pursue development while managing our emissions growth, enhancing energy security and creating world-scale clean-technology industries.

As one of the youngest countries in the world — 42 per cent of India’s population is composed of people aged between 15-35 years; in the next 30 years, this figure will reach 55 per cent — our youth must be empowered to create business solutions that are not detrimental to the environment and aligned with government initiatives such as Skill India and Make In India. There also exists an urgent need to create a business environment that emphasises on sustainability as a key driver of innovation. Upskilling of an ever informed workforce is not a necessity but a compulsion. As a growing democracy with a complex and diverse society, we must be focused on creating a cohort that becomes a vibrant, constructive force that can address social issues and create a more just, equitable and

peaceful world. The youth of our nation are no longer passive recipients of services; they must be shaped into agents of change who have the energy, passion and creativity to make a deeper impact on society.

We need to question ourselves and all 193 countries that have signed to deliver the SDG’s to each one of us living with freedom or aspiring to live with freedom and fear on planet earth. We need to hold each of these countries audited for their efforts leading up to 2030.","Vineet J MehraWhile India is already making rapid strides in the area of sustainability, there is an urgent need to engage our nation’s youth in enabling us to meet our sustainable development goals.

In a ranking of states released last week by Indian policy think tank NITI Aayog and the United Nations, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu have emerged as the front runners in the race to achieve key sustainable development goals (SDGs) especially in poverty alleviation and inequality, while Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh sank to the bottom of the list.According to the SDG India Index 2019, India’s composite score improved from 57 in 2018 to 60 in 2019-20 with successes in water and sanitation, power and industry. Nutrition and gender equality, however, are a cause for concern.India has, therefore, reached a little beyond the halfway mark in meeting the SDGs adopted in 2015. The index covers 13 of the 17 sustainable development goals, including healthcare, gender equality, clean energy, infrastructure, education, peace and building strong, accountable institutions.Kerala retained the top slot while Bihar came out as the worst performer. Kerala’s overall top rank (70) is attributed to its rapid improvements in providing health facilities, reducing hunger, achieving gender equality and providing quality education. The rank shows the distance each state has to cover to reach 100, where it fully achieves its SDGs. Himachal Pradesh ranked next with 69 due its clean water and sanitation efforts, reducing inequalities and preserving the mountain ecosystem. Tamil Nadu has a score of 68. Among the union territories (UTs), Chandigarh topped at 68 due to its focus on clean water and sanitation and providing quality education.Tamil Nadu also topped the states in poverty reduction, while Kerala topped in providing quality education, closely followed by Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh. The toppers in gender equality, Sikkim and Union territories Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Chandigarh have crossed the half way mark in reaching the goals.As per the SDG India Index 2019, the composite score for each state/UT is computed by aggregating their performance across the goals, and then by taking the arithmetic mean of individual goal scores. A score of 100 implies that the State/ UT has achieved targets set for 2030; a score of 0 implies that the particular State/UT is at the bottom of the table. Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and Sikkim have shown maximum improvement, as per the report for second year released by NITI Aayog on Monday. This first such report was released in 2018.The year 2020 will be the fifth anniversary of the adoption of SDGs by 193 countries at the UN General Assembly. The SDGs, constituted through an unprecedented consultative process, have 17 goals and 169 related targets to be achieved by 2030. The Index has been developed by NITI Aayog in coordination with the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, United Nations in India and Global Green Growth Institute.In 2018 index, only three states, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, were placed in the category of front runners – with a score in the range of 65-99. In 2019, five more States joined this league – Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Sikkim and Goa, taking the total tally to eight.With regard to poverty reduction, states which have done well include Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Andhra Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Sikkim. On zero hunger parameters, Goa, Mizoram, Kerala, Nagaland and Manipur were the front runners, according to the report.The SDG India Index is available on an online dashboard, which has cross-sectoral relevance across policy, civil society, business and academia. It is designed to function as a tool for focused policy dialogue, formulation and implementation, and moving towards development action pegged to globally recognizable metrics. The Index also supplements NITI Aayog’s continuous efforts to encourage evidence-based policymaking by supporting States/UTs to benchmark their progress, identifying priority areas and sharing best practices.The 2019 Index is more robust than the first edition on account of wider coverage of goals, targets, and indicators. It spans 16 out of 17 SDGs with a qualitative assessment on Goal 17. This marks an improvement over the 2018 Index, which covered only 13 goals.The SDG India Index 2019 will also help highlight crucial gaps related to monitoring SDGs and the need for improving statistical systems at the National/State/UT levels. Further, the Index highlights the need for improvements in data collection, reporting and methodology.

Policing in SDG and Cornwall set to be more expensive in 2020 Photo by Francis Racine / Francis Racine/Standard-Freeholder

Article content The requests by the two services that police the area — the Cornwall Police Service (CPS) and the SDG OPP are increasing for 2020. The CPS’ 2020 budget request for $19,608,754 constituted a more than half a million dollar increase from last year’s police budget. In comparison, the SDG OPP budget request to SDG council was $10.3 million, $297,530 more than last year’s request of $10 million. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Policing in SDG and Cornwall set to be more expensive in 2020 Back to video A decision by Cornwall council to approve the CPS budget would therefore see city taxpayers pay in about $9 million more than SDG for policing services. Dollar-for-dollar, is just looking at the two price tags a fair comparison? Are ratepayers in either municipality getting the policing they need, with the approach they want, at a reasonable cost? Making a comparison based on dollars alone is unfair to both OPP and the Cornwall police, both of which do the work to police our communities. The Cornwall police’s history dates back to 1784 when village Consts. David Wright and David Scheik patrolled the streets that would later become known as Cornwall and the Townships. SDG OPP on the other hand, took over policing of all of SDG in 2000, after the police service in Alexandria was disbanded.

Article content “Prior to that the OPP has been policing in the separate counties that make up the United Counties of SDG for many decades,” said SDG OPP Insp. Mike Mulhearn. The areas policed by the two services are quite different, both in size and in the number of residents. The SDG OPP’s area of coverage spans all of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry, which is 3,250 square kilometres and home to approximately 65,000 residents, whereas the CPS polices 62 square kilometres and a population of about 47,000. The SDG OPP currently employs 102.5 uniformed personnel, whereas the CPS currently has 89 sworn officers and 10 special constables. In all, Cornwall employs 136 full-time staff members and 14 part-time members. The Cornwall service possesses a headquarters building on Pitt Street, as well as an east-end station on Montreal Road. The station is home to the CPS’ youth services unit and the crime reduction/community partnership unit. The SDG OPP on the other hand, runs five operational buildings, its detachment headquarters being in Long Sault. Four satellite detachments are located in Alexandria, Lancaster, Morrisburg and Winchester. Both police services also bill their appropriate municipalities differently. The CPS’ request is on a budget basis—meaning the city ratepayers pick up the cost of all the services offered by police, minus any revenues it earns from provincial and federal governments, and charging for some of its services, such as dispatching for some outlying fire departments, etc.

Article content The OPP charges SDG on a per-property basis as well as on calls for service. SDG pays $183.23 per property. The rate for calls for services doesn’t reflect the number of calls taken in SDG, but rather, a proportionate share calculated from the total calls all OPP detachments on municipal contracts respond to throughout the province. Cornwall police Chief Danny Aikman said he understood some of the city’s residents might see the additional $9 million as a reason for Cornwall to perhaps set its sights on the OPP. He was however adamant the service offered by his officers differs from the one provided by their OPP counterparts. More On This Topic Cornwall police's $19.6-million budget an increase of 2.98% SDG adds $1.8 million to draft 2020 tax budget “I recognize that it’s expensive,” he said, during an interview with the Standard-Freeholder. “But being a municipal police services allows us to make all of our decisions locally, in Cornwall. Our members are closely intertwined with the community. That’s what community policing is all about. “We come from this community and most of us live in the city of Cornwall or close proximity to it, so we know what the issues are here.” Aikman also recognized that 87 per cent of his department’s budget comes from wages and benefits. “Most people focus on the sworn elements because that’s what they see, in terms of a police service,” said Aikman. “Obviously we have a lot of supporting elements that help us achieve our goals. From a front-line perspective, our field operations division is comprised of the community patrol, the criminal investigations division, which also includes our sexual assault and child abuse unit, as well as our street crime and intelligence unit.”

Article content Despite not being able to provide the Standard Freeholder with statistics, Aikman stressed his staff also provide the community with several hours of volunteering time. “We don’t keep track of the hours we spend doing volunteer work,” he started,” but if there’s a volunteering opportunity within the community, we’re there. Whether it’s minor sports or the Children’s Christmas Cheer event, we are there.” Mulhearn for his part explained the SDG OPP Auxiliary Unit volunteered 3,964 hours in 2019. “Many members volunteer their time outside of work in roles such as coaching and managing sports teams, firefighters as well as being part of community groups, school councils and clubs,” he said. “The OPP and its members are very involved in the community. As a community partner with many other agencies, we strive to ensure not only public safety but the well-being of our residents and to provide assistance to our marginalized populations so all receive the required services.” The SDG OPP has access to several different units, such as community street crime, traffic management, court services and emergency response team, as well as a K9 unit, based in SDG. “Certain members within the SDG OPP are also specialists in fields such as the provincial liaison team, hostage negotiator, tactical flight officer, drug recognition experts, scene of crimes officers, motorized snow vehicle operators, marine operators , all-terrain vehicle operator, technical collision investigator, commercial vehicle safety inspectors, and firearms examiners to name a few,” said Mulhearn. “SDG OPP also has access to all of the OPP’s specialized provincial units, such as the organized crime enforcement bureau, aviation services and provincial anti-terrorism section, to name a few.”

Article content The CPS for its part also offers several units, such as a bicycle foot patrol, communications centre/police and fire dispatch, community patrol division, Cornwall emergency response team, court bureau, crime reduction and community partnerships, criminal investigation division, forensic identification division, marine policing, records bureau, sexual assault & child abuse, street crime unit and a traffic unit. Both police services are also part of their own situation tables. Since its creation in 2017, the Cornwall situation table has addressed over 80 specific cases. “The situation table has more than 30 partners, sitting together to address local issues,” Aikman said. “That’s individuals with mental health or addiction issues, criminal activity within a family and so on. Cornwall police has brought 25 of those situations to the table and we’ve assisted in an additional 46.” One of the main issues the CPS faces the SDG OPP does not, according to Aikman, is linked to socio-economic situations in Cornwall. “Poverty is a real issue in Cornwall and the area,” he said. “It’s is one of those reasons why crime actually occurs. As do the lack of resources for such things as mental health and addictions services. You add that to certain areas of towns that may have population density, and those are all the elements that criminologists will tell you contribute to crime in a community. “We spend a lot of time trying to deal with these issues.”

The deficit of Sudan’s 2020 budget will be SDG 150 billion ($3.3 billion*), Minister of Finance Ibrahim El Badawi reported on Friday during an interview with Omdurman Radio.

El Badawi also asserted that the expenditures of the former regime in 2017 and 2018 exceeded the state budget by SDG 144 billion ($3.2 billion).

This amount is now a debt owed to the Central Bank of Sudan (CBoS). El Badawi explained that the government and the CBoS agreed that the Ministry of Finance will pay off SDG 25 billion ($0.5 billion) per annum over the next six years.

The total debt is currently SDG 70 billion ($1.5 billion). The 2020 budget has a SDG 80 billion ($1.8 billion) deficit, which is 3.5 per cent of the country’s GDP.

El Badawi said that the entire deficit could be covered if the price of petrol is gradually raised between March and July or August this year, and if the subsidy on diesel is gradually reduced from August onwards for a full year. In that case there will no need to borrow funds from the CBoS, according to El Badawi.

A decision about the subsidies will be taken after a dialogue with the society, the Minister said.

In total, the government will spend SDG 252 billion ($5.6 billion) on subsidies in 2020, which is 36 per cent of the total budget. In 2019, the subsidies amounted to SDG 188 billion ($4.2 billion).

""We never had starvation. Everyone should work and a person who works can never die of starvation in Punjab. These figures are wrong. We give atta and dal free - a person can't even make roti?"" asked Dharamsot.

Punjab Health Minister Sidhu said, ""I don't think there is anyone in Punjab who sleeps without having food, anyone who does so is probably trying to lose weight. We in Punjab have a such a healthy and rich diet, there is no question of anyone sleeping hungry.""

Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh had on Wednesday lauded the marked improvement in several key sectors under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the state while calling for more aggressive efforts to boost performance in other areas.

Niti Aayog's -- SDG Index 2019-20 report, based on 17 goals covering 100 indicators, showed that the state has done exceptionally well in areas like open-defecation free (ODF), internet subscribers, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) and door-to-door waste collection, besides showing improvement in the average annual dropout rate at secondary level, said an official statement.

According to the statement, Punjab ranked 10th with the index score 60 among the states against India's overall score of 57 points in NITI Aayog's first report 'SDG Index India 2018', based on 13 goals covering 62 priority indicators.

However, there were a few indicators where the state's performance had marginally declined. The release further said that employment under the MGNREGA decreased from 81.63 per cent to 76.12 per cent, sex ratio at birth decreased from 893 to 886, and reported cognizable crimes against children (one lakh population) increased from 21 to 24.3.

New provincial animal welfare act won't impact OSPCA of SDG

Article content Despite Ontario’s Provincial Animal Welfare Services (PAWS) Act replacing and repealing the previous Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (OSPCA) Act, it will be business as usual at the Ontario SPCA Stormont, Dundas & Glengarry Animal Centre in Cornwall. “The society and its network of animal-welfare communities will continue to facilitate and provide for provincewide leadership on matters relating to the prevention of cruelty to animals and the promotion of animal well-being,” said Melissa Kosowan, associate director of communications for the OSPCA provincial office. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. New provincial animal welfare act won't impact OSPCA of SDG Back to video When asked about the act and how it might affect the SDG office, branch manager Carol Link said, “(the act) is different from what we do, sheltering. It’s two different departments.” PAWS, the first fully provincial government-based animal welfare enforcement system in Canada, will oversee a variety of different categories. The province is implementing a new model with more inspectors to provide provincewide coverage, including those with specialized expertise in livestock, zoos, aquariums and equines.

Article content In addition, the act enables courts to impose the highest financial penalties for offenders in Canada and update prohibitions and obligations, such as barring the return of dog fighting equipment to a person convicted of an offence, and harming or attempting to harm a service animal or one that works with peace officers. The act will provide a more aggressive way of tackling animal abuse, something which the Ontario SPCA did to a lesser extent. “It’s important to remember that enforcement made up only approximately 20 per cent of the work the Ontario SPCA does every day in animal protection,” said Kosowan. “As Ontario’s animal welfare charity, we offer a variety of mission-based programs, including community-based sheltering, animal wellness services, provincial animal transfers, shelter health and wellness, high-volume spay/neuter services, animal rescue, animal advocacy, Indigenous partnership programs and humane education.” The act will also establish a multi-disciplinary advisory table made up of a wide range of experts, including veterinarians, agriculture representatives, academics, animal advocates and others to provide ongoing advice to the ministry. “People care about the welfare of animals and so does our government,” said Solicitor General Sylvia Jones. “We committed to creating a strong, new system to protect animals, and we have delivered on that promise.”

Article content PAWS will also introduce a new enforcement model, made up of a chief animal welfare inspector, locally deployed provincial inspectors and specialized inspectors for livestock, zoos, aquariums and equines. What is unknown at the moment is whether those inspectors who worked for the OSPCA – one was based here in SDG – remain employed under the new service. Inspectors will conduct outreach and education on animal care best practices and how to be compliant with the legislation, proactive, risk-based inspections; including, for example, of zoos and aquariums and reactive inspections to respond to animal welfare concerns The new approach will also provide resources for Crown attorneys to support animal welfare prosecutions. The province has established a toll-free number, 1-833-9-ANIMAL (264625) for people to report concerns about animal distress or abuse. This call centre is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. fracine@postmedia.com Twitter.com/FrancisRacine

Article content This article has been edited to correct the spelling and job title for Cornwall Community Hospital’s vice-president of community programs Christine Penney. Out of the four pillars that make up the newly-created Community Safety and Well-being plan, mental health was given top billing in recognition of its importance in building a healthy and safe community. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Improving mental health for a safer & happier Cornwall/SDG/Akwesasne Back to video There has been a dramatic shift in thinking about mental health issues over the past several years. There is much more awareness and acceptance that seeking help is normal, where once people feared they would be labelled as crazy. With that normalization, there has been a big push to increase and improve mental health services, a trend the new community well-being plan wants to capitalize on. The Standard-Freeholder decided to take the time to look at each of the four pillars individually and examine the several different initiatives proposed for each with some of the groups involved in the plan’s creation.

Article content More On This Topic Working to eradicate poverty in Cornwall/SDG/Akwesasne More people, better access to health care in Cornwall/SDG/Akwesasne Working to create safer communities in Cornwall/SDG/Akwesasne Cornwall, Akwesasne and SDG endorse community safety and well-being plan One of the most prominent mental health organizations in the region is the Cornwall Community Hospital, which not only operates its own mental health Services department, but also several community programs. Hospital CEO Jeanette Despatie noted much of what is proposed in the community safety and well-being plan is being implemented by different groups across the region, but these efforts cannot keep up with the demand for mental health services. “There is a need for additional resources to meet the demand. For instance, there is a real need for more psychiatrists, but we know the need to recruit more is not going away any time soon. So it is our responsibility to figure out different ways that we can help deliver services to fill those needs,” said Despatie. Training and education This has been the goal of mental health advocates for many years, and there has been an enormous amount of success in achieving it. But the plan calls for initiatives such as programs for mental health in the farming community, helping communities become dementia friendly, and workshops to help people identify the signs and symptoms of mental illness. Christine Penney, the hospital’s vice-president of community programs, pointed out the Canadian Mental Health Association is currently doing this in schools.

Article content “We also work with the Eastern Ontario Health Unit around prevention and education, while our mandate is providing treatment,” said Penny. Free counselling The community safety and well-being plan calls for more counselling services that do not cost to the individual. But Despatie argued it would be good to try to expand counselling services, even if they are not completely free, in order to deal with the problem of wait times. “I know the plan is focusing on the free services, but expanding the offerings through our programs would be great, because right now the demand is greatly outstripping the capacity to meet people’s needs in a timely fashion,” she said. Increase availability and access The plan proposes this could be done in several ways, such as having more evening hours so people can seek help after work or school, mobile services for rural communities, and the use of technology for telemedicine. Many of these initiatives already exist in some form or another, organizations including the hospital offer mobile services , and more and more clinics are expanding their evening hours. “There’s always room for increasing evening hours, but it still comes back to the need for more resouces,” said Penney. Penney also noted the hospital is about to embark on a new pilot project using the Zoom teleconferencing platform, which they believe will be particularly popular with youth and rural residents who need to speak with a counsellor.

Article content More support groups There are plenty of support groups for mental health issues such as alcohol and substance abuse, but the community safety and well-being plan wants to see more aimed at problems like post-traumatic stress disorder, postpartum depression, and youth. It also advocates for mentorship programs and programs to teach coping skills. Fortunately, a new post-partum depression clinic has just opened in Cornwall at the Cotton Mills, under the guidance of a local doctor. “They’re just about to get their first group going,” said Penney. Support for caregivers People who take care of their loved ones with mental illnesses are often the unsung heroes of the health-care system. But taking care of someone 24-7 is exhausting, and the plan calls for more support to help make thing easier. Just a few months ago, the hospital opened its new caregiver centre at its facility. “We have peer support from other caregivers, and we put a special emphasis on addiction and mental health because we know those caregivers have a specific set of stressors. So the idea is you can come in between noon and 4 p.m. and talk to someone who will give you emotional support, there is also plenty of resources on things like navigating the system,” said Penney. Prevention and intervention The focus of these programs would be to help people learn life skills, stress management and healthy childhood development. For instance, the plan calls for the creation of wellness groups to help people develop hobbies, self-worth and confidence. It also proposes workshops to teach healthy habits such as cooking exercise, gardening, work/life balance, and so on.

Article content One existing program that might serve as a model is the infant mental health program the hospital has been collaborating on. “A lot times people say ‘infant mental health? What the heck are you talking about?’ What you are actually doing is working with the family, the mother in particular,” explained Penney. “When you identify a high-risk situation – mom may have an addiction or the attachment is occurring as you might expect – we immediately work with our pediatrics unit, the health unit, and children’s aid to put together a comprehensive program for those moms-at-risk.” A community hub One idea that is promoted in all four pillars of the plan is a proposal for a single location where a wide range of social and medical services could be accessed under one roof. In the mental health care space, the hospital’s mental health Services department already fits the bill. But there is also a youth hub located on Pitt Street, which offers recreation for teens as well as access to employment services, a nurse practioner, addiction and mental health treatment. Enhance awareness

Another suggestion contained within the other three pillars is to take steps to make knowing what services are available and how to find them easier. When it comes to mental illness treatment, the hospital has both a phone line to call, as well as two employees who serve as system navigators – one for adults and one for youth. ahale@postmedia.com twitter.com/alan_s_hale

25,https://www.fairobserver.com/region/middle_east_north_africa/un-sustainable-development-goals-good-governance-sdg-mena-news-17612/,"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Fair Observer,The Importance of Good Governance,"To the extent that people know anything about the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), they reasonably assume that they have something to do with the economy (development), and with the environment (sustainability). They’re only partly right. The bigger challenge, especially for countries in the Middle East and North Africa region, is governance.

The 17 SDGs were adopted by all United Nations member states in 2015, with a target date of 2030. That leaves 10 years to achieve, amongst others: no poverty, zero hunger, gender equality, affordable and clean energy and climate action. These are major challenges for all governments, not just MENA.

Yet the most challenging of the goals may be the one that hardly gets talked about: SDG 16. It calls for governments to “Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.”

It’s Complicated

All the SDGs are accompanied by specific targets. The ones for SDG 16 include: promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice for all; substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms; develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels; ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels; and ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements.

This is a familiar list of ingredients of “good governance” as it has been defined by major international agencies like the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development over the last 20 years. But they are more than a list: They are mutually reinforcing. It’s hard to achieve one without the others.

Take eradicating bribery and corruption. How could that be achieved if the courts are in the back pockets of political and business leaders? Corruption cannot be truly addressed without the rule of law. But real rule of law needs accountability and transparency, which means public access to information and protection of fundamental freedoms.

Make Sense of the World Unique insight from 2,000+ contributors in 80+ Countries Make Sense of the World Unique insights from 2000+ contributors in 80+ countries I agree to receive emails and other content from Fair Observer. I understand that I may repeal my consent at any time. You can review our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use for further information.

It gets more complicated. The target of “responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels” is a target less about governments than about civil society and non-governmental institutions. SDG 16 is not just about the institutions of government — it is about the relationship of government to society as well.

It gets more complicated still. In addition to accountability, transparency and participation, SDG 16 also has a target of “effective” institutions at all levels. It is not clear what that means in the context of SDG 16, but it must have something to do with the results and targets for the other SDGs. For example, SDG 4, on quality education and its target of (to take just one) “equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university,” would require both massive investments and well-designed institutions.

Achieving most of the other SDGs will also depend on effective government institutions. For example, decent work and economic growth (SDG 8); innovation, industry and infrastructure (SDG 9); and climate action (SDG 13).

The SDGs, in short, are goals that can only be achieved through good and effective governance. SDG 16 makes that explicit, but it is embedded in most the other SDGs and their targets. This challenge of good governance is not just about warm and fuzzy slogans; it is about institutional design, about government capacity and about government-society relations.

Mixed Results

What progress has been made, and what are the pathways to success by 2030? For the MENA region, given the variety of situations and the intensity of conflict in many countries, the results are mixed. The “Sustainable Development Report 2019,” published by the UN-affiliated Sustainable Development Solutions Network, notes that “Conflicts in some countries lead to poor and declining performance on most of the SDGs and in particular on SDG 2 (No Hunger), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) and SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions).”

While access to clean water, sanitation and clean energy is generally high, the report calls for more efforts to deal with high levels of perceived corruption. It is cold comfort that Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa fare even worse on most SGDs in general, and SDG 16 especially.

The path forward on governance, for all countries and not just MENA, is not to try to do everything all at once. The year 2030 is only a decade away. If we think of the SDGs as 17 rail cars, what are the engines that will pull them into the station on time?

First, education. The results of a good educational system are educated citizens, who will in turn contribute to economic growth and to civil society development. Second, anti-corruption and rule of law. The lessons of recent uprisings and protests around the world are clear: Nothing ignites public outrage more than the injustice that comes with the rot of corruption. Third, build capacity in public institutions through training and high standards of competence and merit. The 2030 Agenda is only a decade away. Achieving SDG 16 is the key to success. We need to start now.

26,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/oecd-introduces-checklist-for-sub-national-action-on-sdg-implementation/,"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,OECD Introduces Checklist for Sub-National Action on SDG Implementation,"The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has released a synthesis report and a localized indicator framework to help cities and regions improve their SDG strategies, plans and implementation. The report argues that, beyond the compliance agenda, cities and regions should leverage the full potential of SDGs as a policy tool to improve people’s lives in a shared responsibility across levels of government.

The experiences of nine pilot cities and regions show the SDGs’ potential to reshape sustainable development policies from the ground up.

Released during the Tenth World Urban Forum (WUF), on 10 February 2020, the report titled, ‘A Territorial Approach to the SDGs: Synthesis Report,’ highlights the key role of subnational governments in achieving the SDGs and demonstrates the importance of the SDGs for cities and regions. The report argues that many OECD countries are increasingly seizing the potential of the SDGs as a framework to improve multi-level governance, and in particular vertical coordination. For instance, Germany and Japan are promoting the “localisation” of the SDGs from the central government level by supporting cities and regions in their local SDGs strategies, both financially and in terms of capacity building. The report also documents – from the experience and evidence of nine pilot cities and regions – the potential that the SDGs offer to reshape sustainable development policies from the ground up.

The report introduces a ‘Checklist for Public Action’ to help policymakers implement a territorial approach to the SDGs. The checklist presents action-oriented recommendations across five categories: planning, policies and strategies; multi-level governance; financing and budgeting; data and information; and engagement.

On planning, policies, and strategies, the checklist recommends defining and shaping local and regional development visions, strategies and plans and reorienting existing ones using the SDGs as a guiding framework; using the SDGs to manage tradeoffs and promote synergies among sectoral policies and across levels of government and link social, economic and environmental dimensions at the Goal or target level; using the SDGs to address concrete local challenges that require holistic approaches, such as access to green spaces, territorial inequalities or service delivery; and identifying place-based priorities through a participatory, multi-stakeholder process that considers the indivisibility and interconnectedness of the SDGs.

On engagement, the checklist suggests: using the SDGs as a vehicle to enhance accountability and transparency through engaging all territorial stakeholders in the policymaking process, including co-designing and co-implementing visions and strategies in a bottom-up, participatory way; engaging stakeholders using a combination of tools, such as providing networking opportunities, de-risking investments in SDG solutions through grants or loans; and using the SDGs as a tool for “public service motivation” by linking staff’s daily work with SDG achievement. Selected examples illustrate how cities and regions have implemented these recommendations.

The OECD Localised Indicator Framework for the SDGs measures the distance towards the SDGs for 601 regions and 649 cities, using 135 indicators across the 17 SDGs. At least 80% of regions from OECD countries have not achieved the suggested end values for 2030 in any of the 17 Goals. The average distance of OECD regions to the SDGs in 2030 ranges from 25% to 60%, showing that cities and regions in OECD countries are “far from achieving the SDGs.” Cities and regions are lagging behind the most on SDG 5 (gender equality) and SDG 13 (climate action), and are performing the best on SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions).

Cities and regions can use the tool to compare their performance with other cities and regions in their country and identify peers in other countries. The tool aims to promote peer-learning and policy dialogues across cities and regions, increase government accountability on the SDGs, and raise awareness on the SDGs among society as a whole. An overview of Tataouine, Tunisia, for example shows that the city is 50% of the way towards achieving SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), below the OECD average of 69%, and 48% percent of the way towards reaching SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), below the OECD average of 73%. The tool identifies Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand as a comparable city or region. The tool identifies Kinki, Japan, and Oslo and Akershus, Norway, as peer regions for New York, US.

OECD’s Programme on a Territorial Approach to the SDGs produced the report and indicator framework. The Programme plans to publish nine additional pilot-specific reports. Each report will offer in-depth analysis, tailored policy recommendations and action plans to champion a territorial approach to the SDGs.

OECD will launch a second phase of the Programme, which will work to implement recommendations and to support new cities, regions and countries in their efforts to localize the SDGs.

Voluntary national reviews (VNRs) are a component of the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda. They are carried out voluntarily by national governments, and are intended to track progress in implementing the Agenda and its SDGs at the country level. VNRs are presented during the annual HLPF sessions convened under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).

China, the Czech Republic, Germany, the Marshall Islands and Slovakia have signed up to conduct and present VNRs in 2021. It will be the Marshall Islands’ first time presenting a VNR, while the other countries have each presented a VNR previously.

China and Germany were among the first countries to present a VNR, during the 2016 HLPF. China later announced a national action plan and targets for each of the 17 SDGs. Germany’s report highlighted: taking all aspects of the SDGs into account and accounting for impact of actions beyond national borders; and strategies to reduce Germany’s ecological footprint, including national strategies for biodiversity and sustainable consumption.

Czech Republic reported in 2017, saying its VNR process had involved stakeholders to ensure factual accuracy and wider acceptance. In 2018, Slovakia highlighted the need to: anchor the SDGs in all public policies; engage in partnerships at all levels, from the regional to the municipal; align budgets with 2030 Agenda priorities; and encourage voluntary actions.

The 2021 VNRs will be the first to take place following the UN General Assembly’s review of the format and organization of the HLPF, which will address the VNRs alongside other elements. The review process is getting underway at UN headquarters in February 2020.

28,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/irp-report-proposes-governance-framework-for-extractives/,"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,IRP Report Proposes Governance Framework for Extractives,"The UN Environment Programme’s International Resource Panel (IRP) has called for the development of a ‘Sustainable Development License to Operate’ (SDLO), in its report on the governance of extractive industries. Governments have increased efforts to decouple their economies from resource use, but the demand for extractive resources is projected to continue to grow, especially in emerging economies.

As a basis for the proposed SDLO framework, the report titled, ‘Mineral Resource Governance in the 21st Century: Gearing Extractive Industries Towards Sustainable Development,’ maps over 80 existing international governance frameworks and initiatives that focus on delivering the SDGs. The authors lament, however, that the existing frameworks do not operate in a sufficiently coordinated or integrated manner.

Noting that extractive industries can cause extensive and lasting damage, the report critiques the current paradigm of “social license to operate” (SLO), which it notes arose as a response to business risk. The SLO paradigm aims to accommodate community demands to the minimum extent necessary to avoid public opposition and social conflict, and associated reputational damage, the authors write.

To move beyond SLO and consolidate existing instruments, the report sets out consensus-based principles, policy options and best practices that are compatible with the SDGs and other international policy commitments. It identifies eight SDGs in which the extractive sector, if well-managed, can play a positive role: Goals 1 (no poverty), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), 13 (climate action), 15 (life on land) and 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions).

Effective mineral resource governance incorporates human rights, responsible business practices, greater engagement of home countries, and economic decoupling.

UNEP emphasizes that the minerals and metals industry can promote social cohesion, inclusiveness and economic progress among low-income countries and vulnerable populations, but guidance is needed. The report elaborates that the SDLO model advocates for fairer deals, equal share of benefits among stakeholders and holistic consideration of regulations that are not inclusive on their own.

The proposed SDLO framework addresses large-scale mining and investigates artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM), in which some marginalized groups in certain geographies partake, though often without oversight by policymakers. The framework does so in part by extending responsibility to ensure implementation is shared by both “host” and “home” countries, and by expanding the scope to a broader swath of the extractive value chain. However, the authors caution that the SDLO is not a substitute for laws and regulations, and that extractive industries place large demands on natural resources such as land and water.

Prerequisites of an effective mineral resource governance framework, the report notes, include decoupling economic growth from environmental and social impacts, protecting human rights, establishing responsible business practices, and ensuring greater engagement of home countries. With respect to national and sub-national governance, the report recommends that countries establish three public institutions: an environment directorate, a mining directorate and a geological survey to regulate the mines and metals industries. The report also articulates the role and responsibility of host governments, which includes devising responsible concession agreements, mainstreaming environmental assessment, domesticating natural capital accounting, ensuring transparency and channeling extractive rents into public investment.

Internationally, the report advocates for the creation of an International Minerals Agency to improve coordination mechanisms, or at least settling on an international agreement to share data on economic geology, mineral demand and the industry’s impacts. It suggests that this agreement could be negotiated through existing for a such as the UN Environment Assembly, the Intergovernmental Forum on Mining, Minerals, Metals and Sustainable Development, and wider ongoing UN processes focused on reviewing progress towards the SDGs.

Launched on 23 January 2020 in Davos, Switzerland, during the World Economic Forum (WEF) by Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary-General and UN Global Compact Board Chair, the SDG Ambition initiative aims to establish a bolder and more strategic “new normal” for the business community. The initiative reflects the need for companies to increase their ambition to achieve the SDGs and to more fully integrate the Goals into their operations.

SDG Ambition seeks to empower and equip UN Global Compact partnership companies to develop and implement innovative business strategies that increase their positive impact on the SDGs. It aims to engage more than 1,000 companies across a range of industries in more than 40 countries. UN Global Compact Local Networks in more than 60 countries will lead the initiative’s implementation, through which participating companies will be able to assess performance, identify risks, and take the necessary actions to achieve the SDGs.

The initiative is undertaken in partnership with SAP and Accenture. SAP Co-CEO Jennifer Morgan explained that by bringing together respective areas of expertise, businesses can be empowered to use “technology for good” and accelerate realization of the SDGs.

A companion publication titled, ‘SDG Ambition – Scaling Business Impact for the Decade of Action,’ shares the Global Compact’s new SDG Implementation Framework, which seeks to guide companies to deepen integration of the SDGs and the Compact’s Ten Principles into business strategy, operations and stakeholder engagement.

The report explores key trends and offers recommendations for African and international stakeholders to create and support a sustainable and prosperous continent, while sustaining economic growth and broadening its benefits.

The report released on 8 January 2020 titled, ‘Foresight Africa’ – priorities for 2020-2030, in the context of SDGs and Agenda 2063,’ is a special decade-oriented edition of Brookings’ ‘Foresight Africa’ series of reports, commentaries and events.

The authors describe “shared energy and excitement around Africa’s potential” for improving the livelihoods of all under the SDGs and the African Union’s (AU) Agenda 2063. The report declares that “never before has the region been better primed for trade, investment and mutually beneficial partnerships.” Africa is home to seven of the world’s ten fastest-growing economies, and economic growth across Africa is expected to continue to outperform other regions through at least the first half of the decade. In addition, regional integration and the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA) is progressing, business environments are improving and transformational technologies are spreading.

Despite this potential, the report cautions that obstacles remain, from gaps in good and inclusive governance, a growing youth labor force and the need for job creation. In addition, the report observes, climate change has the potential to reverse the continent’s development gains, threatens food security and nutrition, and increases the risk of natural disasters.

The report offers strategies for African governments to build and sustain peace, end corruption, empower women, prepare young people for the jobs of the future, and invest in sectors that can grow and create jobs. The report suggests the global community can support efforts to strengthen institutions and promote good governance.

In sub-Saharan Africa, 18 out of 44 countries will get less than halfway to the SDG targets by 2030.

On the SDGs, the report finds that progress on implementing the SDGs has been uneven across countries, goals and targets. All sub-Saharan African countries are anticipated to make some progress towards the SDGs by 2030, but 18 out of 44 countries are predicted to get less than halfway to the targets by 2030. The region has made progress on several SDG 3 (good health and well-being) targets, including under-five mortality (SDG target 3.2), and the report suggests that Africa could meet this target with an intensified and accelerated response.

African countries are also likely to meet targets on primary school enrollment if current efforts are sustained, but progress has fallen on the net enrollment rate for lower secondary education (SDG target 4.1). Although the region’s countries have increased access to clean drinking water (SDG target 6.1) and access to electricity (SDG target 7.1), population growth and urbanization are anticipated to increase the need for infrastructure and services. Poverty (SDG 1) and hunger (SDG 2) remain challenges.

Per the report, reasons for hope include the strong alignment between Agenda 2063 and the SDGs, and that 90% of African countries have mainstreamed the SDGs into their national development plans.

The report concludes African countries must urgently implement the SDGs, especially because many challenges will become harder to contend with if not addressed now.

To ensure progress, the report recommends, inter alia: addressing data gaps, including to improve planning and decision-making; developing reporting and accountability mechanisms; identifying opportunities to scale up social inclusiveness; changing mindsets, rather than doing new things the old way; improving coordination among interventions and sectors; and increasing resource mobilization and financing for the SDGs.

In addition, 50 other countries are preparing their voluntary national reviews (VNRs).

In September 2019 the President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) informed governments that a high number of countries had expressed interested in presenting at the 2020 HLPF. She said the ECOSOC Bureau had decided to give priority to first- and second-time presenters, and countries that had already made two presentations were encouraged to wait until a later HLPF.

Since then, a few changes have taken place on the list. As of 18 February 2020:

Jordan and Monaco are no longer listed to present their second reports;

Barbados and Comoros have joined the list of first-time presenters;

Kenya is listed to give its second report, and

Benin has been added to the list as a third-time presenter.

Benin’s permanent representative to the UN is one of the co-facilitators for the intergovernmental reviews of ECOSOC and the HLPF.

The current list thus includes the following 28 first-time presenters and 22 second-time presenters, in addition to Benin’s third VNR:

First-time presenters: Austria, Barbados, Bolivia, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Burundi, Comoros, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gambia, Kyrgyz Republic, Liberia, Libya, Malawi, Micronesia, Mozambique, North Macedonia, Papua New Guinea, Moldova, Russia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Zambia; and

Second-timer presenters: Argentina, Armenia, Bangladesh, Belize, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Honduras, India, Kenya, Morocco, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, Samoa, Slovenia, Uganda and Zimbabwe.

Nine of the 2020 VNR countries are small island developing States (SIDS): Comoros and Seychelles (Atlantic, Indian Ocean and South China Sea (AIS) sub-region); Barbados, Belize, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago (Caribbean); and Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Solomon Islands (Pacific).

Countries presenting a VNR for the first time have a 30-minute slot in the HLPF programme, while countries presenting a second- or third-time VNR participate in a panel format and each have 20 minutes for their report.

Guidance for presenting countries is contained in the latest version of the VNR Q&A document and the updated voluntary common reporting guidelines.

To support countries’ preparations for the national reviews, the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) organized a two-day global workshop in November 2019 in Oslo, Norway, with support from the Government of Norway. Participants from 35 VNR countries exchanged views on progress and challenges encountered in conducting their VNRs. According to the summary, the workshop also featured a Knowledge Exchange during which UN agencies, international organizations and other stakeholders presented tools and approaches that could support VNR countries in their preparatory process, with a focus on five topics: leaving no one behind; data, monitoring and evaluation; stakeholder engagement; integration and strengthening institutions; and means of implementation.

Ahead of the 2021 HLPF session, six countries have signaled their intention to present a VNR, with Bhutan recently joining five other countries who have volunteered to prepare national reviews.","In addition, 50 other countries are preparing their voluntary national reviews (VNRs).

32,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/guide-applies-sdg-monitoring-and-evaluation-to-national-contexts/,"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Guide Applies SDG Monitoring and Evaluation to National Contexts,"The International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), the EVALSDGs network, Finland’s Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) have released a guide to designing SDG evaluation frameworks around existing national contexts. The authors apply their proposed process to the national contexts of Costa Rica, Finland, and Nigeria to illustrate ways to incorporate SDG evaluation throughout the policy planning cycle.

Launched in New York, US on 4 February 2020, the guide titled, ‘Evaluation to Connect National Priorities with the SDGs,’ argues that a “one-size-fits-all manual” cannot be successful in evaluating success on the SDGs at the national level. The publication reports that a common thread from input provided by 33 government representatives and evaluation specialists from 22 countries is that, if evaluation is to assist in aligning national policy with the 2030 Agenda, it must be bespoke, built around existing political and assessment systems.

SDG evaluation can only make a difference if it is integrated into what countries are already doing. The guide thus outlines four steps of evaluation development and design. They include:

Identify the overall objective and use of the evaluation, by consulting and engaging with different stakeholder groups (e.g. civil society organizations, parliamentarians);

Prepare for the evaluation by designing participatory processes, defining the scope and focus of the evaluation, and identifying the policies and plans to be evaluated;

Use 2030 Agenda principles (e.g. universality, equity, leave no one behind) to inform the evaluative criteria, and use the principles to develop the evaluation questions; and

Frame the evaluation according to the logic of national policies, develop and cost a communication plan.

SDG evaluation can only make a difference if it is integrated into what countries are already doing.

The guide offers indicative questions, suggested criteria and decision trees to help practitioners develop robust SDG evaluation plans tailored to their national contexts. Lessons from case studies in Costa Rica, Finland and Nigeria are applied to each of the above steps, demonstrating how the SDG evaluation can be integrated throughout the policy cycle.

The guide also highlights the ways in which SDG monitoring and evaluation (M&E) processes and results can support national progress on sustainable development, and be integrated into national M&E systems. Early national experiences show that governments can use evaluative tools in: identifying issues that affect sustainable development trajectories and for formulating and adopting policies around those issues; establishing responsibilities to coordinate actions and allocate resources during policy implementation; and assessing the policies’ worth in the context of the SDGs and national priorities, to support optimal outcomes in line with key principles.

The guide also highlights methodological considerations to take into account when developing an SDG evaluation. Attributes of sustainable development evaluation include: robust stakeholder engagement—which should occur throughout the four steps—and co-generation of recommendations; mixed approaches to gathering evidence, including both quantitative and qualitative sources; integrative analysis, which reviews policies or programs from economic, social and environmental perspectives; assessing sustainable development interventions in current their spatial, temporal, socioeconomic and environmental contexts; and recognizing both upstream drivers and downstream effects, as well as impacts beyond national boundaries and across borders.

Acknowledging that there is no single way to monitor and evaluate progress against the Goals, and flagging disparities between countries in terms of their evaluation infrastructure and readiness, the authors emphasize that SDG evaluation can only make a difference if it is integrated into what countries are already doing. The SDGs are not meant to impose an additional layer of policies on top of current ones, but rather to serve as “a compass for aligning countries’ plans with their global commitments.”

The guide also outlines how SDG evaluation can inform countries’ Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) presented during the annual sessions of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

The publication was inspired by a workshop on ‘Evaluation to Connect National Priorities with the SDGs’, which convened in Helsinki, Finland, in March 2019 to foster cross-country learning and understanding on common challenges.

33,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/can-environmental-negotiations-regain-momentum-in-2020/,"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Can Environmental Negotiations Regain Momentum in 2020?,"2020 has a ring to it, holding the promise of a new decade after leaving the old one behind. Each year starts with the possibility of a new beginning, but often still carries the baggage of the previous year. As 2020 begins, the international community faces deadlines to replace old frameworks and rules with new ones, and to conclude negotiations on new treaties and agreements.

It is timely to take stock of global environmental governance as the world enters a new year and a new decade. In our new report, ‘The State of Global Environmental Governance 2019,’ the Earth Negotiations Bulletin team reflects on the successes, shortcomings and overall trends of 2019. We also look ahead, with optimism 2020 will regain the momentum recently lost.

In 2019, scientists were truth-tellers. Over the course of the year, international scientific bodies produced a range of reports on climate change, biodiversity, and the environment as a whole. Each report contains dire warnings for the future of the planet due to the impact of climate change on food production, of pollution on human health, and land incursions on species extinctions. Given historic inaction, nearly every system on the planet is in danger.

Yet, despite the thousands of pages of scientific evidence, intergovernmental political processes remain deadlocked on so many issues. Policy makers could not mount the type of response commensurate with the science.

Climate change governance had a particularly difficult year, limping to the end of the decade after the historic adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015. The demands for climate ambition are loud, and angry. Millions of children and youth, feeling their futures have been stolen, participated in climate strikes every Friday throughout the year. Hearing their calls, 67 countries pledged greater climate ambition at the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit in September, but these countries represent only a small fraction of global emissions. As the year came to a close, governments at the UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid (COP 25) failed to issue a clear call for ambition and could not agree on rules for the market mechanism necessary to complete the Paris Agreement rulebook. The Paris Agreement officially begins in 2020 amid major questions about its ability to catalyze climate ambition and prevent global warming above 2°C.

There were a few bright spots during the year as some policymakers acted on the scientific truths. The first multilateral action to reduce global plastic waste, which amounts to millions of tons each year, was taken under the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movement of Certain Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal. In May, parties to the Basel Convention agreed to include mixed, unrecyclable, and contaminated plastic waste exports into the control regime that requires the consent of importing countries before waste exports can proceed. The fourth meeting of the UN Environment Assembly sent a strong signal that production and consumption of single-use plastics should be reduced or phased out, and the plastics industry has been put on notice. In fact, over the course of the year more than 30 countries around the world, nearly half of which are in Africa, put in place bans on single-use plastic bags.

As we outline in a chapter on linkages, 2019 was also notable for increasing recognition of the need for a more interconnected form of governance. More and more, actors drew linkages among environmental and sustainable development processes, especially biodiversity and climate change, land and climate change, oceans and climate change, human health and the environment, and economics, trade and climate change. The increased understanding about the impacts of degrading ecosystems and a warming climate on local and global economies alike, has led to a number of multinational companies and financial institutions announcing new climate-friendly policies and investments.

Of course, the links among the SDGs and multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) are many and complementary. The 2019 Sustainable Development Goals Report was released in time for the SDG Summit in September. The report outlined progress in some critical areas, including declines in extreme poverty and the under-5 mortality rate, increases in access to electricity, and greater efforts to respond to urbanization, waste, and illegal fishing. Nonetheless, many areas need urgent collective attention, including climate change, ocean acidification, land degradation, hunger, education and gender equality. The report also stressed that the goal to end extreme poverty by 2030 is jeopardized as the world struggles to respond to entrenched deprivation, violent conflicts, and vulnerabilities to natural disasters.

It is abundantly clear the world needs an urgent, ambitious response to unleash a social and economic transformation. But, in 2019, world leaders appeared detached from the crisis at hand, reading statements that were largely devoid of meaningful pledges. This reaction was in stark contrast to the verdict of the people who rose in protest during the Summit and throughout the year: leaders are failing to address the environmental and development emergency the world faces.

This year, we face a busy international agenda as well as waning political will, rising nationalism, and faltering support for multilateralism. 2020 is expected to conclude negotiations and establish new tools to address biodiversity, marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, and a post-2020 strategic approach to international chemicals management. We are already in the fifth year of SDG implementation, and to succeed by their 2030 completion date, governments still need to increase their ambition under the Paris Agreement.

Positive, forward-looking outcomes are essential, but not guaranteed.

Acknowledging achievements: What are the UN’s main contributions to its three pillars of work – development, human rights, and peace and security?

Looking ahead: What measures are needed over the next 25 years to strengthen multilateralism and reinvigorate global governance?

Responding to major global challenges: What are today’s most fundamental global challenges? How is the UN standing up to new challenges?

Delivering on commitments: How can the UN better deliver on its purposes and principles?

Building consensus and mobilizing for change: How can the Decade of Action advance implementation of the 2030 Agenda and leave no one behind? How can the UN maximize its use of resources and partner with diverse actors? How can the UN strengthen the rights, empowerment and participation of women and youth?

The first informal consultation will convene on 21 February 2020 at UN Headquarters in New York, US. The meeting will be open to Member States and permanent observers.

Addressing delegations at the start of the meeting on 21 February 2020, Eneström noted divergent views on some of the topics to be addressed, and said the co-facilitators will “hold the pen” in drafting the resolution, using input from delegations. Al-Thani said the co-facilitators will speak with all interested parties and stakeholders.

This organization has enough documents; it is time to deliver on our commitments.

On the tone and function of the document, UN General Assembly (UNGA) President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande said the resolution must resonate with citizens around the world. Eneström said the declaration should: be written in the voice of the heads of state and government that will assemble in September; contain a focused political message; be understandable and inspire action from all stakeholders; speak to youth and others while also being phrased “at a high level,” and give a sense of achievement while inspiring accelerated action.

Governments then offered their views. A few suggested including sections on the UN’s three pillars – development, peace and security, and human rights – as well as references to strengthening, reforming and modernizing the UN. Many said the declaration should reinforce urgency and commitment related to the 2030 Agenda and the Decade of Action. The discussion indicated broad support for reaffirming the principles of multilateralism and the value of a rules-based international system founded on the UN Charter and international law. The “functional nature” of multilateral cooperation should be highlighted, said one government, in order to address the many issues that transcend national borders.

Member States responded to the food-for-thought paper provided by the co-facilitators before the meeting, which suggested that the declaration address five areas: acknowledging achievements; looking ahead; responding to major global challenges; delivering on commitments; and building consensus and mobilizing for change.

On acknowledging achievements, one delegation said the paradigm of the UN has been changed to put the 2030 Agenda at the heart of its work. Governments also highlighted that the UN has: contributed to a strong body of international law, which should be universalized; provided a common covenant on preserving the rights of future generations; prevented further world wars; improved living standards; and achieved the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

On looking ahead, delegations called for genuine reflection on strengthening global governance and multilateralism, for aligning the UN’s intergovernmental bodies with the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs, and for transforming the UN’s values into people’s lived experiences. One government said a better balance must be reached between the peace and security dimension and the development dimension of the UN’s work, noting that all available energy and resources seem to be activated for peace and security issues, but when it comes to development, “everything is just voluntary.”

Some delegations highlighted the importance of the sovereign equality of states, with one saying that “in reality, not all States are created equal, but large or small, all have an equal right to be heard here at the UN, and all have rights and obligations.” Others emphasized the communications role of the UN, noting the need for “a UN that listens to people and can communicate more clearly.” One highlighted the SDGs as a communications asset.

On responding to global challenges, some echoed UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ assessment of challenges and threats set out in January 2020. He had identified as “four horsemen” that endanger progress: geopolitical tensions, the climate crisis, global mistrust and the downsides of technology. Building on these ideas, governments said the world needs a stronger UN than ever before, and highlighted: non-traditional security threats; inequalities within countries; artificial intelligence; xenophobia, hate speech, and migrant rights violations; climate change and pollution, the importance of a successful UNFCCC COP 26 to address the “increasingly existential” threat of the climate and environment crisis, and the need for the UN to mobilize means to address both mitigation and adaptation;

On ways for the UN to better deliver on its purposes and principles, one delegate said that “turning 75 usually means retirement,” but for the UN it must be a time of rejuvenation and reform. Speakers stressed that the UN must modernize in order to not lose confidence of people, and it must adapt to the challenges of the 21st century to remain the primary forum for multilateral cooperation.

Governments highlighted the need for reforms to the UNGA, the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and the UN’s peacebuilding architecture. They emphasized in particular the need for the Security Council to become more representative, but also for reforms to limit the use of the veto, such as in situations of mass atrocities.

Delivering on specific commitments and frameworks from the UN was also a priority for many speakers, with one saying that “this organization has enough documents”; the most important priority now is to deliver on commitments that have already been made. Delegations highlighted the 2030 Agenda and support for small island developing States (SIDS) as particular priorities: “to remain relevant, the UN must be the driving force and catalyst for sustainable development in all countries, especially the poorest and most vulnerable.”

On building consensus and mobilizing for change, the co-facilitators had asked for input on how the Decade of Action can advance implementation of the 2030 Agenda and leave no one behind, as well as how the UN can maximize its use of resources and partner with diverse actors, and how it can strengthen the rights, empowerment and participation of women and youth? Many highlighted the importance of engaging women, girls and all youth, with one noting that events in 2020 make it a particularly important year for women and girls. One delegation said developing countries need funding, especially from the private sector, to pursue the Decade of Action and empower women and youth. Another said “hearing all voices is not enough; we must also act on them.” She called for marginalized groups to have a place at the table to make decisions and take actions with governments and the UN.

On the challenges of reaching agreement on the declaration, delegates suggested that the process “focus on what unites us and avoid what divides us,” noting that this declaration cannot resolve all unfinished business from the last 75 years. Instead it should highlight areas of convergence, so the declaration and the anniversary commemoration can unite rather than polarize the membership.

Going forward, the co-facilitators will prepare an elements paper for the declaration. They plan to convene a meeting to discuss the elements in early April 2020. They said the UN Special Adviser on the Preparations for the Commemoration of the 75th Anniversary, Fabrizio Hochschild, will be invited to that meeting to provide updates on preparations for the anniversary and the related global consultation process.

The commemoration event will take place on 21 September 2020, at UN headquarters in New York, US. [IISD Sources]","UN Member States held their first informal consultations on a declaration to mark the 75th anniversary of the UN.

36,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/role-of-libraries-in-sdg-implementation-1580916443,"Wed, 05 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",The Financial Express BD,Role of libraries in SDG implementation,"Bangladesh observed national library day on Wednesday (February 05). As the library remains unrestricted for all to provide any relevant services, including reading, access to information and research, it is termed a 'University for Public'. Library is basically a living apparatus which preserves all the information of the past for the use of the present generation and that creates link between the past and present generation for the utilisation of information for its future generation.

The United Nations (UN) held a meeting in New York at the end of September 2019 for adoption of the 2030 Agenda with a total of 169 targets spanning economic, environmental and social development. The global body outlined a plan for all countries to actively work for making the world better for peoples, without anyone left behind.

Libraries are essential platforms for achieving such objectives. Over the last few years, International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) has been actively involved in formulation of the UN 2030 Agenda, promoting inclusion of access to information, safeguarding of cultural heritage, disaster risk reduction through climate literacy, universal literacy and access to ICT (information and communications) in the system. IFLA is the leading international body representing the interests of people who rely on libraries and information professionals.

Access to information was recognised as a priority in SDG 16 (target 16.10): ensuring public access to information and safeguarding fundamental freedoms in compliance with national legislation and international agreements.

Culture (target 11.4), climate literacy (SDG-13) and ICT (targets 5b, 9c, 17.8) have also been included in the SDGs. And, universal literacy is recognised in the vision for the UN 2030 Agenda.

Libraries all over the world are reliable organisations with access to information that is necessary to drive economic opportunity and community development. In many places, a library is the only place where people have access to information that will help better education, develop new skills, find jobs, build businesses, make informed farming and health decisions, or gain insights into environmental issues.

The UN SDGs are now common goals and each country will be responsible for developing and implementing national policies to achieve them, and it is expected that it will track and report its own progress towards each goal.

HOW TO GET INVOLVED: In Bangladesh, libraries now need to demonstrate that they can accelerate change across the whole range of 2030 Agenda. Everyone within and beyond the library community can help foster the role of libraries as development supporters.

IFLA suggests that it is now vital to negotiate with government decision-makers to ensure awareness of the role of libraries as development engines, and to ensure that libraries obtain the funding needed to continue this work. Increasing visibility inside and beyond the library community by arranging events, use of the social media, websites for updating library technology and services, forums, and mailing the users are useful to demonstrate contribution of libraries to helping the country's growth.

Library associations and members should be involved in advocacy work at national and regional levels to ensure reliable public access to information through library services and programmes.

SDG FRAMEWORK: Very recently, as part of the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, some 20 library members, along with other guests, gathered at the Australian Library Association (ALIA) House in Canberra to discuss goals for Australian libraries. They developed 17 SDG goals and 169 SDG targets and are divided into three sections: Priorities for Australian library services, contribution to society and Global citizenship through the prism of the people who attended the roundtable. In every section there are multiple subsections which reflect targets, explanation, role of actors to achieve the targets, indicators, measures taken by leading institutions and timeframe to achieve the goals.

Australian copyright legislation supports open access; equitable access; culture and heritage; literacy and lifelong learning.

It is unfortunate that the library associations in Bangladesh are not yet members of IFLA. It's time to be actively engaged with libraries and library associations internationally.

37,https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/economics/news/implementing-sdg-6-watering-the-seeds-development-1872979,"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",The Daily Star,Implementing SDG 6: Watering the seeds of development,"Nothing is more useful than water. Ironically, hardly anything can be obtained in exchange for water. On the other hand, diamonds have little use, but a large amount of other goods and services may be obtained in exchange for diamonds. This apparent contradiction, known as the ""Diamond-Water Paradox"", was discussed by Adam Smith in his magnum opus titled ""An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations"". Smith stumbled upon the Diamond-Water Paradox whilst attempting to formulate his theory of value. He decomposed the word ""value"" into two parts: ""value in use"" and ""value in exchange"". Water has a high value in use, but a low value in exchange; diamonds have a low value in use, but a high value in exchange. Carl Menger and William Stanley Jevons later showed that value in exchange, or market price, depends not on the total usefulness of a commodity, but rather on its additional usefulness. The total usefulness of water is greater than that of diamonds. However, the usefulness of each additional glass of water is less than the usefulness of each additional diamond. This is because we consume so many glasses of water that each additional glass does not seem to matter much to us. On the other hand, we do not purchase as many diamonds, and so each additional diamond means a lot to us.

Although the Diamond-Water Paradox has been largely resolved, there are serious implications of a beautiful rock being more expensive than an indispensable liquid. This is because market price affects our perception of relative importance, and our perception of relative importance ultimately influences what we save and what we squander. Thus, diamonds are highly prized in society, but water is often wasted. While it may be common to exchange diamond rings during marriage, an exchange of glasses of water for the same purpose would be utterly inconceivable. We tend to feel at ease exchanging ornamental diamonds while allowing life-giving water to go down the drain.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) acknowledge the importance of water in human development. SDG 6 calls upon countries to ""ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all"" by 2030. Access to ""at least basic drinking water"" refers to the availability of drinking water from sources such as piped water, boreholes or tube-wells, protected dug-wells, protected springs, and packaged or delivered water, whose collection time, including queueing, does not exceed 30 minutes for a round trip. The percentage of the population using at least basic drinking water services in Bangladesh increased from 95.60 percent in 2005 to 97.32 percent in 2015. Unfortunately, there was almost no improvement in access to safely managed drinking water, over the same period of time.

Apart from access to drinking water, SDG 6 also emphasises the importance of sanitation. SDG target 6.2 aims to achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all by 2030. Access to ""at least basic sanitation"" refers to the availability of sanitation facilities such as flush or pour flush to piped sewer systems, septic tanks or pit latrines, ventilated improved pit latrines, and compositing toilets or pit latrines with slabs, which are not shared with other households. According to data from the global database of the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene, the proportion of the total population in Bangladesh with access to basic sanitation services increased from 25.3 percent in 2000 to 46.9 percent in 2015. Additionally, the gap between rural and urban sanitation access also narrowed over the years. For example, in 2000, rural areas had 20.16 percent less access to basic sanitation compared to urban areas, but in 2015 this difference was reduced to 10.26 percent. In terms of geographic differences, Chattogram division had the highest and Barishal division had the lowest access to basic sanitation in 2015. Improvement in access to basic sanitation means that open defecation has been virtually eliminated from Bangladesh, even from rural areas. In 2005, the percentage of the population practicing open defecation was 11.91 percent nationally and 14.96 percent in rural areas. However, by 2015, the percentage of the population practicing open defecation fell to 0.10 percent nationally and 0.16 percent in rural areas.

Despite the progress made in improving access to water and sanitation in Bangladesh, a number of key challenges still remain. These include, inter alia, widespread inefficient use of water, lack of sustainable management of surface and ground water, low wastewater treatment, high levels of water pollution and poor quality of water. Additionally, lack of drinking water and sanitation facilities are reducing the efficacy of education and healthcare services where they are needed the most. Furthermore, inequalities are present in access to water and sanitation between urban and rural areas, as well as between slums and formal urban settlements. The existing pricing scheme used by the Dhaka Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA) is based on a single water meter for an entire building, and so does not create incentives for economical use of water by individual households. The poorest households in the capital city have limited access to water, and are often compelled to obtain water from illegal water vendors at exorbitantly high prices. In order to achieve SDG 6 by 2030, these challenges need to be tackled urgently by adopting sustainable integrated water management practices that consider both current and future needs of water and sanitation.

38,https://www.newtimes.co.rw/opinions/beyond-policy-and-public-investment-sdg-imperative-business,"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",The New Times,Beyond policy and public investment: the SDG imperative for business,"There is only one road left to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set for Africa for 2030 and that’s through sustainable businesses. For the sluggish progress to date has been primarily a consequence of ‘putting all our eggs in one basket’ and expecting the state to deliver the SDGs, which it cannot.

A prime obstacle in that is finance. The SDG Center for Africa estimates the financing gap to achieve the SDGs is running at between $500bn and $1.2tn a year. That is simply beyond the reach of the public sector, with the Center estimating that delivering basic state functions of health care, education, water, energy, and road infrastructure requires more than 50 per cent of the GDP of most African countries.

However, for the private sector, pursuing the 2030 goals of eradicating Africa’s hunger, poverty, and inequality and improving healthcare will deliver its own rewards, creating business opportunities worth more than a trillion dollars a year, according to United Nation estimates.

In the absence of that private sector mobilisation, progress remains achingly slow.

The 2019 Sustainable Development Goal Three-Year Reality Checker Report found only five countries in Africa - Seychelles, Mauritius, Morocco, Egypt and Algeria - that had met the SDG target of three per cent poverty by 2015.

Yet the problem is substantially one of mindset. For, while achieving the right policies and public investment is necessary for delivering the SDGs, we need to abandon the idea that it is enough and focus more rigorously on developing SDG aligned businesses.

It is not viable to expect nation-states to achieve a tax take, or a debt load, of 50 per cent of GDP to deliver basic services when the continent is home to a vast informal sector that contributes no government revenue at all. That ‘basic needs’ bill is just unmeetable without a leap forward in business and GDP growth.

And just as public sector SDG success depends on private sector take-off, so too does the private sector’s success.

Investing in SDG-focused businesses, calculates the UN, would create over 85 million jobs in Africa by 2030, which would, in turn, create new consumers and new markets.

Indeed, even relatively small investments in SDG-focused businesses can produce huge returns. For instance, investing in agriculture technology to reduce food waste could generate $57bn a year in additional revenues, based on evidence from Rwanda, where small metal silos or plastic crates have reduced post-harvest losses by over 60 per cent and increased smallholder farmers’ incomes by more than 30 per cent.

If private businesses collaborate with local governments to provide larger infrastructures, such as ports, oil and gas extractives, power plants and automotive, shared revenue of over $296bn could be generated and nearly 16 million jobs, according to the UN’s estimates. There could be further benefits too from using local materials for such works.

Likewise, providing affordable housing, clean water and sanitation, infrastructure and energy solutions, such as solar lanterns and improved cooking stoves to urban dwellers, has a potential revenue value of $214bn a year and could create over 32 million jobs.

Such growth is typical for businesses focused on achieving SDGs. Indeed, research conducted by the Business and Sustainable Development Commission (BSDC) shows that business that is focused on SDG areas also achieves more value locally.

For instance, reports the BSDC, 71 per cent of the value of food and agriculture businesses is retained in developing countries, 60 per cent of health and wellness businesses, 54 per cent of energy and materials, and 54 per cent of the value of upgrading and developing new cities.

Overall, business models that are directed towards achieving Africa’s SDGs have proven to work to the benefit of both consumers and businesses, which is why thy lie at the heart of all we are doing at Intellecap and at next week’s 7th Sankalp Summit for entrepreneurs in Nairobi.

Our initiatives to support private sector SDG initiatives include research, partnerships and projects spanning ideal adaptive technologies, such as rural solar mini-grids; private sector capacity building among communities displaced by projects such as the Olkaria geothermal plant; and assisting small producers into value addition and niche markets, in tea, in bamboo, and multiple other high potential areas.

We have no doubt that without recalibration of our private sector SDG efforts, the 2030 goals for Africa will go unmet, whereas if we now see and seize this opportunity, no African will be left untouched by the benefits borne of SDG-focused entrepreneurs.

The shopkeeper’s intention is to have his son married to a girl who would be meek and gentle and would do all the household chores. But the young girl is not ready for marriage at such an early age and wants to complete her education first. She has learned, moreover, that early marriages result in complicated pregnancies and even death. So, with the help of her cousin Meena, Rita musters up the courage to tell her father that she is not ready to get married; and fortunately for her, the suitor too had told his father that he will not marry a minor girl and as a result, the marriage is postponed.

Despite being a fictional character, Meena was an ambassador of social and cultural change, particularly on issues pertinent to gender. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5, “achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls”, embodies the spirit of Meena’s advocacy. SDG target 5.3 calls upon countries to eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage. Unfortunately, forced early marriage is still widespread in Bangladesh—although there has been a declining trend. The percentage of women in Bangladesh between ages 20 to 24 years old who were first married by the age of 18 years old decreased from 73.3 percent in 1994 to 58.6 percent in 2014. Similarly, the percentage of women between ages 20 to 24 years old who were first married by the age of 15 years old decreased from 47.2 percent in 1994 to 22.4 percent in 2014. Despite the improvement, these numbers are nonetheless unacceptably high. When women are married off at such early ages, it substantially compromises their ability to pursue their education and participate in the labour market.

Apart from early marriage, empowerment of women in Bangladesh has also been stifled through violence. SDG target 5.2 asserts the need to eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres. However, in 2015, as high as 55 percent of women who were ever-married and 65 percent of women who were currently married reported suffering from violence inflicted by their partners, according to data from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS). Regrettably, a large number of incidents of violence against women remained unreported. In 2015, an estimated 72.7 percent of ever-married women in Bangladesh did not disclose their experiences of violence to anyone. This means that the prevalence of violence against women may be far worse than illustrated by the findings of the official surveys. In fact, according to Ain O Salish Kendra (ASK), a legal aid and human rights organisation, 409 women were victims of domestic violence, 116 women were victims of sexual harassment,195 women were victims of physical torture for dowry and 22 women were victims of acid attack in 2018.

Gender inequality is a pervasive phenomenon which has proliferated from households to markets to governance systems and to all other spheres of society. This means that the myriad miseries of life, such as poverty, physical violence, sexual abuse, illiteracy, unemployment, employment with low wages, landlessness, vulnerability to climate change and burden of unpaid household work—all tend to affect women disproportionately more than men. Thus, it is imperative to identify the root causes of gender inequality, and consequently make the relevant changes in laws, institutions and policies that will create equal opportunities for men and women.

Concurrently, the economic empowerment of women through education and employment must be ensured. The right to education should not be violated on the basis of gender, and girls at all ages should be guaranteed access to quality education and lifelong learning opportunities within secure and supportive environments. The unpaid household work of women should be eased by improving access to clean drinking water and natural gas for cooking. In order to support working women, legislation on equal pay and maternity benefits should be properly enforced, and child care centres should be established. Ultimately, the success of these measures will depend on whether the overall attitudes, values and perceptions towards women are consistent with, and conducive towards, the goal of achieving gender equality. Unless the required behavioural changes can be achieved, it will be difficult to accomplish SDG 5 by 2030.

Organized by NITI Aayog in partnership with the North Eastern Council, Govt. of Assam, and Tata Trust, the conclave is supported by UNDP and RIS.

The inaugural session of the conclave started with an address from Amitabh Kant, CEO of NITI Aayog, followed by welcome remarks from Himanta Biswa Sarma, Minister, Finance, Transformation & Development, Education & Health, Government of Assam. Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog set the context for the Conclave, followed by Renata Lok-Dessallien, UN Resident Coordinator, India.

The three-day event, from 24 to 26 February, hinged on the premise of ‘Partnership, Cooperation and Development of North East States’, will see representation from the highest offices of all the State Governments of the north east, Central ministries, civil society organizations, academia, international development organizations and think tanks active in the north eastern region.

“India, especially the northeast region, offers unique challenges & opportunities. The solutions need interventions that bring disruptive change and, thus, fostering a tech-embedded development trajectory is of paramount importance,” said NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant.

Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog, Rajiv Kumar, focused on the need for mainstreaming the northeastern region in the national development agenda and identification of state specific and region specific priorities as key to SDG localisation.

“Several north eastern states rank on the top of NITI Aayog’s SDG India Index and the region is India’s bridge to South East Asia, and this presents immense opportunity for trade & commerce,” said Renata Lok-Dessallien, UN Resident Coordinator, India.

Chief Ministers of North Eastern states also addressed the inaugural session of the SDG Conclave. “In the coming days, we will partner will NITI Aayog for strengthening our resolve for SDGs. We have identified 145 state indicators linked to the CM dashboard, which has been monitoring the State’s progress for the last 2 years,” said Pema Khandu, CM of Arunachal Pradesh.

“With the financial help from the Central Government, as well as monitoring the progress made by north eastern states of India, I believe the SDGs can certainly be achieved,” said Chief Minister of Mizoram, Zoramthanga.

“Through SDG Conclave 2020, we now have a regional space to learn from each other and from the rest of India. Sustainability is important for Himalayan states like Sikkim and how we harness our natural resources,” said Prem Singh Tamang, CM of Sikkim.

Chief Minister of Tripura, Biplab Kumar Deb, presented a goal wise analysis of Tripura’s progress towards achieving the ambitious Agenda 2030 by linking existing schemes and programmes.

“Guwahati will play a crucial role as it is India’s gateway to Southeast Asia. Together, with NITI Aayog’s support, we will continue our journey in ensuring the prosperity of the region and its people,” put forth Sarbananda Sonowal, Chief Minister of Assam.

In his keynote address, Union Minister of State (MoS), Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), Jitendra Singh, said, “When India becomes a $5 trillion economy, the north east will be an essential component”.

Another key highlight was the release of reports on challenges, prospects, and SDG best practices. The four reports released were: Compendium of State Indicator Frameworks of 8 North Eastern States; North East and SDGs by RIS and Tata Trusts; Stories of Change by Tata Trusts; and Best Practices Portfolio on North East by UNDP.

The inaugural session on the first day will be followed by technical sessions on 25 and 26 Feb. These sessions will include discussions pertaining to SDGs in the North Eastern Region: Pathways for Localisation and Achievement; Drivers of Economic Prosperity & Sustainable Livelihoods; Climate Adaptive Agriculture; Nutrition Security & Health and Wellbeing for All; Education, Skill Development and Entrepreneurship; Communication, Connectivity and Infrastructure Development; Addressing Inequality and Exclusion in the North East and the Way Forward and Valedictory.

NITI Aayog has the mandate of overseeing the adoption and monitoring of SDGs at the national and sub-national level. Progress in the northeast region is crucial in this decade of action for the country to achieve the SDGs by 2030 and this conclave is part of NITI Aayog’s continuous efforts towards fostering partnerships at the sub-national level. In terms of SDG localisation, the states in the region have taken major strides in integrating the Agenda 2030.

It ranks last, however, on progress towards the environment-focused Goals. The assessment was conducted by Social Justice Ireland, for the fourth year in a row.



The report titled, ‘Measuring Progress: Sustainable Progress Index 2020,’ finds that Ireland ranks tenth among the 15 EU peers, one step up from its 2019 performance. Overall, the report concludes Ireland requires a “joined-up thinking approach” to address the complexities of sustainable development and achieve the environment-focused SDGs and the 2030 Agenda as a whole. The authors call for keeping the SDGs at the top of Ireland’s agenda to help policymakers pursue sustainable development.

On environment, the report finds Ireland is lagging behind its EU peers and “facing significant challenges.” Its rankings are as follows:

Ireland ranks 13th on SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and (climate action), with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions “well above the EU average”;

Ireland ranks 11th on SDG 7 (clean and affordable energy), and 11th out of 13 for SDG 14 (life below water); the country is “struggling to achieve its sustainable objectives” on SDG 14;

Ireland ranks ninth on SDG 15 (life on land), as it is doing well on its share of protected terrestrial and freshwater areas but finding its share of land dedicated for forestry use well below the EU average; and

Ireland ranks eighth on SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

On “society,” Ireland ranks seventh overall. On SDG 1 (no poverty), Ireland is in ninth place. On SDG 2 (zero hunger), Ireland also ranks ninth and faces obesity-related challenges, with over 25% of its population categorized as obese. Additional SDG 2 concerns relate to ensuring the sustainability and long-term productivity of agriculture and the country’s share of organic farming. On SDG 3 (good health and well-being), Ireland ranks seventh.

Ireland has the highest share of the population aged 30-34 that has completed tertiary education.

Ireland’s best performance is on SDG 4, where Ireland is ranked second and has the highest share of the population aged 30 to 34 that has completed tertiary or equivalent education, at 56.3%. The country performs well on reading, math, and science, and has the second-lowest number of students dropping out of education.

On SDG 5 (gender equality), the report finds that Ireland’s performance is mixed and “much more” needs to be done to accelerate the country’s progress. Ireland places in the middle for the gender pay gap and gender employment gap, and well below average on the share of women in senior management roles and in national parliament. In contrast, women are ahead of men in education.

Ireland ranks ninth on SDG 10 (reduced inequalities). On SDG 16, Ireland is ranked fifth. The country’s institutions are considered transparent, effective, and accountable, and Ireland is considered a relatively safe society with a low perceived occurrence of crime, violence, and vandalism. On SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals), Ireland ranks eighth, but the report cautions that better and more reliable quality data are needed.

On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), Ireland ranks eighth out of the 15 EU countries, with high scores on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and unemployment. Ireland faces challenges in progress on the proportion of youths not in employment, education, or training (NEET), average wages, and accidents at work. On SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), Ireland ranks 11th overall, and ranks the lowest for its expenditure on research and development. The report concludes there is “significant room for progress” on economic-related SDGs.

The report concludes with a series of SDG-specific policy proposals to accelerate SDG progress at the national and local levels.

The region is struggling the most on SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 13 (climate action).The report titled, ‘Asia and Pacific SDG Progress Report 2020,’ assesses the region’s progress towards the 17 Goals. A major finding is that the region is degrading and depleting its environmental resources. On SDG 13, the region emits half of the world’s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and its emissions have doubled since 2000. On SDG 15 (life on land), 35% of countries in the region have continued deforestation trends. In addition, progress has been slow on SDG 5 (gender equality) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

Conditions in 2030 will be worse on 20% of the SDG indicators without immediate actions to reverse the current trends.

The report predicts that the Asia-Pacific region is unlikely to meet any of the SDGs without concerted efforts from all stakeholders. In addition, conditions in 2030 are predicted to be worse on 20% of SDG indicators than they were in 2015 “unless immediate actions are taken to reverse current trends.” Although the region has made progress on income poverty, it is “likely to miss all measurable SDG targets related to other forms of poverty, hunger and gender equality and reduced inequalities within and between countries by 2030.”

Still, the report emphasizes promising progress on targets related to food security, women’s role in decision-making, and access to basic sanitation services. These trajectories provide the region with a “strong basis for future acceleration.”

The report finds the region is most likely to meet SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). On SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), the region has increased access to electricity across all five subregions (although the region has one of the lowest shares of renewable energy globally, at 16%). On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), the region’s real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita growth was more than double the world average in 2017. In addition, on SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), at least 18 countries are experiencing less income inequality.

The authors note that progress across Asia-Pacific’s five subregions is uneven. For example:

On SDG 2 (zero hunger), East and North-East Asia have made the most progress, while the Pacific lags behind the rest of the region.

On SDG 10, North and Central Asia is considered on track, and has progressed more than any of the other subregions. In contrast, South-East Asia has regressed on SDG 10.

On SDG 12, the Pacific is the only subregion on track. South and South-West Asia show “considerable regression.”

On SDG 16, North and Central Asia have made the most progress while the Pacific, South-East Asia, and South and South-West Asia are “moving further from achieving the Goal.”

The report also observes that data availability for the SDG indicators has “substantially increased,” from 25% in 2017 to 42% in 2020. Data is still unavailable for over half of the SDG indicators, including several SDGs with slow progress. Data is available for only a “very few” of the SDG 13 and SDG 14 (life below water) targets. ESCAP calls for urgently strengthening the policy-data nexus in the region.

The authors call for the region to accelerate SDG action to reverse negative trends and to redouble efforts to strengthen the means of implementation, including mobilizing additional financing for development (FfD) and supporting the region’s least developed countries (LDCs) to access global markets and build their capacity for statistical development.

ESCAP Executive Secretary Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana said the report’s findings “sound the alarm for the region to urgently foster sustainable use of natural resources, improve the management of chemicals and wastes, increase its resilience against natural disasters, and adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change through integrated policies.” [ESCAP press release] [ESCAP press release on virtual launch] [Report landing page] [Publication: Asia and Pacific SDG Progress Report 2020] [ESCAP guest article on key messages of 2020 report] [SDG Knowledge Hub story on 2019 report]","The region is struggling the most on SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 13 (climate action).The report titled, ‘Asia and Pacific SDG Progress Report 2020,’ assesses the region’s progress towards the 17 Goals.

The report aims to inform the region’s progress on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

The report titled, ‘The Sustainable Development Goals in an Arab Region Affected by Conflict: Monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals with Household Survey Microdata,’ analyzes 47 indicators for 12 SDGs using microdata from 2011-2014. The report explains that most countries in the Arab region regularly collect micro-level data that are “highly representative of national populations,” and such microdata measure the type of population characteristics required for SDG indicator disaggregation. The authors suggest leveraging this existing data to support SDG monitoring efforts.

On SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), the report finds that acute multidimensional poverty exists in the region’s least developed countries (LDCs), including Sudan and Yemen, where approximately 50% of the population experiences multidimensional poverty. Sudan also exhibits a large urban-rural gap, with 70% of poverty concentrated in rural areas. Pockets of multidimensional poverty “remain across and within Arab countries,” with conflicts increasing potential poverty for large population groups within countries. The report calls for additional data collection initiatives across the region to generate consistent indicators for SDG 10 and enable comparison across countries.

Conflict intensification in Yemen and Iraq is causing a surge in stunting for children exposed to conflict.

On SDG 2 (zero hunger) and SDG 3 (good health and well-being), malnutrition is “still prevalent” in Arab countries. Although child mortality rates have declined in the region, nearly every country still exhibits large socioeconomic disparities in child health. Child malnutrition and food insecurity are highly correlated among crisis-affected countries in the region, and conflict and protracted crises are “a critical factor affecting children’s health and mortality.” Sudan and Yemen are most vulnerable to food insecurity, with mothers and children at increased risk of malnutrition and mortality. Stunting among children is also a challenge in the region, with 20-25% of children experiencing stunting in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, and 50% of children stunted in Yemen. The report also highlights large subnational disparities in Yemen and Egypt, and observes that conflict intensification in Yemen and Iraq is causing “a surge in stunting for children exposed to conflict,” leading to large regional inequalities. Obesity is a challenge for seven Arab countries, and female genital mutilation (FGM) is still common in several countries.

On SDG 4 (quality education), conflict has “directly disrupted the skill-formation process of many children” in region, resulting in disadvantages and inequalities. The report finds that the expansion in educational attendance “has not been accompanied by equal improvements in educational quality,” meaning that schooling is not necessarily translating into learning. The report concludes conflict has “reversed much of the gains in educational expansion at all levels” in countries across the region, and calls for large investments to restore access to schools and boost educational quality.

The report examines SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) to analyze living standards and conflict. Overall, the report concludes that living standards have steadily increased across the region. The report finds significant disparities on access to improved water sources between urban and rural areas and across wealth quintiles. Although most Arab states have provided access to improved sanitation facilities for over 90% of their populations, Sudan and Yemen lag behind on sanitation infrastructure. In Yemen, for instance, violent conflict has damaged water supply networks and populations are cut off from regular access to water and sanitation.

On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), the report observes several employment and labor-related challenges across the Arab region, which have both contributed to crises. Additional challenges include a lack of diversification, and a mismatch of skills needed by the private sector and skills attained by graduates.

On SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), the report combines geo-coded indicators with household survey microdata to examine how violence across the region affects SDG progress. The report concludes that violence is a development challenge that “could delay progress or even reverse advances already achieved.”

The report emphasizes the importance of better data availability to track SDG progress, especially among conflict-affected countries, and calls for capacity building efforts to improve data availability and quality. It also calls for further investment in national statistical systems to collect, process and analyze data.

The VNRs are a component of the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda. They are carried out voluntarily by national governments, and are intended to track progress in implementing the Agenda and its 17 SDGs at the country level. VNRs are presented during the HLPF sessions convened under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) each year in July.

The panel discussion took place on 10 March 2020, as part of the TAP-UNDP initiative to create a resource for stakeholders involved in post-VNR activities on SDG 16. The resource is expected to be published later in 2020.

Mechanisms established for a country’s VNR process should continue their work following the presentation.

Joern Geisselmann, Partners for Review (P4R), identified trends and country experiences following a VNR presentation. Among the lessons learned, he said VNRs should not only review past implementation, but also agree on next steps. Immediate action should be taken after the VNR as a follow-up step, such as reporting to parliament and/or the media. Geisselmann also suggested institutionalizing any mechanisms established for the VNR process, to continue their work following the presentation to the HLPF.

He reported that in some countries that have conducted VNRs, follow-up activities have included:

Georgia introduced an SDG architecture, including a multi-stakeholder SDG Council, thematic working groups and an Annual Forum to share and debate experiences related to SDG implementation;

Germany established an annual Sustainability Forum as a multi-stakeholder dialogue forum organized by the Chancellery;

Mexico involved the Ministry of Finance in a process to map all applicable budget lines and programs with SDG indicators; and

Mongolia conducted a systems analysis of drivers, bottlenecks and impacts, and developed short- and long-term actions to tackle air pollution.

Margarita Cano of SEGEPLAN, Guatemala’s State planning body (Secretaría de Planificación y Programación de la Presidencia), discussed her country’s efforts to mainstream and implement SDG 16 and the 2030 Agenda following its first VNR in 2017 and second in 2019. She reported that after the 2017 presentation, the government changed its approach from government-led to whole-of-society, engaging local governments, civil society organizations, the private sector and congress. This enabled the government to collect far more usable data than it had in 2017.

Following its 2019 VNR, the ministry incorporated the results of the review as it developed goals for the next four years.

Peter van Sluijs, Civil Society Platform for Peacebuilding and Statebuilding (CSPPS), said the VNRs have been “seen as an end product” rather that a means to determine actions needed for further results. He observed that, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected countries, if a country does not fully utilize its consultative processes to develop its view of progress, the VNR is not being used as a management tool for steering the 2030 Agenda at the national level. He called for meaningful stakeholder inclusion and participation in the follow-up processes to the VNRs.

In February 2020, CSPPS released a publication titled, ‘Reporting for the Future,’ as a report of its Ready for Review project. The report includes an in-depth analysis of implementation and lessons learned that will inform the next stage of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in fragile and conflict-affected countries, and better support the countries that will present VNRs in 2020.

Ameyovi Alice Goza, Founder and President of the International Association of Women and Young Leaders (AIFJL) in Togo, highlighted the importance of engaging young people in post-VNR processes, stressing that youth groups continually achieve positive impacts on the ground. She called for capacity building for the efforts of youth organizations.

Fiona Dawe, UK Office of National Statistics (ONS), reported that since the UK’s VNR in 2019, the ONS is working to make the country’s SDG data more readily accessible to the its government and other interested stakeholders. She explained that the Open SDG National Reporting Platform is a free-to-reuse, open-source SDG reporting and monitoring solution, with completely customizable software. It was developed in collaboration with the US Government and the Center for Open Data for Enterprise. The UK is providing technical support to other countries’ national statistical offices as well as other stakeholders, to create their own platforms for SDG data. To date, approximately 13 countries have replicated the site for their own contexts or are working to do so.

Since 2016, 158 VNRs have been presented by 142 countries at the Forum. In 2020, the following 51 countries are preparing VNRs: first-time presenters – Austria, Barbados, Bolivia, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Burundi, Comoros, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gambia, Kyrgyz Republic, Liberia, Libya, Malawi, Micronesia, Mozambique, North Macedonia, Papua New Guinea, Moldova, Russia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Zambia; second-time presenters – Argentina, Armenia, Bangladesh, Belize, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Honduras, India, Kenya, Morocco, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, Samoa, Slovenia, Uganda and Zimbabwe; and third-time presenter Benin.

Ahead of the 2021 HLPF session, six countries have signaled their intention to present a VNR: Bhutan, China, Czech Republic, Germany, Lao, Marshall Islands, Slovakia, Spain, Thailand.

There is overwhelming evidence that the Asia-Pacific region needs to accelerate action on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and substantially reverse current negative trends, especially those which are depleting and degrading its environmental resources, according to a new report released today by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).

The Asia and the Pacific SDG Progress Report 2020 draws attention to the region’s poor performance on most of the measurable environmental targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. For example, the share of renewable energy has dropped to 16 per cent, one of the lowest rates globally. The region also emits half of the world’s total greenhouse gas - a number which has doubled since 2000. 35 per cent of countries continue to lose their forests.

“Our analysis finds that the Asia-Pacific region has struggled the most with two Goals: advancing responsible consumption and production, and climate action. In fact, the region is not even moving in the right direction,” underscored United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP Ms. Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana.

“These findings sound the alarm for the region to urgently foster sustainable use of natural resources, improve the management of chemicals and wastes, increase its resilience against natural disasters, and adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change through integrated policies,” added Ms. Alisjahbana.

On a positive note, many countries are moving decisively and showing remarkable progress in improving the quality of education (Goal 4) and providing access to affordable and clean energy (Goal 7). The Report suggests that achieving these two Goals is well within reach. The region is also making good progress on targets related to economic growth. Real GDP per capita growth in the Asia-Pacific was more than double the world average in 2017, and at the same time, at least 18 countries in the region are experiencing less income inequality.

Yet, to grow more sustainably and equitably, the current economic progress of the region must be coupled with human well-being and a healthy environment. Progress has been far too slow in areas such as gender equality (Goal 5) and building sustainable cities and communities (Goal 11). ESCAP warns that the region remains unlikely to meet any of the 17 SDGs by 2030 without concerted and extra efforts from all stakeholders.

Progress has also been uneven across the five Asia-Pacific subregions, most especially in reducing inequalities (Goal 10), responsible consumption and production (Goal 12), and peace, justice and strong institutions (Goal 16). A positive example of collective progress across all five subregions however is on access to electricity, where steady improvement is noticeable, particularly in rural areas.

Data availability for the SDG indicators has substantially increased over the past few years in Asia and the Pacific, from 25 per cent in 2017 to 42 per cent in 2020. But data is still lacking on over half of the SDG indicators, especially those Goals with slow progress. This, according to ESCAP, highlights the urgent need to strengthen the policy-data nexus in the region.

A flagship annual publication produced by ESCAP, in partnership with five other UN agencies, the Asia and the Pacific SDG Progress Report uses the latest data for global SDG indicators to determine where additional effort is needed in the region and where momentum for future progress is building.

The report aims to inform the 2020 session of the UNECE Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (RFSD).

The report titled, ‘Towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the UNECE region: A statistical portrait of progress and challenges,’ reviews trends in progress on 49 global SDG indicators. UNECE selected the indicators based on their relevance to region and availability of data, and they cover all 17 SDGs. The report shares progress on people, planet, prosperity, and partnership.

On people, the report finds UNECE countries are making good progress on ending poverty (SDG 1) and hunger (SDG 2) and ensuring that all people can fulfill their potential with equality and dignity and in a healthy environment. Social protection schemes cover a large majority of the population, with about half of UNECE countries providing universal pension schemes for older persons, and 30 out of 41 countries with data providing a disability cash benefit for everyone with severe disabilities.

Almost all UNECE countries have maternal, infant and child mortality rates (SDG 3) below the global SDG targets; in the few countries with rates above the targets, these rates have “fallen substantially over recent years.” The report also highlights progress on: family planning; disaster-related mortality (SDG 13); proficiency levels in reading, mathematics and information, communications and technology (ICT) skills (SDG 4); and some gender equality targets (SDG 5), such as narrowing the gender gap in domestic and care work and increasing the proportion of women among parliamentarians and managers. Still, very few countries are approaching gender parity.

In some areas, “little or no progress has been made.” The UNECE region has high overweight rates among children, and the proportion of local governments with disaster risk reduction (DRR) strategies varies widely. Births to adolescents remain relatively high in Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Although countries have made progress in reducing road fatalities since 2007, progress has stalled or reversed in recent years, and the region is “far from reaching the global target.” Air pollution remains the “most significant environmental risk to human health,” and only ten UNECE countries have levels of air pollution with fine particulate matter below the recommended limit (SDG 11).

Forest cover increased by 28 million hectares between 2000-2015.

On planet, the region has “greatly expanded” protection of marine key biodiversity areas (SDG 14) and forest cover has expanded over the past two decades (SDG 15), with a net increase of 28 million hectares between 2000 and 2015. UNECE countries are fulfilling their obligations under multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs), complying with agreements on protecting the ozone layer and disposing of hazardous waste, and implementing international instruments to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Two-thirds of UNECE countries provide safely managed sanitation services for over 80% of their population (SDG 6), with 40 countries showing improvements since 2000. Most UNECE countries have decreased their energy intensity (SDG 7), and the authors suggest that more countries are becoming more energy efficient: Central Asia and Eastern and South-eastern Europe show the largest reductions.

Although renewable energy consumption has increased in UNECE countries, the region remains below the global average. Additional planetary-related challenges in UNECE countries include a limited number of countries with operational arrangements covering their transboundary waters, water scarcity, and water equality in open water bodies and river water bodies. Six countries treat less than 50% of their wastewater. Twenty-seven countries face challenges in addressing persistent organic pollutants.

On prosperity, half of UNECE countries have increased the share of value add from medium and high-tech industry, and all countries have increased the share of the population with fixed internet broadband subscriptions. UNECE countries have “relatively stable” economic growth (SDG 8), but the share of youth not in employment, education or training (NEET) has declined in recent years. Progress on SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) remained stable in some countries and decreased in other countries. In addition, the number of homicide victims is decreasing and progress has been made on other targets related to peace, justice and strengthened institutions (SDG 16).

On partnership, only five UNECE countries met the target of allocating 0.7% of their gross national income (GNI) to assistance to developing countries.

The report concludes by reflecting on the importance of relevant, comparable and timely statistics to track SDG progress, observing that the report’s production highlighted several challenges related to measuring SDG progress. Challenges include the lack of an internationally-agreed methodology for many indicators and a lack of data on several indicators for a large number of countries. The report calls for “investing in data for the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda.”

The UNECE Statistical Division prepared the first annual SDG progress report to inform the 2020 RFSD.

In some areas, work is shifting to alternative virtual formats, such as the UN’s Fifth Committee on administrative and budgetary matters.

By early March, a number of announcements regarding the postponement or cancellation of meetings due to the COVID-19 pandemic had been made. The UN Commission on the Status of Women held a historically short meeting for its 64th session, convening for a half-day on 9 March 2020 to adopt a political declaration before suspending. The CSW usually brings together thousands of participants the world for a two-week session and hundreds of side events.

Also acting early to adjust major plans were the World Bank and IMF, which transitioned the annual Spring Meetings scheduled for mid-April to a virtual format. The World Bank announced that it would cancel or postpone “all major events and conferences until further notice,” including the cancellation of the 2020 Land and Poverty Conference scheduled for 16-20 March. In cancelling the 19th session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Peoples, which was scheduled for April 2020, members of the Forum noted the “already precarious health situation that many indigenous peoples live in, and the imperative to avoid adverse impacts.”

On 10 March, the ECOSOC Youth Forum and a Youth Plenary in preparation for the UN’s 75th anniversary were postponed. On 11 March, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) voted to postpone the fourth session of the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC 4) on an international legally binding instrument under the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ), with new dates to be determined (decision 74/543). IGC 4 had been scheduled to convene from 23 March to 3 April. UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande also announced that two high-level events would not go forward: the High-level Interactive Panel on Anti-microbial Resistance, scheduled for 14 April 2020; and the High-level event to commemorate and promote the International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace, scheduled for 24 April 2020.

On 11 March, the President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) circulated a list of proposed changes to the Council’s meeting calendar, inviting Member States’ views. She subsequently announced instead, “we need to remain flexible.”

On 17 March, the UNGA President announced that in-person, formal meetings of the UNGA “should not be organized at this time.” He suggested that the UNGA adopt any essential decisions via silence procedure, and agreeing on a simple procedure for postponing meetings. By a separate letter, he said he had decided to cancel all in-person meetings of the UNGA’s mandated processes for the 74th session that are scheduled to be held up to 17 April 2020, stating that, “These processes will conduct their activities via alternative mechanisms.” On mandated UNGA events scheduled for after 17 April 2020, he said discussions are ongoing.

The UNGA President said officials are considering alternative ways to adopt key decisions (instead of in-person meetings), and that the UNGA’s Fifth Committee has “successfully started conducting informal meetings via the UN’s Video Conference Tool (VCT).” ECOSOC, too, is exploring virtual options and solutions, according to the President’s statement on 18 March.

Additional ECOSOC meetings and events have been postponed or cancelled, as follows:

The 19th session of the Committee of Experts on Public Administration (CEPA), 30 March-3 April: Postponed

2020 ECOSOC Partnership Forum, 3 April: Cancelled

2020 ECOSOC Forum on Financing for Development Follow-up (FFD Forum), 20-23 April: Postponed until after April 2020

SDG Investment Fair, 20-22 April: Cancelled

Other ECOSOC meetings that fall within the eight-week timeframe are:

The UN Forum on Forests (UNFF), 4-8 May; and

The Multi-stakeholder Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation (STI Forum), 12-13 May.

Later in May, the ECOSOC Development Cooperation Forum (DCF) is scheduled for 14-15 May, and the ECOSOC segment on Operational Activities for Development (OAS) is planned to convene from 19-21 May.

Negotiations on outcome documents of upcoming meetings, such as the ministerial declaration of the HLPF/high-level segment of ECOSOC in July 2020, may not take place in person.

Four out of five of the UN regions have had to postpone their annual regional fora for sustainable development or switch to a virtual format. The exception is the UN Economic Commission for Africa, which convened the Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (ARFSD) from 24-27 February 2020. These regional sessions comprise an important part of the preparations for the July session of the HLPF.

The UN Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries, and Small Island Developing States (OHRLLS) has been organizing preparations for the fifth UN conference on the LDCs, which will convene in Qatar in 2021 (UNLDC-V). Regional review meetings to inform these preparations have been postponed both for Africa, in Malawi, and Asia-Pacific, in Bangladesh.

On climate change, the Secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is not organizing in-person meetings until the end of April 2020 and official missions have been suspended. The regional climate weeks have been postponed, as has the 2020 NAP Expo among other planned meetings. The Adaptation Committee will meet virtually instead of its in-person meeting from 24-27 March.

On biodiversity, the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has announced the postponement of a number of meetings, including the 24th Meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice of the CBD and the third Meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Implementation of the CBD. Both of these meetings are expected to feed into the preparations for the UN Biodiversity Conference, which is scheduled to take place in October 2020, in China and is expected to adopt a global biodiversity framework for the post-2020 period.

On chemicals and waste management, the fourth meeting of the intersessional process for Considering the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) and the Sound Management of Chemicals and Waste Beyond 2020 was postponed, having been scheduled to convene in Bucharest, Romania, from 23-27 March 2020. The meeting will feed into the fifth International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5), which is scheduled to take place from 5-9 October 2020, in Bonn, Germany.

The Secretariat of the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm has announced that an upcoming meeting in Ottawa, Canada and an upcoming meeting in Rome, Italy have been suspended, while the first meeting of the small intersessional working group on the strategic framework for the implementation of the Basel Convention for 2012–2021, scheduled for 31 March to 2 April 2020, will take place online. Preparations are continuing for the 2020 COP meetings of each convention, and a final decision will be made five weeks before the scheduled dates. These meetings, all scheduled to convene in Geneva, are:

Meeting of the Bureau of the Conference of the Parties to the Rotterdam Convention, 9 June 2020

Meeting of the Bureau of the Conference of the Parties to the Stockholm Convention, 10 June 2020

12th meeting of the Open-ended Working Group of the Basel Convention (OEWG-12), 22-25 June 2020

The changes were recommended to the Commission as the outcome of the ‘2020 comprehensive review’ conducted by the UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs).

The UNSC met for its 51st session in New York, US, from 3-6 March 2020.

Introducing the IAEG’s report on the proposed changes on 3 March 2020, IAEG co-chair Viveka Palm (Sweden) said the Group had developed 36 “major changes” to the framework, including by replacing, revising, and deleting current indicators, as well as adding new ones. In total, the revised framework would have 231 indicators, approximately the same number as in the original framework. She also provided an oral update to the report, noting that on indicator 3.8.1, the refinement has been changed to “coverage of essential health services,” meaning that the indicator “basically goes back to what it was before.”

She also highlighted that:

The IAEG proposes establishing a working group for measuring development support more broadly than through official development assistance (ODA) – “total official support for sustainable development (TOSSD)”. An additional indicator on TOSSD had been proposed during the comprehensive review process, but members differed over the methodology. The Group agreed to work further on this potential indicator for submission to the Commission in 2022, and to establish a working group to this end.

Data disaggregation is a main area of work for 2020, to ensure “no one is left behind,” and the IEAG aims to develop guidelines on tools and methodologies on data disaggregation and to help build national capacity; and

The Group has issued a report on interlinkages between the Goals and targets both statistically and through a policy and legislation lens, to support deeper analysis of the 2030 Agenda.

Member States, some of whom are IAEG members, made numerous remarks. Several welcomed the fact that the changes to the framework had been limited so as not to increase the overall burden on national statistical organizations, while increasing the quality of the framework. Some expressed support for specific changes, such as the addition of an indicator on civil justice (16.3.3), the additional of an indicator on total greenhouse gas emissions per year (indicator 13.2.2), and in a revision to indicator 15.9.1, the integration of biodiversity into national accounting under the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting.

Speakers expressed concern on the proposed deletion of indicator 8.9.2 on employment in sustainable tourism.

On other changes, the speakers expressed concern, including on the proposed deletion of indicator 8.9.2 on the proportion of jobs in sustainable tourism industries out of total tourism jobs. China voiced concern about, among others, the addition of the GHG emissions indicator, noting that the global response to climate change should focus on equity and preserve each country’s equal right to development.

The United Arab Emirates suggested “cancelling” all indicators that remain in Tier 3, given the relatively short time left to implement them. The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) lamented the lack of an indicator for older persons under SDG target 2.2. on malnutrition.

The African Group recommended reinforced collaboration and coordination with regional commissions. Others called for improved coordination between the custodian agencies for the indicators and national governments.

Revisiting the discussion on 6 March 2020 with the aim of approving the Commission’s report on the proposed changes (E/CN3/2020/L.3, draft decision 1), many delegations reiterated their concern about deleting indicator 8.9.2 on sustainable tourism employment.

The Director of the UN Statistics Division Stefan Schweinfest recalled that the comprehensive review process had been lengthy and “very complex” and had resulted in a “package deal.” This would make reconsidering the decision on one indicator a “dangerous path,” he said, urging delegations to accept the premise of a compromise. Speaking on the “painful” impacts of deleting 8.9.2, Suriname urged that the report reflect that “part of the Commission does not accept this…. Some countries are saying this is not okay.”

The report of the IAEG was adopted as orally revised, and it “agreed to and adopted the proposed major changes and minor refinements … while noting concerns regarding specific indicators, and recognized that the work on SDG indicators is work in progress.” The amended text also indicates that the IAEG is requested to continue its annual refinement, research and methodological work including on “policy issues such as sustainable tourism and climate change.”

Another oral revision to the report adds wording on “the importance of the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting for SDG monitoring.”

At the closing of the 51st session, Commission Chair Shigeru Kawasaki (Japan) expressed satisfaction that “the SDG indicator framework is advancing, although there is still some room for improvement … we are in a very promising situation.” [Meeting webcast, 3 March 2020] [Meeting webcast, 6 March 2020]","The UN Statistical Commission (UNSC) has approved a set of changes to the global indicator framework for the SDGs.

Landsvirkjun has signed an agreement with US and UK institutional investors to issue USD 80 million senior unsecured notes in the US Private Placement (“USPP”) market. The issue reiterates Landsvirkjun’s focus on sustainability-linked financing, linking the pricing of the notes to the company’s carbon sequestration targets, in line with the UN's Sustainable Development Goal (“SDG”) 13 on climate action.

The offering was very well received, with an order book which was multiple times oversubscribed. The attractiveness of this funding opportunity was enhanced by the ability of the US and UK investors to provide short-dated notes in a favourable rate environment. The notes have a 3-year maturity and carry a fixed interest rate of 2.51%, with semi-annual payments. Proceeds from the transaction will be used to refinance existing debt and for general corporate purposes.

The issuance demonstrates Landsvirkjun’s continued commitment and focus on sustainable development and follows the execution of a USD 150 million sustainability-linked revolving credit facility in 2019 and the successful placing of a USD 200 million green bond in the USPP market in 2018.





First European SDG-linked USPP

Landsvirkjun is the first issuer in Europe of an SDG-linked USPP. The USPP is understood to be one of the first SDG-linked issuances in Europe overall and underscores Landsvirkjun’s innovation and leadership in this fast-moving space.

As part of the transaction, Landsvirkjun has committed to increase its carbon sequestration efforts to reach at least 32,538 tons of CO 2 eq. for 2020 (up by at least 2% from 31,900 tons CO 2 eq. for 2019). The USPP is directly tied to this commitment whereas the annual coupon will increase by 10 bps if Landsvirkjun fails to achieve this target. The target forms part of Landsvirkjun’s strategy to become carbon neutral by 2025.

Barclays acted as Sole Placement Agent in this transaction. Landsvirkjun’s legal advisors were Logos and Morrison & Foerster. The funders’ legal advisor was Greenberg Traurig.





Hörður Arnarson, CEO of Landsvirkjun:

“We are pleased with our second successful issuance in the USPP market and the support that we have received from our investor group. The private placement provides further diversification of funding sources and demonstrates our ability to access financing on attractive terms. As sustainability and the environment are core to our social responsibility initiatives, we are proud to have issued the first SDG-linked USPP in Europe, which further reinforces our commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2025.”





Landsvirkjun

Landsvirkjun is owned by the Icelandic State. The company generates about 75% of all electricity used in Iceland from 100% renewable energy sources, hydro, geothermal and wind. The company operates eighteen power stations; fifteen hydropower stations and three geothermal power stations, as well as two wind turbines.

By Ashok Pandey

THE NITI AAYOG released the second version of the SDG India Index and Dashboard on December 20, 2019. India, as a signatory to adoption of UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals, is under obligation

to streamline development policies for a time-bound (by 2030) achievement of human well-being. The 17 goals and 169 related targets weave around five pillars— People (first six goals), Prosperity (next five), Planet (following four goals), Peace (goal 16) and Partnership (goal 17). Achieving these requires government’s commitment, people’s participation, allocation of funds, intergovernmental cooperation, technology and innovation.

The SDG Index is the first attempt at the national level to assess where each state and UT stands on achieving SDGs. The SDG India Index 2.0 uses a hundred indicators covering 16 goals (barring goal 17 for want of sufficient inputs) and 54 targets. The Index has played a vital role in driving the SDG agenda in India. Budgetary allocation is an essential component of pushing the SDG agenda forward. Prominent themes in this year’s Budget include working for an aspirational India, ensuring economic development for all, fostering a caring society and ease of living. These also cover most SDG goals around People and Prosperity.

The finance minister gave a big push to wellness, water and sanitation by providing Rs 69,000 crore for the health sector. Of this, Rs 6,400 crore is for the PM Jan Arogya Yojana, extending its reach to 20,000 empanelled hospitals, and Rs 3.6 lakh crore approved for the Jal Jeevan Mission, of which Rs 11,500 crore will be available for 2020-21. Cities with a million plus population are mandated to achieve the objective this year. Also, Rs 3,000 crore additional will be available for skill development, and the National Skill Development Agency will give a special thrust to infrastructure-focused skill development— infrastructure projects will involve young engineers, management graduates and economists from universities.

Women-specific schemes, nutrition enhancement and financial support to uplift the conditions of young girls contribute significantly to achieve educational, health and financial targets under different SDG goals. There are conscious efforts and the intent to reduce fossil-fuel based power to meet the objectives under goal 13. An allocationof Rs 4,400 crore has gone to the 16 action points for agriculture, irrigation and rural development. Additional allowances will help propel fish production and export. Encouragement to growing algae, seaweed and cage culture will give a boost to the blue economy.

The finance minister’s statement to ensure corruption-free, policy-driven governance is a welcome step. Providing justice and building strong institutions will enhance the Index ranking undergoal 16. The government’s recognition of the potential of artificial intelligence, quantum computing and new technologies to augment our efforts in achieving plan 2030 is also commendable. The SDG India Index noted that Tamil Naidu and Jammu & Kashmir performed the best amongst states and UTs, respectively, in alleviating poverty. This means better performance in achieving the targets under SDG goal 1— reducing extreme and multi-dimensional poverty, improving social protection and safety net, providing the necessary services and mitigating a multitude of natural disasters.

A similar indexing in achieving other targets is both instructive and encouraging. The SDG India Index, together with the budgetary mandate, should serve as a reminder that with intentional policy and

action on the ground, it is possible to achieve the goals of well-being. The interstate and inter-UT competitions and a mature and people-centric federal interdependence augur well for the country. The NITIAayog’s SDG India Index 2.0 will serve as a facilitative rubric to bring transparency, accountability and urgency for judicious utilisation of national resources.

52,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/the-imperative-of-ending-wildlife-crime/,"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: The Imperative of Ending Wildlife Crime,"Reports that the current coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak originated from illegally sourced wildlife, including pangolin, has given a new sense of urgency to ending wildlife crime. Wildlife crime is not new, yet, remarkably, there is no global legal agreement addressing it. This is despite the devastating impact it has on wildlife, local communities, national economies, security, public health and entire ecosystems, and its links to HIV Aids, Ebola, SARS, MERS and now COVID -19.

We are not talking about subsistence poaching, which is a separate and distinct issue to be resolved locally, but rather, large-scale criminal activity organized transnationally and fueled by corruption. A recent World Bank report estimates the value of illegally traded species at US$200 billion, when all wildlife, including fish and timber not listed under CITES are included.

Saving wildlife, and, as we now see, ourselves, means stopping an illegal commerce that shifts thousands of tonnes of contraband, worth billions of dollars and leaves death, destruction, and instability in its wake. Ending wildlife crime requires a new level of international cooperation that assures criminals feel the long arm of the law. The time for bold action is now.

No longer a tenable solution

Currently and by default, we have turned to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), a trade-related conservation convention from the 1970’s, to serve as the de facto legal instrument for combating serious wildlife crimes. The problem is that CITES wasn’t designed to deal with wildlife crime. It was meant to regulate wildlife trade to avoid over-exploitation of threatened species.

While a critically important trade convention, it was never designed to fight crime. CITES has its limitations. It only applies to species listed in its appendices – that is 36,000 of the world’s eight million species – and to the cross-border movement of specimens. It doesn’t require illegal trade to be criminalized, nor does it apply to poaching. However, in the absence of any alternative, over the past decade, CITES has been leveraged to crank up the fight against illegal wildlife trade.

Even with its limitations, CITES has had some success in this regard. It led the creation of the International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime (ICCWC) in 2010[i], which was welcomed by CITES Parties in 2013[ii]. In parallel to the Consortium, the UN General Assembly passed a first-ever Resolution on Combating Illegal Wildlife Trade in 2015, and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC) released the first-ever UN World Wildlife Crime Report in 2016. Over the years, CITES has seen the deeper engagement of police and customs agents, and action by key industry sectors, including finance, transport, and tourism.

Yet, a serious underlying problem remains, one for which we are now paying a heavy price. There is no international legal framework for cooperative global and national action to catch and punish serious wildlife criminals, nor is there an agreed definition of wildlife crime. This inhibits global enforcement efforts and jeopardizes the lives of park rangers, creates insecurity and undermines conservation schemes. It robs local communities of their resources and it elevates the risk of future disease outbreaks like COVID-19.

Transnational wildlife crimes deserve the attention of the criminal justice system and deployment of their resources.

Given the scale and seriousness of wildlife crime and its grave implications for countries, their ecosystems and species, and for humanity overall, it can and must be dealt with by police, prosecutors and the judiciary – not by individuals such as conservationists or park rangers acting alone. We need an unequivocal political message, supported by the right legal framework, that organized, transnational wildlife crimes deserve the attention of the criminal justice system and deployment of their resources.

We must move with the times

The time has come for a new global agreement on wildlife crime.

This agreement can be housed under the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNCTOC), as has been done for other serious crimes such as human trafficking. Such an agreement should oblige countries to prohibit the import of any wildlife[iii], supported by criminal sanctions, unless the importer can prove it was legally obtained[iv].

This idea was put forward at the recent ‘End Wildlife Crime’ event at the House of Lords, which promoted a new agreement on wildlife crime that criminalizes the importation, distribution and consumption of illegally sourced wildlife. What is proposed is not unlike the approach taken in some countries, such as in the US under the Lacey Act, and what some countries have in place for certain timber imports.

Doing things differently requires us to take a fresh look at historic approaches to conservation and question their ongoing efficacy in a changing world. Making bold but necessary changes will prove difficult and stir up resistance. But the status quo won’t do; nor will incremental changes. It’s abundantly clear that we need to scale up the fight against the transnational, organized criminals who are stripping countries bare of their precious wildlife and creating havoc locally and globally. To stop them we need to get police and prosecutors hot on their trail.

Global responses to biodiversity loss must move with the times and if we can blend taking a hard line against transnational organized criminals, while opening up new opportunities for local communities in and around biodiverse-rich areas, then we will not only end wildlife crime but see wildlife, ecosystems and local communities thrive.

This article was written by John E Scanlon AO, Special Envoy, African Parks (Secretary-General of CITES 2010-2018).","Reports that the current coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak originated from illegally sourced wildlife, including pangolin, has given a new sense of urgency to ending wildlife crime.
Ending wildlife crime requires a new level of international cooperation that assures criminals feel the long arm of the law.
In parallel to the Consortium, the UN General Assembly passed a first-ever Resolution on Combating Illegal Wildlife Trade in 2015, and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC) released the first-ever UN World Wildlife Crime Report in 2016.
There is no international legal framework for cooperative global and national action to catch and punish serious wildlife criminals, nor is there an agreed definition of wildlife crime.
This idea was put forward at the recent ‘End Wildlife Crime’ event at the House of Lords, which promoted a new agreement on wildlife crime that criminalizes the importation, distribution and consumption of illegally sourced wildlife."

It followed on the heels of the 33rd African Union (AU) Summit, which focused on the 2020 theme, ‘Silencing the Guns: Creating conducive conditions for Africa’s Development.’

Addressing the overarching theme, ‘2020-2030: A Decade to Deliver a Transformed and Prosperous Africa through the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063,’ the sixth session of the Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development (ARFSD 2020), was also the first regional consultation to take place under the UN@75 reform process. On the margins of the Forum, UN Deputy Secretary-General (UNDSG) Amina Mohammed convened several consultations with regional stakeholders, including UN and AU institutions, and youth, to elicit perspectives from on the ongoing UN reform process.

ARFSD 2020 took place from 24-27 February 2020, in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe. It was co-organized by the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and the Government of Zimbabwe, in collaboration with the AU Commission (AUC), African Development Bank (AfDB) and the UN system. It brought together nearly 3,000 delegates in plenary and parallel sessions over the four days, holding more than 60 preparatory and side events.

The Regional Forum assessed Africa’s progress on all 17 SDGs, clustered around the “five Ps” of the 2030 Agenda: people, prosperity, planet, peace, and partnerships. Drawing on regional data sources – including the Africa Sustainable Development Report 2020, and the inaugural AU Continental Report on the Implementation of Agenda 2063 – there was a convergence of evidence that, despite some pockets of progress, the region is off track on both global and regional goals.

Forum participants engaged in in-depth discussion of key findings and lessons from a selection of VNRs currently being conducted by 17 African countries for presentation at the HLPF in July 2020, as well as emerging lessons from voluntary local reviews (VLRs), which featured for the first time at the Forum. A recurring theme in the discussions was the need to address weak national and local capacity in accessing and using quality and relevant data. Underscoring the importance of building VNRs on evidence-based local reviews, the Forum proposed developing a template to support country reporting. Accelerators for delivering a transformed and prosperous Africa, including through leveraging science, technology and innovation (STI), and strengthening partnerships with the UN Development System, major groups, youth, and other stakeholders were also highlighted.

The Forum adopted a ministerial declaration, titled, ‘Victoria Falls Declaration on the UN Decade of Action and Delivery for Sustainable Development in Africa,’ as well as an outcome summary report and key messages containing Africa’s priorities and policy measures to speed up implementation of the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063.

Addressing the negative impact of the climate crisis, Vera Songwe, Executive Secretary, UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), cited estimates that some countries are spending the equivalent of 2-3% of their GDP on unplanned responses to weather and climate impacts. Touching on repercussions for the water, energy, conflict, food security, and hydropower production sectors, she highlighted efforts underway to craft a common regional position on this issue for the 2020 UN Climate Conference.

During the 33rd AU Summit, which took place from 8-9 February, 2020, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the AU-UN strategic partnership is growing “ever stronger and more dynamic,” and highlighted interlinkages between the ‘Silencing the Guns’ initiative with targets on human rights, gender equality, climate change, and sustainable development. With an estimated tripling of armed conflicts over the past decade, despite implementation of a peace and security roadmap, the discussions underscored the importance of good governance, and building more inclusive societies.

Incoming AU Chairperson, Cyril Ramaphosa, President of South Africa, outlined regional priorities to achieve the Agenda 2063, including, supporting regional integration, industrialization, and trade and investment, and strengthening women’s economic empowerment, in line with the launch of the AU Decade of Financial Inclusion for Women. The Summit adopted enhanced commitments towards this end, including plans to allocate 25% of public procurement to women-owned businesses, and the launch of the African Women Leadership Fund (AWLF), which aims to provide capital to both first time and experienced fund managers, to invest in majority female-owned businesses.

The report titled, ‘A Security Threat Assessment of Global Climate Change,’ constructs its global analysis “through the lens of the U.S. Geographic Combatant Commands.” It provides regional and international threat assessments for climate change, as well as recommendations going forward.

The report, which was published in February 2020, assesses the security implications of two future warming scenarios: near term, 1-2°C; and medium-long term, 2-4°C. It affirms that the world has already warmed almost 1-2°C compared to pre-industrial temperatures. At both warming scenarios and across all regions, the report identifies threats, including increased social and political instability, and risks to US military missions and infrastructure, and security institutions.

Higher-warming levels could lead to catastrophic, and likely irreversible, global security risks.

The report concludes that even at low-warming scenarios, every region will face severe security risks over the next three decades, while higher-warming levels could lead to catastrophic, and likely irreversible, global security risks during the 21st century. Additionally, the report also finds, inter alia, that such threats could happen quickly, destabilizing the regions and relationships on which US and international security depend; and that climate change will present significant threats to US military missions, as well as to regional security institutions and infrastructure, which are critical for maintaining global security.

To avoid severe and catastrophic security futures, the report recommends:

achieving net-zero global emissions as soon as possible in an ambitious, safe, equitable, and well-governed manner;

“climate-proofing” environments, infrastructure, institutions, and systems on which human security depends, rapidly building resilience to climate impacts, and investing in adaptation, disaster response, and peacebuilding; and

in the US, enhancing efforts to prioritize, communicate, and respond to climate security threats, and integrating them across all security planning.

The report also presents threats by region. For example, the African region is likely to see a rapid loss of rural livelihoods, disease, resource stress, and migration, and an increased threat from violent extremist groups in fragile areas. Europe will likely experience severe weather that threatens to: destabilize of key economic sectors; lead to rising regional inequality, migration and ethno-nationalist responses; and result in negative impacts on civil and military infrastructure. The Indo-Pacific region will experience water scarcity in some areas and precipitation inundation in others, threatening security infrastructure, social stability, and tensions between regional powers.

55,https://trade4devnews.enhancedif.org/en/op-ed/achieving-sdg-2-policy-options-and-their-trade-offs,"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Trade for Development News,Achieving SDG 2: Policy options and their trade-offs,"SDG 2 commits governments to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture, with five specific targets setting the level and ambition of this goal. With trade recognized as a “means of implementation” under Agenda 2030, policymakers need to ensure that measures affecting trade and markets take into consideration efforts to achieve SDG 2. Resolving the trade-offs between competing policy objectives requires meaningful analysis and discussion within the context of multilateral agreements, to take account of the measures that could contribute to achieving SDG 2.

The five specific targets of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 aim for improvements related to a range of issues. The targets are: end hunger (2.1); end all forms of malnutrition (2.2); double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers (2.3); ensure sustainable food production systems (2.4); and maintain genetic diversity (2.5).

This is ambitious, given the current situation.

According to the most recent estimates, 821.6 million, or one out of every 10 people in the world, are undernourished, and roughly 728 million people are estimated to be obese. And, there are 736 million people living in extreme poverty, with a majority engaged in the agri-food sector. At the same time, agricultural production systems face a number of environmental challenges related to soil health, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land conversion, biodiversity loss, and water use and pollution.

Trade and related policies play a significant role in this context, as governments often use such measures to address food security as well as agricultural development objectives. Policies that can affect trade and markets include border measures like tariffs, export restrictions and non-tariff measures, as well as “behind-the-border” domestic support such as input and output subsidies, market price support, public investments in infrastructure and R&D, and some forms of income support programmes.

The domestic and international impacts of each of these policies can differ depending on whether the country is a net exporter or importer, a small or big producer or consumer, and the way in which policies are designed and implemented.

In addition, impacts may differ in the short versus longer run.

As policymakers consider using trade and related policies to achieve SDG 2, it is important to recognize that each of its targets – as well as trade itself – often constitute distinct policy priorities in many countries. As such, difficult trade-offs may exist between competing policy objectives.

ON COMPETING PRIORITIES

The use of export restrictions is an example of competing priorities of a border measure, in particular between short- and longer-run objectives within the domestic market, and between the policy objectives of two trading partners. Export restrictions are usually used to address domestic food security concerns related to rising food prices. Such measures often have the immediate effect of increasing food availability and lowering food prices in domestic markets, therefore contributing to the achievement of SDG targets 2.1 and 2.2. However, there might be negative implications for producer incomes (SDG target 2.3), which may be significantly reduced by lower food prices.

In the medium-to-long run, the initial effects of such a policy may be completely reversed as farmers respond to lower prices and policy uncertainty by decreasing cultivated areas. This can contribute to lower production and higher prices in the medium-to-long run, thus mitigating the initial positive implications of the measure for SDG targets 2.1 and 2.2. Furthermore, the application of export restrictions can undermine the achievement of SDG targets 2.1 and 2.2 in importing countries by lowering food availability on world markets and contributing to higher prices, particularly if measures are implemented simultaneously by many exporting countries.

As policymakers consider using trade and related policies to achieve SDG 2, it is important to recognize that each of its targets – as well as trade itself – often constitute distinct policy priorities in many countries. As such, difficult trade-offs may exist between competing policy objectives.



Behind-the-border measures such as input subsidies and market price support measures also involve important choices between different policy objectives. They can have positive implications for the achievement of SDG target 2.3 as they can improve farmer incomes. However, in addition to their high fiscal cost and administrative burden, they can negatively affect the achievement of SDG target 2.4, in particular if they provide production incentives for products with high GHG emissions.

In addition, there might be consequences related to SDG target 2.3 at an international level as such measures may lower prices and undermine the opportunity for small-scale producers in the importing country to sell their products in international markets.

RELATIONSHIP WITH MULTILATERAL TRADE RULES

Some measures generally have positive implications for the achievement of SDG 2 targets. These include public investments in infrastructure like storage facilities that can improve farmer prices (affecting SDG target 2.3), rural roads that can connect producers to markets (affecting SDG target 2.3), and efficiencies in trade and logistics that can reduce food waste and bring farm products where they are needed (affecting SDG targets 2.1 and 2.2).

As these measures do not typically involve transfers to individual producers, they usually fall under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) green box category and are not subject to any limitation. Moreover, the first means of implementation target of SDG 2 (i.e. 2.A), commits countries to “increase investment including through enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension services, technology development and plant and livestock gene banks…”

For other measures that can have production and trade-distorting effects, not only are they subject to limits in the multilateral trading system, but SDG 2’s other two means of implementation targets focus on improving the functioning of agricultural markets. In particular, target 2.B commits countries to “correct and prevent distortions in world agricultural markets, including through the parallel elimination of all forms of export subsidies and all export measures with equivalent effect…”

While progress on indicator 2.B has been made with the WTO Nairobi Ministerial Decision, achieving SDG 2 and resolving the trade-offs requires that governments go beyond a narrow focus on the elimination of export subsidies. Instead, policymakers need to take a broader approach to indicators of progress that encompass a range of measures that affect trade and markets in the global food system.

The term is used to describe the selective reporting of companies’ impacts, sans failures, in regard to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

It appears to be an issue of omission and one-sided reporting, according to the Responsible Mining Foundation, an independent research organization that supports the proliferation of responsible mining, which found that many of the world’s largest mining companies have continuously failed to mention any negative impacts that might impede achievement of the SDGs, the organization said, in its recent RMI Report 2020.

The report is an “evidence-based assessment” of the economic, environmental, social and governance (EESG) policies and practices of 38 large-scale mining companies, which means that its data helps paint a truly global picture — the firms operate in more than 780 mine sites, and together account for 28 percent of the world’s mining activity by value of production, according to RMI. The data was gathered throughout a one-year study, and approximately two months were spent reviewing and assessing various aspects of each company.

According to the International Labor Organization, mining remains one of the top three most hazardous sectors. RMF’s raison d’être is to support the principle that “minerals and metals mining should benefit the economies, improve the lives of peoples and respect the environments of producing countries, while allowing companies and their investors to make a fair and viable return.”

By the Numbers

Mapped to the SDGs and approximately 50 international initiatives, standards or guidelines related to responsible mining or corporate accountability, RMF’s methodology is thorough, to say the least.

RMF’s index is shaped by a specific analytical framework, comprised of six thematic areas: economic development, business conduct, lifecycle management, community well-being, working conditions and environmental responsibility. This is in addition to 76 individual indicators that were distributed among three measurement areas: commitment (follow-through on what they said they’d do), action (what they’ve done so far) and effectiveness (meaningful, measurable outcomes).

More specifically, each category includes an in-depth assessment into companies’ said “progress.” RMF explained, “Commitment indicators assess the extent to which companies have formalized their commitments on particular issues, assigned responsibilities and accountabilities for the implementation of these commitments, and provided resources and staffing to operationalize the commitments. Action indicators assess the extent to which companies have developed systematic approaches to address particular issues and disclose key aspects of their activities, and Effectiveness indicators assess the extent to which companies track, and report on, their performance in managing particular issues and demonstrate continuous improvement on these issues.”

The report also assesses 180 individual mine sites in 45 countries against 10 basic indicators of responsible mining, including local employment; local procurement; post-closure plans; community grievances; worker grievances; air quality; water quality; tailings management; and emergency preparedness.

A Red Flag

But for mining companies, “SDG-washing” is highlighting specific stats that give the impression of responsible mining, which “fails to present stakeholders with a true picture of the challenges the mining sector faces in its support of the SDGs,” according to RMF.

The disillusion surrounding the industry’s progress thus far in its quest for responsible mining has led to a “disconnect between company-wide policies and standards, versus actual on-the-ground actions at mine sites, where the impacts of mining are most evident,” RMF said, raising a huge red flag that encourages industry members to take a deeper look at companies’ claims versus reality.

Who’s Who

The list of mining companies in the report includes Anglo American; AngloGold Ashanti; Antofagasta; ArcelorMittal; Banpu; Barrick Gold Corp; BHP; Buenaventura; Bumi Resources; China Shenhua; Coal India;, Codelco; ERG; Evraz; Exxaro Resources; First Quantum Minerals; Fortescue; Freeport-McMoRan; Glencore; Gold Fields; Grupo México; Industrias Peñoles; MMG; Navoi MMC; Newcrest Mining; Newmont; NMDC; Nordgold; Orano; Peabody Energy; Polymetal; Rio Tinto; RUSAL; Sibanye-Stillwater; Teck; Vale; Vedanta Resources; and Zijin.

Hélène Piaget, chief executive officer of the Responsible Mining Foundation, said that the SDGs “provide a valuable societal framework for reporting and action on economic, social and environmental concerns, but an unbalanced emphasis on the ‘good’ that companies do may obscure the negative impacts, be they inherent or unintentional, that may impede the achievement of the SDG goals.”

Piaget added that a proactive approach toward the SDGs, in tandem with data transparency, can reap positive results for mining companies. “While the trust-deficit with society is recognized as the number-one risk for mining companies, the RMI Report 2020 acts as a prompt to the industry to eliminate the need to respond to multiple information requests. By proactively making EESG data available — starting at individual mine sites and in open data formats companies can help to build trust, limit risk, and show respect. In fact, more proactive data disclosure will reduce the demand for companies’ reporting.”

Great Expectations

Since the last RMI assessment in 2018, several large-scale mining companies have been “at the center of major controversies as mine tailings failures have claimed scores of lives, devastated whole communities and caused major environmental disasters,” RMF noted.

Afshin Mehrpouya, associate professor at HEC Paris and member of the Board of the RMF, said that “Such tragedies reflect very poorly on the sector as a whole and put into stark perspective companies’ claims of responsible mining. The industry must redouble its efforts to prove that it prioritizes broader ESG responsibilities over short-term considerations.”

And it can be done. Similar to the prior assessment, this year’s report noted that “mining can meet society’s expectations.” The RMF said “if one company were to achieve all the highest scores recorded” in each of the indicators, “it would reach more than 70 percent of the maximum achievable score.”

And similarly, the RMF said if one mine site “were to achieve all the highest scores seen for the asset-level indicators, it would score over 80 percent. All companies are encouraged to adopt more systematically the good practices already being demonstrated across the sector.”

Commitment Issues

Usually, good comes with the bad — and in the case of mining, it’s no different: The report noted a “modest overall improvement” by companies on many of the issues previously assessed in 2018. Albeit, “much of the improvement is due to companies making commitments, with markedly less evidence of progress in following up these commitments with concrete actions,” RMF said, adding that “the weakest results relate to companies’ efforts to track, review and act to improve the effectiveness of their actions on EESG issues.”

RMF explained, “So while commitments are a step in the right direction, the mining sector as a whole would benefit – both in terms of its performance and its trust-building with other stakeholders – from being able to demonstrate more consistent implementation of commitments across operational portfolios and across issues.”

The Bottom Line

And as it goes with most sustainability topics, transparency is critical — RMF said that not only was there little evidence of sharing mine-site-level information on issues of strong public interest for neighboring communities, workers, governments and investors, the organization was hard-pressed to find evidence of companies engaging with local stakeholders on important issues, inclusive of local procurement, grievance mechanisms or air and water quality, all according to RMF.

Of the 180 individual mine sites assessed, only one site scores more than 50 percent — the other 145 sites scored less than 20 percent, and 45 sites scored zero on all 10 indicators, the report said.

All in all, it boils down to the bottom line: “None of the companies [showed] consistent performance across the mine sites they own or operate.”

It is designed to improve the effectiveness, inclusiveness and sustainability of projects by facilitating dialogues between public and private sector partners. The SDG tool can be tailored to individual projects, responding to the priorities and challenges of different cities.

UN-Habitat is rolling it out across the 19 cities of the UK Foreign and Commonwealth’s Global Future Cities Prosperity Fund Programme. Developed for the 30 diverse urban projects of the Programme, the SDG Tool covers three thematic pillars; Urban Planning, Transport and Resilience.

Essentially, over the past few months, UN-Habitat and its partners, have conducted workshops with city authorities to tailor the SDG Tool for use in Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nigeria, the Philippines, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey and Vietnam.

In Nigeria, the SDG Tool sheds light on the importance of integrating transport modes and affordable housing when planning Transit-oriented Developments (TODs).

In Lagos, stakeholders pinpointed community engagement as imperative for successful Urban Renewal Guidelines; and in Istanbul, the tool sparked discussions on long-term financial strategies.

Following the tailoring of the SDG Tool for the 19 cities of the Global Future Cities Programme, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office alongside UN-Habitat and other public and private sector partners will use it to assess and positively influence how the 30 urban projects of the Programme are developing.

The launch event at the World Urban Forum and the workshops in the 19 cities revealed that many of them had developed a keen interest in making the SDG Tool available to more projects and cities.

UN-Habitat is therefore working on expanding the applicability of the SDG Tool and on refining it based on lessons learned from the Global Future Cities Programme.

Experts say young-adults from indigenous soceity are the most neglected and vulnerable group in Bangladesh

Addressing the obstacles faced by the younger generation in Bangladesh, especially from marginalized and indigenous parts of the society, will be a key to attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), said experts and activists.

Badiul Alam Majumdar, country director of the US-based charity The Hunger Project Bangladesh, said youths from indigenous soceity are the most neglected and vulnerable group in Bangladesh. “They are deprived largely in social, academic, employment and even cultural affairs.”

“In order to reflect and materialize the SDG focus of leaving no one behind, we must focus on diversity, tolerance, pluralism and the atmosphere of acceptance among some major measures, or else, they will not only get derailed but also get involved in extremism in numbers,” he warned.

The statements came up during a conference on Voluntary National Review (VNR) 2020 of Bangladesh: Positioning Non-State Actors, organized by Citizen’s Platform for SDGs, Bangladesh, at a hotel in Dhaka on Wednesday.

Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) Chairman Rehman Sobhan said the work being done by the government and non-government organizations (NGOs) for the SDG implementation implies how serious they are.

Through engaging in the process, the government attest to its obstacles and reliance on the NGOs, he said, adding: “But did it formally recognize the role the NGOs are putting in?”

Rehman insisted on much more coordination among the government and non-state actors in attaining the SDG, for which he termed the next five years as highly crucial.

The noted economist suggested the civil society to recognize its role in the process and act as a pressure group, especially on behalf of the marginalized people.

“By assembling data, it can evaluate what has been and needs to be done alongside holding the government accountable for the development activities for the SDG implementation,” he further said.

Shaheen Anam of the citizen’s platform said achieving the SDGs by 2030 does not solely depend on the government’s efforts; rather it is a process that involves all citizens of the country.

“And in doing so, we have to focus more on the theme of the SDGs and the 16th goal, engaging more and more youths in the process,” she opined.

“In the past, we massively neglected the young population despite the latter being our future. We hardly thought of resolving the challenges they face,” Shaheen said.

The young must get assistance and guidance from all since their activities will decide where the country will be heading towards in the future, she said.

Transparency International Bangladesh’s (TIB) Executive Director Iftekharuzzaman said the 16th goal of the SDGs may be hampered by politicization within the administration, the judiciary and authorities concerned.

He alleged that the space of civil society in the development process is being gradually shrunk since it is failing to raise its voice and criticize any irregularities in development projects.

“Even the young, in many cases, feel threatened only for dissenting on any graft in the development process, thus, refraining from participating in the dialoge for accountablity,” he said.

KM Abdus Salam, director-general of NGO Affairs Bureau, said the young have nothing to worry about in inclusive growth as the government believes in ensuring development for all.

The event was addressed, among others, by the citizen’s platform Coordinator Anisatul Fatema Yousuf, CPD Distinguished Fellow Mustafizur Rahman, and ActionAid Bangladesh Country Director Farah Kabir.","The statements came up during a conference on Voluntary National Review (VNR) 2020 of Bangladesh: Positioning Non-State Actors, organized by Citizen’s Platform for SDGs, Bangladesh, at a hotel in Dhaka on Wednesday.

61,https://www.independent.co.ug/the-sdg-imperative-for-business/,"Wed, 04 Mar 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Independent,The SDG imperative for business,"The financing gap to achieve the SDGs; between $500bn and $1.2tn, is beyond what many states can deliver

COMMENT | KARNIKA YADAV | There is only one road left to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set for Africa for 2030 and that’s through sustainable businesses. The sluggish progress to date has been primarily a consequence of ‘putting all our eggs in one basket’ and expecting the state to deliver the SDGs, which it cannot.

A prime obstacle in that is finance. The SDG Center for Africa estimates the financing gap to achieve the SDGs is running at between $500 billion and $1.2 trillion a year. That is simply beyond the reach of the public sector, with the Center estimating that delivering basic state functions of health care, education, water, energy, and road infrastructure requires more than 50 per cent of the GDP of most African countries.

However, for the private sector, pursuing the 2030 goals of eradicating Africa’s hunger, poverty, and inequality and improving healthcare will deliver its own rewards, creating business opportunities worth more than a trillion dollars a year, according to United Nation estimates.

In the absence of that private sector mobilisation, progress will remain achingly slow.

The 2019 Sustainable Development Goal Three-Year Reality Checker Report found only five countries in Africa – Seychelles, Mauritius, Morocco, Egypt and Algeria – that had met the SDG target of three per cent poverty by 2015.

Yet the problem is substantially one of mindset. For, while achieving the right policies and public investment is necessary for delivering the SDGs, we need to abandon the idea that it is enough and focus more rigorously on developing SDG aligned businesses.

It is not viable to expect nation states to achieve a tax take, or a debt load, of 50 per cent of GDP to deliver basic services when the continent is home to a vast informal sector that contributes no government revenue at all. That ‘basic needs’ bill is just unmeetable without a leap forward in business and GDP growth.

And just as public sector SDG success depends on private sector take-off, so too does the private sector’s success.

Investing in SDG-focused businesses, calculates the UN, would create over 85 million jobs in Africa by 2030, which would in turn create new consumers and new markets.

Indeed, even relatively small investments in SDG-focused businesses can produce huge returns. For instance, investing in agriculture technology to reduce food waste could generate $57 billion a year in additional revenues, based on evidence from Rwanda; where small metal silos or plastic crates have reduced post-harvest losses by over 60 per cent and increased smallholder farmers’ incomes by more than 30 per cent.

If private businesses collaborate with local governments to provide larger infrastructures, such as ports, oil and gas extractives, power plants and automotive, shared revenue of over $296 billion could be generated and nearly 16 million jobs, according to the UN’s estimates. There could be further benefits too from using local materials for such works.

Likewise, providing affordable housing, clean water and sanitation, infrastructure and energy solutions, such as solar lanterns and improved cooking stoves to urban dwellers, has a potential revenue value of $214 billion a year and could create over 32 million jobs.

Such growth is typical for businesses focused on achieving SDGs. Indeed, research conducted by the Business and Sustainable Development Commission (BSDC) shows that business that is focused in SDG areas also achieves more value locally.

For instance, reports the BSDC, 71 per cent of the value of food and agriculture businesses is retained in developing countries, 60 per cent of health and wellness businesses, 54 per cent of energy and materials, and 54 per cent of the value of upgrading and developing new cities.

Overall, business models that are directed towards achieving Africa’s SDGs have proven to work to the benefit of both consumers and businesses, which is why they lie at the heart of all we are doing at Intellecap and at next week’s 7th Sankalp Summit for entrepreneurs in Nairobi.

Our initiatives to support private sector SDG initiatives include research, partnerships and projects spanning ideal adaptive technologies, such as rural solar mini-grids; private sector capacity building among communities displaced by projects such as the Olkaria geothermal plant; and assisting small producers into value addition and niche markets, in tea, in bamboo, and multiple other high potential areas.

We have no doubt that without a recalibration of our private sector SDG efforts, the 2030 goals for Africa will go unmet, whereas if we now see and seize this opportunity, no African will be left untouched by the benefits borne of SDG-focused entrepreneurs.

The decision-making method is known as the “silence procedure,” a version of which Member States have already been using to reaching agreement informally.

On 27 March 2020, the UNGA adopted decision 74/544, titled ‘Procedure for taking decisions of the General Assembly during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.’ The decision notes “the limitations recommended on meetings within the United Nations premises as precautionary measures aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19.” Circulating the proposed decision for adoption, UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande said that from his consultations with the Assembly’s General Committee, “it is quite clear that we all agreed that, under the prevailing extraordinary circumstances, the General Assembly has to be able to take essential decisions related to the Organization.”

According to a step-by-step document on applying the silence procedure, the UNGA President will circulate a draft of a decision or resolution to all Member States, specifying the deadline for raising an objection and allowing at least 72 hours. At the same time, the draft is to be made available on the UN’s Official Document System in all official languages, except in extraordinary circumstances. Any information from the Secretariat on programme budgetary implications is to be circulated at the same time.

To make an objection, Member States can send a letter or Note Verbale via email to the UNGA President. The President will inform all Member States that the silence has been broken. The President then may choose to refer the draft decision/resolution and the objections to: the sponsors of the text; the co-facilitators of the UNGA-mandated processes for the 74th session; the Chair of the originating Committee; the Office of the UNGA President; or a facilitator designated by the President to lead further consultations. Any revised drafts would follow another round of the silence procedure.

If there are no objections within the specified time period, the UNGA President will circulate a letter confirming adoption. The step-by-step process also includes options for making an explanation of position. The document indicates that it is not technically possible to hold a vote under this temporary procedure.

All decisions and resolutions adopted via the silence procedure will be noted by the UNGA plenary at its first possible meeting in the General Assembly Hall.

For ECOSOC, on 1 April 2020, taking into account the UNGA’s agreement on the methodology, President Mona Juul circulated a proposal enabling the Council to adopt decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Council adopted Decision 2020/205 on 3 April, and the procedure is in effect until the end of May 2020 unless extended through the same procedure.

According to the step-by-step guide, when the ECOSOC president intends to circulate a draft decision or resolution under the silence procedure, she will first consult the Bureau. Bureau members will then consult with the members of their respective regional group. The document notes that information about this consultation will be posted on ECOSOCPlace before a proposal is sent on silence procedure.

The draft is to be circulated to all Members of the Council with copy to all other Member States for their information, under a silence procedure of at least 72 hours. If the silence is not broken, the decision is considered adopted.

If objections are raised, the ECOSOC President may choose to refer the text and the objections to: the Vice-President responsible for coordinating matters under the item concerned; the sponsors; the co-facilitators of the ECOSOC processes for the current session; the Chair of the originating subsidiary body; or a facilitator to lead further consultations.

Other steps in the procedure are similar to those under the UNGA procedure, including the circulation of programme budgetary implications and the placing of the draft text into the UN’s document system in all official languages. Like in the UNGA, all decisions taken through the silence procedure will be noted at the first plenary meeting held “after the cessation of the precautionary measures as soon as the circumstances allow.” [UN News story on UNGA silence procedure] [All COVID-19 updates from ECOSOC President]","The decision-making method is known as the “silence procedure,” a version of which Member States have already been using to reaching agreement informally.

64,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/in-updated-ndc-chile-aligns-climate-and-sustainable-development-agendas/,"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"In Updated NDC, Chile Aligns Climate and Sustainable Development Agendas","Chile has submitted its updated nationally determined contribution (NDC) to the UNFCCC, following submission of its first NDC in 2015. Under the Paris Agreement on climate change, countries agreed to prepare and communicate an updated NDC every five years to reflect progress towards their climate objectives. Chile’s updated NDC, submitted on 9 April 2020, seeks to align international climate commitments with guidelines and instruments proposed under the country’s Climate Change Framework Bill. It also establishes intermediate adaptation and mitigation goals for 2030.

The updated NDC recognizes the importance of aligning the climate and sustainable development agendas. It includes an innovative social pillar that ties together mitigation, adaptation, and integration commitments, focusing on a just transition and the SDGs. As part of this component, Chile commits to guide implementation of its NDC actions based on: synergies with the SDGs, with each commitment contributing to the fulfillment of one or more SDG; just transition needs; water security; gender equity; nature-based solutions; inclusion of indigenous and other traditional knowledge; public participation; and cost efficiency.

Chile will establish a mechanism to measure, report, and verify that these criteria are applied. It intends to develop, by 2021, a ‘Strategy for Just Transition’ that protects the rights of the most vulnerable in decarbonizing the energy matrix.

The update presents an increase in ambition to reach the Paris Agreement objective, in line with a path towards carbon neutrality by 2050 and consistent with what Chile promoted and highlighted during COP 25 in 2019. The updated NDC replaces the previous emission intensity indicator, with a GHG emissions level goal of 95 MtCO2eq by 2030, an emissions peak by 2025, and a carbon budget not exceeding 1,100 MtCO2eq for the period 2020-2030. In 2020, Chile will establish a public-private dialogue roundtable to define policy for the use of markets, taking into account guidelines that preserve environmental integrity, avoid double-counting, and promote sustainable development.

Another new element in the updated NDC is the integration of climate and clean air policies, and the mitigation of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs). Chile commits to reduce total black carbon emissions by at least 25% by 2030.

On adaptation, the update establishes targets related to water management, sanitation, and disaster risk management (DRM), including the development of indicators to set regional and organizational-level water security goals, and water management at the watershed level. Specific contributions include:

updating existing studies and analysis on climate vulnerability and risk in Chile;

strengthening the inclusion of non-governmental actors in planning and implementing adaptation measures;

strengthening, by 2026, the current monitoring and evaluation system with indicators on adaptation;

enhancing information mechanisms for managing the climate impacts on water resources; and

strengthening capacity to adapt to climate-related risks and manage the effects of socio-natural disasters.

Chile’s updated NDC also highlights synergies between mitigation and adaptation actions through an “integration component” that emphasizes the role of oceans and coastal wetlands, circular economy, forests, peatlands, and ecosystems. This component details commitments that will be implemented in the 2020-2030 period, the delivery of which must also consider the unique circumstances and requirements arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Commitments include: developing a Circular Economy Roadmap for 2020 to 2040; developing a national organic waste strategy to increase the recovery of organic waste generated at the municipal level; and generating and implementing circularity metrics and indicators to monitor the country’s progress.

On forests, the updated NDC doubles the scale of Chile’s previous forest management and reforestation targets, and adds new forest degradation and landscape restoration commitments. It emphasizes: sustainably managing and restoring 200,000 hectares of native forests by 2030; reducing emissions from degradation and deforestation of native forest by 25% by 2030; and, by 2021, developing a national landscape restoration plan, which will incorporate 1,000,000 hectares into the restoration process.

The NDC addresses emissions from peatlands for the first time. It makes plans for creating a national inventory by 2025 and setting indicators for evaluating peatlands’ adaptation and mitigation capacity by 2030.



Explicitly integrating ocean protection in its NDC, Chile will: establish new protected areas in at least 10% of its under-represented marine ecoregions; protect at least 20 coastal wetlands by 2025 and at least ten additional ones by 2030; develop and implement management plans in all marine protected areas (MPAs) that were created before 2020; and strengthen mitigation and adaptation co-benefits of different ecosystems in MPAs.



On implementation measures, Chile will, in 2020:

develop a Strategy for Capacity Development and Climate Empowerment to strengthen the capacities of citizens and organizations to achieve national climate targets;

present its Climate Change Technology Transfer and Development Strategy; and

update its Financial Strategy on Climate Change to, inter alia, promote the design and implementation of financial green instruments.

Consider blood donation campaigns. In most countries of the world, donating blood is voluntary. To raise donations, governments and health agencies traditionally appeal to social responsibility and a sense of civic solidarity, sometimes even providing incentives.

Imagine instead a scenario where the principal pitch-line of a donation campaign was that it remains a “voluntary” initiative, and citizens can always find “alternative” ways to express their civic responsibility. The likely result would be to discourage the noble action of blood donation.

This resembles the situation we are witnessing with the global SDG indicator framework. Following the most pessimistic declaration to date by the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) in September 2019, in which it noted with great alarm that the world is “off track” to meeting most of the SDGs, the response by the UN Statistical Commission at its latest session on 3-6 March 2020 was to tepidly “reiterate that the application of the global indicator framework is a voluntary and country-led process and that alternative or complementary indicators for national and subnational levels of monitoring will be developed at national level on the basis of national priorities, realities, capacities and circumstances.”

The SDGs are a shared responsibility that is articulated in concrete actions, measured first and foremost by the global SDG indicators.

Why does the Commission take pains to repeat that the global indicator framework is a voluntary process, and why is it sanctioning the use of alternative indicators?

Importance of Monitoring the Global Indicators

The development and review of the global SDG indicator framework has been an arduous process that has lasted over five years and required the concerted effort of the entire international statistical community. The Commission’s seemingly paradoxical approach of downplaying its importance may be the result of objections from a small number of countries to certain SDG indicators or to their methodological specifications. Rather than tackle this handful of cases head-on, the Commission appears to have preferred portraying the entire SDG indicator framework as less binding, including allowing for “alternative” indicators and continuing to refer to it as “work in progress.”

Nobody is debating the fact the 2030 Agenda as a whole, and the SDG indicators in particular, are a voluntary commitment. But by constantly reiterating the voluntary nature of the global indicator framework, without advocating for its use for the purpose of global monitoring, the UN Statistical Commission – the highest intergovernmental decision-making body in statistics – sends an ambiguous message to countries that risks doing a disservice to the 2030 Agenda.

In our previous article published on this blog, we highlighted how poor SDG data are leading to poor implementation of the 2030 Agenda’s global commitments. In that article, we also suggested a number of pragmatic measures to tackle the huge data gaps, beginning with the need for the UN Statistical Commission to urge countries to monitor the global SDG indicator framework. Unfortunately, when the Commission met in March 2020 for its annual session, it missed this opportunity.

Alternative Indicators, Risky Substitutions

The Commission’s open invitation for countries to use “alternative” indicators may have serious consequences for global SDG reporting. To some readers, the terms alternative and complementary may at first glance appear almost equivalent. However, there is a profound difference between the two. To complement the global indicator framework with regional and/or national indicators means that countries should ostensibly report global indicators as the starting point, yet they are also free to deploy additional indicators for more specific purposes. By contrast, suggesting that “alternative” indicators can be developed effectively gives countries a blank cheque to substitute global indicators with different national indicators.

As we also noted in our previous article, alternative national indicators are invariably incomparable with global indicators, and this directly undermines the principle of mutual accountability on which the 2030 Agenda is built. There are no established criteria or procedures for determining when and how to substitute global indicators with national indicators, which leaves the door open to arbitrary choices. More importantly, when countries do not produce the official global indicators at national level, it becomes impossible to compile regional and global aggregates and thereby gain a sense of the world’s progress towards implementing the SDGs.

By allowing countries to develop “alternative” indicators, the UN Statistical Commission has overlooked associated risks, as well as the sage advice of the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on the Millennium Development Goal indicators (IAEG-MDG) – the predecessor mechanism to today’s IAEG-SDG. In its seminal report on Lessons Learned from MDG Monitoring from a Statistical Perspective, the IAEG-MDG noted one of the key weaknesses of the MDG monitoring framework was the fact that “discrepancies between national and international data, due to, among others, different methodologies, definitions, different choice of data sources, or time gap in release dates, created problems at the national level and tension in the international statistical community.”

The other challenge with using “alternative” instead of “complementary” indicators is that it may amount to a reinterpretation of UN Resolution 70/1 (by which the UN General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development). Paragraph 75 states that: “global indicators…will be complemented by indicators at the regional and national levels which will be developed by Member States.”

The term “alternative” does not figure at all in the 2030 Agenda or its associated UNGA resolution. In introducing this term, with the real and not merely semantic implications explained above, the UN Statistical Commission has set a questionable precedent by blurring the boundaries between the roles of legislator and statistician.

Time is Running Out to Measure SDG Indicators

With a little over ten years left until the end of 2030, and an unenviable track record so far, half-hearted efforts and mixed messages will not get us to the finish line. A bold and unambiguous statement is needed to remind all actors that the SDGs are a shared responsibility that is articulated in concrete actions, which are measured, first and foremost, by the global SDG indicators.

The World Bank aims to expand the initiative into a global initiative that can provide solutions to implement circular economy principles in wastewater projects around the world. The World Bank stresses that safely managed water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services are essential in preventing disease and protecting human health, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lessons learned from the LAC region’s experience suggest four key actions to achieve a paradigm shift in the wastewater sector.

First, the report recommends planning wastewater treatment within the river basin to maximize benefits, improve efficiency and resource allocation, and engage stakeholders.

Second, the report calls for moving from wastewater treatment plants towards water resource recovery facilities. The report argues countries need to “recognize the real value of wastewater and the potential resources that can be extracted from it”, including clean water, energy and nutrients.

Third, the report proposes implementing innovative financing and business models, including efficient subsidies.

Fourth, the report suggests implementing necessary policy, institutional and regulatory frameworks to facilitate a shift towards reuse and resource recovery and a circular economy.

Case studies in the report share best practices and highlight programs and projects that promote implementation of circular economy principles. Cases range from the potential for generating energy from anaerobic ponds in Bolivia to the generation and sale of biogas in Chile, which has generated an annual net profit of US$1 million for the wastewater treatment plant. A case from Egypt describes the role of public private partnerships in fostering wastewater reuse and increasing wastewater coverage. Cases from Peru and South Africa focus on wastewater reuse for industrial purposes: the wastewater plant in Cusco, Peru, saves USD230,000 annually by transporting biosolids for compost and avoiding landfill fees. These and other examples in the report showcase “what’s possible when governments at all levels apply circular economy principles to their wastewater challenges.”

The World Bank’s Water Global Practice Global Director, Jennifer Sara, stressed wastewater treatment for reuse “is part of the solution to water scarcity and pollution problems.” She emphasized that treated wastewater can be used to replace freshwater for industrial practices, irrigation or recreational purposes.

In presenting the report’s findings, Diego Juan Rodriguez, author of the report and a World Bank Senior Water Resources Management Specialist, said wastewater “should not be considered a ‘waste’ anymore, but a resource.” He highlighted the potential to transform sanitation from a costly service to one that is “self sustaining and adds value to the economy,” explaining such actions can also help countries bridge the funding gap to achieve the SDGs.","The World Bank has reported on findings from an initiative on innovative use and reuse of wastewater.

The note argues that the pandemic offers Asia-Pacific governments a chance to build resilience through strengthened and systemic health and social protection measures for all.

The policy note titled, ‘The Impact and Policy Responses for COVID-19 in Asia and the Pacific,’ observes impacts from COVID-19 on the region’s economic activities, demographics, and urbanization, as well as negative impacts on SDG progress. The region is home to over two-thirds of the global population, the world’s most populous cities, over 46 million migrants, and the bulk of the world’s energy supply and consumption and industrial activities. Initial measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 have reduced aggregate demand, particularly on service sectors, such as civil aviation, hospitality, retail, and tourism, and on international demand for commodities, especially oil.

On the economy, the authors call for short-term economic responses to “prioritize people over economic recovery.” Immediate and large fiscal measures are then required to contain COVID-19, cure people, and ensure economic and financial stability. Among the country-specific examples of fiscal support, the note highlights that Hong Kong, China, and Singapore have launched funds to subsidize individual sectors, such as food, retail, transport, and tourism. The authors recommend that countries facilitate cross-border movement of essential medicines, medical equipment and teams, and other essential goods, while also removing tariffs and non-tariff measures.

Stimulus packages should not support business behaviors that contribute to environmental degradation.

On the environment, the note finds that measures to contain COVID-19 have resulted in reductions of “15 to 40 percent in output across key industrial sectors in China alone,” with coal consumption 3% lower and satellite-based nitrogen dioxide levels 3% lower. The authors observe that this “dramatic drop” of nitrogen dioxide emissions “demonstrates how much drastically reducing transport and industrial activity can impact emissions.” The note recommends policy measures grounded in sustainability to both fight COVID-19 and enable the Asia-Pacific region to address climate change and sustainable development, such as government stimulus packages to accelerate decarbonization and greening of the economy, including sustainable mobility. In addition, the note cautions that stimulus packages should not support business behaviors that contribute to environmental degradation. The note further recommends regional cooperation to ban illegal trade of wildlife, stop habitat loss, and adopt international sanitary standards.

On social impacts, the note highlights health inequalities in the Asia-Pacific region, including 1.6 billion people who lack access to basic sanitation, and 260 million who lack access to clean water at home, therefore hindering their ability to employ frequent handwashing as a preventive measure against COVID-19. The note also observes the vulnerability of older people, persons with disabilities, and migrant workers to the virus. The authors recommend placing vulnerable populations at the center of social policy reform packages in the short- and medium-term, including by establishing systems for universal health care and universal social protection. In the long-term, the note suggests that countries invest in strengthening social protection and enhancing emergency preparedness to minimize the impact of future health emergencies and enhance resilience of economies. The authors also suggest investing in reducing the digital divide, observing that digital communication has played a key role in enabling social distancing.

Finally, the note draws attention to potential regional cooperation to establish a public health emergency fund and coordinate debt relief measures. ESCAP and other UN bodies could manage an emergency fund to help mobilize financial resources at the regional level and provide targeted support for countries most affected by the virus, the note suggests.

The guidebook provides practical “how-to” guidance for SAIs in auditing their respective countries’ SDG implementation. The IDI SDGs Audit Model (ISAM) adheres to five principles: focus on outcomes; recognize SAI diversity; base the guidance on International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs); inclusiveness; and add value.

For the purposes of the SDGs Audit Model, an audit of SDG implementation is defined as a “performance audit that focuses on the achievement of nationally-agreed targets linked to the SDG targets.” It does not focus on entities, projects, programs, or processes. Instead, it focuses on the interplay between the entities, projects, programs, and processes for the achievement of cross-cutting results. The audit methodology presented in the guidebook focuses on the achievement of outcomes while also encouraging audit institutions to mainstream actions for enhancing impact throughout the audit process.

The guidebook includes chapters on how to select topics for audits, how to design an audit of SDG implementation, how to draft a report that has an impact, and how to follow up on the audit. It also includes sections addressing how to audit a government’s efforts related to coherence and integration, multi-stakeholder engagement, efforts to ensure no one is left behind, and policies related to the achievement of a national target.

The ISAM encourages SAIs to focus on the “leave no one behind” principle underlying the 2030 Agenda as a key consideration in defining audits of SDG implementation and throughout the audit process.

The English version of the ISAM was launched on 31 March 2020. It is currently available in English and Spanish. It will be translated into Arabic and French prior to June 2020. The ISAM will be updated based on lessons learned during pilot audits and other feedback.

Since its launch in March 2018, approximately 686 tonnes of waste have been shipped from eligible Pacific islands and territories for treatment and recycling in suitable ports in the Asia-Pacific region.

The Partnership between SPREP and the China Navigation Company (CNCo), also known as SWIRE Shipping, allows for CNCo vessels to carry, free of charge, containers of recyclable waste from eligible ports in Pacific island countries and territories that have insufficient or inappropriate landfill space to store waste, have inadequate waste treatment facilities, and lack financial capacity to ship recyclable waste.

Kosi Latu, Director General of SPREP, has described the Moana Taka Partnership as a “paddle in the right direction” towards tackling the “immense waste management challenge” in Pacific islands.

The focus of the Partnership is on non-commercial waste streams and the types of materials that are considered recyclable, including plastics, aluminum cans, waste oil, and ozone depleting substances. Twenty-one Pacific island countries and territories are eligible to participate in the scheme.

Examples of shipments of recyclable waste made thus far include: six containers of scrap metal from Samoa and Papua New Guinea; nine containers of plastic waste from Fiji; three containers of used oil from the Marshall Islands; and 16 containers of varied waste contents from Fiji.

The Partnership contributes to implementation of the Pacific Regional Waste and Pollution Management Strategy 2016-2015, ‘Cleaner Pacific 2025,’ a “comprehensive long-term strategy for integrated sustainable waste management and pollution prevention and control in the Pacific islands region until 2025.” Priority areas for management outlined in the Strategy include municipal solid waste, asbestos, electrical and electronic waste (e-waste), healthcare waste, chemicals (such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), ozone depleting substances, and mercury), used oil and lubricants, marine litter, ship-sourced pollution, disaster waste, and liquid waste (such as sewage and trade waste).

As such, the initiative forms an important contribution towards achieving SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and Article 10 (Disposal of Waste) of the Noumea Convention for the Protection of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region and Related Protocols.

According to the fund giant, which came under the spotlight last year over its engagement with climate issues, the high conviction equity strategy gives investors access to businesses that are “helping to address major world challenges”, and that are advancing the UN’s ‘Sustainable Development Goals’ (SDGs).

The portfolio focuses on a broad spread of themes including access to quality education and affordable housing, and developing healthcare innovation to help with societal challenges such as the current Covid-19 pandemic which has caused over 130,000 deaths worldwide at the time of writing.

The actively managed fund will also search for growth in firms that are pushing for financial and digital inclusion, preventing climate change, reversing environmental degradation, and increasing efficiencies in water usage and deployment, the US asset manager said in a statement.

According to portfolio manager and head of active equities impact investing, Eric Rice, who joined BlackRock last year, impact investing is becoming more popular as investors ""increasingly require their investment targets to advance their sustainability objectives"".

“Launching the fund during the Covid-19 pandemic has further highlighted the important role companies play in society. Covid-19 is one of the greatest societal challenges the world faces right now, and we see impact investing playing a meaningful role in how we overcome it,” he said.

He added that capital from the fund will be invested in companies focused on medical diagnostic tools and vaccines to combat the coronavirus crisis, as well as ""crisis mass notification systems"" and microloans.

SDGs, a collection of 17 global goals, were set in 2015 by the UN with the intention of creating a “blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all”.

71,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/dag-hammarskjold-foundation-paints-picture-on-art-of-un-leadership/,"Tue, 07 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Dag Hammarskjöld Foundation Paints Picture on Art of UN Leadership,"A publication by the Dag Hammarskjöld Foundation on leadership aims to stimulate the conversation on how UN leadership culture, policies and practices can be enhanced to ensure the UN’s relevance and strengthen its impact—particularly at a time when the multilateralism is being tested.

The forward, by Henrik Hammargren, notes that defining “leadership” can be a difficult task, but identifies four characteristics: 1) that it can be both constructive and destructive and therefore must be scrutinized; 2) that it should not be condensed to a particular set of skills; 3) that it is often confused with—or reduced to—management capability; and 4) that the public discourse is too narrowly-focused on the individual, and should also recognize collective responsibility and action.

Making the case for the relevance of UN leadership in the current context, the report offers five precepts that provide a framing for 26 written contributions:

The responsibility of the UN and its mandate: leaders in the UN must act in the midst of—and in response to—endemic poverty, climate change, armed conflicts and human rights violations, and uphold the UN charter in the face of resistance The recognition that no one has a monopoly of knowledge over ‘leadership’: the voices and viewpoints expressed by the individual thoughtpieces differ, each offering their own perspective The relationship between leadership and management: noting the above caveat, leadership encompasses management, but the latter can be taught, learned or otherwise implemented, whereas leadership builds on a variety of other traits spanning ethics, integrity and courage Leadership is not just at the top: leadership is to be sought, enabled and nurtured at all levels of the organization, across a wide range of professional profiles Anchoring decisions in today’s realities: recognizing that past inspirations regularly surface, the report avoids a “golden age” or “what would Hammarskjöld have done” sentimentality, recalling his words that, “Your duty, your reward – your destiny – are here and now.”

The report organizes contributions beginning with a broad exploration of what principled leadership at the UN entails, and how leadership can build consensus to address global challenges and strengthen multilateralism. The second chapter describes lessons learned from, and attributes of, individual leaders, featuring inspirational stories and an exploration of the question, “who would you want to work for?” The report’s third chapter explores the institutional role of UN leadership in coalition-building, the relevance of feminist leadership to the UN, and the relationships between innovation and leadership. The final chapter takes stock of current leadership initiatives undertaken in the wake of the adoption of the UN System Leadership Framework, and utilizes data related to UN human resources functions to revisit past assumptions and review “unexamined symptoms of ailing leadership.”

Better leadership is essential not only for ensuring trust in the UN—and in multilateralism more broadly—but also for effectively responding to today’s global challenges, the report argues. It highlights a tension between realism and idealism, where leaders must uphold universal values and principles, but also must hold governments and people to account, which involves a unique set of risks and pressures. These pressures, the report recognizes, demand that a leader demonstrate grit and courage, but also humility, compassion and empathy.

The report concludes with three emergent learnings: for leadership to grow, failures must be recognized and discussed; further stock must be taken on the UN Leadership Framework’s implementation across a fragmented UN system; and if the UN is to be impactful beyond New York or Geneva, reflections on leadership must be shared beyond these spheres, going past inward-looking perspectives to include external experiences and stakeholders.

The publication’s focus on UN leadership derives from three factors: 1) the UN reform process, of which strengthening leadership features as a core pillar; 2) turbulence, where the UN is being questioned and having its contributions and budgets reduced; and 3) historical, as 2019 marked the “centennial anniversary of the international civil servant” and the founding of the League of nations. Additionally, this September will feature a celebration of the UN’s 75th anniversary, a key theme of which will be multilateralism.

In 2020, to mark its 75th anniversary, the United Nations have initiated UN75, the largest and most inclusive global conversation on how to build a better future.

The initiative intends to map out what works and what doesn’t within the framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. When calling for global participation in the conversation, UN Secretary-General António Guterres remarked that no country can solve the complex global challenges on its own. Participation is pivotal to shaping the future we want.

And 2020 will be a year of great importance: there are just 10 years left to achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda.

The goals, adopted by all countries in 2015, constitute a universal roadmap for the world and represent a shared commitment for people, planet and prosperity. Among its key aims, the 2030 Agenda includes bringing to life a low-carbon, climate-smart economy, ending extreme poverty and hunger, and promoting peace, just societies and gender equality. All of which must be accomplished within the next decade.

Doing so necessitates concrete action to be taken now to safeguard the progress made over the past five years.

To deliver on the 2030 Agenda, stakeholders, stretching across sectors, societies and countries, require greater mobilisation — a point made by UN Deputy Secretary-General, Amina J Mohammed, when briefing Member States on the Decade of Action in late 2019. She acknowledged that “game-changing transformation” has yet to occur. Gender inequality, the climate crisis, poverty and hunger, corruption and numerous other obstacles still haunt and hinder us.

Unpacking the Decade of Action

Under the umbrella of the Decade of Action, the UN has identified three action points: mobilisation, ambition and concrete solutions. Governments and other actors need to showcase good practices and address their failures.

These three action points resonate with the SDG Lab at UN Geneva, and strike at the chord of the Lab’s DNA. As a relative newcomer in the sustainable development space, the Lab acts by serving as a connector, an amplifier, a question-asker and an innovator.

The SDG Lab’s role

The SDG Lab leverages the convening power of the UN. It brings together governments, actors from the UN system, civil society, academia and the private sector, and offers a neutral space to advance the SDGs. The role of the Lab is increasingly relevant in disseminating SDG solutions.

Among the key initiatives that the Lab has spearheaded is its work in connecting the expertise and resources of the finance and development communities. Development finance is taking a new turn. More investors are looking to drive capital for impact, and to integrate social and environmental aspects into their investment processes. Both communities acknowledge that much more can be achieved together than separately.

New sustainable finance projects have been developed in the Geneva ecosystem. One such project is the “Pipeline Builder” that aims to bridge the need for investment at country level with actors who want to drive more capital for greater impact. Another concept that is being explored is an initiative that would facilitate SDG financing by strategically utilising public and philanthropic capital to incentivise the mobilisation of additional private finance.

Bridges for sustainable finance

In 2019, the SDG Lab, together with 50 partners, held Switzerland’s first-ever Building Bridges Week (buildingbridgesweek.ch). The event’s ambition was to help influential financial players gain exposure to sustainable development and insight into impactful investments.

The Week also tapped into the growing fatigue with the “business as usual” attitude. Many citizens have pressing demands for new investment models aligned with the 2030 Agenda. They want to see their money make a difference, as well as financial returns.

In the spirit of the Decade of Action, initiatives such as these help to mobilise the SDG actors of international Geneva and beyond, boost ambitions and provide SDG solutions.

In line with the momentum of UN75, the SDG Lab will continue to do its part to accelerate implementation of the goals.

There's a little more padding as well, but it's still fairly firm and supportive enough for the long days of EWS racing (remember racing?).



The SM Enduro isn't as shockingly light as some in this list, but the prices are a lot less stratospheric, too. A saddle is a wear item on an enduro bike, so maybe not spending a week's salary on one is a good idea. And to that end, it's got tough-feeling material around the back and sides of the saddle as well.



The flat portions of the rails are longer than others to help nail your seat position. This is a super nice detail for taller riders who often end up with slack effective seat-tube angles once their saddle height is correct. More adjustability is a big help for them.



The oil slick colorway available on the Comp model will be polarizing, but they all come in normal colors as well. Without the oil slick, it's a sleek-looking silhouette, and no surprise we'll be seeing it on a lot of enduro riders' bikes this year.","Ergon has been at the forefront of a lot of the current saddle thinking—raised areas at the back, flat overall profiles, etc., and the new (ish) SM Enduro adds ""overall shorter"" to the list.

“We are preparing for an increase in call volume over the next few weeks to months,” Bill Lister told reporters Friday afternoon.

He also urged people to only call 911 for real emergencies like a heart attack or stroke. This is similar to the measures put in place during the 2018 municipal strike.

Lister says call volumes are actually down right now – about 28 to 41 calls per day since March 12 – partly because hospitals have stopped elective surgeries and doctors are not taking non-essential appointments, leading to fewer ambulance transport calls.

The long term average is about 49 calls per day.

Lister is projecting, at the height of the COVID-19 outbreak, we could “see upwards of around 60 calls per day. That’s what we’re planning on, when we reach the peak in this pandemic,” he told Cornwall Newswatch.

Cornwall-SDG Paramedic Services has 66 full-time and around 54 part-time paramedics. Lister says they are going to be hiring another 12-20 part-time paramedics in short order in anticipation of the projected uptick in calls.

As for the health of the paramedics on staff now, Lister says there are some showing flu-like symptoms. “We’ve have a few medics tested (for COVID-19) but we don’t have the results back yet. The medics that aren’t at work have mild symptoms like sore throat, runny rose, that type of thing. We have nobody severely ill that we’re able to attribute directly to COVID-19,” he told Newswatch.

As for how the public should handle calling 911, the chief says people should only call “when they really need one (an ambulance)”.

In addition to the symptoms of heart attack or stroke, Lister says you should call if it feels “like you ran a marathon just getting up off the couch.”

“We’re trying to save the resources for the sickest people,” he said.","SD&G – The head of Cornwall-SDG Paramedic Services says they will be hiring more paramedics shortly to meet the anticipated demand of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Article content Despite 2020 not being halfway done, it already appears the year will be disastrous for several local fairs, many of them being cancelled over COVID-19 safety concerns. It was announced on April 15 the Maxville Fair had been cancelled. Every year, the Maxville Fair is the first to take place, setting the stage for other such fairs in Chesterville, South Mountain, Avonmore, Stormont and Williamstown. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Some SDG fairs already cancelled due to COVID-19 Back to video “I think this is the first time it’s been cancelled,” said Steve Rolland, president of the Maxville Fair’s board of directors. “It was a very hard decision to take. All the directors voted on it through email because we couldn’t get together.” During an interview with the Standard-Freeholder, Rolland said the difficult decision was made in order to protect local residents who take part in the fair. “We actually start planning the fair before April,” Rolland said. “That’s why we took the decision to cancel it this year. This whole pandemic doesn’t seem to be getting any better. Our fair is based on our community.

Article content “We didn’t want anyone getting sick.” Despite the cancellation of the 132 year-old fair, the president expressed hope for the future,. “We’re going to plan for 2021,” Rolland said. “We’re going to try and overcome this and try to make it better for next year. We’re not sure how this is going to affect next year’s fair, but hopefully the sponsors and everyone else understand.” The Avonmore Fair also recently announced its board of directors had taken the decision to cancel this year’s edition. This year’s fair would’ve taken place in July and would’ve marked the 160th anniversary of the event. “The decision to cancel our fair, like many fair boards are having to consider, was not an easy one,” read a statement on the fair’s website. “2020 marks our 160th year and we were excited to share it with you. Instead, we will celebrate it at our fair in 2021. We appreciate the hard work of our volunteers, as well as the support of our community and we are looking forward to the 2021 Avonmore Fair.” The president of the Williamstown Fair said its board had not yet made up his mind regarding the possible cancellation of the event. Williamstown is the longest-running fair in Ontario, spanning over 200 years. This year, it is slated to take place from Aug. 7-9. “While preparations have started, we are closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic situation at this time,” said president Mike Seguin. “We know that some people are wondering whether there will be a fair this summer. Although it is not business as usual, we believe that it is premature to make a decision on the fate of this year’s fair.

Article content “Any decisions we make will be in keeping with the directives and recommendations of public health agencies and government.” Other fairs that are to be held in August have yet to issue announcements of cancellations. This includes the South Mountain Fair. The Mountain Township Agricultural Society, which organizes the latter, remained optimistic. The board had yet to cancel the event scheduled from Aug. 13-16, stating it was still evaluating all the factors that might impact holding the event. It also cited that it was awaiting further guidance from government and public health officials before making a decision. The Chesterville Fair, which is set to take place from Aug. 26-28, as well as the Stormont County Fair, to take place from Sept. 4-7, had also not issued any announcements as of Thursday. fracine@postmedia.com twitter.com/FrancisRacine

For the pilot accelerator, it has selected 11 startups from across Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).

The program, which has been moved online for the time due to the pandemic, which run for 5 months, beginning from April 21.

Due to the current corona crisis all physical elements (e.g. workshops, events) of the program have been transformed into a virtual version in order to support both the startups and the people behind them. All 11 finalists will now have access to a five-months accelerator program provided by Google for Startups. Google

Out of the 11 startups selected, mDoc, a Nigerian healthcare startup that uses technology to make health services more accessible to people is one.

Here is what mDoc does

mDoc provides 24 hours support to people in sub-Saharan Africa with chronic diseases. It does this by connecting people through a virtual network to healthcare service providers using its app.

Through its tech platform, mDoc has a secured centralized repository of users’ healthcare information and uses it to connect them to various practitioners such as nutritionists and coaches.

The experts, in turn, help users with their health goals. They also help people find quality in-person healthcare when needed.

mDoc’s geo-coded database of healthcare providers makes it easy for users to access quality health care from different parts of Africa using their health information which can be updated and monitored on mDoc’s app.

Why was mDoc selected?

Besides its laudable operations and using tech to deliver quality services, the health startup was selected because its services align with one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as outlined by the United Nations.

By tackling the problem of access to quality healthcare and support for people with chronic disease, mDoc is working to realize SDG number 3 in Africa.

Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 3

As a part of the accelerator, mDoc will work with Google engineers. The startup will equally have access to mentoring from over 20 teams at Google, as well as outside experts and local mentors.

The survey will remain open until 31 July 2020.

The Campaign for a Decade of Accountability is a multi-stakeholder partnership to aims to “bolster concerted action and amplify efforts to hold duty bearers to account for their commitments to sustainable development in a coordinated manner.” Advisory Group members to the Campaign include the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), the UN Global Compact, and World Vision. The Campaign is complementary to the UN’s Decade of Action and Delivery for the SDGs.

Survey respondents are asked to: rank specific challenges to accountability for the SDGs in their country, and indicate support needed to address them; comment on expected impacts of COVID-19 on SDG accountability in their country; share information on their country’s platforms enabling stakeholders to engage with the SDG accountability; and how global processes can help to advance SDG accountability. The survey also requests examples and case studies on specific actions that have been undertaken to enhance SDG accountability.

Inputs collected through the survey will feed into the forthcoming ‘Global SDG Accountability Report’ with recommendations for advancing accountability for the 2030 Agenda. The survey is available in Arabic, English, French, and Spanish.

Also on advancing accountability, the Transparency, Accountability and Participation (TAP) Network and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH (GIZ) launched a publication analyzing how nine countries’ voluntary national reviews (VNRs) have addressed SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), in comparison with how civil society reports have done so, over a two-year period. The publication provides recommendations for stakeholders to enable stronger and more inclusive reporting for SDG 16 in subsequent reporting cycles, including:

Integrate findings from civil society reports into VNR reports;

Scale up reporting, monitoring, and review of SDG 16-related actions, such as: measures to mainstream SDG 16 into development plans, collection and use of data, including non-official sources, and targeted policies with a focus on leaving no one behind;

Establish platforms for civil society representatives to regularly engage with government on issues relevant for sustainable development;

Use existing platforms (HLPF, regional economic commissions’ fora for sustainable development, expert group meetings on specific SDGs) to encourage dedicated awareness raising, peer exchange and global learning; and

Increase comparability of civil society reports, possibly through templates and other guidance.

The report draws on the latest available data on the indicators contained in the global SDG indicator framework as of April 2020. It also highlights implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on each SDG.

The 2020 SDG Progress Report finds “continued unevenness of progress” and identifies areas where significant improvement is required. Areas of progress until the end of 2019 included declining global poverty, falling rates of maternal and child mortality, access to electricity for more people, and the development of more national sustainable development policies and signing of international agreements for environmental protection. At the same time, progress was stalled or reversed on the number of people suffering from hunger, the rate of climate change, and increasing inequalities.

Progress is stalled or reversed on inequalities, the rate of climate change, and the number of people going hungry.

The report enumerates impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on groups of people and operations around the world, and how those effects are “imperiling progress” towards the SDGs. It reports that least developed countries (LDCs), land-locked developing countries (LLDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and countries in humanitarian or fragile situations “stand to be hit hardest” due to fragile health systems, limited social protection coverage, limited financial and other resources, vulnerability to shocks, and dependence on international trade.

The UN Secretary-General urges that “recent gains are protected as much as possible and a truly transformative recovery from COVID-19 is pursued, one that reduces risk to future crises and brings much closer the inclusive and sustainable development required to meet the goals of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.”

In addition to the Secretary-General’s annual progress report, the UN also releases a ‘Sustainable Development Goals Report’ that reviews the year’s progress in implementing the 2030 Agenda, uses infographics to present findings, and provides in-depth analysis of selected indicators. The two yearly reports are among the inputs to the HLPF session held each July.

An Assessment of VLRs to Date,"There are only ten years left to deliver the 2030 Agenda. However, as speakers and reports prepared for the 2019 SDGs Summit clearly demonstrated, we are not progressing fast enough. To increase momentum, UN Secretary-General António Guterres inaugurated the ‘Decade of Action’ in January 2020. The Decade is built on three levels of action—global action, local action, and people action—to accelerate progress on the SDGs.

Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs) could be an important vehicle to accelerate ‘local action’. Four VLRs were launched during the July 2018 meeting of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) – by Kitakyushu, Shimokawa, and Toyama in Japan, and New York City in the US. These VLRs have ignited enthusiasm among other cities.

Building on these efforts to localize the SDGs and to further our contribution to the “Decade of Action,” the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) has released two complementary publications to highlight and support the work of Local and Regional Governments (LRGs) in implementing the 2030 Agenda:

The “State of Voluntary Local Reviews 2020: Local Action for Global Impact in Achieving the SDGs” is a review of the publicly available VLRs as of February 2020.

“The Shimokawa Method for Voluntary Local Review: A Blueprint for Localising the SDGs” is a method on how to conduct a VLR based on Shimokawa’s experience.

We understand the VLR as a process in which LRGs voluntarily review and follow-up implementation of the SDGs. This process becomes a vehicle for sharing experiences, challenges and lessons learnt, as well as to open avenues for new partnerships to address any current shortcomings LRGs might confront. It can also enable LRGs to engage communities in the process, thereby strengthening the accountability and inclusiveness of their policymaking.

The ‘State of VLRs 2020’ report analyzes the 16 VLRs that had been identified as of February 2020. Of these “first generation” VLRs, four were launched in 2018, ten in 2019, and two in 2020 (all are available at the VLR Lab, here). After summarizing the main characteristics of the 16 VLRs, this report focuses on two crucial aspects of conducting a local review: the level to which the VLR process engages with stakeholders, and the alignment of the VLR with the Voluntary National Review (VNR) process. The report reviews the impressive number of commitments and actions that are already underway at the local level, details which are often missing in VNRs.

The comparative analysis of VLRs revealed that conducting a VLR can unlock meaningful opportunities for cities and regions. In particular, a VLR: 1) allows the local government to listen to the needs of its people and reflect them into local policymaking; 2) invites self-reflection; 3) provides for a process that is data-driven and can be used to plan for action to achieve the future we want; and 4) gives a local take on the global conversation on sustainable development. Altogether, these opportunities can lead to transformation. The report also found that the majority of the first generation of VLRs have focused chiefly on aligning the SDGs with local policies, but have not explicitly included a stakeholder engagement process, with notable exceptions being Shimokawa, Manheim, and New Taipei.

In the conclusion of the report, we emphasized the need to envision the next generation of VLRs. The next generation should maximize the meaningful opportunities provided by the VLR process, as identified in the ‘State of VLRs 2020’ report, to capture all its benefits. We suggest that these opportunities will only be fully crystalized once the current approach is changed.

A key recommendation for maximizing these benefits is to strengthen stakeholder engagement in the VLR process, and to enable this engagement to be thorough and self-organised. In the case of Shimokawa, a community-led platform with staff from all bureaus of the town hall developed the new 2030 vision, fully embracing the SDGs. This vision then guided Shimokawa’s comprehensive plan (the highest level of planning), and contributed to fostering ownership of the town vision and plan. In addition, Shimokawa specifically tried to engage communities during the action-plan setting phase and helped establish an implementation platform that could mobilize different stakeholders for different community-led initiatives.

This planning process was built on “backcasting,” an approach that identifies a desirable outcome and then walks backwards to find measures to reach the final destination. The case of Shimokawa demonstrates that this approach enables a more robust, transformative policy process than through the use of forecasting, while also allowing for continuously revisiting the vision initially set if the circumstances change.

The report on the Shimokawa Method for VLRs builds on the mechanism used in the Shimokawa case, translating it into ten practical and straightforward steps, This report also incorporates findings from the ‘State of VLRs 2020’ report and contains a guide for “VLR format” to which cities can refer as they construct their own VLRs.

The Next Generation of VLRs

The ‘State of VLRs 2020’ report presents an assessment of the currently available VLRs, while the Shimokawa Method report provides a handbook for implementing VLRs. These two documents seek to pave the way for improving the VLR process. While many internal areas of improvements related to VLRs can be addressed by using the Shimokawa method, more must be done. In particular, when looking to increase the global and national impact of VLRs, cities must strive to integrate their VLRs with their national VNR processes, so that a country can address territorial challenges and scale up successful local solutions.

The principles that underlie the 2030 Agenda resonate strongly with the ongoing global crisis. The current COVID-19 pandemic is reminding humanity that society as a whole is as vulnerable as its most vulnerable people. It also brings into sharp focus the ramifications of inequality at many levels. These challenges cannot be suddenly alleviated during the crisis. As the UN Secretary-General has said, “The recovery from the COVID-19 crisis must lead to a different economy.” Recovery must go beyond “returning” and aim to “Build Back Better”, anchored in leaving no one and no place behind. VLRs can be instrumental to this end, building resilience and transforming our cities.

This multifaceted crisis will keep adding pressure to fragile communities. It calls for a comprehensive and collaborative response. And at the root of it is clean energy; essential to help countries prepare, respond, and recover from COVID-19 crisis.

Clean energy can provide affordable solutions that are in line with climate targets and can help mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 crisis on people’s livelihoods and local economies.

On the frontline of the battle against COVID-19, energy for households and health centers is critical. Yet 840 million people don’t have electricity, 570 million of them live in sub-Saharan Africa, where one in four clinics has no energy at all, and 28 percent don’t have consistent access.

Reliable power supply ensures that core systems for the management of health programmes can function effectively.

In regions where the electricity grid is unreliable or even non-existent, clean energy technologies provide solutions that can be deployed rapidly. With reliable energy, health centers can work around the clock, instead of relying on candles or phone flashlights.

Solar for Health

The Solar for Health programme, funded principally by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, UNDP and Innovation Norway, and ongoing in 11 countries since 2016, showcases a green model that improves health services while saving lives, the environment, and money.

UNDP and its partners seek to build on this expertise to support countries in scaling up clean energy investments for the electrification of health centers.

Clean energy can also address some of the health risks that might make people more vulnerable to respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Nearly half of the world relies on polluting fuels and inefficient stoves for cooking, at considerable health and environmental costs. Every year 3.8 million people die prematurely from illnesses linked to smoke from open fire or stoves. Promoting the use of clean fuels and energy efficient stoves can protect billions of people from breathing in harmful fumes at home every day.

Access to energy also makes social distancing policies viable by powering the technologies and devices that help people to stay in touch with each other, receive information, engage in online education, and work from home. It can also provide reliable access to clean water, a crucial element in times of COVID-19. It also ensures food security by enabling food cold chains, and powering water pumps.

Boost investment in clean energy

Clean energy can also fuel economic recovery in the aftermath of the pandemic. Renewable energies are an engine for job creation. A record 11 million people worldwide were employed in the renewables sector in 2018 and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that this number could rise to 42 million jobs globally by 2050.

Clean energy also boosts local economies. Decentralized, off-grid energy systems can help small businesses thrive and offer potential for sources for additional income.

Clean energy is available, affordable, and reliable. But in many developing countries and economies, the potential for large scale renewable energy projects remains largely untapped. Investments in this area are still much lower than would be required to deliver clean energy’s full development and climate benefits.

Lifting barriers

Across the world, UNDP is working with governments to lift the barriers that impede these investments. By addressing the policy and financial risks associated to such investments in developing economies, UNDP aims to help government create an enabling environment for renewable energy. UNDP’s Africa Minigrid Programme and Solar for Health, being set up in over 11 countries, is set to expand across the continent.

As nations prepare for the COVID-19 aftermath, there is a tremendous opportunity for a global reset. Ambitious green stimulus plans will help countries restore their economies while deepening their energy transition. As oil prices drop to historical lows, we need to ensure the world stays on track with its climate targets. Now is a good time to reform fossil fuel subsidies and re-assess the options countries have to accelerate their clean energy transition to sustain a recovery that’s better for all.

The number of people suffering hunger has increased, climate change is occurring faster than predicted, and inequality is increasing within and among countries, António Guterres says in his ‘Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals’ 2020 report.

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were launched four years ago to address the most pressing global needs for a sustainable future, including education and health improvements and reductions in social and economic inequalities.

“I think [food price rises are] probably much more widespread than we realise because we’ve never encountered an emergency on this sort of scale before. It’s like having an emergency in every single country.” Jane Howard, head of communications, marketing and advocacy, WFP

“The effects of the pandemic and the measures taken to mitigate its impact have overwhelmed the health systems globally, caused businesses and factories to shut down and severely impacted the livelihoods of half of the global workforce,” he says in the report.

It comes on top of an existing slowing in progress towards many of the SDGs, and Guterres had launched a Decade of Action in September to turn things around.

The latest report, published last week (14 May), illustrates “the continued unevenness of progress and the many areas where significant improvement is required”.

The report has been released ahead of UN Economic and Social Council high-level meetings scheduled for July to provide a global, data-driven overview of the SDGs.

Women and girls

Last year’s report had already warned that there was “simply no way that we can achieve the 17 SDGs without achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls”.

In the 2020 review, Guterres says “the promise of a world in which every woman and girl enjoys full gender equality and all legal, social and economic barriers to their empowerment have been removed, remains unfulfilled”.

Only half of the world’s women who are married or ‘in-union’ make their own decisions regarding sexual and reproductive health and rights, based on 2007-2018 data from 57 countries, the report says.

Social and economic development has been shown to accelerate when women have access to mobile phones, the report says, but phone ownership remains higher for men than for women.

More than 260 million children were out of school in 2017 and 773 million adults — two-thirds of whom are women — remained illiterate in 2018.

As of 2019, less than half of primary and lower secondary schools in Sub-Saharan Africa had access to electricity, computers, the internet and basic handwashing facilities, the report states.

Billions of people worldwide still lack access to safely managed water and sanitation services, including 2.2 billion people without safe drinking water.

And, the world is projected to miss the target to end poverty in all its forms as hunger increased for the fourth consecutive year and about 50 million children experienced acute undernutrition. Globally, 144 million children under five were still affected by stunting in 2019, with three quarters of these children in Central and Southern Asia or Sub-Saharan Africa.

Claire Heffernan, director of the London International Development Centre, a membership organisation, says the SDGs are incompatible with the COVID-19 pandemic on a political level.

“The SDGs reflected the political will of the time,” she says. “Today, in the midst of this pandemic, I think it’s safe to say global political will is in short supply.”

Food crisis

Subir Sinha, senior lecturer in institutions and development at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), says he is sceptical of suggestions in the report that progress has been made on poverty, because the quality of data from national governments has become worse.

He says that wage protections and labour rights need to be made into political issues to ensure they stay on governments’ radars.

“COVID-19 is going to make questions of hunger much worse,” Sinha says. “People are talking about a global response in terms of a vaccine, I think we should pay attention to those who are talking about a global response to the coming food crisis.”

The SDG progress report comes after the United Nations predicted last week that the COVID-19 crisis could push 130 million more people into poverty in the next 10 years.

About 35 million people are expected to fall below the extreme poverty line this year as a result of the pandemic, with 56 per cent of them in Africa, the UN’s World Economic Situation and Prospects as of mid-2020 report predicted.

The global economy is forecast to lose a staggering US$8.5 trillion in production over the next two years due to the pandemic, the UN report says.

This is a “tremendous setback” for sustainable development, Elliott Harris, UN chief economist and assistant secretary-general for economic development, told SciDev.Net.

“[The pandemic] is particularly affecting the more vulnerable groups … because these are the ones whose activities generally require some form of physical proximity to others.”

Remittances

Remittances from migrant workers in the global North could face a hit – in countries such as Haiti, South Sudan and Tonga, remittances constitute more than a third of gross domestic product.

“You have an abrupt cut of people’s livelihoods and incomes, and then you’ve got different kinds of cascading effects through the bigger food system,” says Sophia Murphy, senior specialist in agriculture, trade and investment at the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD).

There are also fears about what the pandemic could mean for long-term food security, with the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) estimating that 130 million more people in low- and middle-income countries may be pushed into acute food insecurity this year.

Bumper crops in some regions are at risk of being wasted. India has been hit by COVID-19 at harvest time, with crops left unpicked and difficulties getting grain to market for sale before it spoils.

This comes after rising hunger in the three years to 2018 pushed undernourishment back to levels seen around 2010.

Evidence of price rises has already emerged. In Brazzaville, capital of the Republic of the Congo, the WFP notes a 10 per cent surge in the price of a typical local basket of food – comprising fish, pulses, peanut paste, cassava flour, oil and condiments – in the space of two weeks.

The organisation expects food price rises to occur more widely, as this is happening in countries such as Syria, where prices have more than doubled in the past year.

“I think it’s probably much more widespread than we realise because we’ve never encountered an emergency on this sort of scale before,” says Jane Howard, head of communications, marketing and advocacy at the WFP’s London office.

“It’s like having an emergency in every single country that you’re working in.”

Some countries are already reeling from other problems, such as the locust swarms in East Africa, leading to potentially “devastating” impacts, she adds.","The latest report, published last week (14 May), illustrates “the continued unevenness of progress and the many areas where significant improvement is required”.

88,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/itc-charts-businesses-path-through-covid-19-crisis/,"Thu, 28 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,ITC Charts Businesses’ Path Through COVID-19 Crisis,"The International Trade Centre (ITC) has released a 15-point action plan to support micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) through the COVID-19 pandemic.

MSMEs, the action plan notes, are “the driving force behind” many essential services in the pandemic. However, they are also particularly vulnerable to the repercussions of the crisis, especially in developing and transition economies. Beyond facing weaker consumer confidence and being overrepresented in the hardest-hit sectors such as retail trade, tourism, and personal and professional services, MSMEs have fewer assets, reduced access to credit, and a more challenging trade environment relative to large companies.

The plan for MSMEs is centered around five recommendations for businesses, five for business support organizations, and five for governments. An ITC news release featuring a consolidated set of recommendations reminds the reader in each of the three sections to both “prepare your immediate response to the crisis” and to “get ready for the ‘new normal’.”

Free movement of goods and services is critical to producing essential products, including medical equipment and food.

The plan’s introduction highlights that the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) estimates a decline in cross-border investment flows by up to 30-40% in 2020-2021. Accordingly, trade aspects feature prominently throughout the action plan, and are especially strong in the section for governments, though the plan emphasizes that governments, business support organizations, and small business alike should coordinate the immediate response in a collaborative manner. The plan calls on governments to implement support measures built around concessional financing, tax reductions and grants, employment incentives, and targeted interventions.

Resisting the allure of trade protectionism is paramount, the plan argues. It emphasizes that free movement of goods and services is critical to producing essential products, including medical equipment and food. Thus, the plan also recommends that governments facilitate cross-border trade in goods and services, and streamline the movement of essential products by following best practices as outlined in the World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement. Actions include, inter alia: certificates for medical equipment and essential food items; enhanced border management coordination, for example between customs and sanitary authorities; special regimes for expedited clearance of certain goods; and accelerating clearance processes for trusted traders or authorized economic operators who respect health-related rules and regulations.

The plan also notes that governments can expand and facilitate access to trade finance for MSMEs, including those run by women and young entrepreneurs. The pandemic, the plan notes, has negatively impacted the availability of trade finance for small business due to higher liquidity costs and the perceived risk of short-term finance, leaving a void for governments to fill. The document notes that several economies have expanded short-term programmes that provide financial support to national exporters. Flagging that nearly all MSMEs rely on goods that have been sourced internationally, the plan stresses that now more than ever is the time “to conserve the links between small businesses and international markets.”

The plan underscores that trade documents and procedures can be digitalized in collaboration with the private sector, noting that the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement encourages countries to introduce digital clearance processes. As noted above, such processes can simplify cross-border trade whilst limiting physical contact and in-person interactions. While the plan points to the private sector as having responsibility for digitalizing trade documents, it acknowledges that the onus is on governments to provide legal certainty that these documents will be recognized within their respective jurisdictions.

The dialogues gather UN Member States, civil society, and UN representatives for off-the-record discussions, in parallel to the ongoing intergovernmental consultations on the declaration.

The co-facilitators for negotiations on the declaration – Alya Ahmed bin Saif Al-Thani, Permanent Representative of Qatar, and Anna Karin Enestrom, Permanent Representative of Sweden – issued an “elements paper” on 9 April. The paper proposes the declaration contain three sections: Acknowledging achievements and looking ahead; Delivering on commitments and responding to global challenges; and Building consensus and mobilizing for change.

In 1945, the majority of humanity was unable to participate in the UN’s work, but now it must be a feature.

The first dialogue in the series took place on 23 April with a focus on ‘Acknowledging Achievements and looking ahead,’ the first section of the elements paper. According to the discussion summary, this dialogue gathered 157 representatives from 19 UN Member States and over 100 civil society organizations. The discussion highlighted that the COVID-19 pandemic represents the clearest example of several, intersecting global crises. It points to the need to strengthen multilateralism and address mistrust.

Participants noted that in 1945, the majority of humanity was unable to participate in the UN’s work, but now it must be a feature. It was emphasized that inclusion is “not solely for representation,” since one group’s advancement should lead to the advancement of all. Similarly, national sovereignty itself should be re-evaluated. No country is autonomous in this interdependent world, participants emphasized, and addressing problems globally is in the best interest of all.

Building on this idea, the declaration should propose that the UN no longer function to find equilibrium among competing national interests, but strive to replace an intergovernmental approach with a supranational one. Other proposals included:

Establish a post-2020 process to consider and implement recommendations for reform.

Re-evaluate process for reaching consensus, to ensure a “recalcitrant few” cannot hold back a vast majority.

Consider possible formats for a UN Parliamentary Assembly.

The second dialogue, on 30 April, took up the declaration’s possible section on ‘Delivering on Commitments and Responding to Global Challenges,’ which is expected to contain the most substantive, practical proposals, and serve as the primary vehicle to lay out a plan for the future of the UN. The third dialogue in the series will convene on 7 May, to address ‘Building consensus and mobilizing for change.’ This section is meant to serve as the call to service for the governments of the world.

The lessons are presented in a paper titled, ‘Accountability in a Time of Crisis’ released in April 2020.

The paper was developed by the INTOSAI Development Initiative (IDI), Audit Service Sierra Leone (ASSL), General Auditing Commission of Liberia (GAC), and African Organisation of French-speaking Supreme Audit Institutions (CREFIAF).

Emergency situations can lead to basic control systems being suspended or bypassed.

The introduction to the paper notes that “emergency situations can lead to basic control systems being suspended or bypassed, combined with weakening of accountability systems and oversight.” The rush to address a crisis may result in increased levels of waste, mismanagement, and corruption, they caution.

The paper draws from audits of previous crises, including the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, to identify lessons that can be used for handling the coronavirus crisis. The paper presents recommendations for the role that Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) could play in the crisis and safeguards that development partners could apply when funding COVID-19 measures.

Among the activities that SAIs can provide during a pandemic are:

provide advice on rules and regulations;

conduct real-time audits on procurement;

audit the implementation of new regulations and programmes;

maintain dialogue with stakeholders such as the government, development partners, and CSOs to understand the COVID-19 response, the main risks, and how the SAI can add value through its audit work; and

undertake short, special audit reports in order to issue timely and relevant reports outside the normal audit cycle.

In the aftermath of a crisis, the paper recommends that SAI audits be used for accountability purposes as well as to identify lessons for the future.

The paper also suggests that development partners can reinforce good governance practices and carefully select short-term safeguards while encouraging the adoption of medium-term safeguards. Recommendations for how development partners can achieve these objectives include:

produce immediate messaging to strengthen and reinforce behaviors:

encourage key national stakeholders and other implementing agencies to send clear messages setting expectations about the use of and accountability for emergency funds;

in the short-term, use appropriate safeguards relevant for different sector risks and funding modalities; and

in the medium-term, encourage governments to take action on relevant prior audit reports, bringing key findings and recommendations into policy dialogue, and encourage SAIs to stay visible and conduct follow-up audits on implementation of prior recommendations.

The paper recommends that development partners should ensure that SAIs can audit the use of emergency funds. The authors suggest that development partners should consider how funds will be audited at the outset rather than after funds have been spent.

I’m proud of the new Bel-Air V3. Understanding our roots, it was important for us to keep the heritage of the Bel-Air alive. My team and I worked tirelessly to further enhance and I strongly believe that the new Bel-Air V3 will continue to keep riders satisfied in the saddle for another decade. — Tyler Anspach (SDG Owner)

The year was 1995. The Digital Versatile Disc (DVD) was invented, eBay had just launched, Coolio’s “Gangsta’s Paradise” topped the Billboard Charts and Mötley Crüe rocker Tommy Lee married Baywatch star Pamela Anderson. In addition, SDG’s new Bel-Air saddle was taking the industry by storm as the premier MTB saddle of choice.Chances are if you’ve ridden a mountain bike in the past 25 years, you've probably perched yourself on top of an SDG saddle. Even more likely, that saddle has been a Bel-Air model or one of its offspring. SDG Components started in a garage in Southern California back in 1993. Their first product was the Comp Ti saddle (the first premium Kevlar covered MTB saddle), and by 1995, they added the Bel-Air to their lineup - which utilized the same base as the Comp. It quickly gained popularity as the “go-to” saddle of its era. Since then, SDG Components has sold in excess of one million Bel-Air saddles in various forms and iterations, including the Bel-Air SL – the first I-Beam version. While many popular trends and advanced products have come and gone since 1995, the timeless Bel-Air saddle has remained in the game.Although the name and brand have grown since the days of bending titanium rails and stitching fabrics in a garage, the legacy continues for the Bel-Air with the introduction of the new Bel-Air V3 saddle. The new V3 sees some much-needed enhancements that turns the old skool comfort favorite into a contemporary saddle for riders that may have never seen a metal flake SDG or lusted after the wild animal prints and crushed velvet saddles from decades ago.SDG has tooled a significant amount of saddle models over the years. And surely, as saddle preferences and overall shapes vary, not all saddles are created equal. In fact, some saddles are designed to be firm and stiff for ultimate power transfers, extremely light or even minimalist and relatively flat forward, allowing a rider to move freely on the saddle or even slide off the back end on steep descents. So admittedly, some SDG saddles weren’t overly comfortable, but they were built to serve a function and a intended use. Unlike some of the I-Beam race seats, the Bel-Air has always been a comfort-focused saddle. While the foam shape has slightly morphed over the years, the same base has always remained.For 2020, SDG’s Bel-Air V3 will continue in the tradition of the iconic shape, with a slight rear rise profile, on a proven 140mm platform. The saddle also takes advantage of new materials and manufacturing techniques to further enhance the performance, overall aesthetics and most importantly, bringing the time tested comfort tradition along for the ride.Seeing as the Bel-Air and Bel-Air 2.0 continued to be popular sellers in the SDG line, they were a bit outdated and far too bulky. And so the overhaul started nearly 19 months ago. SDG aimed to incorporate the same overall top profile and optimal riding area for the widest range of riders and a wide range of disciplines. As seat tube angles have evolved, so have saddles and the Bel-Air V3 is designed with modern bikes in mind. The new saddle moves to a shorter, padded nose and a reduced overall length (260mm) to match current bike trends. The shoulders of the V3 are also trimmed up, providing a sleeker overall appearance, without compromising comfort.The SDG Bel-Air V3 keeps a slight rear rise and lowered profile design. This helps rotate the pelvis forward and provide extra support, comfort and power from a seated position. The Hidden Undercut Relief has also been added. It is a strategically placed cutout throughout the bottom of the saddle, relieving perennial pressure in a way its predecessor did not.With the enhanced base, SDG integrated their reverse Free Float Rail Inserts to allow for more forgiving wings. To maximize power transfer and improve longevity, SDG constructed the new Bel-Air V3 with a long glass fiber reinforced Nylon material, with a new Base Bridge, providing unparalleled strength and stiffness where needed.Sitting above the cutout is the newest type of EVA Foam technology available - the original Bel-Air uses standard PU. This Injection Molded EVA offers optimal density, saves precious grams and extends all-day comfort. Unlike mass-produced EVA foam, which is stamped off flat sheets and glued onto saddle bases, SDG’s new injection process allows for a lower profile saddle that still offers support and comfort while also increasing the saddle’s lifespan.To address the finished quality of the new Bel-Air V3, SDG uses Atmos Shaping which eliminates the need for bumpers, staples or glue and leaves a clean seamless transition into the base. With this vacuum sealing process, Kevlar and Cordura side panels were no longer necessary as SDG is now able to Sonic Weld protective edges. By heat-fusing materials together, the Bel-Air V3 has increased durability and reduced friction points that could irritate riders. On top of that, it’s definitely more visually appealing and the injected colored bases can complement any new build.Also new for the Bel-Air V3 are Lux-Alloy rails. These heat-treated composite rails are nearly 15% stronger than standard Ti-Alloy (in push and fatigue testing) and the weight is only slightly heavier but at a more affordable price.The SDG Components Bel-Air V3 is set to continue the tradition with enhanced comfort and performance features while offering more color offerings than a bag of Skittles. The SDG Bel-Air V3 extends premium craftsmanship across the full lineup and hits several price points thanks to several rail material options.

They are probably the only global agenda that the 193 Member States of the UN all agreed to and put at the centre stage of this global platform

Maybe it’s time we agreed on another SDG – The 18th Goal: Managingor Handling Pandemics.

The SDGs or Sustainable Development Goals were adopted in September 2015 by the General Assembly of the United Nations. They are probably the only global agenda that the 193 Member States of the UN all agreed to and put at the centre stage of this global platform. Of course, they followed the somewhat unsuccessful MDGs or Millennium Development Goals that the member states had adopted earlier. These were eight goals expected to be realised by the year 2015 that were adopted at the Millennium Summit of the United Nations in 2000, following the adoption of the United Nations Millennium Declaration.

It was,however, found by 2013 that progress towards the MDG goals was uneven. Some countries achieved many goals, while others were not on track to realize any. Experts and critics of the MDGs complained of a lack of analysis and justification behind the chosen objectives, and the difficulty or lack of measurements for some goals and uneven progress, among others. The UN therefore, felt it appropriate to redesign the world’s goals for development and member states thus officially adopted the historic new agenda for development, entitled “Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,” and now includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets.These 17 SDGs are comprehensive, and all-encompassing and embrace all aspects of development for the world including poverty, inequality and hunger; health and education; water and sanitation; energy and industry; decent work; infrastructure and urbanisation; climate change, peace and justice. They balance the economic, social and ecological dimensions of sustainable development, and place the fight against poverty and development on the same agenda for the first time. Building on the principle of “leaving no one behind”, the new Agenda emphasizes a holistic approach to achieving sustainable development for all. In India, the NITIAayog is coordinating the SDGs progress and implementation. It has constructed the SDG India Index spanning across 13 out of 17 SDGs and tracks progress across all States and UTs. It also measures their progress on the outcomes of the interventions and schemes of the Government of India.

We are now in 2020. Five years since 2015 and the adoption of these SDGs and we find that at the international level, progress in some areas, such as on extreme poverty reduction, widespread immunization, decrease in child mortality rates and increase in people’s access to electricity, but slow going on many other programmes. Probably the global response has not been ambitious enough, leaving the most vulnerable people and countries to suffer the most.

And as we face the COVID 19 pandemic, there is danger that many societies may slip on the progress made so far. The most important thing that COVID 19 has taught us is global cooperation. Even the very competitive multi-national pharma companies are sharing their individual confidences and collaborating with other pharma companies and labs in trying to find a Vaccine. Today we need effective collaboration and shared communication among health experts, economists, scientists and policy makers. That is the only way we will manage to manageto contain this Corona Virus.

As Yuval Noah Harari, the famous Israeli historian and philosophersaid in a recent interview, we now need a collective leadership – ‘like a coalition of the willing’! He argues that even for promoting nationalism it’s better to protect your own when everybody is protected. Emergencies accelerate the momentum of history. We thus need global solidarity to take the right decisions now and that is why we need a new SDG 18!

Many people predict the future but hardly anyone listens. Microsoft founder Bill Gates in 2015 famously talked about preparing for pandemicsand today we have social media claiming that he did it to promote his work in vaccines! Cynics will always abound, but global governance must use the structures it has to take collective decisions. Because if you solve it in some countries but the poor countries remain affected, you may get unmanageable immigration and even conflict.

Some of the lessons from COVID will change our social behaviour for example online meetings and virtual education, but basic human nature and structures of governance will still be there. The earlier epidemics didn’t change these either whether they be SARS, Spanish Flu or AIDS. So, if the same structures of global governance remain then we must use these structures to address this pandemic and its aftermath.

It could be argued that the SDGs already have Goal 3: ‘Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages’. However, it could also be argued that this is too narrow an agenda. This Pandemic is proving to be much more than just a health issue. Despite the life vs livelihood debate the fact remains that the global economy is in a downward tailspin. This debacle will impact not just health but the very basis of what we consider to be human. The response to it must therefore be multi-dimensional and multi-sectoral. Thus the need for a new development agenda – SDG 18: Managing Pandemics.

The top 12 nominated entrepreneurs will be able to pitch their products and solutions at the Summit, scheduled to take place in the first quarter of 2021 during the Building Bridges Week and will get support to access strategic partners to scale up their venture.

According to a statement UNDP is calling for third parties (accelerators, impact funds, family offices, international organizations, etc.) to nominate from their own pipelines, up to 3 entrepreneurs which meet the eligibility criteria. Self nomination is not be accepted. The call will remain open till 15 July.

The call is for growth stage impact ventures for SDGs aimed at identifying and showcasing mature impact ventures in emerging countries with the catalytic potential to drive both large impact and yield sustainable profit.

The UNDP said 2020 the Call for Nominations only accepts Post Series A impact ventures providing products and services which reduce inequalities (with particular attention to gender inequalities) by providing solutions that empower people at the bottom of the pyramid to access to quality health, affordable and clean energy, and by reducing and recovering waste. Only ventures with headquarters, primary workforce and service provision or product market in developing countries can be eligible for the selection.

“We are delighted to support UNDP in its focus on impact ventures that address the SDGs. Contrary to the multitude of awards and competitions targeting early stage start-ups, companies invited to Growth Stage Impact Ventures have the potential to bring about rapid and positive change at scale, targeting in particular the bottom of the pyramid,” said Julia Binder, Project Leader of Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) Tech4Impact.

A first screening of nominees will be carried out by EPFL to shortlist the top 20 enterprises. Finalists will then be reviewed by technical experts, investors and UN officials to select the top 12 finalists, who will attend the SDG Finance Geneva Summit, in 2021.

In 2019, 76 third-parties submitted 119 proposals from 40 developing countries. Eighty-five percent of the nominated ventures had raised at least half a million dollars at the time of nomination, and closed their Series A. All 12 finalists were mid-sized, with an average of up to 50 employees, annual revenue of over US$3 million, and with a cumulative impact on more than 15 million lives through their products and services.

Also, the coalition says the legal framework to support efforts by state and non-state actors in the protection of natural area remain limited. It cited the non-passage of the over 16-year-old Wildlife Resource Management Bill which would empower “communities to participate in and benefit from the management of natural resources in community lands.”

In a similar concern, the Convenor for Youth in Natural Resource and Environmental Governance, Chibeze Ezekiel has called on Ghanaians to support the fight against environmental degradation which endangers the animals in the environment.

World Biodiversity Day

The United Nations proclaimed May 22 The International Day for Biological Diversity (IDB) to increase understanding and awareness of biodiversity issues.

When first created by the Second Committee of the UN General Assembly in late 1993, 29 December (the date of entry into force of the Convention of Biological Diversity), was designated The International Day for Biological Diversity.

In December 2000, the UN General Assembly adopted 22 May as IDB, to commemorate the adoption of the text of the Convention on 22 May 1992 by the Nairobi Final Act of the Conference for the Adoption of the Agreed Text of the Convention on Biological Diversity.

This was partly done because it was difficult for many countries to plan and carry out suitable celebrations for the date of 29 December, given the number of holidays that coincide around that time of year.

Today, 22nd May 2020, marks another globally important day for the reflection, appreciation and action towards securing our natural world and the diversity of plants and animals that thrive in it and are crucial for the survival of every person living on this earth.

This year’s theme ‘Our Solutions are in Nature’ is captured to reflect the fact that biodiversity still remains the answer to many of the sustainable development challenges that we all face. From nature-based solutions to climate change, to food and water security and sustainable livelihoods, biodiversity remains the basis for a sustainable future. The recent global assessment of biodiversity and ecosystems services by the Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services reports of mass extinctions that need our urgent action if we are to prevent a repeat of these crises.

The UN declared a decade of biodiversity from 2011 to 2020, which ends soon. Even as the quality of the environment continues to decline, we are called to rally in solidarity behind negotiations to work towards a strong Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. This is very urgent, as onset of Covid-19 pandemic demands that we re-examine the way we interact and use the natural world. Without doubt, the evidence points to the fact that, without the natural world, humans will cease to exist.

This important day also provides a crucial opportunity for Ghana to reflect on how we interact with the natural environment and plan for a sustainable future that prioritizes the wellbeing of nature and of every Ghanaian.

Ghana is endowed with rich natural resources and biological diversity from all corners of the country providing critical livelihood solutions to Ghanaians from all walks of life rich and poor. We can mention the many beautiful birds, butterflies, and other animals we see mostly in rural communities in areas set aside for the protection of forests and other biological assets such as the Achimota Forest in Accra, Atewa Forest close to Kyebi, Kakum National Park in the Central Region, Mole National Park in the Savanna Region as well as several sacred groves in the country serving important cultural, spiritual and aesthetic functions. We can also mention the Boabeng Fiema Monkey Sanctuary, Sakumono Ramsar Site, Keta Lagoon and all the forests and wetlands providing important habitats for the protection of specific species and also providing crucial live support services to every Ghanaian.

The beautiful natural areas notwithstanding, we also observe many negative practices from individuals, companies, and state agencies that deplete or destroy or indirectly perpetuate acts that are incompatible with the wellbeing of some of these natural areas so crucial for our survival and sustainable development as a country.

Key issues of concern that need urgent attention are as follows:

The increasing incidence of mining in state gazetted forest reserves across the country from galamsey activities as well as state approved mining in areas set aside purposely for the protection of forests and the security of biological diversity. Forest reserves serve as important habitats that support a large diversity of plants and animals. Unfortunately, most forest reserves in Ghana’s high forest zone are under threat or pressure from mining activities and this needs to be addressed with all the urgency that the state can mobilize. Current attempts by government to turn critical biological hotspots like Atewa Range Forest Reserve into a bauxite mine is inimical to our commitments to the Sustainable Development Goals and derails all efforts locally and globally to secure the wellbeing of our natural environment as a guarantee for our wellbeing.

The legal frameworks to support efforts by state and non-state actors in the protection of our natural areas remain limited. The Wildlife Resource Management Bill that empowers communities to participate in and benefit from the management of natural resources in community lands has been in and out of Parliament for more than 16 years now. Another republic is going to end and there is no clear evidence to show the bill will be passed before that time. When finally passed into law, it will also domesticate some key important biodiversity security and regulatory mechanisms such as the protection of migratory species, and entrench regulations that address the increasing incidence of illegal exploitation and trafficking of endangered species like pangolins, and restricted trade species like rosewood, and many others from Ghana.

All across the country, we see hope, the young ones, and the elderly trying hard to reconnect with nature, travelling to natural areas as much as possible. Domestic tourism to natural areas has surpassed international tourist visits compared to a decade ago. We have experiences where individuals are using their own money to purchase, rescue and set free illegally captured species along our highways. Several communities across the country are struggling to manage wildlife in their communities’ lands. These efforts are hampered by the continuous absence of key legislation to enhance enforcement and compliance of the protection of our natural areas and biological diversity, lack of enforcement of the laws that do exist, as well as the wanton destruction of our biological and natural areas that are essential for our wellbeing and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.

As we celebrate and reflect on this important day now and for life after Covid-19, we cannot continue to watch and act with indifference and impunity as our natural world fades away without taking the necessary steps to address the challenges as mentioned above. We need to rededicate and commit to halt the destruction of forest reserves and biological diversity and pursue a development agenda that is founded on nurturing and safeguarding the natural world as an imperative.

By the latest version of the text, the UNGA would specify eight SDGs for in-depth review during the 2021 session of the HLPF, and hold more forward-looking discussions during the 75th UNGA session (2020-2021).

Kaha Imnadze (Georgia) and Jean-Claude do Rego (Benin), co-facilitators for the intergovernmental negotiations for the review process of ECOSOC and HLPF, explain that they focused the revised draft only on 2021 partly in order to “bridge the gap between the positions of delegations.”

The co-facilitators released the zero draft of the resolution on 24 April, which proposed themes, SDGs, and “areas for acceleration” to be discussed at the next three HLPF session (2021, 2022, and 2023). By that draft, SDGs 5 (gender equality), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), and 17 (partnership for the Goals) would be reviewed each year. Member States discussed the zero draft on 8 May, and several delegations subsequently submitted written inputs: Canada, the EU, Japan, Mexico, the Group of 77 and China, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Switzerland, the UK, and the US.

The revised version of the text, dated 8 June, now identifies SDGs for review only during the 2021 session of the HLPF. Preambular paragraphs in the revised draft note that the COVID-19 pandemic poses threats to sustainable development, including in the areas of health and the world economy, and that the poorest and most vulnerable people are the most affected. This hampers progress towards the SDGs. The introductory text continues, “implementation of the 2030 Agenda is crucial to help better equip the world for future systemic shocks,” and the SDGs provide a “blueprint” for recovery that leaves no one behind.

The revised draft proposes that the 2021 theme for ECOSOC and HLPF would be ‘Sustainable and resilient recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic: Building an inclusive and effective path for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda in the context of the decade of action.’ The 2021 HLPF would take up three “areas of acceleration”: health and human well-being; sustainable, inclusive and resilient economies; and healthy nutrition patterns.

In-depth reviews would be held on several SDGs – “namely, but not limited to” the eight SDGs most closely associated with these areas: Goal 1 (no poverty), Goal 2 (zero hunger), Goal 3 (good health and wellbeing), Goal 8 (decent work and economic growth), Goal 10 (reduced inequalities), Goal 12 (responsible consumption and production), Goal 16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions), and Goal 17 (partnership for the Goals). The in-depth reviews will address interlinkages between the SDGs to promote actions that “create co-benefits, address synergies and trade-offs, and meet multiple objectives in a coherent way.” They would also account for the impacts of COVID-19 on the SDGs.

By the revised draft resolution, the UNGA would decide to conduct the reviews of ECOSOC and the HLPF during its 75th session, which begins in September 2020. The informal meetings for the review would be open to major groups and other relevant stakeholders.

Discussions during the 75th session also would define the themes for the HLPF and ECOSOC sessions in 2022 and 2023.

A virtual consultation will convene on 15 June for a paragraph-by-paragraph discussion of the revised text. [Revised draft resolution and letter of co-facilitators]","By the latest version of the text, the UNGA would specify eight SDGs for in-depth review during the 2021 session of the HLPF, and hold more forward-looking discussions during the 75th UNGA session (2020-2021).
By that draft, SDGs 5 (gender equality), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), and 17 (partnership for the Goals) would be reviewed each year.

The statement titled, ‘On the Black Lives Matter Protests and other Mass Demonstrations against Systemic Racism and Police Brutality,’ stresses that, “To merely condemn expressions and acts of racism is not enough. We must go beyond and do more.” Highlighting outrage at the “injustice of racism that continues to be pervasive in our host country and across the world,” the signatories note that, as leaders in the multilateral system, it is incumbent upon them to “advocate for effective responses that would contribute to fight systemic racism, a global scourge that has been perpetuated over centuries.”

The statement highlights that 2024 will mark the end of the International Decade for People of African Descent, and indicates the leaders will use their collective voice to “contribute towards the realization of Africa’s own transformative vision contained in Agenda 2063,” which is consistent with the global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

The 22 signatories, all of whom hold the rank of Under Secretary-General, welcome initiatives by the UN Secretary-General to strengthen the global anti-racism discourse and to address systemic racism at all levels, including by having an “honest assessment of how we uphold the UN Charter within our institution.” These leaders emphasize that they “share the core beliefs and the values and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations that do not leave us the option to keep silent.”

The statement was released on 14 June 2020, in the context of the global protests at the killing of George Floyd in the hands of police. June 2020 also marks the 75th anniversary of the conclusion of the UN Conference on International Organization and signature of the Charter of the United Nations. Signed on 26 June 1945, the preamble to the UN Charter identifies the determination of the peoples of the united nations to “reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small” as one of four defining objectives.

These Standards are the latest contribution of market-focused tools from SDG Impact, a flagship initiative of UNDP’s Finance Sector Hub, focused on accelerating investment to achieve the SDGs. The Standards will be available for comment and consultation through 31 July 2020.

As governments and markets around the world face the dual challenges of a pandemic and climate change, private capital will play a vital role in meeting immediate needs and financing paths toward achievement of the SDGs. “Investors want useful guidance and tools to make better informed decisions to help them allocate and manage investment and drive capital to where it is needed most” UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said.

These Standards are timely as a growing number of pandemic and social bonds come to market. “If ever we needed ambitious shared goals to open paths to a better future, it is now,” SDG Impact Director Elizabeth Boggs-Davidsen said. “UNDP’s stewardship for the SDGs enables us to offer these tools on a competitively neutral platform.”

UNDP has Practice Assurance Standards in development for SDG Bonds, Private Equity Funds, and Enterprises. UNDP plans through SDG Impact to establish an assurance system and SDG Impact Seal.

“We’ve been able to bring together leaders from across the globe in collaboration around the urgency of practice to drive investment capital to where it’s needed,” Boggs Davidsen said. “The Administrator chairs a Steering Group of pioneering leaders, and we have access to deep expertise in standards through SDG Impact’s Standards Expert Fabienne Michaux, who brings lessons from her role in finance and ratings, including heading Standard & Poor’s across developed markets in Asia.”

“These Standards build on other useful tools in the market and bridge a gap between high-level principles and impact reporting by providing a common framework for what to do and how to do it,” Michaux said. “Bringing rigor and transparency to impact management on a consistent and comparable basis will develop our understanding how investments contribute to the SDGs and help investors make more informed decisions.”

The SDG Bond standards are the second set to be released and incorporate feedback on the first draft of Private Equity Standards, which has informed a more streamlined, user-friendly approach.

“The feedback from dozens of stakeholders on the draft for Private Equity was really useful,” said Boggs Davidsen. “There was significant interest from across the market, from those who have been investing for impact for a long time and others who have seen the potential more recently.”

“We see a lot of impact investment, but nothing on the scale we know is required,” Steiner said. “This is still an emerging field and there is much for us all to learn. With a presence in some 170 countries, UNDP aims to assist countries in rapidly evolving the investment landscape to attract more capital to achieve the SDGS. These Standards aim to capture the best of what we see in the market, to provide a very practical and scalable way forward.”

The events allowed for an exchange of information while also demonstrating progress that is underway, even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The June Momentum for Climate Change was conducted under the guidance of the Chairs of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA). The events took place during the time period that the annual meetings of the UNFCCC subsidiary bodies would have convened as the Bonn Climate Change Conference, but they did not involve formal negotiations.

Over eight days from 1-10 June 2020, 17 open events and six additional events requiring registration, including meetings of the constituted bodies, took place. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin summary from the events indicates that several focused on the work of the constituted bodies, which are the bodies that focus on implementing various aspects of the Convention and the Paris Agreement on climate change. These technical bodies provided updates on their work and future plans. Formal meetings also took place, with the committee to facilitate implementation and promote compliance under the Paris Agreement holding its first meeting and lead reviewers of biennial reports and national communications met to share experiences. Other events discussed ongoing and emerging issues, such as a sustainable recovery from the pandemic.

During an opening session on the theme, ‘UN and the UNFCCC Vision for 2020 in the Light of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Opportunities for Sustainable Recovery,’ Selwin Hart, Assistant Secretary-General for the Climate Action Team, reported that the UN Secretary-General’s six climate-related actions to shape the recovery range from investing in green jobs and tying bailouts to the Paris Agreement’s goals, to ending fossil fuel subsidies, accounting for climate risks, and ensuring no one is left behind as we recover better, together. President-designate of the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) to the UNFCCC, Alok Sharma (UK), highlighted energy, transparency, nature-based solutions, adaptation, and finance as key COP 26 themes. UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa emphasized that 2020 is still a critical year for countries to fulfill their commitments under the Paris Agreement, including by submitting enhanced nationally determined contributions (NDCs) by the end of the year.

During a closing segment, youth non-governmental organization (YOUNGO) representatives delivered messages highlighting the need for sustainable, low-emissions climate change conferences, calling for access to food, energy, education, jobs, and medicine for the most vulnerable, and supporting grassroots communities to decentralize decision making.

SBI Chair Marianne Karlsen (Norway) noted that there had been more than 12,000 views of the 17 open events over the eight-day June Momentum event, and of the 136 panelists, 48% were female. With SBSTA Chair Tosi Mpanu Mpanu (Democratic Republic of the Congo), she noted that several of the activities would advance the agenda, including on Action for Climate Empowerment and the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture. They also noted events that emphasized the need for sustainable recovery, including by using NDCs as frameworks.

Officials expect that limitations on international travel and convening of large in-person meetings may still be in effect in September due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The high-level week has been anticipated as the start of a “landmark year” for the UN.

On 9 June 2020, UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande circulated “elements for consideration” regarding the revised format. The proposal is based on advice from the UN Secretary-General, the host government (US) and local authorities (New York City and New York State), Member States, and the UN’s medical director.

Heads of States and Government would address the General Debate via pre-recorded video statements.

According to the proposal for the high-level week, the General Debate would still take place on the scheduled dates, 22-29 September 2020. On 22 September the President of the 75th UNGA session – Volkan Bozkir of Turkey, who was elected on 17 June – would deliver an opening statement in the UNGA Hall, and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres would present his annual report on the work of the organization. Heads of State and Government or Ministers would address the General Debate via pre-recorded video statements played on screens in the UNGA Hall. Alternatively, the New York-based Permanent Representative of a Member State could deliver a statement in person in the UNGA Hall.

The physical presence of delegations in the UNGA Hall would be limited to at one delegate per Member States. This may be extended to two delegates, if possible. Everyone would be requested to wear a face covering at all times, maintain physical distancing, and be free of COVID-19 symptoms.

Similar arrangements would be put in place for the high-level meeting to commemorate the UN’s 75th anniversary on 21 September 2020 (UN75).

Other high-level meetings are currently scheduled to convene in parallel to the debate. Therefore, citing operational limitations on parallel meetings, Muhammad-Bande suggests changing their dates to allow for the use of virtual platforms and pre-recorded video statements. These meetings and their proposed rescheduled dates are:

Summit on Biodiversity (proposed to reschedule to 30 September);

High-level meeting on 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing+25) (proposed to reschedule to 1 October); and

High-level meeting to commemorate and promote the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons (proposed to reschedule to 2 October).

The President notes that proceedings of the high-level week will be streamed live on UN WebTV and all statements made in any of the UN’s six official languages will be interpreted into the other five languages.

In addition, he writes that “we will work to facilitate the meaningful participation of civil society.” Side events are encouraged to take place over virtual platforms only.

Negotiations on the text will continue in June 2020 with a series of virtual informal consultations.

The co-facilitators for negotiations on the Ministerial Declaration, Georgi Velikov Panayotov, Permanent Representative of Bulgaria, and Amal Mudallali, Permanent Representative of Lebanon, held a virtual informal meeting on 4 May and then collected delegations’ written inputs.

The Declaration would commit to accelerating action to achieve the 2020 targets and requesting them to be updated for 2030.

The zero draft of the declaration includes a section on ‘Assessment of the situation regarding the 2030 Agenda,’ which highlights uneven progress in implementation of the 2030 Agenda, with some areas stalled or reversed (hunger, climate change, inequality) – as reported in the annual SDG Progress Report released by the UN Secretary-General on 14 May.

The draft also acknowledges the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, asserting that “insufficient efforts” to implement the SDGs have exacerbated the pandemic’s impacts (overwhelming health systems, affecting the livelihoods of half the global workforce, disrupting supply chains, and closing schools, while also expected to push tens of millions of people back into extreme poverty and hunger).

The majority of the draft is a section listing ‘Actions to be taken for the way forward.’ Responses to and recovery from the pandemic are woven throughout the text. Among the actions to which Member States would commit, they note that governments:

“Will relaunch sustainable and inclusive growth,” reduce income inequalities and address developing countries’ financing challenges. To this end, “our economies will be reconfigured to protect the environment and create conditions for decent work for all” and support micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to help restore jobs and incomes.

Will integrate a gender perspective into emergency social and economic schemes, noting the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on women, “who also face increased risks of domestic violence and exploitation.”

Pledge to increase their level of ambition to mobilize and effectively use all available means of implementation, in line with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on Financing for Development (FfD), and to fully implement the agreed conclusions and recommendations of the 2020 ECOSOC FfD Forum. They also express deep concern about high debt levels as countries attempt to withstand COVID-19 and implement the 2030 Agenda.

Commit to “maintaining the integrity of the 2030 Agenda,” referring to the SDG targets with a 2020 deadline, including by: ensuring ambitious and continuous action on those targets, accelerating efforts to achieve them, and requesting intergovernmental fora and bodies to review and update them “to reflect a suitable level of ambition for 2030.”

Urge the UN to make better use of the Voluntary National Reviews presented each year during the HLPF by national governments, to support accelerated SDG achievement and encourage peer learning.

The text ends with a commitment to “invest more in human capital, to empower children, adolescents and youth, as critical agents of change, and support their meaningful participation in realizing the vision of the 2030 Agenda.”

Delegations will hold their next informal consultation on 8 June. Each of the Major Groups and other Stakeholders can nominate one representative to participate in the meeting and submit a written statement. Three representatives will be invited to make statements. The consultation will not be webcasted.

Additional informal consultations will convene on 16 June and 23 June, and the co-facilitators then plan to finalize agreement on the draft using the silence procedure.

The 2020 HLPF takes place from 7-16 July. The format is expected to be virtual, although some small, in-person meetings of New York-based participants reportedly have been considered. Registered participants will be able to attend the virtual meetings, while others can follow the meeting through the UN webcast or YouTube. Side events and exhibitions will take place only virtually.

The latest programme for the HLPF was released on 14 May, indicating that the Voluntary National Reviews will proceed on 10 July and from 13-16 July. The presenters include one country making its third VNR, 26 countries making their first VNRs, and 20 making their second-time presentations.

104,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/observations-on-the-quest-to-build-back-better/,"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Observations on the Quest to Build Back Better,"The SDG Knowledge Hub spoke with Mandeep Tiwana, Chief Programmes Officer at CIVICUS, about his assessment of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and impacts on the 2030 Agenda. Tiwana highlights the persistence of “MDG mindsets” and an increase in censorship and surveillance. He also suggests five ways to build a better post-pandemic world.

What have you observed about the SDG community’s responses to the pandemic?

Significant attention is being focused on the negative impacts of COVID-19, especially on impoverished and excluded communities. Important issues such as debt relief and financing for development have come to the fore. For example, the IMF announced immediate debt service relief for 25 countries in April, and further efforts are underway.

Yet, across the board, “MDG mindsets” remain stubbornly prevalent. The MDGs were weak in their comprehension of development by focusing on a small sub-set of rights. They were also charity-oriented in their approach, and reinforced top-down aid in the Global South.

The SDGs, on the other hand, are universal and underpinned by a range of interdependent human rights and social justice values, which gives them transformative potential. However, five years since the passage of the SDGs, the impulse in many quarters is still to scale up existing approaches. A lot of the emphasis remains on “soft” communications and feel-good actions, rather than to push for fundamental changes in how our societies and economies function to better realize rights.

What impacts do you expect the COVID-19 crisis to have on the achievement of the 2030 Agenda?

COVID-19 could be a turning point. I have guarded optimism that we could overcome the paucity of ambition that has held us back from making transformative shifts.

COVID-19 has exposed and accelerated existing problems in our societies. Inequality, exclusion, and lack of voice were already marring progress on the 2030 Agenda. With COVID-19, the worst impacts are being felt by the disadvantaged as hunger and deprivation abound. Violence against women and excluded minorities has spiked. All of this is undermining the commitment to leave no one behind. Recent protests against racial injustice in the US and around the world highlight the importance of people’s participation for overcoming structural inequities and getting States to discharge their responsibilities to ensure proper health care, education, and access to justice for those most at risk. Thus, a silver lining has been renewed purpose among activists and civil society organizations to demand radical shifts to ‘leave no one behind.’

However, a less constructive trend has emerged as well. As public safety has taken center stage, censorship and surveillance have ramped up along with official propaganda. Many governments have sought to control the narrative about their pandemic response by clamping down on civic freedoms. Even before COVID-19 struck, only three percent of the world’s population lived in countries where the fundamental civic freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and association were adequately protected, according to the CIVICUS Monitor, our participatory research platform that measures civic space around the world.

There are worrying signs that COVID-19 emergency restrictions could be used as a smokescreen for a broader crackdown on dissent. The negative legacy of COVID-19 could last as long as the wave of dubious security measures passed in the wake of 9/11. This would undermine accountability for the 2030 Agenda.

Have any new lessons emerged that can inform plans and strategies to “build back better”?

Our vulnerabilities stand exposed by COVID-19. However, as we begin this Decade of Accountability for the SDGs (a multi-stakeholder campaign to hold duty bearers to account for their commitments to sustainable development), we still have an opportunity to build better forward by creating greener and fairer societies. In our recently released State of Civil Society Report 2020, we highlight five areas of focus to create a better post-pandemic world.

First, civic freedoms and democratic rights are essential as our leaders are making life-or-death choices that could define the fate of generations. Concerned citizens, the media, and civil society organizations must have access to credible information and be able to exercise fundamental civic freedoms, in order to shape decisions in people’s best interests and hold decision makers to account. In a positive example in Paraguay, the government has set up a website that allows the public to track COVID-19 expenditure and engage directly with public officials.

Second, now is the time to rethink how our economies are structured. This means avoiding harsh austerity policies or market fundamentalism that prioritizes the interests of big business in recovery. To make a dent in inequality we need radical shifts such as progressive taxation and reinforcing the state’s responsibility to directly provide quality essential services. State funding for military infrastructures and repressive state apparatuses should be repurposed towards social safety nets.

We also urge better protection of worker’s rights. Towards this end CIVICUS has put in place a social security protocol to ensure job security, and to protect the mental and physical well-being of our co-workers.

Third, the needs of the most excluded people should be placed front and center. Reconstruction efforts should adopt a human rights approach and reach the most disadvantaged first. Steps must be taken to safeguard the rights of women and the health and wellbeing of older people and children, and to prevent violence against them. Economic stimulus plans should target those who are most vulnerable. For example, Spain has taken steps to introduce a basic monthly income for about a million of the country’s most impoverished households. We encourage other countries to adopt a similar policy.

It is also important to protect civil society organizations from funding shifts. CIVICUS is urging funders to exercise flexibility and listen to their partners as they navigate disruptions in programme activities and planned convenings. We also call for a greater proportion of funds to be delivered to organizations directly serving people on the ground.

Fourth, international cooperation remains vital. Multilateral institutions need to be adequately resourced and supported by governments in the spirit of multilateralism. Responses to the pandemic must strengthen and uphold the autonomy of international institutions, not only the World Health Organization but also institutions that promote human rights, peace, and sustainable development. Like pandemics, major contemporary challenges such as conflict, poverty, and environmental degradation have spillover effects beyond their borders. Strong international institutions and cooperation are needed to realize initiatives such as the UN Secretary-General’s call for a global ceasefire.

Fifth, now is an opportune time to ramp up action on climate change. The healing of nature seen in so many places should be nurtured. New ways of working introduced during the crisis that reduce carbon footprints should continue where possible. The Paris Agreement must receive new life to ensure that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are reduced and rises in global temperature are kept to a minimum. Recovery plans are an opportunity to invest in employment that advances the transition to a green economy.

Human rights cut across many of your proposals, for example in the need for transparency, protecting workers and the most disadvantaged, and strengthening human rights institutions. Why are human rights so relevant during COVID-19?

Countries that appear to have done better are ones that have empathetic leaders who have been inclusive in their policy responses and have involved civil society in decision making. This is all part of a human rights approach. In April this year, over 650 civil society organizations from around the world co-signed a letter calling on world leaders to respect human dignity and rights in responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.

We can’t turn the corner towards transformation after COVID-19 without a human rights approach.

Finland is one of 47 countries that will present a VNR during the 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

The report, which was released by the Prime Minister’s Office, covers all 17 Goals and 169 targets of the SDG framework. It focuses on progress achieved between 2016 and 2020, and summarizes key changes and lessons learned regarding: methodology for preparing the VNR; policy and enabling environment; and means of implementation.

As noted in the foreword by Prime Minister Sanna Marin, preparation of Finland’s 2020 VNR introduced new approaches for “intensified stakeholder participation,” with several stakeholders providing their own assessment of progress. Progress on each SDG is presented in the report through two assessments: one from government officials, covering all targets; and another from civil society, providing an overall assessment of progress as well as recommendations for further progress.

The preparation process also included peer review, with the Governments of Mozambique and Switzerland reviewing the draft report and sharing their views.

At the national level, Finland’s VNR notes that a sustainability assessment has been integrated into the annual cycle of policy planning, budgeting and reporting. Environmental aspects have been easier to integrate into policy than social aspects, the report reveals.

The VNR also reflects SDG localization in Finland, noting that cities’ engagement in implementing the 2030 Agenda has increased, and three cities have prepared Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs). In addition, the autonomous region of Åland has integrated the SDGs into its core strategies.

The report provides an update on two major features of Finland’s approach to sustainable development – the circular economy, and the ‘Society’s Commitment to Sustainable Development 2050.’ On circular economy, after creating the world’s first roadmap to a circular economy in 2016, its objective is now to “bring the circular economy to the core of competitiveness and economic growth strategy, transition to low-carbon energy, start considering natural resources as a scarcity and promote the shift to a sustainable lifestyle.” Per the national roadmap, Finland aims to be a leading nation in circular economy by 2025.

On the Society’s Commitment, the report describes the tool enabling anyone in Finland to register a concrete action towards the SDGs, and reports that as of March 2020 over 2,000 commitments are listed, with private companies, schools and individual citizens being the most active partners. The latest version of the platform allows users to calculate their personal carbon footprint, draw up a personal plan to reduce their footprint, and track their contribution to the national emissions reduction target.

Looking forward, the government notes that:

A national implementation plan for 2020-2025 will be submitted to the Parliament later in 2020;

The UN SDGs are an urgent universal call for action to change the world and steer it towards a better and more sustainable path. One goal is missing: the 18th SDG on sustainable use of outer space.

What are the SDGs?

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were launched at the UN Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro in 2012 following decades of work by countries and the UN and were adopted by all UN Member States in 2015. They replaced the Millennium Development Goals, which started a global effort in 2000 to address poverty.

The UN Development Programme supports countries in implementing and achieving the SDGs through integrated solutions. Because of their global nature, achieving the SDGs requires the establishment of global partnerships, including governments, private actors, civil society, and citizens. Moreover, creativity, technology, and financial resources from all of society are necessary to achieve the SDGs.

The need for the 18th SDG

Planet Earth and the human race are strongly connected to each other. Sustainability of this planet is something that can be achieved from on Earth but also from outer space. Natural disasters and other phenomena that can lead to the extinction of the human race in the long term can be observed from outer space through satellites that provide essential information.

As public and private interest in the quest for exploration and use of outer space increases, the UN can spread awareness on issues that would protect humanity and the outer space ecosystem.

With the development of counter-space technologies and ‘space forces’ by several nations, a constant need exists for the protection of space against military use. Space, although infinite, is a scarce resource due to the limited availability of orbital space near Earth and in view of orbital congestion and space debris, there is a need for the protection and sustainability of space for future generations. Any set of SDGs without a focus on environmental impact would be incomplete. Formulating guidelines on environmental compliance reporting will go a long way to protect the outer space environment. A new SDG 18 could also address how data obtained about new celestial bodies in the process of commercial exploration is shared for the benefit of humanity.

Remote sensing satellites providing data for monitoring land use, soil, drought, crop development, water cycles, and other aspects of the natural environment, as well as the epidemiology of infectious diseases, are vital for addressing the problems incorporated in the SDGs on hunger, poverty, sanitation, energy, life on land and life below water. While the SDGs on quality education, decent work and economic growth, industry, innovation, and infrastructure, are addressed by telecommunication technologies enabled by satellite communication, the unique opportunities for partnerships and collaborations in space foster cooperation vital for ‘Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions’ (SDG 16). Therefore, it could be said that SDG 18 would not only be a sustainable development goal itself but also a catalyst for all the other 17 SDGs!

‘The long-term survival of the human race is at risk as long as it is confined to a single planet… but once we spread into space… our future should be safe.’ – Stephen Hawking

Initiating space as the 18th SDG

Placing space on the UN SDGs agenda has already seen several initiatives. In a joint report published by UNOOSA and the European GNSS Agency in January 2018, global cooperation and recognition of the ability of space to support the SDGs were recognised as a key for the success of the UN SDGs.

Additionally, The National Space Society, a US organisation for space advocacy, calls for ‘Recognizing the Imperative Role of Space in our Future’ as the 18th SDG. According to the NSS, the sustainable development of space economy must be recognised as a development goal that will include the principles of space exploration and utilisation, and the development of space communities.

Finally, a group of students from the Windesheim Honours College in Zwolle, the Netherlands, calls for the recognition of SDG 18: ‘Space for all’ by emphasising the responsibility of humanity for the bigger system beyond Earth. Their work introduces four pillars for that goal: respect and care for the community of life in our galaxy and universe; ecological wisdom and integrity towards biological systems in space; social and economic justice towards other planets and their resources; and global commitment to democracy, nonviolence, and peace towards potential new forms of life.

It is clear that space plays a crucial part in the achievement of the existing 17 SDGs. However, as the reliance on space to meet these goals is growing, space sustainability should be recognised as a goal in itself. As Stephen Hawking stated:

‘The long-term survival of the human race is at risk as long as it is confined to a single planet… but once we spread into space… our future should be safe.’","One goal is missing: the 18th SDG on sustainable use of outer space.

A shared understanding could help ensure a meaningful contribution to the SDGs and hold companies accountable for the social and environmental behavior, the authors argue.

The policy brief released on 28 May 2020 titled, ‘How can investors move from greenwashing to SDG-enabling?,’ observes that companies must help build a sustainable world, which they need in order to preserve their long-term financial performance. However, investors may lack tools to measure activity and hold companies accountable. A common definition of Sustainable Development Investment (SDI) would establish norms and minimum thresholds to qualify as aligned with sustainable development. The authors note that the Global Investors for Sustainable Development (GISD) Alliance launched in October 2019 is working on a shared understanding of sustainable investing.

The time has come to shift from voluntary to mandatory sustainability reporting.

A common definition would need to be followed by strengthened reporting requirements. Regulatory frameworks would “enable a proper assessment of corporate contribution to the SDGs, but also penalize unsustainable practices and discourage short-term thinking in capital markets.”

The brief notes that the Financing for Sustainable Development Report 2020, prepared by over 60 international agencies from the UN system and beyond, recommended the adoption of global mandatory disclosures on climate-related financial risk like those promoted by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

The authors also identify three challenges to sustainability reporting by companies. First, its voluntary nature: “the time has come to shift from voluntary to mandatory sustainability reporting.” Second, the quality and absence of meaningful KPIs that connect to the SDGs; only 23% of multinational companies’ sustainability reports connect the SDGs to numerical performance indicators, and “without numbers, sustainability reporting quickly becomes a public relations exercise.” Third, the variety in type of information, which makes it hard to compare different companies’ data.

Finally, the brief notes that Canada has pioneered an approach in which companies receiving financial assistance for crises like the COVID-19 pandemic must commit to stricter reporting requirements on socioeconomic issues, as well as carbon reduction targets.

The brief is part of a series aimed at helping policy makers facing difficult choices during the COVID-19 pandemic. The series has also addressed the impacts of the pandemic on youth, older persons, persons with disabilities, and indigenous peoples, and how it is affecting physical activity and wellbeing; and accountability at the national level and the relationships between States and people, among other topics.

The report uses a human rights lens to examine how “inclusive, just and rights-based” the region’s situation is for each SDG. The 2020 report is the first ASDR since 2015.

The publication, released on 10 June 2020, was led by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA). In the foreword, ESCWA Executive Secretary Rola Dashti says the ASDR calls for “humility to acknowledge that we are not on the right track.”

Findings indicate that the region will not achieve the SDGs by 2030. In line with the global diagnosis on SDG achievement, the authors observe, the region has yet to usher in a transformative shift in development. However, the report finds an increasing recognition among both governments and peoples that more needs to be done to protect the environment, address climate change, and ensure the sustainable use of natural resources.

Each SDG chapter includes sections on: key facts on the Goal; measuring the SDGs using the global indicator framework, and any targets with 2020 or 2025 deadlines in the global framework; barriers to transformation; those “at risk of being left behind;” and what the region can do to accelerate progress.

The report places major emphasis on the role of conflict in holding the region back from sustainable development. In the chapter on SDG 1 (no poverty), for example, it notes that as a result of conflict, the region has witnessed the only increase in extreme poverty in the world from 2010 levels, and this was the case even before the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other effects of conflict, the report finds that the vulnerability of women and girls to all forms of violence is exacerbated by prolonged humanitarian crises, instability and displacement.

Other pressing issues to tackle in all Arab countries include health care and education, namely to increase quality and access.

The report highlights the need for different approaches to data, including better disaggregation, more robust methodologies, more public availability of data, and better use of data produced by multiple stakeholders.

The report also underscores the striking inadequacy of policy frameworks, and the potential power of integrated policy making. It finds that the region has yet to embrace an integrated approach that brings together the different dimensions of sustainable development. To a large extent, it asserts, trade-offs and complementarities between different Goals and dimensions are unaddressed.

Among the suggested ways to remove the barriers to progress, the report highlights the need to:

Shift Arab economies towards sustainability and productivity, noting that over-reliance on oil, rents and investment in real estate and services are depleting natural resources and failing to create the labor demand to absorb people’s capacities, especially young people;

Increase adherence to universal human rights, including by overhauling discriminatory legal frameworks and addressing discriminatory social and cultural norms and institutions;

Move towards a vision of education where schooling at all stages produces creative critical thinkers; and

Use regional action and integration, including: economic integration; harmonization of standards and capacities in transport and connectivity; promoting cultural change; producing data on the health of ecosystems; water governance across borders; responding to humanitarian crises; advocating for the restructuring of global governance structures and addressing the inequities of global trade systems and the cost of climate change; and pushing the global community to deliver on its commitments to developing and least developed countries.

The studies also present trends and perspectives for transitioning to safe alternatives.

The studies show that these countries have all experienced an increasing trend in the use of HHPs, which can permanently undermine human health and affect future generations. HHP poisoning can lead to chronic disability or death. An overall summary of the studies provides a snapshot of each country’s HHP use.

The Russia study highlights: partial contamination of land and adjacent environments with harmful substances due to long-term use of HHPs and agrochemicals in agriculture and forestry; challenges ensuring environmental safety due to a lack of effective state supervision over the safe handling of pesticides and agrochemicals in agricultural production; and environmental pollution in areas where obsolete and banned pesticides are stored.

In Armenia, more than 60% of pesticides allowed by legislation are HHPs, with one third of them categorized as carcinogens or possible carcinogens.

Many pesticides registered and officially used in Kazakhstan contain one or more active ingredients from the HHP list. The study from explains that, as of March 2019, 74 active ingredients belonging to HHPs are used in Kazakhstan, with 25 of the active ingredients banned in other countries. Of the 1,021 trade names of pesticides registered in Kazakhstan, 386 contain one or more active HHP substance.

In Uzbekistan, 59 HHPs are allowed for use, 34 of which are banned in other countries. Uzbekistan has established a database of laws and regulations governing the production, use, injury, and liability of individuals and legal entities and the sound management of chemicals, including the registration, licensing, and prevention of stockpiling of hazardous chemicals.

In Ukraine, the study concludes that among 3,966 preparatory forms of pesticides, 1,125 formulations contain one to three active ingredients of HHPs. Thus, around one third of pesticides and agrochemicals allowed for use in Ukraine are HHPs. Eighty-three active ingredients of HHPs in preparative forms of pesticides and agrochemicals are allowed for use in Ukraine, 41 of which are already prohibited in other countries.

Recommendations include: reducing and eventually eliminating HHPs in Eastern Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia through increased information on safe HHP substitution, including use of the ecosystem-based approach and traditional knowledge in agriculture; and Regional Focal Points to the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) collecting lessons learned from this process and sharing them with national officials to facilitate the switch from HHPs to safer alternatives.

The executive summaries are in English, while the full reports are provided in Russian. The studies were undertaken as a part of IPEN’s Toxics-Free SDGs Campaign, which focuses on international, multi-stakeholder, multi-sectoral cooperation to support chemical safety and sound chemicals management and waste objectives beyond 2020. The Campaign contends that advancing chemical safety is necessary to achieve the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. It seeks to engage civil society organizations to further advance its objectives.

The studies are related to SDGs 2 (zero hunger), 3 (good health and wellbeing), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 14 (life below water) and 15 (life on land).

IPEN Participating Organizations have been undertaking activities related to the Toxics-Free SDGs Campaign since 2018. Activities address agroecology, chemicals in products, endocrine disrupting chemicals or POPs, hazardous chemicals in the lifecycle of electronics, HHPs, lead in paint, women and chemicals, workplace right-to-know, and/or zero waste issues.

In addition to the above five countries, activities are ongoing in Australia, Bangladesh, Belarus, Brazil, Cambodia, Cameroon, Chile, China, Croatia, Cuba, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Mexico, Mozambique, the Philippines, Senegal, Serbia, Thailand, and Togo.","The International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN) has published a series of studies on the production and use of highly hazardous pesticides (HHPs) in Armenia, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.

(LWI) - The Lutheran World Federation (LWF) has joined a call by 460 civil society organizations to ensure the participation of non-government organizations at this year’s High-Level Political Forum (HLPF). The purpose of the HLPF, scheduled for 7-16 July 2020, is to evaluate the global implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Organizations are concerned that measures are not in place to ensure their meaningful participation in the meeting, which will take place virtually due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

“We as churches have invested significantly in the implementation of the SDGs and our experience on the ground could contribute to global level discussions such as those in the HLPF”, says Isaiah Toroitich, LWF Head of Global Advocacy.

Fear that voices will be “muted”

The LWF through the initiative “Waking the Giant”, builds on the potential of the 148 LWF member churches to contribute to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. At the national level, Waking the Giant helps to establish and strengthen the link between faith-based actors, relevant government ministries and UN agencies. It facilitates joint planning and new partnerships to further strengthen the churches’ engagement.

Like the almost 500 signatories of the letter, LWF also fears that the perspective gathered in working with local communities will be lost if the virtual conference does not open up sufficient spaces for civil society actors, including churches. The organizations urge the UN member states to adjust formal procedures in order to ensure visibility and participation of civil society.

“About people and communities”

As countries evaluate the efforts made to address issues such as civil freedoms, gender equality and poverty, “It is vital that civil society actors actively participate to provide insights into the impacts of efforts made to general populations around the world,” the letter reads.

“The SDGs are about people and communities,” Toroitich adds. “Without the meaningful participation of civil society in the High-level Political Forum, the entire agenda loses meaning. No one should be left behind in the SDGs work”.","“Experience on the ground can contribute to global discussions”(LWI) - The Lutheran World Federation (LWF) has joined a call by 460 civil society organizations to ensure the participation of non-government organizations at this year’s High-Level Political Forum (HLPF).

Below is the Nigeria Country Report No. 2020/177, titled ""Nigeria: Technical Assistance Report-Additional Spending Toward Sustainable Development Goals"", issued in April 2020.

Preface

In response to a request from the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Sustainable Development Goals (OSSAP-SDGs), a technical mission visited Abuja, Nigeria during January 29-February 11, 2020 to collaborate on an assessment of the spending associated with making substantial progress along the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The mission comprised Mauricio Soto (head) and Mariano Moszoro (all FAD), and Julieth Pico (FAD expert).

This technical mission was financed by the European Union under the EU-IMF Public Financial Management Partnership Program (PFM-PP).

The mission was hosted by D.M. Dauda (Secretary of Programme, OSSAP-SDGs) and Dr. Bala Yusuf Yunusa (Senior Technical Advisor, OSSAP-SDGs).

The mission met with Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed (Minister of Finance, Budget, and National Planning), Prince Clem Ikanade Agba (Minister of State for Budget and National Planning), and Suleiman H, Adamu (Minister of Water Resources). The mission also met with Didi Walson-Jack (Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Power), Emmanuel Meribole (Director, Health Planning, Research and Statistics, Ministry of Health), Babangida Hussaini (Director of Special Projects, Federal Ministry of Works and Housing), and Adeoye E.O. (Acting Director, Department of Educational Planning, Research, and Development, Federal Ministry of Education).

The mission also met Katrine Mulvad Thomsen (Team Leader, Economic Cooperation and Energy, European Union Delegation), Amarakoon Bandara (Senior Economic Advisor, UNDP), Shubham Chaudhuri (Country Director, World Bank), Moses Ongom (Health System Adviser, WHO), Anthony Simpasa (Lead Economist, African Development Bank), and other staff of development partners.

The mission expresses its sincere appreciation for the cooperation and support given by officials and staff of these various organizations with whom the mission met. The team is especially grateful to Chukwuemeka Olanrewaju Ogbuehi (Ministry of Finance), Ogunleye Femi (OSSAPSDG), and Zainab Mangga (IMF Resident Representative Office) for the excellent coordination and support during the mission. The mission is also thankful to Laraba Bonet (IMF Resident Representative Office) for facilitating mission logistics.

Since the mission took place before COVID-19 became a global pandemic, the report does not reflect the impact from COVID-19 on economic activity in Nigeria. The report focuses on some of the medium-term challenges that Nigeria will face after the COVID-19 crisis, namely the additional spending needed to ensure substantial progress along the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.

Executive Summary

Making progress in the SDGs requires substantial additional resources. Concomitant with the reform priorities identified by the United Nations, World Bank, European Union, and other international development institutions, the mission estimates additional spending of 18 percentage points of GDP by 2030-a level higher than the average low-income and developing countries. Relative to other low-income and developing countries, additional spending is higher in education and water and sanitation, and lower in health, electricity, and roads (Figure).

Given scarce resources, a long-term vision is imperative. Given scarce resources, a long-term vision is imperative. The authorities have made important progress in developing long-term plans in sectors such as health, electricity, and water and sanitation.

Education-increasing access and improving quality. The relatively low resources devoted to education are insufficient to deliver quality education for all. With 50 percent of the population in school-age, we estimate that total annual spending in education would need to increase by 7.7 percentage points of GDP by 2030. A pragmatic approach should be taken depending on resource availability. For example, expanding enrollment could be done at a more modest cost of some 1 percentage points of GDP.

Health-tackling inefficiencies. Nigeria should deliver better outcomes at its current level of spending. Rebalancing the system, with an emphasis on primary care with public support, is critical. In the medium-term, additional annual spending of 4 percentage points of GDP would be needed to expand health workers, improve infrastructure, and improve health outcomes.

Electricity-rehabilitating and expanding power infrastructure. Annual investments of 1 percent of GDP are needed to expand electricity access and keep up with population growth. Rehabilitating the existing capacity can help meeting part of these investments. Mini-grids can play an important role in mobilizing capacity to remote and vulnerable communities.

Roads-expanding the road network. Increasing access roads from 26 to 75 percent of the rural population will cost 2 percent of annual GDP. It is critical to outline the road network and identify projects with high economic and social returns. The private sector can play an important role in this sector, supported by strong oversight to ensure value for money.

Water and sanitation-picking low-hanging fruit. A priority is improving access for the most vulnerable. Ending open defecation and expanding basic water and sanitation can be achieved at a modest annual cost of 0.6 percent of GDP. In the medium-term, providing safely managed water and sanitation for all will cost an additional 2.5 percent of annual GDP.





Beyond resources, improving coordination and strengthening governance is critical to delivering on the SDGs. The federal administration through its Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Sustainable Development Goals (OSSAP-SDGs) is committed to advance towards the 2030 goals. In line with policy options outlined by the World Bank and the United Nations, progress in these sectors requires a whole-of-government approach, supported by strong coordination between the federal, state, and local administrations.

While development partners and the private sector can help, the government should be in the driving seat of these efforts. To support decision-making based on evidence, one priority is to collect and analyze data to inform best practices and better target scarce resources.

Saturday’s COVID-19 data update from the Eastern Ontario Health Unit added five new confirmed cases to the region’s tally.

The update, posted to the EOHU website shortly after 2 p.m., showed three new cases in Cornwall, one in SDG, and one in Prescott-Russell. This brings the total number of confirmed cases within the EOHU region to 158 and represents the largest single-day jump in weeks.

Three of the cases are dated to Thursday, with one Wednesday and the last on Friday. The EOHU does not hold its briefings on weekends, so any further information about these five new cases, and any added to the count on Sunday, will await Monday afternoon’s briefing. Based on the episode dates alone, none of these new cases should be related to the region entering Stage 2 on Friday.

The EOHU also noted two additional resolved cases, both in Prescott-Russell. That leaves 21 unresolved cases in Prescott-Russell, four in SDG, and five in Cornwall. Another bright spot is that the COVID-19 outbreak at the Foyer St- Viateur in Limoges was declared over on Saturday— it dated back to a staff member testing positive. An outbreak was declared for a second time at the Pinecrest long-term care facility in Plantagenet on Wednesday, after an asymptomatic staff member tested positive. All residents and staff members at the facility will be tested again.","Three new COVID-19 cases in Cornwall, one in SDG, one in Prescott-RussellArticle contentSaturday’s COVID-19 data update from the Eastern Ontario Health Unit added five new confirmed cases to the region’s tally.

United Way of SDG Community Campaign supporting more agencies Back to video In a recent news release, United Way/Centraide of SDG executive director Juliette Labossiere said this year’s investment totals $337,786, a slight increase from last year, and that with new member agencies and programs being supported, the United Way’s impact in the community will grow. “We’re excited and proud to grow our membership,” Labossiere said. “These new agencies hold the potential to allow us to reach thousands of new individuals, and help some of the most vulnerable members of our community.” The United Way recently completed the allocations process for its traditional stream of funding, the investments above and beyond recent announcements on funding regarding the COVID-19 crisis. With all of its member agencies and programs back from last year, a total of 20 different programs in the region are receiving financial support.

Article content The allocations process is volunteer driven, led by United Way board members, who evaluate each member agency’s request for funding and then make a recommendation. The board of directors finalizes the annual amounts each member agency receives. Funding for allocations usually comes entirely from the amounts raised during the ongoing annual campaign. The community campaign had its annual launch in mid-September with a kickoff breakfast at Royal Canadian Legion Branch 297 in Cornwall. As at the previous two breakfasts, the United Way didn’t announce a financial goal, instead focusing on the agencies it supports and how their need is year-round. There was one announced contribution, the RBC Foundation getting the campaign off to a big start with a $12,500 donation. The campaign continues year-round, but in mid-March the pandemic arrived, and the United Way became an even more important part of the region’s social support structure.

118,https://www.morrisburgleader.ca/2020/06/25/sdg-county-backs-call-for-review-of-farm-tax/,"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",The Morrisburg Leader,SDG County backs call for review of farm tax,"SDG – County councillors voted June 15th to support a resolution by requesting the province of Ontario review the Farm Property Class Tax Rate.

The rate program was developed 22 years ago when the Mike Harris government overhauled farm property taxation, simplifying the structure.

SDG’s support of the resolution by Mapleton Township, northwest of Guelph, calls for the government’s program to be reviewed due to the burden it has shifted to other tax classes for municipal taxation.

Before the program launched, farms paid the full amount of property tax for the land used for agriculture production to a municipality. The land owners then would receive a rebate of approximately 75 per cent of the property tax paid from the province. Under the current program, agriculture land is taxed at one-quarter the residential tax rate by municipalities and the rebate eliminated. The impact to urban municipalities has been minimal, but for rural municipalities, the revenue issues are substantial.

“The tax burden has shifted more to residential owners,” said councillor Steven Byvelds (South Dundas). “If you have other industries that you can spread that tax burden, it helps.”

Byvelds pointed to South Dundas, which has some industrial businesses, but not as many as when the program started 22 years ago.

“We had a lot more manufacturing here then,” he said. “There still is some in South Dundas, and we’re grateful for that.”

Some municipalities in SDG have taken a larger hit on their finances under the province’s two-decade long taxation program, in part due to the province’s reductions in the Ontario Municipal Partnerships Fund. That fund was set up to help compensate municipalities for the revenue shortfall after 1998 when the farm class taxation program went into effect. That reduction has become a double whammy for one municipality within the county.

At just under 7,000 in population, North Stormont has seen the impact of farm tax class issues impact their budget even more.

“We’ve seen dramatic cuts in OMPF funding and that has been balanced off with increases in assessment,” said councillor Jim Wert (North Stormont). “The impact has been reduced somewhat because of partnership agreements but the reality is without Lafleche, we’d be looking at double-digit tax increases yearly.”

Lafleche Environmental Services in Moose Creek is the largest single industrial taxpayer in North Stormont.

“I think we’re all prepared to pay our share,” Wert said. “But I also feel it’s an opportunity given the financial challenges at the provincial and federal level that we would be wise to ask.”

The resolution calls for the program to be reviewed as it was originally supposed to be revenue neutral, with funding offsets provided by the OMPF.

“A review is overdue,” Byvelds said. “We need to see if its the right way, if the tax formula is right for the needs of everyone, and it’s a fair system.”

Article content This article has been edited to correct the expected opening date for services at St. Peter’s. Churches throughout the region will slowly be reopening in the coming days and weeks, allowing for in-person masses to resume with 30 per cent capacity. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Religious services start resuming this weekend in Cornwall/SDG Back to video The decision to do so by the area’s many religious organizations was made following the announcement from the Ontario government on Monday, that several regions throughout Ontario would be entering the second phase of its three-phase reopening plan. Two of the Archdiocese of Ottawa-Cornwall’s local churches will be opening this weekend — St. Columban’s and Blessed Sacrament. “We’ve been given a lot of rules,” said archdiocese representative Kimberly Walsh. “There are a lot of things to put into place and therefore I believe this is why the reopening is not happening in all the parishes this weekend. One of the biggest issues in many of the parishes is how do you accommodate only 30 per cent capacity and social distance rules all while being fair. This is a dilemma that I know the parishes are definitely grappling with.

Article content “Going to mass is not simply going to a regular meeting of an organization. Mass is the source and summit of our faith, and it’s when we receive Jesus’ real presence in the Eucharist. We’ve not been able to do this for thee months, and missed the most important liturgical feasts of the season: Holy Week, Easter Sunday, the 50-day Easter season, Pentecost – hence the difficult dilemma.” St. Francis de Sales and Blessed Sacrament on the other hand, will open their doors over the next weekend. The opening Ste-Thérèse-de-Lisieux might not take place until the last weekend of June, with an opening date for St. Peter’s not yet confirmed— but it will likely be in July. A strict set of safety measures are to be implemented in churches that are reopening. These include only using one door to enter and one door to exit, the encouraged wearing of masks or face coverings and keeping a six feet distance between parishioners. In addition Holy Water won’t be available at St Columban’s. Parishioners are also being asked by the diocese to not engage in singing, in order to limit the potential spread of the virus. Communion will also be altered — only to be received in the hand. “You are to place one open hand flat upon the other to receive the Sacred Host,” reads a document from the diocese. “Communicants are instructed to remove their masks, using the straps and without touching the front of their masks, while the person ahead of them is receiving Holy Communion.”

Robert Adams indicated to the Standard-Freeholder the regathering of the congregation might take place, in July and only if safety precautions have been put in place. “Our one key goal is to ensure that our worship space is safe for all people,” he said. “The last thing that we want is to be an infection hotspot that endangers our members and the broader community.” Adams went on to say that the biggest challenge they currently face is the continuous sanitation of their church. “We have already started to look at spacing people throughout the sanctuary to maintain social distancing and we will be discussing things like masks for all people who enter the building for worship,” he said. “But with a large building, we recognize there is a real challenge to sanitizing the space each week.” He additionally said his church would also ask parishioners not to sing for the time being. “We know that some of our people will not feel comfortable in large crowds just yet,” Adams added. “So we are also making upgrades to our technology so that we can continue to livestream our services. That is an area of ministry that has been very well-received during our time away from the sanctuary.” Services at the church will also be impacted if there is a spike in local COVID-19 cases.

The Framework will seek to support accelerated country progress in five key areas of SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation): financing; data and information; capacity development; innovation; and governance. Speakers emphasized the value of UN efforts to deliver as one at the country level and interlinkages between action on SDG 6 and other SDGs.

Houngbo highlighted that the framework introduces an annual moment for stocktaking and sharing of best practices. He also called attention to the importance of World Water Day in 2023, when the midterm review of the implementation of the International Decade for Action “Water for Life” will take place. Several speakers noted that this event will be the first UN high-level conference on water since the 1970s.

Among the elements and objectives of the Framework that speakers highlighted were the following:

Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, President of the UN General Assembly, commended the Framework’s focus on strengthening multistakeholder participation;

Achim Steiner, Administrator, UN Development Programme (UNDP), noted the value of linking to governance frameworks (SDG 16);

Audrey Azoulay, Director-General, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), stressed the importance of a multilateral approach, given that much of the world’s freshwater flows across international boundaries;

Qu Dongyu, Director-General, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), stressed the need to address water scarcity;

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General, World Health Organization (WHO), emphasized that water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) are essential for addressing the COVID-19 pandemic;

Maimunah Mohd Sharif, Executive Director, United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), stressed the need for addressing WASH needs of slum dwellers and for ensuring that data can inform decision making and investment decisions;

Olga Algayerova, Executive Secretary, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), noted that the Water Convention provides a unique legal platform for addressing shared waters;

Petteri Taalas, Secretary-General, World Meteorological Organization (WMO), discussed the links between efforts to address climate change adaptation and water related services and science; and

Inger Andersen, Executive Director, UN Environment Programme (UNEP), stressed the need to understand the hydrological cycle, the value of ecosystems, and how much water is embodied in our consumption patterns.

In his closing statement, Secretary-General Guterres stressed that the water and sanitation crisis demands a holistic approach, noted that it cuts across all of the pillars of UN, and said he was pleased to see the focus on action at the country level.

The launch took place on 9 July 2020, during a special event on the sidelines of the 2020 meeting of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). In addition to the SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework, the SDG 6 Action Space will provide a platform for national governments and other actors to record their initiatives to accelerate SDG implementation. These initiatives will be recorded as part of the SDG Acceleration Actions, a UN DESA online platform.

The report concludes that global clean energy access has improved, however regional disparities persist, and the rate of improvement must be enhanced to achieve 2030 targets.

The SDG 7 Technical Advisory Group, convened by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), also published its third series of policy briefs on SDG 7 and its interlinkages with other SDGs in support of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

‘Tracking the SDG 7: The Energy Progress Report,’ published by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the UN Statistics Division (UNSD), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO), with funding from the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), monitors and assesses the world’s progress towards global targets for universal access to sustainable, affordable, reliable, and modern energy services. It also identifies best practices, policies, measures, and scenarios to accelerate further progress and simultaneously pursue other SDGs.

On universal access (SDG target 7.1: “By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy services,” including access to electricity (indicator 7.1.1) and access to clean cooking solutions (indicator 7.1.2)), the report finds that over 1 billion people have gained access to electricity since 2010, increasing the connected proportion of the population from 83% to 90%. However, 789 million people still do not have access to electricity, and Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 70% of this deficit. The report estimates that by 2030, 620 million people will lack electricity access, 85% of them in Africa. The report recommends that governments respond to the COVD-19 crisis by working with donors and investors to ensure that off-grid developers, utilities, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remain active and that governments adopt a suite of safeguards to protect energy consumers.

Access to clean cooking fuels and technologies represents the largest SDG 7 deficit, according to the report. While the global proportion of the population with access increased by 200 million between 2010 and 2018, 2.7 billion people remained without access. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the number of those without access increased from 750 million to 890 million. The report concludes that 2.3 billion people, 30% of the world’s population, will continue to lack clean cooking fuels by 2030. It recommends that governments utilize more comprehensive household surveys to support more effective evidence-based policy and investment decisions.

On renewable energy (SDG target 7.2: “By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix”), the report notes that the share of renewables in total final energy consumption grew from 16.3% in 2010 to 17.2% in 2017, indicating that global use of renewables has increased at a faster rate than overall energy consumption. This increase was driven by solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy in the power sector. The report finds that while adoption of renewable energy in the heating and transport sector lags behind its potential, it will be required to achieve SDG 7.2 by 2030.

On energy efficiency (SDG target 7.3: “By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency”), the report states that in recent years, the rates of improvement in global primary energy intensity have fallen to 1.7%, although the average rate of improvement between 2010-2017 was 2.2%. To achieve the SDG 7.3 energy efficiency target of doubling the historic improvement rate, annual improvement will need to increase to an average of 3% per year between 2017-2030. The report recommends that countries make energy efficiency a policy and investment priority through minimum energy efficiency standards, market-based mechanisms, financial incentives, and other means.

On international public finance (SDG target 7.a: “By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology,” with indicator 7.a.1 focusing on international public financial flows to developing countries in support of clean and renewable energy), the report finds that while total international financial flows to developing countries in support of clean energy doubled to USD 21.4 billion in 2017 over 2010 flows, only 12% reached least developed countries (LDCs), which are the furthest from achieving SDG 7 targets.

The event was organized by the UNU Institute for Natural Resources in Africa (UNU-INRA), UNU Institute for the Advanced Study of Sustainability (UNU-IAS), UNU Institute for Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS), UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), and UN Department for Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA).



The session built on the UNU-INRA report on African Development in the Age of Stranded Assets, which discusses Africa’s development in light of potential asset stranding. The report aims to raise awareness on the need for effective natural resource management by African governments to achieve lower-carbon economies.



Osabarima Owusu Baafi Aboagye III, Chief of Akyem Dwenase, presented a keynote message on behalf of Okyenhene Osagyefuo Amoatia Ofori Panin, King of Akyem Abuakwa, Ghana. He said Africa’s policymakers must avoid the risk of stranded hydrocarbon resources and use them to drive the continent’s industrialization agenda.



Shinjiro Koizumi, Minister of the Environment, Japan, highlighted partnerships with developing countries to support the SDGs through integrated policy approaches.



Fatima Denton, Director, UNU-INRA, said COVID-19 has created major problems for hydrocarbon-dependent economies, with the sharp decrease in global oil prices. She explained Africa faces a paradox of plenty with rich hydrocarbon and mineral resources, while remaining largely energy poor. She highlighted the need to, inter alia:

decouple economic growth from carbon intensive investments;

scale up solar PV deployment;

harness renewable energy potential;

investment in digital economies; and

unlock climate finance.

On ways to manage the risks of stranded assets and opportunities of green transitions in Africa, panelists emphasized, among others, the importance of public sector investment to leverage private investment in clean energy solutions. They also discussed ways to ensure green transitions in urban spaces and support sustainable cities in Africa, emphasizing that decarbonization creates green jobs. Panelists also emphasized the need to include measures to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) in COVID-19 recovery strategies, and break policymaking silos and follow diverse pathways that include renewable energy.

125,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/covid-19-what-happens-when-summer-heatwaves-strike/,"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: COVID-19: What Happens When Summer Heatwaves Strike?,"Since the COVID-19 outbreak started in the middle of winter in the Northern hemisphere, it has become clear that it is to stay with us throughout and beyond the summer. The past few summers were among the hottest ever recorded, and forecasts have similar predictions for 2020: the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has put out a warning that this summer will likely see temperature extremes once again. With heatwaves becoming more extreme and lasting longer, they increasingly affect human health.

For example, in Germany alone, the heatwave of 2003 resulted in nearly 7,000 deaths and many heat-related illnesses such as heat strokes, dehydration, and cardiovascular diseases. Many of these have to be treated in hospitals and will therefore put an additional strain on the capacities of the healthcare system.

Heatwaves are particularly problematic for urban citizens because densely built-up urban areas are especially prone to the so-called “heat island effect.” This effect occurs because when buildings are close together, they heat up one another. This is why urban areas are often up to 3°C warmer than their rural surroundings. Additionally, temperatures hardly drop overnight anymore due to a lack of ventilation and thermal absorption of houses and surfaces. This leads to “tropical” nights when temperatures do not drop below 20°C, adding to the residents’ health stress.

When heatwaves strike, people in cities tend to flock to green open spaces like parks or to bodies of water because these have a cooling effect. However, this behavior leads to exactly the kind of overcrowding which is not compatible with physical distancing. In the past, many European cities took innovative precaution measures to allow people to cool down. They extended the opening hours of public pools or air-conditioned public spaces like town halls or shopping centers, for example. However this year, we will be facing a complete closure of these facilities or at least restricted hours of operation.

If the predictions are true and this summer proves to be extraordinarily hot, more people than ever before will be working from heated-up homes (most European countries do not have air conditioning in private residences) instead of air-conditioned office buildings. Their options to take weekend trips to the countryside will also be more limited than usual. Even taking a longer summer vacation to flee hot cities for a couple of weeks will be more difficult to realize.

Yet, if urban citizens are left without options to cool down, it will put an additional burden on healthcare systems as people suffer from heat-related symptoms. The heat will also take a toll on their mental health when, in addition to contact bans and restrictions, they have to deal with the discomfort caused by heat that they can hardly escape.

It is crucial to develop concrete ideas for how the urban population can safely navigate the summer.

Those cities that have already invested in large-scale green or blue infrastructure such as green open spaces and ponds will have an advantage. Such multifunctional spaces are not only cooler during heatwaves, but they also protect from natural hazard impacts like heavy rainfalls or flooding, which makes them a worthwhile investment beyond the pandemic. If they are designed in a grid with pocket parks and community gardens, the risk of overcrowded green areas and temporary closures decreases. We need to work out how to best utilize these existing spaces so that a large number of people can cool down safely.

While it may not be possible to build a park in time for a heatwave, it is not too late to create multifunctional spaces with mobile shading elements and some vegetation in crowded neighborhoods. Parking areas or empty lots, for example, have great potential for quick and highly effective conversion. Schoolyards could also be opened up for the public. In addition, we need space for cyclists and pedestrians where they can safely move around with enough distance between them. Many cities are addressing these challenges. Brussels, for example, has just introduced a new traffic concept for its inner city, and Munich has introduced pop-up trails.

There are also measures that individuals can take, which can be encouraged. Green roofs and walls contribute to cooling homes, for example. Now is the time to think about greening houses or retrofitting them, for instance by adding sunshades or vegetation to provide shade. Another measure is to enhance thermal insulation and ventilation systems of residential buildings.

Which measures work best where has to be decided on a case-by-case basis. People’s living arrangements are different and so are their challenges, which calls for different solutions. Those of us who live in small apartments without balconies or gardens and whose apartments heat up quickly will be more challenged than those living in large homes with big outdoor spaces. These kinds of social dimensions have to be taken into account.

At the same time, we have to keep in mind that while this pandemic is hopefully a temporary challenge, another more long-term pressing challenge, climate change, must not be neglected in our efforts. While houses and apartments can be cooled down with air conditioning units, experts consider them a form of “maladaptation.” Firstly, air conditioning units use a large amount of energy, which is harmful to the environment, and secondly, they give off heat to the surrounding area, which then gets even hotter.

The long-term goal for livable cities in line with SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) must be green-blue infrastructure, which not only benefits climate change adaptation and mitigation (SDG 13) but also gives us space for leisure and recreation, and ultimately contributes to human health and well-being (SDG 3). At the same time, it can contribute to multiple goals of the New Urban Agenda (NUA) as well as targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), including “build back better” as the guiding principle in recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction (Priority Area 4).

Finally, there are also some promising societal developments that we have seen with COVID-19. Over the past weeks, numerous community initiatives to support the elderly and other vulnerable groups have been initiated in many cities, including activities that bring together previously often unknown neighbors. Younger neighbors go shopping for older neighbors so that they do not expose themselves to the increased risks of contracting COVID-19, for example. Also in other crises, some societal groups tend to be more vulnerable than others. Less vulnerable groups supporting more vulnerable ones is a mechanism that has been proven highly successful in times of crisis, including during heatwaves, making it possible to spare the elderly from having to go to the supermarket on particularly hot days.

It is certain that COVID-19 will profoundly change how we experience summer, but it is not too late to prepare so that we can still enjoy the warmer temperatures.

Nearly 14% of this urban population was estimated to be living below the poverty line in 2011-12 with 65.5 million living in slums. India’s urban population is expected to rise to around 606 million by 2030.These figures are part of a comprehensive voluntary national review report on a wide range of sectors and progress made presented by Niti Aayog at the United Nations High-level Political Forum (HLPF) on sustainable development on Monday.The report, Decade of Action: Taking SDGs from Global to Local, emphasises how India is focussing on making the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) monitoring and implementation more localised for better results. It maps India’s progress, challenges and the way forward on various SDG goals ranging from no poverty, zero hunger, good health and gender equality to sanitation, sustainable cities and reducing inequalities.In the backdrop of the pandemic, Niti Aayog, vice chairman, Dr Rajiv Kumar, asserted that “the role of international cooperation is more critical than ever before.”Despite the pressure on cities, the report says “migration can, in fact, be turned into a strong economic opportunity by overcoming bottlenecks such as migrants’ lack of access to healthcare, social entitlements, education for children, lack of improvement in skill profile and employability”.A significant proportion of migrants and the poor in cities are employed in the informal economy which makes them vulnerable, especially in times such as the Covid-19 crisis. The report says that to mitigate the impact on various sectors including migrants both the central government and the states have announced an economic relief package with both short term and long term measures.The report cites the importance of schemes like “One Nation, One Ration Card” for enabling access to subsidised foodgrains across the country, irrespective of the place of origin of migrants.

The country’s updated NDC is more ambitious than the previous one, both in terms of its sectoral coverage and a commitment to deeper emission reductions in the energy sector.

The UNFCCC Secretariat received the updated NDC on 1 July 2020.

Taking steps to move towards an economy-wide target, Jamaica undertakes to bring emissions from the land-use change and forestry sector within its NDC for the first time.

For the energy sector, Jamaica has updated the reference indicator and identified opportunities to deepen emission reductions. The country’s first NDC had business-as-usual (BAU) energy emissions in 2030 of 14.5 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e), while in the new baseline, the comparable emissions are 8.2 MtCO2e. Jamaica is taking an increasingly comprehensive approach to decarbonizing the sector, covering both electricity generation, as well as energy use sub-sectors.

The changes to Jamaica’s NDC approximately double its ambition. The NDC foresees, by 2030, emission reductions in the forestry and energy sectors of between 25.4 % (unconditional) and 28.5 % (conditional upon international support). This implies that emissions in these sectors would be 1.8 MtCO2e to 2.0 MtCO2e lower than in the BAU scenario. When comparing with the range of 1.1 MtCO2e to 1.5 MtCO2e in its previous NDC, the absolute level of ambition in Jamaica’s unconditional commitment has increased by more than 60%.

Jamaica will further undertake a range of actions not covered under these quantitative commitments, including in the agriculture and waste sector. Among several agricultural projects, one focuses on promoting community-based climate resilience in the fisheries sector. Another project, on integrated watershed management, aims at improved conservation and management of biodiversity and provision of ecosystem services. This will be done by implementing sustainable agriculture (including renewable power generation), forestry, land management, and livelihood practices within targeted communities. An initial estimate suggests that the avoided deforestation, reforestation, and sustain able land management outcomes of the project could yield emission reductions of more than 550,000 tCO2e for the four-year duration of the project.

In the waste sector, Jamaica is developing a country-wide integrated waste management public-private partnership (PPP) concession to improve the management and reduce the emissions of the waste sector. The country is also undertaking a range of pilot projects to explore biodiesel from cooking oil, the production of biogas using animal waste, and increasing the use of biodigestors. The country has already banned the import, manufacture, distribution, and use of single-use plastic bags and plastic straws, as well as the import and manufacture of styrofoam.

According to the updated NDC, adaptation represents an important cross-cutting element for all sectors in Jamaica, a small island developing State (SIDS) exposed to many climate change risks. Adaptation co-benefits from the shift to cleaner energy will reduce local air pollution which would become more severe as temperatures increase. The preservation of the forest cover will improve water, soil, and air quality, and reduce soil erosion.

The updated NDC notes that Jamaica’s participation in the UNFCCC Talanoa Dialogue in 2018 generated political momentum for enhanced climate action, and resulted in more robust commitments thanks to both political support and implementation plans already in place.

Yet, Jamaica states, the availability and transfer of technologies that are environmentally sound and which support low-carbon and climate-resilient development is paramount. The NDC notes that further fostering North-South cooperation would help in building capacity and expertise, meeting the costs of transition measures, and meeting the need to be more efficient and to produce from cleaner technologies.

By Beate Antonich, Thematic Expert for Climate Change and Sustainable Energy","The country’s updated NDC is more ambitious than the previous one, both in terms of its sectoral coverage and a commitment to deeper emission reductions in the energy sector.
The UNFCCC Secretariat received the updated NDC on 1 July 2020.

During these sessions, the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP) Replenishment Task Force on the replenishment of the Multilateral Fund (MLF) presented its report to the parties.

As the Earth Negotiations Bulletin summary of the unusual OEWG notes, it was crucial that the Working Group prepare the way for the negotiation of the decisions to be adopted by the joint session of 12th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 12) to the Vienna Convention and 23rd Meeting of the Parties (MOP 23), which are tentatively scheduled for November 2020. In November, delegates will negotiate decisions related to funding that will support parties in phasing out ozone-depleting substances (ODS). The “MLF replenishment is a ‘do or die’ item for the Protocol as the current round of funding ends in December 2020.”

During the online sessions, the ENB summary reports that Replenishment Task Force Co-Chairs Bella Maranion, Suely Carvalho and Shiqui Zhang presented an overview of the report, stating that the MLF Replenishment needs to take into account not only the hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) phase-out but also the hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) phase-down. Estimated funding requirements put forward by the RTF ranged from USD 376,697,000 to USD 808,706,000.

Issues raised by parties during the discussions included:

creating centers of excellence for those countries whose consumption of ozone-depleting substances classifies them as low-volume-consuming countries to aid in capacity building;

considering the potential impact of COVID-19 on preserving the ozone infrastructure and implementation of future activities; and

insufficient funding for institutional strengthening.

The online forum will reopen from 17-31 July 2020, providing parties with another opportunity to submit comments and questions on the report that have not yet been addressed. The OEWG 42 Co-Chairs will then compile and share these submissions with all parties.

This country is well on its way in attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2030, according to TT’s permanent representative to the United Nations in New York Pennelope Beckles.

States presented their Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) to the United Nations in a two week-long conference which included a high-level political forum on sustainable development and a three-day ministerial meeting held under the UN Economic and Social Council. The theme was “Accelerated action and transformative pathways: realizing the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development.”

Beckles in her presentation of TTs first VNRs noted that it was centred around eight of the 17 SDGs and they were incorporated into TT’s national development strategy and vision 2030. The eight SDGs are good health care (SDG 3), quality education (SDG 4), gender equality (SDG 5), decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), reduced inequalities (SDG 10), climate action (SDG 13), peace, justice and strong institutions (SDG 16) and partnerships for the goals (SDG 17).

She explained that TT’s plan focused on putting people first by nurturing asset; delivering good governance and service excellence; improving productivity through quality infrastructure and transportation; building globally competitive businesses and placing the environment at the centre of social and economic development.

Beckles said, “Our commitment to “Leaving No-One Behind” has been anchored in the strengthening of the country's public policy framework through vision 2030 and the implementation of several policy initiatives directly related to SDG 3, SDG 4, SDG 5 and SDG 10.”

She noted that while TT and the world suffered tremendous losses due to covid19, this country minimised economic contraction through adjustments, reforms, and private sector support.

“Government has taken a multi-dimensional approach, with the introduction of a number of financial and economic measures to minimise contraction of the economy and maintain economic activity.

“This was in conjunction with the creation of a 'Road to Recovery' committee which comprised representatives from government, private sector, civil society, labour and academia, which was established to develop a plan for the reopening of society and the road to economic recovery for the post-pandemic period,” Beckles said.

She highlighted the progress within the health system through improved statistics in mortality rates with the Perinatal Information System which improves evidenced-based clinical decision-making for mothers and their new-born babies.

Beckles noted that, “The system contributed to the annual decline in the maternal mortality rate between 2015, from 42.9 per 100,000 live births to 12.3 per 100,000 live births, in 2018.

“Our nation's health sector also recorded a decline in the under-five mortality rates from 13.9 per 1,000 live births in 2016 to 11.3 per 1,000 live births in 2018.”

Beckles further noted TT’s moves to provide education for all with the increase of in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) centers (SDG 4); gender equality (SDG 5) through the increased participation of women in politics and reduced inequalities (SDG 10).

“The increase of the national minimum wage from $15 per hour, to $17.50 per hour, was in part aimed at improving the living conditions of the poor and vulnerable. These measures are further supported by a robust legal and policy framework which includes child protection and Gender -Based Violence units in our police service, she said.

Climate change, a big concern for small island developing states (SIDS) was of key importance to TT, Beckles pointed out and its contribution has been continued reduction in overall cumulative emissions from the electricity generation, industry, and transportation sectors.

Beckles added that TT continued to strive for strong institutions with the collaboration of government, law enforcement, academia, and civil societies among others for its effectiveness, but there remained challenges.

She said, “Undoubtedly, TT has made commendable strides. We are more cognisant of the challenges that could hinder our realisation of the 2030 Agenda. Climate change, citizen insecurity, socioeconomic and environmental vulnerabilities and the uncertainty stemming from the covid19 pandemic can all undermine our development ambitions.”","Beckles present TT’s SDG goals progress to UNFile photo: Pennelope BecklesThis country is well on its way in attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2030, according to TT’s permanent representative to the United Nations in New York Pennelope Beckles.

The government has delivered an outline of how well the country is implementing the Sustainable Development Goals. Prime Minister James Marape’s speech to the UN High-level political forum was delivered by National Planning Minister Sam Basil. It showcased the achievements and challenges of PNG. The conference was conducted at the APEC Haus early this morning via the United Nation’s website.

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals range from Good Health and Well Being to Eliminating Poverty, Hunger and Climate Action.

Being a member of the United Nations, PNG adopted “Agenda 2030’ in the 70th session of the General Assembly in 2015.

This means PNG has agreed to measure its performances on development against the global benchmarks using indicators of the 17 SDGs.

In the first five SDGs, where it focuses on Ending Poverty, Zero Hunger, Good Health and Well Being, Quality Education and Gender Equality, Prime Minister Marape says the population living below the extreme poverty line as per the last national survey has improved from 53 percent of the total population in 1996 to 39 percent in 2010.

The Prime Minister has noted improvement in health statistics that shows an increase in life expectancy rates but made mention that more focus needs to be given to health issues like TB and Malaria.

The other 12 SDGs include decent work and economic growth to responsible consumption and production.

In these different goals, the Prime Minister noted that the local economy has grown from an average of 6 percent between 2010 and 2014, highlighting a peak in 2013 at 13 percent before declining in 2015 to a 9.5 percent.","Share the NewsThe government has delivered an outline of how well the country is implementing the Sustainable Development Goals.

The UN has warned in its recently released State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2020 report that achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of zero hunger might not be possible by 2030. The report estimates 690 million people suffering from hunger globally in 2019, 10 million more than the previous year.

The Covid-19 pandemic, and the global recession caused by it, will without doubt make matters worse, the report warns, with 130 million more suffering from chronic hunger in 2020. In 2019, Asia had the highest number of hungry people (381 million), followed by Africa (250 million), and Latin America and the Caribbean (48 million). However, by 2030, Africa is estimated by the UN to account for around more than half of the world’s hungry people by 2030. The lowest-cost healthy diet is estimated to cost, on an average, more than $1.90—which is more than the international poverty threshold—and around three billion people across the globe are unable to afford this. Rising food deprivation will exacerbate the existing problem of nutrition security.

The largest impact, both for the present as well as the future, will be of hunger amongst children—191 million children under the age of five are currently undernourished. While India saw under-5 undernutrition decline by around 60 million over the last one and a half decade, from 21.7% in 2004-06 to 14% in 2017-19, and stunting has also come down, experts fear the pandemic could erode some of this progress. The UN has pitched for clubbing direct cash transfers with in-kind transfers to ensure food security and diet diversity, though, in India’s case, it talks of the inefficiencies of the PDS and calls for reducing subsidies and redirecting these to direct cash transfer. Malnutrition, as estimated by FAO earlier, may cost nations 4-5% of their GDPs. Given how ensuring food security gets more urgent in the post-Covid-19 world, India needs to shift comprehensively to cash support, so that the vulnerable don’t fall through gaps—thanks to poor implementation, the bulk of beneficiaries of the free-grains announced under the corona relief package by the Union government were unable to receive these in states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.","However, by 2030, Africa is estimated by the UN to account for around more than half of the world’s hungry people by 2030.

The “new special topic” for the issue is market access for medical goods and COVID-19 medical supplies.

The report titled, ‘World Tariff Profiles 2020,’ compiles the main tariff parameters for each of the 164 WTO members, as well as other countries and customs territories where data are available. Each one-page tariff profile contains information on tariffs imposed by each economy on its imports, with disaggregation by sectors and duty ranges, and includes an analysis of the market access conditions each economy faces in its major export markets.

The publication features summary tariff and trade statistics for all countries and territories for all products, including a breakdown into agricultural and non-agricultural products, and information on non-tariff measures such as safeguards and anti-dumping measures, which, the report notes, “are of increasing importance in international trade.” Statistics for all countries and territories are presented in standardized tables, which, the report states, allows for easy comparisons between economies, between sectors, and, specifically for WTO members, between bound and applied tariffs.

The “special topic,” which presents a new subject in each edition, deals with market access for medical goods and COVID-19 medical supplies. The report notes that the COVID-19 pandemic “has highlighted the importance of easy access to affordable medical products” and that shortages of essential products and increased prices “have made it all the more challenging for countries to combat the crisis.” The relevant chapter discusses the bound and applied tariffs for medical products such as medicines and medical technology, critical for the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the report, the average tariff applied by WTO members to all medical products is 4.8%, with the highest tariffs (11.5% on average) being applied to personal protective products.

“I feel very fortunate to have had such a long career at the County and I truly enjoyed my work,” Thomson said. “I have worked with many great Wardens, Councils and staff. The County has seen me through many of life’s milestones – getting married, having children and now grandchildren.”

Thomson said her decision to retire came with “mixed emotions” as she weighed her love of work along with her love of family.

“I discovered through the COVID shut down, I really enjoy being at home,” she said. “My office visitors were one-, two- and three-year-olds and a farmer who stopped for lunch. I have realized it is time.”

Addressing ECOSOC (United Nations Economic and Social Council) commemoration of UN's 75th anniversary, the Prime Minister said the 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas' (together for everyone's growth with everyone's trust) motto resonates with the core SDG principle of leaving no one behind.

""India also contributed to shaping the ECOSOC agenda, including the SDGs. Today, through our domestic efforts, we are again playing a salient role in achieving Agenda 2030 and the SDGs. We are also supporting other developing countries in meeting their SDGs,"" he said.

""Our motto is 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas'. This resonates with the core SDG principle of leaving no one behind. Be it access to nutrition, health education, electricity or housing. We are making great progress through our inclusive programmes,"" the Prime Minister said.

He said other developing countries can learn from the scale and success of India's development programmes.

""It is this realisation that underpins India's own development partnership with the Global South,"" he said.

Noting that over the past few years India has reduced 38 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually, he said this was achieved by electrifying our villages, providing clean cooking fuel to 80 million poor households and the introduction of energy-efficient measures.

""We have set a target to install 450 Gigawatt of renewable energy and restore 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030. We have an age-old tradition of living in harmony with nature,"" Modi said.He said that the government has launched one of the largest campaigns for cleanliness and discouraged usage of single-use plastic. He stated that the setting up of International Solar Alliance was a practical manifestation of climate action.

""Similarly, the Coalition for Disaster Resilience Infrastructure brings together all relevant stakeholders for a comprehensive approach. We have always prided ourselves as the first responder in our region -- a friend in need,"" the Prime Minister said.

Modi said that his government has given the highest priority to deliver benefits to the poor households.

""We have announced a package of more than USD 300 billion. It will bring the economy back on track, build modern infrastructure and put in place a technology-driven system. We have put forward a vision of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat', a self-reliant and resilient India, integrated with the global economy,"" the Prime Minister said.

Talking about the COVID-19 fight, the Prime Minister said that the grassroots health system is ""helping India ensure one of the best recovery rates in the world"".

Speaking about his government's initiatives, Modi said that India achieved full sanitation coverage in 6,00,000 villages on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. He also spoke about the country's improvement in rural sanitation cover, food security and how women-oriented programmes have transformed lives and livelihoods.

""In five years, we built over 110 million household toilets, which improved our rural sanitation cover from 38 per cent to 100 per cent. Our massive awareness generation programmes are empowering our women. We have achieved gender parity in elementary and secondary education,"" he said.

The Prime Minister noted that nearly 70 million women in rural India are part of self-help groups under the Livelihood Mission. ""They are transforming lives and livelihoods on a big scale. Over a million women are elected representatives of our local governments, leading the process of participatory development,"" the Prime Minister said.

""In the last six years, we opened 400 million bank accounts for the unbanked, out of which 220 million are owned by women. We have leveraged the power of technology for financial inclusion. This is based on the trinity of a unique identity number, a bank account and a mobile connection for everyone. It has allowed us to make Direct Benefit Transfers of USD 150 billion to over 700 million people. Our food security programmes reach 813 million citizens,"" he said.

The Prime Minister said that the 'Housing for All' programme will ensure that every Indian will have a safe and secure roof over his head by 2022, when India completes 75 years of independence. ""By then, 40 million new homes would have been made under this programme, more than the total number of households in many countries,"" he added.

The Prime Minister said 'Ayushmaan Bharat' scheme is the world's largest health protection programme, covering 500 million individuals. He also said that India is on track to eliminate tuberculosis by 2025.

Article content SDG council recently approved a change order for skin patching on County Rd. 43, from intersection of South Street West to the south limits of the Chesterville Bridge for $83,000. Asphalt skin patching is a short term, economical pavement repair solution for small asphalt surfaces. It works by covering an isolated, damaged area of asphalt with new asphalt material, according to ACI Asphalt and Concrete. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. SDG council approves various tenders Back to video “This is a request for council’s consideration, we’ve finished our cold-in place contract and we were able to finish under budget,” said Benjamin de Haan, director of transportation and planning services. “We didn’t need as much asphalt cement as we originally anticipated in that one.” “As we’re going through the different roadways, depending on the asphalt cement that we can recover, from the stuff we’re recycling, it does go up and down of what we need. We have the flexibility in that contract.”

Article content Council’s support was sought to address a small section of road that is in poor shape relative to surrounding sections, according to an administration report. Council previously approved a skin patch repair on County Rd. 43, between County Rd. 7 to South Street West in Chesterville, in July 2016. The skin patch was necessitated due to the poor shape of the section of the road, specifically the significant rut which had materialized in the westbound lane. Since the competition of this repair, this portion of the road has remained in good shape and has not shown the expected deterioration profile typical of a skin-patch repair. Last year, council additionally approved the completion of cold-in place recycling and hot mix paving on County Rd. 43, from Chesterville to County Rd. 31. The area which was treated in 2019 was specifically from the north end of the Chesterville Bridge to County Rd. 31. The consequence of the above noted work is that a 350 metre section of the County Rd. 43 between the south limits of the Chesterville Bridge to South Street West remains in poor shape, exhibiting some signs of failure and cracking distresses. The skin patch repair will consist of paddling and cross fall correction, with a full 25mm lift installed over the entire length. Also include in the price is the shouldering and key joints. The expectation is that this section will deteriorate similarly to the 2016 skin patch between County Rd. 7 and South Street West, ensuring that this small section remains on a similar deterioration profile to the adjacent section.

Article content Council approved a claim from a contractor as a result of increased costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic resulted in Roto Mill Inc., a cold-in-place recycling contractor that had received a $2,697,419 contract from the county, to request an additional $37,130. The request was made due to the company having incurred additional costs due to the pandemic. “The submission we did receive was the direct invoices,” said de Haan. “It’s just hotel rooms. They did have to do extra health and safety and sanitization and a whole bunch of different things. Extra vehicles and extra costs that were not part of this claim, but the claim is strictly for extra hotel rooms they needed because they usually double-up their staff and they had to split them all apart. They were here for quite a length of time.” De Haan further stated that he felt sympathetic to the company, as it was required to change their whole operation due to the virus. Administration reported a surplus of about $260,000 as a result of favourable asphalt cement pricing and less than budgeted asphalt cement volumes. Based on projections, the hot mix contract is also expected to be completed on budget. It recommended that council use the surplus to offset the claim. At the start of the work, the contractor notified the county that they were expecting to encounter cost increases and challenges as a result of the pandemic, requesting that the council consider compensating them for reasonable and documented costs which would not have been included in the contract price. At the outset, the contractor indicated that they would be willing to provide all receipts to substantiate a claim, would not include any overhead or profit, and, would make any and all efforts to minimize the extra costs.

Article content Tender for culvert lining awarded to Edgewater Sewer Services Inc. Edgewater Sewer Services Inc. was recently awarded a tender for curried-in-place lining work to be undertaken at nine cross culverts throughout the counties. The tender is valued at $139,998. The liners that have been specified are designed to be standalone new pipes — the old pipes being lined simply act as a conduit. According to administration, these new liners have a 50-year service life. “What our plan was for the county, from an organization perspective was that of course we like to do culvert lining, it is very efficient,” said de Haan. “We get a lot of work done at relatively comparable, if not, cheaper prices then actual conventional replacement. We like to do this on culverts where the shape is still there, but it’s deteriorating. This liner goes in as a new pipe.” This type of culvert rehabilitation is becoming more popular because of its low impact on road users and pricing when compared to conventional culvert replacement, according to administration reports. jsantos@postmedia.com twitter.com/ByJoshuaSantos

Registration for the Alexandria camp will begin on July 6. The Cornwall camp is open to children aged six to 12, whereas the Alexandria camp is open to children four to 12. “This is significantly smaller than previous years and that stems from the requirements in following the guidelines from the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, and the Eastern Ontario Health Unit,” said Jacquie Richards, executive director of the Boys and Girls Club of Cornwall and SDG. “Regulations in place allow us to only have a certain amount of spots available this year.”

Article content According to Richards, management was optimistic it could still hold a summer camp this year. It just wasn’t sure what kind of summer camp it would turn out to be. “Everything changes so quickly with the COVID situation,” she said. “Regardless of what was happening, we we’re going to have camp, a certain version of camp, whether that was going to be physical camp, which is on premise or virtual camp.” More On This Topic Cornwall Boys and Girls Club take part in Giving Tuesday Cornwall Boys & Girls Club kids get Best Buy scholarships When the Boys and Girls Club received the go ahead to host the summer camp, its team took the time to reformat the camp’s procedures and formats in order to comply with the many safety and health measures. “We want to offer the camp in a fun and engaging way,” said Richards. “Our No. 1 priority is the safety and the well-being of the children, their families and our staff.” The club may be the first to open registration for a summer day camp in the region. The City of Cornwall doesn’t run day camp programs, and other area municipalities and agencies either already cancelled summer programs, or haven’t announced if they will open. The St. Lawrence River Institute is running a smaller version of its summer science camp, with information on registration and the program available on its website. This year’s activities will be promoting physical distancing, while maintaining fun. These include indoor and outdoor play, crafts, science experiments, water-related activities and more. There won’t be any field trips or out-trips that require transportation.

Article content Although children won’t be forced to wear masks while at camp, they will be welcome to wear them if they want to. Staff members working in camps will be wearing masks however, when they are indoors and not capable of physically distancing. In addition, there will be daily health screenings when a child is dropped off to camp. This includes a check of the child’s temperature. Parents will also be asked to print and complete a screening questionnaire each day, prior to arriving at the camp, in order to speed up dropoff routines. “When we decided to offer a summer program, it really was respond to that need from families, specifically reaching out to us, seeking out summer child-care options,” said Richards. “Many families have reached out, needing to have a program in place for summer. Part of our role in the community is to respond to that need as best we can, as safely as we can.” In addition to the summer camp, the Boys and Girls Club of Cornwall and SDG will launch next week its Virtual Summer Camp, for children aged six to 12. The free program is offered through a partnership with the Blue Jays and the Jays Care Foundation and will give youths the opportunity to connect with club staff and other children of their own age while playing games and building a strong social connection virtually. Registration and more information about the two camps is available by visiting the Boys and Girls Club of Cornwall and SDG’s website, at www.bgccornwallsdg.com.

They are some of the signs of the times.

In Cornwall and across the region – and across the continent and beyond – yard signs started popping up late in the spring and early in the summer, in front of houses and apartment buildings, all making very special announcements: this is the home of a high school graduate.

We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Signs of the times: Celebrating graduates in Cornwall/SDG Back to video

Before long, even some students who were graduating from an elementary school had their own sign, as there were plenty of those across the region too.

The spring portion of the school year was very different this year, classes being cancelled after March break due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Online studies salvaged some of the semester, but it wasn’t the same, obviously.

For those in their final year of high school, it was a particularly difficult and bittersweet time. Their lives were about to change, but there could be no formal graduation ceremony, or prom for that matter.

Yard signs became one of the ways that students and families marked and celebrated the occasion.

Have the graduates and families of the Class of 2020 started a new tradition? Surely regular graduation ceremonies will resume next year and beyond, but maybe the signs will be back, too.

Here’s a rather large sample of some of the graduation signs in Cornwall and across the area.","Signs of the times: Celebrating graduates in Cornwall/SDG Back to videoBefore long, even some students who were graduating from an elementary school had their own sign, as there were plenty of those across the region too.

The Secretariats of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) made the changes to account for ongoing restrictions on physical meetings due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to ensure the completion of work leading to each milestone event.

CBD Shifts SBSTTA and SBI to 2021

On 24 August 2020, the CBD Secretariat announced that it “is now clear that it will not be possible to convene any large physical intergovernmental meeting this year,” due to the global pandemic. Following consultations with the Bureaux of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the CBD and its Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA), as well as the Chair of the Subsidiary Body on Implementation (SBI), meetings of SBSTTA 24 and SBI 3 – the dates for which had been shifted several times – are being moved to the first quarter of 2021, “conditions allowing.” The Chairs, Bureaux, and Secretariat will consider options for virtual discussions in November.

In preparation for the SBSTTA and SBI meetings, the CBD Secretariat will convene virtual sessions in September 2020. The launch of the 5th Global Biodiversity Outlook report (GBO-5) will also take place in September.

New dates for the third meeting of the Working Group on the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework have not yet been announced.

The Secretariat also announced that the President of the CBD COP, Yasmine Fouad, Minister of Environment of Egypt, has requested an extraordinary meeting of the COP and the meetings of the Parties to the Cartagena and Nagoya Protocols (COP-MOPs) at the end of 2020. The purpose of the ExCOP would be to consider and approve an interim budget for the Secretariat’s operations in 2021. The Parties are expected to consider the draft budget decision either through a silence/written procedure or a virtual meeting that would take place within the period from 16-19 November 2020.

CBD COP 15 was originally scheduled to take place in October 2020. Following an announcement on 15 July 2020, the meeting is now expected to take place from 17-30 May 2021, in Kunming, China.

UNFCCC Considering Additional Event in 2021

On 28 May 2020, the UNFCCC COP Bureau decided that the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26), which was originally scheduled to take place from 9-19 November 2020, in Glasgow, UK, will take place from 1-12 November 2021, still in Glasgow.

Subsequently, at the end of June 2020, the COP Bureau decided to postpone the meetings of the UNFCCC Subsidiary Bodies (SB52) until 2021, at a date to be decided. During the time frame during which the SB52 meetings were originally scheduled, the Secretariat organized a series of virtual events under the banner, ‘June Momentum on Climate Change.’

In related news, during a UNFCCC COP Bureau meeting on 25 August 2020, the Bureau decided that “there could be an additional third session in 2021 if needed to catch up on work,” in order to be prepared for COP 26 in November 2021, according to a report from the Least Developed Countries (LDC) Group on Climate Change.

UNCCD Review of Implementation Set for February 2021

On 12 August 2020, the Secretariat for the UNCCD announced that the 19th meeting of the Committee for the Review of the Implementation of the Convention (CRIC 19), which was expected to take place at the end of 2020, will now take place from 10-12 February 2021, in Bonn, Germany.

However, the second edition could not address the methodological issues sufficiently. The justifications and coverage on several aspects, such as proxy indicator identification, target setting, state categorisation, imputation of indicators, data gaps are found to be weak. This commentary highlights some of the problems identified in the report and suggests possible solutions, which can bring more credibility and statistical acceptance to the future SDG index reports.

NITI Aayog launched the first edition of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Index India Report in 2018 to measure India’s and its states’ progress towards the SDGs for 2030. It was meant to provide an aggregate assessment of performance of Indian states and union territories on social, economic and environmental parameters. Further, it was aimed to serve as a tool to benchmark progress, identify data issues, devise better policy strategies coupled with a sense of competitiveness among the states (NITI Aayog 2018). It was also one the first few attempts by a country to rank its subnational governments by using an index on SDGs (NITI Aayog 2019). The second edition of the report has been recently released. This is an enhanced version with 100 indicators covering 54 targets across 16 SDGs leaving SDG 17 as compared to the base version with 62 indicators covering 13 SDGs (leaving 12, 13, 14 and 17). This is a progressive sign with regard to larger coverage of goals, targets and indicators, and alignment with the National Indicator Framework (NIF), which serves as the backbone of SDG monitoring in the country (MoSPI 2019).

However, there is a need to critically analyse and relook at the methodology of SDG index and the policy implications it directs for the country. The following sections highlight some of the methodological issues and policy perspectives identified by the authors in the recent SDG Index India Report, 2019. The discussion also highlights possible solutions for each problem along with the relevant global context.","The second edition (2019) of the Sustainable Development Goals Index India Report released by the NITI Aayog is an enhanced version that builds on the baseline report of 2018.

The Alliance’s report proposes 64 recommendations to harmonize and scale SDG financing and investment, with particular attention to the European Union (EU).

Released in early August 2020, the report titled, ‘Renewed, Recharged and Reinforced: Urgent actions to harmonize and scale sustainable finance,’ urges public and private leadership to achieve the SDGs. It calls for mobilizing private sustainable investment through fair and transparent risk-sharing agreements and making faster and scaled use of blended finance. The report argues that green investments alone will be insufficient to deliver the SDGs or the Paris Agreement on climate change; the entire economy and the whole financial system must “undergo a sweeping transition to a more sustainable future.” Proposals to deliver this transition include a financial incentive system that uses fiscal measures to rewards companies for creating sustainable stakeholder value and striving for sustainability outcomes.

Fiscal incentives could be used to reward companies for sustainability outcomes.

To move towards sustainability, the report underscores the “imperative of collective behavioral and policy alignment,” stressing that everyone must “row in the same direction in a coordinated way,” from aligning climate scenarios and risk methodologies for banks, to aligning policy lending and private investor flows. The report calls for addressing “inconsistent approaches to metrics” and poor quality, inconsistently disclosed sustainability data. The report recommends fixing these flawed metrics, aligning standards, and providing consistent information, and mandating confirmed disclosures to ensure SDG-related disclosures are built into existing governance structures. The report further calls for embracing partnerships, collaboration, and innovation to fund the Goals, including by investing in technologies and processes for metrics that support SDGs and sustainability.

Among their detailed recommendations, the members of the Alliance call for:

endorsing the Basel Committee’s high-level Task Force on Climate-related Financial Risks (TCFR) to develop a framework for environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) risk supervision applicable to global financial institutions;

making sustainability reporting mandatory for financial and non-financial institutions, including through globally harmonized disclosure requirements that go beyond climate metrics to include material SDG-related information and forward-looking data;

increasing the quality, ambition, and standardization of Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) for the 2030 Agenda and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for the Paris Agreement, including by establishing an international platform for the development of investable national capital-raising plans and transaction-oriented investor engagement;

ensuring that public subsidies align with the SDGs and the Paris Agreement; and

diversifying and increasing bond issuance across the SDGs and drive green bond principles and standards into the project finance market.

The report responds to the European Commission’s (EC) Renewed Sustainable Finance Strategy Consultation and features specific recommendations for the EU. Those recommendations include: requiring standardized ESG disclosures from companies participating in the EU Green Deal Investment Plan; elevating the Shareholder Rights Directive to the status of an EU Regulation; and elevating the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive to the status of an EU Regulation.

The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) developed the GISD Alliance in collaboration with the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), based on the design of the Swedish Investors for Sustainable Development. The Alliance is part of the UN Secretary-General’s strategy for financing sustainable development, and aims to to provide leadership for mobilizing resource for sustainable development and to accelerate and scale up finance and investment for the SDGs.

The IIGCC developed the ‘Net Zero Investment Framework’ with over 70 leading global investors representing an aggregate of over USD 16 trillion in assets. The guide is intended to enable investors to adopt a strategy to decarbonize their investment portfolios while increasing investment in climate solutions to help achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

The Framework is “based on the expectation that governments and policy makers will deliver on commitments to achieve the 1.5°C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.” The IIGCC designed the Framework to help deliver “additional meaningful long-term emission reductions,” overcoming limitations in other approaches “based only on portfolio emissions reduction or portfolio temperature targets,” which allow investors to “technically meet targets while selling the problem to someone else.”

The Framework provides a comprehensive set of recommended actions, metrics, and methodologies to enable both asset owners and managers to become “net zero investors.” It covers four asset classes: sovereign bonds; listed equities; corporate fixed income; and real estate, with other asset classes to follow. The Framework identifies five core components of a net zero investment strategy: governance and strategy; objectives and targets; strategic asset allocation; asset class alignment; and policy advocacy and market engagement.

The Framework is open for consultation until 25 September 2020. Five investors – APG, Brunel, the Church of England Pensions Board, PKA, and Phoenix Group – are testing the Framework by modeling its impact across the performance of their portfolios, collectively valued at USD 1.3 trillion. Results of this analysis will be included in the final Framework, expected to be released later in 2020.

The IIGCC is a European membership body for collaboration on climate change. The organization includes over 240 members, mostly pension funds and asset managers, across fifteen countries, representing over EUR 33 trillion in assets under management. The Framework is a key output of the IIGCC’s Paris Aligned Investing Initiative (PAII), which was established at the request of European asset owners to develop key definitions and concepts relating to the alignment of investment strategies to the Paris Agreement.

The Observatory’s lead in paint database issued an interactive map showing the countries that have lead paint legislation and their corresponding limits on the amount of lead allowed in paint. The countries with the strictest controls, such as the US, Canada, Kenya, India, and China, have 90 ppm as the upper limit of lead concentrations in paint. Switzerland, Thailand, and Tanzania have limited it to 100 ppm. The UN Environment Programme’s (UNEP) ‘Model Law and Guidance for Regulating Lead Paint’ recommends a lead concentration limit of 90 ppm.

Tracking legislation of lead in paint is part of the larger Global Health Observatory platform, which also provides information on universal health coverage, health emergencies, and health and well-being, among other topics. It also includes data on health-related issues such as child health and malnutrition, malaria, governance and aid effectiveness, maternal and reproductive health, public health and environment, and the SDGs.

On its SDG page, the Observatory provides country data for SDG targets and indicators related to, inter alia: maternal mortality, including maternal mortality ratio per 100,000 live births and percentage of births attended by a skilled health nurse; newborn and child mortality and the probability of dying between birth and age 1; communicable diseases, including incidence of tuberculosis, malaria, and new HIV cases; mental health and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including cancer and cardiovascular disease; substance abuse; road traffic injuries; mortality from environmental pollution, including ambient and indoor air pollution, and unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); and development assistance and vaccine coverage.

The platform also details data by country on other health-related SDG targets, including:

SDG target 1.a (mobilization of resources for ending poverty);

SDG target 2.2 (child malnutrition);

SDG target 5.2 (eliminating violence against women and girls);

SDG target 6.1 (access to drinking water);

SDG target 6.a (water and sanitation-related capacity building);

SDG target 11.6 (clean cities), including concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM25); and

152,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/pandemic-lessons-open-data-for-forest-and-climate-action/,"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Pandemic Lessons: Open Data for Forest and Climate Action,"Since March 2020, we have witnessed numerous parallels between COVID-19 and the climate crisis, including a lack of cohesive, coordinated global intervention and a laissez-faire response to a global emergency.

Inadequate government response to the pandemic has led to preventable deaths from a highly contagious virus, just as inadequate government responses to the climate crisis could result in exacerbated effects by drought, fires or flooding as well as rising food insecurity. These risks are fast approaching their tipping points.

COVID-19 has inundated our lives with numbers and social media updates to the point of statistical overload, a phenomenon WHO refers to as an ‘infodemic.’ The flood of information has occasionally caused the public to question the veracity of certain claims, which in turn has hampered effective public health responses. Nonetheless, the vast availability of data encourages scientists and citizen scientists across the world to disseminate models, ideas and scenarios for better progress against the virus.

Open Data for Forests

The pandemic reinforces the importance of data for interpretation and dissemination. It is a resource that needs to be carefully curated, because leaders, whether in health or in climate science, need to make informed decisions in order to respond to global agendas such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Likewise, citizens will need assurance and transparency to act as individuals and communities, and to advocate for data-driven policy development.

Likewise, forest data transparency is key to supporting higher levels of ambition for the roles of forests in climate change action. Progress in National Forest Monitoring Systems (NFMS) in the past ten years has catalyzed solutions for forests and climate action, such as for REDD+. In many countries, greater transparency of countries’ forest-sector data and information has resulted in improved national decision-making, and for the first time, detailed and transparent forest data has been reported internationally, with 50 countries having submitted forest reference emissions levels to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

Still, countries’ efforts towards forest data transparency must be strengthened. Under the Enhanced Transparency Framework of the Paris Agreement, robust data collection is central for reporting on emissions and removals, as well as for tracking the progress of Nationally Determined Contributions. An NFMS that is transparent, reliable, relevant, accessible, and sustainable can support climate action on the ground.

What lessons can forest monitoring practitioners take from the ongoing pandemic?

Sharing openly can flatten the curve: With COVID-19, countries that have embraced data acquisition through frequent testing and have been transparent about infection rates have mostly succeeded in flattening the curve of infections. In Germany, testing, tracing, and transparency are credited with building public trust. Likewise, improved data availability combined with transparency could catalyze more collaborative solutions to the climate crisis that could equally buy some precious time to achieve the terms of the Paris Agreement. Climate policies need up-to-date and integrated information: Data sets can be shared at unprecedented speed. While the availability of COVID-19 related data has often overwhelmed data consumers and resulted in conflicting guidance, frequent and integrated forest data is likely to enhance public engagement and collaboration on relevant solutions for forests. Public money means public information: Enormous financial resources have been poured into COVID-19 monitoring. Likewise, national forest data is primarily collected through taxpayer finances, either through national or international cooperation funds. Greater public financing of large-scale data collection and sharing ultimately means greater information available to the public, enhancing public trust and increasing opportunities for investors and researchers. Open, transparent, and reliable forest data can also enhance private investment, which is urgently needed to trigger transformation of forest and land management for climate action and other multiple benefits. Accurate and reliable forest data created from public funds needs to be open and accessible to the public. Overcoming obstacles to sharing: Under the pandemic, open data has accelerated science, but also introduced vulnerabilities. Both media and politicians have sometimes reported promising results before they have been scientifically validated. Among the obstacles to sharing forest data is the concern of inadequate use of the data and lack of intellectual property recognition. Barely 14% of researchers in 2018 shared their data in repositories. Yet, twisting the tragedy of the commons, while 74% researchers value others’ data sharing as beneficial to their own research, both scientists and governments show reluctance to share their own data.

To overcome this resistance, legal agreements that release individual contributors from conflicts with the institutions involved in data sharing are needed, with updated and harmonized measures to ensure anonymity of legal subjects and/or spatial coordinates. Further, data ownership recognition standards should encourage data sharing. Government officials and researchers need to follow the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) guiding principles for data management and stewardship, thereby making the case that in the end the benefits of sharing outweigh the disadvantages.

Forest Open Data Platforms and FAO’s Support

Some existing microdata platforms, such as the Global Forest Biodiversity Initiative GFBI, largely compile and share global field data for academic research and require strict rules on confidentiality and control of users. Yet, forest-related information still remains largely scattered across multiple platforms. FAO is working with UN Member States to overcome obstacles to open forest data. Our current efforts include:

the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020, which provides country validated forest data, accessible through an interactive platform and dashboards.

the Hand-in-Hand geospatial platform launched recently, representing a major step towards accessible and transparent cross-sectoral geospatial data across agriculture, fisheries, and forestry.

a set of free and open source tools (Open Foris) developed by FAO to facilitate flexible and efficient data collection, analysis, and reporting helping to enhance forest monitoring at national level.

A new FAO project ‘Building global capacity to increase transparency in the forest sector (CBIT-Forest)’ to establish a Global Field Forest Observation Repository with a view to harmonizing legal assurances in data confidentiality, redistribution policies, and quality assurance conditions meeting international data documentation protocols. Microdata inclusion on this platform would contribute to increased standardization, accessibility and data usage.

A New, Transparent Normal?

COVID-19 has increased awareness about the power of data sharing. We hope that this motivates governments and forest monitoring practitioners to share forest data. At the same time, it is important that open databases follow standards to minimize misuse and misinterpretation. We believe that open forest data can strengthen our collective effort to identify and apply solutions for forests as a key response to the climate emergency.

FAO’s support to forest monitoring aims to strengthen data openness standards, while solving conflicts with data protection and confidentiality. In order to achieve reusability, clear and accessible data use licenses must exist. Legal certainty through license to redistribute agreements, ensure data robustness alongside data sensitivity. A Global Field Forest Observation Repository to facilitate data sharing of forest microdata to technicians and academics while supporting international reporting requirements across countries, is a step towards fostering that necessary transparency.

The 2020 HLPF was an important moment for the global policy community to take stock of where we stand on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Yet as we reach one-third of the way into our SDG journey, only 22 out of the 93 (23%) environment-related indicators showed good progress during the last 15 years. For the other 77% of environment-related SDGs indicators, there is either insufficient data to assess progress (68%) or it is unlikely that the target will be met without scaling up action (9%).

Freshwater shortfalls, rate of species extinction, deforestation, and land degradation are accelerating. With a global average temperature increase of 1.1°C above estimated pre-industrial levels, the international community is worryingly off track to meeting either the 1.5°C or 2°C targets called for in the Paris Agreement. Monitoring progress on the SDGs has never been more crucial, as both countries and the international community aim to achieve the Goals by 2030.

The importance of timely, quality, open, and disaggregated data has been brought to the fore by the COVID-19 crisis. Such data are critical in understanding, managing, and mitigating the social and economic effects of the pandemic. They are also essential for designing short-term responses and accelerated actions to put countries back on track to achieve the SDGs. In 2019, most countries reported that they were carrying out a national statistical plan (141 countries, up from 129 in 2018), but according to the UN, the pandemic has caused many National Statistical Offices (NSOs) in low-medium income countries to experience closures, funding cuts, and limitations in face-to-face data collection. These challenges may produce a lasting impact on countries’ abilities to produce timely and high-quality data.

Juxtaposed to this lack of environmental SDG data, sustainability reporting among the private sector has risen dramatically. According to the study run by the Governance and Accountability Institute, companies in the S&P 500 Index disclosing sustainability information rose from 20% to 85% between 2011 and 2017. Better informed investors, conscious of the growing economic importance of ESG indicators, have already been shown to be game changers in accelerating corporate action to tackle climate change. This information can be harnessed to help address the SDG environmental data gap.

It is vital that the private sector sustainability community works with the statistical community to understand each other and advance efforts to capture and analyze relevant data for the SDGs. To explore the role of private sector data in measuring progress towards the SDGs, CDP and GRI held a panel event during the HLPF 2020. Central to this discussion were the findings in the 2020 edition of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals Report, which showed large data gaps remaining in the timeliness, geographic coverage, and level of disaggregation required. These gaps, together with the impact of COVID-19, highlight the need for data innovations and new partnerships required to bridge data gaps, including between the public and private sectors.

Two of CDP’s latest reports, on climate and nature-based solutions, demonstrate the need to ensure a conducive policy environment for globally standardized climate-related disclosure, mandating, where appropriate, the adoption of the recommendations of the Task Force for Climate-related Finance Disclosure (TCFD), and to mainstreaming nature-based solutions into legislation and regulatory frameworks for policy coherence between climate change, biodiversity, and sustainable development.

In this SDGs decade of action, the time is ripe to advance the Agenda that we started exploring back in 2012, on the margins of the Rio+20 conference, where the private sector was first recognized as a key actor on sustainable development through the practice of sustainability reporting (paragraph 47). Action does not mean reinventing the wheel. We can begin by looking at what data are already available from business SDG-related disclosure, understand how NSOs can access and use these data, and develop a methodology for the engagement and use of business-generated, SDGs-related data for the Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs).

With the 2020 World Data Forum around the corner, efforts to leverage corporate environmental data to address the SDG data gap are increasingly gathering attention in a number of jurisdictions. A strengthened partnership between the public and private sectors will be essential to ensure COVID-19 recovery pathways are inclusive, sustainable, and in line with efforts to achieve the SDGs by 2030. While it will be important to think of new ways to address the effects of the pandemic, a framework response for sustainable development already exists: ensure the achievement of the Paris Agreement’s goals and the SDGs.

While the pandemic demonstrates the immediate benefits of digital finance, the disruptive potential of digitalisation in transforming finance is immense. This is according to a new report, People’s Money: Harnessing Digitalization to Finance a Sustainable Future, by the UN Secretary-General’s Task Force on Digital Finance, which sets out an ambitious, practical action agenda.

Mobile payment technologies have transformed mobile phones into financial tools for more than a billion people.

Digital is supporting big data and artificial intelligence in advancing cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets, peer-to-peer lending, crowdfunding platforms, and online marketplaces.

Commenting on the report, UN Secretary-General, António Guterres said: “Digital technologies, which are revolutionising financial markets, can be a game-changer in meeting our shared objectives. The Task Force on Digital Financing of the Sustainable Development Goals provides leadership to harness the digital revolution.”

According to the report, banks have invested over $1 trillion in developing, integrating and acquiring emerging technologies. In 2018, ‘fintech’ investment reached $120 billion. This is one third of global venture capital funding.

Centrally, the report spells out how digital finance can be harnessed in ways that empower citizens as tax-payers and investors in envisaging a digital transformation at a scale that better aligns people’s money with their needs, collectively expressed by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Digital finance responds to COVID-19 pandemic

Also commenting on the release of the report, Achim Steiner, administrator of UNDP and Co-Chair of the UN Secretary-General’s Task Force on Digital Finance said: “Digital finance’s dramatic potential for transformative impact is being revealed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital transfers enable governments to get support to people in need, crowdfunding platforms have mobilised funds for medical supplies and emergency relief, and algorithmic lending means small businesses have quicker access to funds.”

More about COVID-19’s impact on the power sector

The speed of the recent spread of these technologies is astonishing, but progress is not automatic said Steiner, adding that “for digitalisation to be a true force for delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals, technological advances must combine with sound policy that empowers citizens and enables our financial system to meet the urgent investment challenges that must be overcome to build forward better.”

The report highlights how billions of people around the world are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic using digital tools to work, spend and socialise. It argues there is a historic opportunity to harness digitalisation in placing citizens, the ultimate owners of the world’s financial resources, in control of finance to ensure that it meets their needs, today and in the future.

The Task Force identifies five catalytic opportunities for harnessing digitalisation in aligning financing with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Together they cover much of global finance:

Aligning the vast pools flowing through global capital markets with the SDGs.

Increasing the effectiveness and accountability of public finance that makes up a major part of the global economy.

Channeling digitally-aggregated domestic savings into long-term development finance.

Informing citizens how to link their consumer spending with the SDGs.

Accelerating the lifeblood financing for the employment and income-generating world of small and medium-sized businesses.

The Task Force’s Action Agenda is a call to action to businesses, policy-makers and those governing finance to do what it takes to deliver on these opportunities. It spells out not only the ‘what’ but also the ‘how’: investments, new capabilities and governance innovations can get the job done.

The Task Force concludes that harnessing digitalisation for the good is a choice, not an inevitability driven by technology.

Its action agenda points to actions needed to overcome digital risks that, unmitigated, could deepen exclusion, discrimination and inequalities, and separate finance further from the needs of an inclusive, sustainable development.

155,https://www.forbes.com/sites/vipinbharathan/2020/08/14/esg-and-sdg-alpha-backed-by-the-blockchain/,"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Forbes,ESG And SDG Alpha Backed By The Blockchain,"ESG means Environmental, Social & Governance. SDG means Sustainable Development Goals. SDGs are set by the UN. Most SDGs have ESG implications. ESG rated companies have become popular in investment portfolios. This is because the ESG standing of a company is a proxy for long term value, say the boosters of ESG based investing. The retail investor, by necessity, outsources research on ESG to professionals and invests in funds with a sustainable focus. The funds are meant to investigate the sustainable claims of many companies. Instead of doing so themselves, they rely on outfits like MCSI and Sustainalytics to choose the portfolio companies.

Much like the ratings agencies whose triple A rated bonds cratered as the financial crisis hit in 2008, these ESG raters do not and cannot stand by their scores when non-sustainable practices at firms with high ratings are exposed. Similar to those rating agencies who also got paid by their targets to rate the bonds that they issued, there is often a conflict of interest at the heart of these ratings. The scores are often proprietary and employ models and methods, including survey based results which rely on the enterprises to self-report. Self-reporting has never been a good method to rate enterprises or individuals.

Sustainable Development Goals Graphic from the UN

After laying bare the debate about ESG based investment strategies; some efforts to improve the quality and depth of the data and hence make the scores more objective are discussed. Some of these proposals use the blockchain to secure the truths about the business attested by programmatic or other verifiable metrics. A combination of methods probably works best, with suspicious activity getting investigated further, including the use of shoe leather.

The Skeptics

The US Labor department regulators recently released a proposed new rule, to clarify the ERISA guidelines as being concerned purely with pecuniary results. The new rule says that ESG ratings should not be used as a criteria for investment. Since this affects all investments by pension plans, it has a great influence on investment strategy and climate in the US; since pension plans control a huge chunk of investment. This new rule could be a huge problem for portfolio managers who are in charge of pension funds.

Another idea that has gained prominence when talking about the superior pandemic performance of ESG rated companies was that ESG ratings have nothing to do with it. A well respected analyst has asserted that ESG ratings do not have anything to do with the better performance of ESG rated companies; since the difference in performance during the pandemic is due to the fact that energy companies and airlines who have poor ESG ratings cratered in first weeks of the pandemic. You can certainly apply this narrow logic to the performance metrics focused on a specific crisis. However, nothing can be said about the wider alpha generated by better ESG metrics. Indeed the better performance of ESG companies during the pandemic can be thought of as being generated by their resilience, better credit ratings and being relatively sheltered from black swans like the pandemic.

One more example is a company called Boohoo in the UK. Boohoo had received good ESG ratings from the ESG rating agencies which earned it a place on some portfolios in ESG funds. When news broke that their supply chain included vendors that underpaid their workers, the stock dove. These revelations resulted in its removal from the ESG funds. This points to the lack of depth in the rating; for a fashion brand suppliers matter. This is a case of a company receiving higher grades than they should have, because of the lack of proper due diligence.

ESG Proponents

The head of State Street Advisors STT , Cyrus Taraporevala, published an op-ed in the Financial Times arguing against the dept of labor rule about the Erisa guidelines and its proscription of ESG ratings as criteria for investing. Taraporevala is all for the guidelines that put the fiduciary responsibility of the portfolio managers to focus on pecuniary results. However, his argument is that ESG forward companies are better suited to weather the storms since they focus on employee well-being, resilience of supply chains and agile management. This is more true in the longer horizon which most pension plans should be focused on. He asserts that stocks with higher ESG ratings are better bets in the long term. Taraporevala does admit that there are some gray areas in measurement and accounting for ESG risks.

Measuring ESG

There was some talk in the ESG community that using the SDGs to measure ESG performance would be better, since they are finer grained and may be actually measurable. There are 17 headings there rather than just three in ESG.

For carbon emissions and other types of environmentally destructive activities where there can be a measure of objectivity, independent auditors and public data can bridge the transparency gap. The IWA has created a Carbon Emissions Token that includes several measurements and assertions. Nominally this would be on the blockchain so that the various parties who issue and monitor the token can assert to the measurements.

Another effort in the climate & accounting SIG in Hyperledger to setup utility emission channels will use public eGrid data, published by the EPA, along with the customer’s utility bills to calculate the emissions attributable to their energy consumption can be used to rate enterprises on their emissions profile. This uses a blockchain to capture this information from multiple parties. All of this point to the original use case for the blockchain to be a non-repudiable source of ordered documents.

Other ESG factors are harder to measure, especially the social and governance aspects. The ESG rating agencies who use a host of factors to calculate the ESG ratings will have to use many more automated methods using publicly available data; including some from blockchain anchored data stores. These methods will get better as time passes and ESG ratings will no longer be questioned as proxies for long term performance.","Another idea that has gained prominence when talking about the superior pandemic performance of ESG rated companies was that ESG ratings have nothing to do with it.

The joint publication titled, ‘Promoting Access to Medical Technologies and Innovation: Intersections between Public Health, Intellectual Property and Trade,’ provides an update since the first edition’s launch in 2013. The study presents new data on health, innovation trends in the pharmaceutical sector, and trade and tariffs relating to medical products, capturing insights from joint technical assistance activities and taking into account developments in intellectual property legislation and jurisprudence.

The study “draws practical lessons from experiences regarding how public health, IP, trade and competition rules all interact with each other in the broader context of the human rights dimension of health and the [SDGs].” Given recent rapid changes in these policy arenas due to COVID-19, a WTO landing page for the study notes that “a standalone section on COVID-19 was added at the start of the publication to map the multiple challenges posed by the pandemic in relation to the integrated health, trade and IP policy frameworks set out in the study,” given that the report had been completed prior to the virus’s outbreak.

The COVID-19 section points readers to specific chapters, sections, and sub-sections of the report, and provides additional relevant information on:

Meeting the demand for health technologies and medical services;

Preserving effective international trade;

The global IP system vis-à-vis the pandemic;

International initiatives to support research and development of, and equitable access to, COVID-19 technologies;

Regulatory responses; and

Efforts to ensure transparency.

International trade has assumed increasing importance in ensuring supplies of health-related goods.

The study itself describes the need for policy coherence and the role of the three authoring institutions (Chapter 1), summarizes the policy landscape (Chapter 2), and offers detailed information on the issues that specifically pertain to medical innovation and the research and development landscape (Chapter 3) and access (Chapter 4). The report draws connections to the SDGs and means of implementation such as trade throughout. Chapter 2 highlights linkages to SDGs 3 (good health and well-being), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and 17 (partnerships for the Goals), and describes key elements of trade policy such as tariffs, government procurement rules, and free trade agreements (FTAs). Chapter 4 considers the impact of trade and trade policy on access to medicines and medical technologies.

Noting that “innovation cannot take place in isolation from concerns about access,” the study emphasizes the need to preserve the global trade’s integrity. It observes that “international trade has assumed increasing importance in ensuring supplies of health-related goods.” Recognizing governments’ recent implementation of trade-restrictive emergency measures such as export restrictions, the report also stresses “the importance of well-functioning supply chains and the need to facilitate cross-border flows of vital medical supplies and services.”

With the EU, the US, China, and Switzerland accounting for nearly three-quarters of the total share of health-related product exports, the majority of the global community appears reliant on imports. The study notes that from 1995 to 2018, “substantial and widening variations in per capita imports of health-related products” have been observed in countries at different levels of development, “highlighting stark differences in access to medicines.” Acknowledging the global trade regime’s increasing complexity, the study points to the existence of WTO agreements such as, inter alia, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), and Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) as establishing rules to ensure that tariffs and non-tariff measures “do not become discriminatory or [become] unnecessary trade barriers.”

The WTO, WHO, and WIPO Directors-General each provided video remarks to support the launch of the study. WTO Director-General Roberto Azevêdo highlighted the importance of close collaboration between the agencies, and joint global efforts more broadly, while WIPO Director-General Francis Gurry emphasized the importance of an interdisciplinary approach. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for the removal of barriers to access, highlighting “unaffordable prices, intellectual property barriers, unjustified tariffs and challenges in ensuring effective and efficient regulatory review,” but also pointed to “unprecedented investments in collaborative, not-for-profit research” to tackle the shared threat of COVID-19.

The Angels wrapped up the tournament with a 3-1 record after losing in a semifinal game.

Finishing with a 12-5 overall record, the 13U Angels reached the semifinals in all four of the Grand Slam Baseball tournaments they entered.

SDG (Soli Deo Gloria, meaning Glory to God Alone) began its journey June 5-7 in the Back-to-Baseball Blowout held at Signature Park in Braselton. In heartbreaking fashion, the Angels lost 9-6 to the Lambert Longhorns — a team they defeated 9-3 in the qualifying round — in the championship game to finish second in a field of seven teams.

Not to be denied, the Angels next played in the 11-team June Jam Summer Series Week 3, held June 19-21 at Rabbit Hill Park in Dacula. SDG beat the Orange Crush from Clemson, S.C., 11-9 in the Championship game to finish 4-1 in the tournament. Crowned Tournament Champions on Father’s Day, each Angel was presented with a championship ring.

A fourth-place finish in the nine-team Star-Spangled Slugfest in Dacula held July 4-5 followed. In what proved to be their toughest outing, the Angels finished 2-2 after being knocked out in the semifinals.

Including two additional tournaments — the Southeastern Sports Tournament in Cumming, where they placed second, and the Perfect Game Tournament in Tyrone — the Angels finished 15-9 on the summer season.

Standout performers for the Angels included Gehrig Knapp, who finished 7-1 with 27 1/3 innings pitched with 54 strikeouts. Knapp also had 21 RBI and stole 18 bases, all team-leading numbers. Lucas Langley was 3-1 pitching and added six triples and a home run to lead the Angels in those two categories. JD Smith led SDG in batting with a .558 average, runs scored with 35 and stolen bases with 18. Cooper Duncan added a team-leading 21 RBI.

Colton Fincher was the winning pitcher in the June Jam Summer Series Week 3 Championship game. Nolan Mitchell came on in relief in the final inning with two outs, two on and the score 11-9 to earn the save.

The Angels select travel team was started by Andy Mitchell in 2014. That original squad was a 8U team. This fall it will become a 14U team. Seven players have been with the Angels that entire time.

“The 2020 season was delayed getting started, but was a success. Each young man got a lot out of our workouts this summer and the battles we had together in games” said Angels Head Coach Andy Mitchell. “Wins are important, that’s why you play the games, but the development of each individual ballplayer and seeing them become good teammates, friends and grow in their faith is just as vital. We try to do that every season with the SDG Angels.”

A former standout at Heritage High School in Conyers, Georgia Tech and the Baltimore Orioles organization, Mitchell added: “In sports, you win or lose, but you have to learn from both. The successes make you love the game more and the failures have to motivate you to improve. I love each of our players and was happy to see them win a ton of games this summer.”","The Covington-based SDG Angels completed their 2020 summer travel schedule this past weekend with a third-place finish in the 11-team North Georgia State Championships held at Rabbit Hill Park in Dacula.

In a statement, the UWI said partners developed a three-day virtual programme which took place on August 15 and 22 and concludes on August 29, for adolescents in Trinidad and Tobago between the ages of 14 and 19.

This programme forms part of the UN’s 75th anniversary global dialogues on SDGs. It aims to introduce the participants to their roles in achieving SDGs and create a forum for helping them generate and present ideas for practical projects to improve their communities.

The Youth Awareness Programme commenced on August 15 with presentations on ‘Localising Sustainable Development Goals’. Students from The UWI, St Augustine campus and other educational institutions across the country participated and developed their own SDG projects in small groups via a virtual platform.

At the second session on August 22, the students presented their projects to a panel of representatives from the UN in Trinidad and Tobago, DEF and The UWI.

The UWI said a virtual awards ceremony is scheduled for the final day of the programme on August 29. The most innovative project proposal will be announced and funded by the UN for implementation.

Commenting on The UWI’s participation on the initiative, Dr Stacy Richards-Kennedy who heads the University’s regional Office of Global Partnerships and Sustainable Futures stated:

'Following our launch of the UWI SDG Youth Advocacy Campaign in 2017 and our ongoing SDG initiatives, we remain energised as a leading partner on programmes such as these. It is through continuous youth engagement and expansion of networks of youth advocates that we will be able to increase awareness and strengthen capacity to implement sustainable development projects. As a regional university, we remain committed to supporting the Caribbean in working towards the achievement of the SDGs by 2030.'

'The UWI’s involvement in this SDG Youth Awareness Programme is just one example of the University’s support for youth engagement on the global 2030 sustainable development agenda.'

The UWI said in 2017 it spearheaded a regional SDG Youth Advocacy Campaign funded by UNDP, co-organised the Caribbean Action 2030 Regional Conference and Youth Forum at its Mona Campus in Jamaica, launched a digital photo competition “Through the lens of Caribbean Youth” and produced a series of short films entitled “Youth Action on the SDGs” in collaboration with Sustain T&T.

In July this year, The UWI joined forces with UNICEF and the Ashley Lashley Foundation in Barbados to host the Global Youth Network Summit on Climate Change and Health, which included a Declaration signed by Caribbean students in support of climate action.

Several SDG youth engagement activities have also been led by The UWI Youth Development Programme and UWI-STAT Ambassadors. In 2020, The UWI also ranked among the top 200 universities in the Times Higher Education’s Impact Rankings for its research, outreach and stewardship of the SDGs.

The regional University’s partnership with Decibel Arts and Entertainment Festival was born earlier this year, based on DEF’s mission to work with youth and preparing them for the future. DEF has also stepped up to support UWI students across the region who have been functioning in difficult social circumstances because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this most recent collaboration, The UWI and DEF have realised another shared objective of empowering young people to make tangible contributions to help the region achieve the SDGs.

WINCHESTER — If you’ve driven past any part of the Canadian Pacific rail line in North Dundas recently, you may have seen some changes, including a track being removed.

Canadian Pacific Railway, which constructed and has operated the line since the mid-1880s, is upgrading a 100-kilometre section of its railroad line between Smiths Falls, Ont., and Dorion, Que.

The line is part of the company’s Toronto-Montreal and transcontinental routes.

“CP is continuously looking for opportunities to improve its track infrastructure,” said Andy Cummings, media relations manager for the company.

The project involves removing one track of the Smiths Falls-Dorion line, known as the CP Winchester Subdivision, and installing four long passing sidings.

Those sidings are located between Merrickville-Kemptville, Inkerman-Winchester, Finch-Avonmore, and Apple Hill-Green Valley.

CP crews began working on the project in early 2020 preparing the site for the upgrades, which include considerable track-work and changes to grade-level railway crossings.","CP Rail line being upgraded in across northern SDGArticle contentWINCHESTER — If you’ve driven past any part of the Canadian Pacific rail line in North Dundas recently, you may have seen some changes, including a track being removed.

The authors outline a role for the UN in building domestic political consensus to respond constructively to global megatrends, highlighting that the UN “can assist in mobilizing needed global support for individual countries, particularly those with fewer resources.”

The ‘Report of the UN Economist Network for the UN 75th Anniversary: Shaping the Trends of Our Time’ was launched on 16 September 2020. The UN Economists Network is led by the UN Chief Economist.

The UN’s 75th anniversary is an opportunity to forge a global commitment to digital cooperation, with goals, principles, and priority actions.

It looks at the “outright failures in policy” that have resulted in climate change, environmental degradation, and inequalities. “Climate change and environmental degradation have no positive side, and must be reversed. Similarly, the overall impact of persistent and rising inequalities is negative,” although some people may emerge as short-term winners. Further, these megatrends cannot be fully shaped by national policy; they require all countries to act in concert, the report underscores.

The economists offer guidance for policy makers on steering three other megatrends towards positive outcomes: demographic shifts, particularly population ageing; urbanization; and the emergence of digital technologies. On digital technologies, the report suggests that the UN is well placed to facilitate agreement on principles for “managing frontier technologies” and aligning the use of technology with ethical and human rights standards. The authors note that the UN’s 75th anniversary presents an opportunity for a global commitment to digital cooperation, which could enshrine goals, principles, and priority actions.

On reducing inequality, the report asserts that support for policy responses to inequality often “runs into a wall of vested interests.” The UN can help governments overcome such political constraints, the authors offer.

According to the report, achieving the SDGs is highly unlikely without an “overhaul of the current disjointed policymaking.” Policies to influence one megatrend as well as other megatrends that interact with it “can propel more effective, mutually reinforcing changes.” The authors stress that if the right choices are made quickly, “it is not too late to shape the major trends of our time in a direction that is sustainable and delivers benefits to all.” [Publication: Report of the UN Economist Network for the UN 75th Anniversary: Shaping the Trends of Our Time] [Executive Summary]","A group of UN economists has released a report aiming to set the stage for the high-level event to commemorate the UN’s 75th anniversary.

The presentation of VNRs are a central focus of the annual global “check in” on implementation of the SDGs – the HLPF. VNRs present each country’s experiences, policies, and institutions for the implementation of the SDGs.

According to the DESA policy brief released on 14 September 2020, 39 out of 46 VNR reports presented at the 2020 HLPF explicitly mentioned the impact of the pandemic on SDG implementation. The reports showed that small, vulnerable, highly indebted, and tourism-dependent states have been among the hardest hit by COVID-19. Some governments suggested that if SDG implementation had been at a more advanced stage before the pandemic, its impacts may have been less severe.

If SDG implementation had been more advanced, the pandemic’s impacts may have been less severe, countries said in their 2020 VNRs.

Governments also reported on how the crisis affected stakeholder consultations planned for the last phase of VNR preparations. Amid lock-down measures, several countries aimed to reach stakeholders and NGOs by posting reports online and inviting proposals and descriptions of their work to include in the report. Some countries tried to reach remote communities through phone interviews or community radio stations. Others reported that some stakeholders, such as youth, were able to participate in consultations through virtual means.

The DESA brief reports that most countries’ VNRs underlined the importance of multilateralism and global solidarity in order to recover from COVID-19 and achieve the SDGs. Another strong message was the need for “a coordinated international response to the pandemic and for cooperation by all stakeholders.”

Ahead of the 2021 HLPF session, the President of the UN Economic and Social Council announced that only 42 countries will be able to present VNRs, with priority for countries presenting VNRs for the first time. So far, 30 countries have expressed interest. The 2021 session will focus on the theme, ‘Sustainable and resilient recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, that promotes the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development: Building an inclusive and effective path for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda in the context of the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development.’

It will focus in particular on nine SDGs: Goal 1 (No poverty); Goal 2 (Zero hunger); Goal 3 (Good health and wellbeing); Goal 8 (Decent work and economic growth); Goal 10 (Reduced inequalities); Goal 12 (Responsible consumption and production); Goal 13 (Climate action); Goal 16 (Peace, justice, and strong institutions); and Goal 17 (Partnership for the Goals).

The reviews will include targets with a 2020 timeline.

The launches took place as part of an event on ‘American Leadership in Advancing the Sustainable Development Goals.’

The side event was organized by The Brookings Institution and the UN Foundation. It convened virtually on 16 September 2020. John Allen, President of The Brookings Institution, welcomed participants and announced that Brookings is creating a new Center for Sustainable Development.

To set the stage for the event, Fatimata Cham, youth poet and activist, performed a poem that concluded with the assurance, and challenge, that “Hope is the sound of your own voice.”

The multiple challenges we are facing demonstrate the importance of local leaders.

Anthony Pipa, The Brookings Institution, highlighted that the 2030 Agenda is an agenda for all sectors, not just national governments. He said the multiple challenges we are currently facing demonstrate how important local leaders are.

Representatives of US cities and companies discussed their work as “engines of action” to implement the SDGs. From the City of Los Angeles, California, Mayor Eric Garcetti said “Leadership is defined by how we react to things that we did not expect to happen,” and noted that the SDG framework helps to make our choices clear when considering policy options. He called attention to LA’s online dashboard to track its progress, and reported that LA is launching an SDGs activities index to help LA residents find new partners.

For the City of New York, Penny Abeywardena, Commissioner for International Affairs, recalled that in 2018, New York launched a Voluntary Local Review (VLR) on the sidelines of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). Since then, over 200 local governments and cities have committed to producing VLRs, she reported.

Rose Stuckey Kirk, Verizon and the Verizon Foundation, discussed her company’s work in relation to SDG 4 (quality education), especially to address inequalities in connectivity. Yvette Pearson, George R. Brown School of Engineering, Rice University, highlighted the need to incorporate societal input into the design of solutions. She said this requires adjustments in engineering curricula.

Launching the first Voluntary University Review (VUR), James Garrett Jr., Carnegie Mellon University, expressed hope that more universities will follow CMU’s lead. He emphasized the importance of dialogues – with local government, NGOs, and the private sector – when creating the VUR.

Governor of Hawai’i David Ige launched the first statewide review of the SDGs (voluntary state review, or VSR). He reviewed the dialogue process used to develop the VSR, with state and local governments, community organizations, and the private sector working to identify shared goals. He said the state will measure progress through a data dashboard to hold itself accountable.

Ige noted that the SDGs provide a common language “to align our canoes in the same direction.” Hawai’i’s US Senator Brian Schatz said policies need to “paint a picture and paint me in it” – they need to work for people, and the SDG framework ensures that policies work for everyone.

Dustin Liu, UNA-USA Youth Observer to the UN, reiterated the discussion’s emphasis on the role of dialogue with multiple stakeholders by calling for including youth voices at all levels of decision making.

Elizabeth Cousens, President and CEO, UN Foundation, said it is inspiring to see how groups are using the SDGs. She shared her experience as a government representative who helped negotiate the SDGs five years ago, saying those negotiators did not expect them to resonate across so many groups. Multiple groups have embraced the Goals because, as Cousens emphasized, they are universal, interconnected, and about real challenges faced by people around the world.

It has the potential to take the dialogue further – beyond expressions of commitment to solidarity and cooperation, and into a more precise vision for revitalizing the multilateral system.

However, this is a tall order this year, when multilateralism finds itself at a “historic low point” as observed by IISD’s Earth Negotiations Bulletin.

At the July 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), governments considered drafts of the Ministerial Declaration that had been negotiated in the preceding months. Governments consulted on the draft through remote means, and continue to do so several weeks after the close of the HLPF. (They were unable to vote during the HLPF, which was held virtually, because online voting procedures were not in place.)

In the latest draft, the ministers “reaffirm our commitment to international cooperation and multilateralism” in the context of the UN’s 75th anniversary. They also recognize the UN’s role in “catalysing and coordinating a global response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, based on unity, solidarity, multilateralism and international cooperation.”

COVID-19 has, justifiably, required a large share of the world’s attention in 2020. By its nature, a pandemic and its resulting social, economic, and environmental crises epitomize the need for multilateral cooperation. These interlocking problems have also focused global attention on areas where SDG progress has slowed down and even reversed course. As a result, the draft HLPF declaration notes, “Strengthening multilateralism, international cooperation and global partnership is more important than ever.”

Statements during the HLPF aligned with this view: multilateralism is a top priority for surviving the global pandemic and shifting more resources to SDG achievement. Many countries stressed that the only way out of this crisis is through global solidarity.

However, the Earth Negotiations Bulletin’s analysis of the HLPF poses the question, “Will multilateralism survive the pandemic?” The ENB suggests that discussions at the HLPF fell short of providing a “clear vision of exactly how multilateralism and the 2030 Agenda can be revived and strengthened.” Instead, speakers belied “an underlying nervousness and recognition that multilateralism is at a historic low point at this time of greatest need.”

The analysis continues,

Some delegates echoed Nepal’s concerns that countries may be too busy saving themselves to show solidarity with others. It is true that the pandemic has evoked nationalistic, beggar-thy-neighbor responses from some countries which, for instance, have diverted shipments of limited supplies of personal protection equipment meant for other countries in “an act of modern piracy;” bought up almost the entire global supply of remdesivir, the anti-viral drug that can speed the recovery of coronavirus patients; or have been accused of “vaccine nationalism” for trying to secure priority access to a potential COVID-19 vaccine.

Among the action areas for reviving and strengthening multilateralism, the ENB reports that participants highlighted:

promoting solidarity and partnerships;

working together to produce a “people’s vaccine;”

using non-GDP related measures of progress;

reform of international financial institutions;

broadening of the causes and measures of vulnerability;

fair and open global trade;

protection of the rules-based international order; and

more social security and protection.

The high-level commemoration of UN75 on 21 September 2020 could serve to organize actions like these into a set of concrete priorities to rebuild trust in institutions and reignite cooperation that serves all partners, equally.

The UN2020 initiative, a coalition of civil society representatives, has crafted a “people’s declaration” for the UN’s 75th anniversary. It calls for a process to design a coherent strategy to fill global governance gaps. It also contains a plan for global action with three priority recommendations for the UN and Member States:

Establish a Member-State-mandated post-2020 follow-up mechanism to enhance global governance, ushering in a new compact for more equitable and effective global governance and rebuilding confidence in global institutions;

Reliably and increasingly fund the UN including by addressing the challenge of unfulfilled Member States’ annual dues and financial commitments, streamlining “archaic” UN budgetary processes, and considering global taxation on fossil fuel, carbon or other commodities; and

Enhance participation modalities for civil society and other stakeholders with: a dedicated civil society focal point in the UN Secretariat at the level of Under-Secretary-General; a system-wide review of stakeholder participation in UN processes and adoption of a few well-designed reform proposals; increased use of communications technology to mitigate the digital divide; and a global petition mechanism to surface issues of concern for a critical mass of individuals.

The plan for global action also contains an annex of additional proposals generated through the civil society consultations leading up to the People’s Forum.

Whether leaders take forward these recommendations or others that may emerge through the UN75 commemoration and related global conversation, there is certainly space for a “clear vision” and plan of action to strengthen multilateralism and ensure the world moves closer to the 2030 Agenda, not ever further from the future we want.","The high-level meeting to commemorate the UN’s 75th anniversary will be the culmination of a year’s discussions on multilateralism.

165,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/39-countries-form-alliance-for-poverty-eradication/,"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,39 Countries Form Alliance for Poverty Eradication,"The UN General Assembly has inaugurated the Alliance for Poverty Eradication, aimed at galvanizing multilateral and bilateral efforts. The Alliance was the focus of a high-level virtual meeting on trends, options, and strategies for eliminating poverty.

Thirty-nine countries are listed as members of the Alliance. The Alliance will be led by Interim Coordinator Samson Itegboje, Permanent Mission of Nigeria. Itegboje said poverty is “the number one goal among the SDGs” and the most topical issue facing the global community apart from the impacts of COVID-19.

SDG target 8.6 (by 2020, substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training) is very unlikely to be met.

Itegboje said the Alliance must “chart a new course” for poverty eradication. To be effective, he said, a strategy to eradicate poverty must reflect its multi-dimensional nature, incorporating economic, social, cultural and political dimensions.

Olivier Schutter, UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, said the Alliance is extremely important for three reasons:

The number of people in extreme poverty is still unacceptably high, and this is not a result of natural disasters but of inappropriate policy choices. He called for a policy-oriented study on why people are still poor.

Other stakeholders must be involved in improving global governance practices. He called for collaboration on trade, investment, international property rights, and other interventions critical to the realization of SDG 1 (no poverty).

Developing countries need support to establish social protection floors, due to their current budget deficits.

Schutter informed participants of a process underway to establish a Global Fund for Social Protection. This will aim to coordinate various countries’ efforts to strengthen social protection. It would also work to mobilize resources to support developing countries in bridging financing gaps and establishing social protection floors. Finally, the Fund would also provide a reinsurance facility, allowing poor countries to protect themselves against shocks and thus maintain the functioning of social protection systems.

The President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), Mona Juul, said women must be at the center of the Alliance, just as with all other development efforts. She said the Alliance should strive to shift world attention to a resilient development path that leads to human rights for all.

UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said policymakers should not lose sight of the urgency of climate action, which can unlock “massive economic and social benefits and accelerate structural transformations for sustainable development.” She also reminded participants that the UN’s framework for immediate socioeconomic responses to the COVID-19 pandemic provides a roadmap for a systemic, multifaceted approach.

Mohammed cited a World Bank estimate that COVID-19 could push between 71 and 100 million more people into extreme poverty in 2020, “effectively wiping out progress made since 2017.” On 6 August 2020, the World Bank released a publication on these “new poor,” finding that the global poverty rate was originally projected to fall to 8.2% in 2019, but due to COVID-19, is now projected to increase to 8.8% (baseline) and 9.2% (downside) in 2020.

The discussion during the high-level meeting highlighted challenges in poverty eradication, noting that SDG target 8.6 (by 2020, substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training) is very unlikely to be met, as roughly 75% of employed youths work in the informal sector and lack protection, while 126 million young workers still live in poverty.

The report of the meeting provides recommendations emerging from the meeting. These include:

Institute people-centred policies to allow for scaled up investment in universal healthcare, education, social protection, equitable access to digital technology, and support to micro- and medium-sized enterprises;

Scale up investment in agriculture and rural development within the context of national poverty eradication policies and plans;

Implement credible anti-corruption policies and strengthen the integrity of public institutions;

Prioritize reform of judiciary and law enforcement agencies, to provide an enabling environment for allocating resources productively; and

Improve support for developing countries to establish social protection floors.

UNGA President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande said the high-level meeting – which took place on 30 June 2020 – represents the start of a series of annual dialogues on poverty eradication.

The Vienna Convention is a framework agreement adopted in 1985, setting out principles for cooperation and information sharing on the effects of human activities on the ozone layer. The Convention Secretariat reports that it was the first convention of any kind to be signed by every country involved, and it reached universal ratification in 2009.

In a message on 16 September 2020, the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the Convention was the first step in fixing the hole in the Earth’s ozone layer. He highlighted that few global agreements have been as successful as this one has been. The Convention’s Montreal Protocol has facilitated phasing out the gases that caused the ozone hole, which were used in aerosols and cooling appliances. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) reports that the ozone layer is expected to return to pre-1980 values by mid-century.

The next step, the Secretary-General said, is to find new alternatives for the ozone-depleting substances, since replacements themselves are now known to contribute to global warming. This is the focus of the Montreal Protocol’s most recent agreement, the Kigali Amendment, which came into force in January 2019. It calls for reducing the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by more than 80% over the next 30 years.

In her message on the International Day, UNEP Executive Director Inger Anderson said that if fully implemented, the Kigali Amendment will prevent 0.4°C of global warming.

Titled ""2020 Taipei City Voluntary Local Review"" (VLR), the report listed four Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that were not included in the 2019 edition: quality education; gender equality; decent work and economic growth; and industry, innovation, and infrastructure. The SDGs are a set of 17 global objectives that constitute a blueprint for a better and more sustainable future for all as set forth by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015.

Taipei has incorporated the SDGs into its response to the coronavirus pandemic, according to the Department of Environmental Protection. Related actions include establishing quarantine hotels and tracking systems, promoting online courses to ensure the right to education, launching bailout packages to prop up the economy, and disinfecting public places and transport to reduce the risk of transmission.

The city has also made efforts to bolster disease control at the community level, implement proper waste disposal management to ensure a zero transmission environment, and compile relevant standard operation procedures in English to more easily share the city's experience with the world.

As for the four additional SDGs in this year’s report, the city pledged measures such as increasing subsidies for public daycare centers, raising public awareness of domestic violence, and providing employment matchmaking services. In terms of infrastructure, the city is upgrading its public transit network to integrate the MRT, buses, and bicycles as solutions to the ""last mile"" problem while improving accessibility to public facilities.

Centered around climate action and energy transition, the international forum was held in Taipei, and sessions were live-streamed. Representatives from the EU, the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES), the Netherlands, France, and Japan shared their experience in sustainable development policies at the forum, with some participating via videoconference or recorded videos.

Artur Runge-Metzger, director of the European Commission’s DG CLIMA, shared how the EU will strive to promote post-coronavirus climate action under the European Green Deal. IGES Joint Program Director Yatsuka Kataoka gave an overview of cities’ SDG strategies.

Participants adopted a Declaration that recognizes multilateralism as a necessity for a more equal, more resilient, and more sustainable world, and that implementation of the 2030 Agenda is necessary for survival.

The official commemoration of UN75, which took place at a socially-distanced UN Headquarters, with Heads of State and Government joining virtually, focused on the theme of ‘The future we want, the United Nations we need: Reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism.’

The UN Secretary-General warned that the world faces a “surplus of multilateral challenges, and a deficit of multilateral solutions.” In January 2020, Secretary-General António Guterres had launched the UN75 initiative as “the world’s largest conversation about current global challenges, and the gap between the future we want and where we are headed if current trends continue.” The UN crowdsourced views on its future priorities and solutions from the global public, through a survey of over a million people in all 193 UN Member States; more than 1,000 dialogues in 82 countries across the world; and artificial intelligence analysis of social and traditional media in 70 countries, along with academic and policy research mappings in all regions.

Improved global governance does not threaten national sovereignty.

Presenting findings from the consultation during the high-level commemoration, Guterres noted they demonstrate the public appetite for increased global solidarity, and emphasized that improved global governance does not threaten national sovereignty. Guterres identified gender inequality as the “greatest single challenge to human rights around the world” and expressed concern about the “climate calamity”, rising poverty and nuclear weapons.

UN Security Council President Abdou Abarry said the social and economic impacts of COVID-19 have exacerbated challenges such as the illicit arms trade, human trafficking, and international terrorism. He also noted that there is no other global organization with the legitimacy and convening power of the UN.

The UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) President Munir Akram said his presidency will focus on mobilizing finance to address the pandemic, achieve the SDGs, avoid the climate catastrophe, and invest in sustainable infrastructure. Four youth leaders called for concrete actions to support those who are left behind and to tackle climate change, among other issues.

President of Malawi Lazarus Chakwera, for the least developed countries (LDCs), listed five focus areas for the UN: strengthening multilateralism, including through UN reforms; addressing inequality, including the gender gap and digital divide; financing to implement the 2030 Agenda; pursuing holistic approaches to reflect the singular objective of all SDGs; and promoting a people-centric approach. President of the European Council (EC) Charles Michel, for the EU, underscored the need for COVID-19 treatment to be accessible to all. President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, for the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), called for revitalizing the UN General Assembly and reforming the Security Council. Many other speakers expressed support for UN reform, and emphasized the importance of multilateralism in COVID-19 recovery and progress towards a more equitable, sustainable world for all.

President of South Africa Cyril Ramaphosa noted that climate change, environmental disasters, transnational crimes, and migration can be solved only through multilateralism. Prime Minister of Sweden Stefan Löfven announced that Sweden will host a conference in Stockholm in 2022 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the UN Conference on the Human Environment.

During the event, Heads of State and Government adopted a ‘Declaration on the Commemoration of the Seventy-fifth Anniversary of the UN (A/75/L.1).’ In the Declaration, Member States recognize that while there have been many achievements in the past 75 years, the world envisaged by the UN’s founders 75 years ago has not yet been realized: it is plagued by growing inequality, poverty, hunger, armed conflicts, terrorism, insecurity, climate change, and pandemics; people are forced to make dangerous journeys in search of refuge and safety; the LDCs are falling behind; and complete decolonization has not been achieved. Further, Member States recognize that global challenges are interconnected and can only be addressed through reinvigorated multilateralism, as demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic. They agree that multilateralism is not an option but a necessity, to build back better for a more equal, more resilient, and more sustainable world, with the UN at the center of efforts. They also recognize that the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is necessary for survival.

In the Declaration, Member States resolve to:

Leave no one behind, with particular attention to people in vulnerable situations.

Protect our planet, including through transformative measures, and by building back better and greener.

Promote peace and prevent conflicts, including through preventive diplomacy and mediation, and respect for international humanitarian law.

Abide by international law and ensure justice.

Place women and girls at the center, and accelerate action to achieve gender equality, women’s participation and the empowerment of women and girls in all domains.

Build trust, by addressing growing inequalities within and among countries, and addressing root causes of inequalities, including violence, human rights abuses, corruption, marginalization, discrimination in all its forms, poverty, and exclusion, as well as lack of education and employment.

Improve digital cooperation and ensure safe and affordable digital access for all.

Upgrade the UN, including by supporting ongoing reform by the UN Secretary-General. They also commit to instill new life in the discussions on the reform of the UN Security Council, continue the work to revitalize the UNGA, and strengthen ECOSOC.

Ensure sustainable financing, including by paying assessed contributions in full and on time; and through the full and timely implementation of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development (FfD).

Boost partnerships, by engaging with all stakeholders including regional and sub-regional organizations, NGOs, civil society, the private sector, academia and parliamentarians.

Listen to, and work with, youth.

Be prepared, including by improving the global crisis prevention and response systems; learning and sharing experiences and information to reduce risks and make our systems more resilient; and accelerating development, production, as well as equitable and affordable global access to new vaccines, medicines, and medical equipment.

169,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/we-can-bend-the-curve-on-terrestrial-biodiversity-loss/,"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: We Can Bend the Curve on Terrestrial Biodiversity Loss,"By Neil Burgess

It’s clear that we need urgent, transformative change to tackle the global nature crisis. In many cases, we already know the solutions. How to stop terrestrial biodiversity loss from habitat conversion is one such case, and it has implications for the entire SDG framework.

Last week, the UN Convention for Biological Diversity’s (CBD) Global Biodiversity Outlook 5 reported that of the 20 Aichi targets agreed in 2010, only six are being “partially achieved” by their 2020 deadline. The CBD warns that despite encouraging progress in several areas, the natural world is suffering badly and getting worse. Launched in the same week, WWF’s Living Planet Report found that the population sizes of mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, and reptiles have seen an average drop of 68% since 1970.

How can we halt biodiversity loss from land use change while feeding a growing population?

The good news is that the scientific community has made great progress in defining the problem over the past decade; we now have a clear and robust evidence base showing the urgency of changing course. There has also been massive progress in scientifically defining what needs to be done. A prime example of this is our knowledge of how to halt and reverse terrestrial biodiversity loss from land use change.

A third recent study, published in Nature on 10 September, shows the possibility of halting and reversing terrestrial biodiversity loss caused by land use change.

Six Actions to Halt and Recover from Terrestrial Biodiversity Loss

The new study was led by David Leclere of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) and involved 58 experts from across 46 institutions including the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC). It projects that without further efforts to tackle habitat loss and degradation, global biodiversity decline will continue at a rate close to or greater than that for 1970-2010. Land use change, also known as habitat conversion, is one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss on land. The researchers used ground-breaking modelling and newly developed scenarios to identify six actions needed to stop such losses. These are:

Sustainable increases in crop yields;

Trade increases in agricultural goods with reduced trade barriers;

Reducing the waste of agricultural goods from field to fork by 50%;

Cutting the share of animal calories in human diets by 50% except in regions in which the share of animal products in diets is already estimated to be low (the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and other Pacific Islands);

Increasing Protected Area extent to 40% terrestrial coverage, covering important sites for biodiversity and with improved management; and

Increasing restoration (reaching about 8% of terrestrial areas by 2050) and landscape-level conservation planning that balances production and conservation objectives on all managed land.

By combining the six actions listed above in an integrated strategy, modelling shows that it is possible to avoid more than two thirds of future terrestrial biodiversity losses caused by land use change.

Protecting SDGs 2 (Zero Hunger) and 15 (Life on Land) at the Same Time

The authors of the study considered seven different scenarios to explore whether we could achieve this without undermining other SDGs. In particular, how can we halt biodiversity loss from land use change while also feeding a growing population?

Without transformation of the food system, bold conservation efforts could conflict with future food provision by raising food prices. The conservation efforts alone would also not be enough to stop the losses by 2050. In order to achieve this and reduce potential negative impacts on food security, conservation efforts should be combined with simultaneous transformation of food systems, as well as wider action on other drivers of biodiversity loss, such as climate change and biological invasions.

Such transformative change in food and land use systems would also have valuable co-benefits that contribute to other SDGs, such as SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), and SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing).

Implications for International Policy

This is the first time that the key combined actions needed to stop and reverse biodiversity loss on land have been identified and backed by robust futures modelling. This research sets out clear and ambitious actions for governments, businesses, and consumers to take on board.

The next Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 2021 (COP 15) is expected to agree a set of new international goals and targets as part of a post-2020 global biodiversity framework to take us through to 2050. The post-2020 global biodiversity framework will be a critical opportunity to stop biodiversity loss and ensure that people continue to benefit from biodiversity into the future. But for this framework to be effective, it must incorporate bold conservation and restoration efforts as well as food system transformation. Together these can help to tackle the drivers of terrestrial biodiversity loss.

However, government interventions and significant reform of the multilateral trading system would offer an opportunity to pivot towards long-term growth and sustainable development.

The report titled, ‘International Trade and Development,’ finds that economic and social disruptions caused by COVID-19 have resulted in about USD 6 trillion in losses in global trade, approximately 50% larger than the decline in trade that occurred during the 2008 recession. Economic disruptions have affected some sectors more than others, particularly the automotive, textiles and apparel sectors, the tourism sector, and various machinery sectors. The decline in crude oil prices has resulted in a “drastic drop in export revenues” for oil exporters, and sustained low oil prices may affect renewable energy development, as consumers have less incentive to switch from fossil fuels to renewables.

The exponential increase in women’s care work is moving women from stable, protected jobs to more informal jobs.

COVID-19 is “not only a health crisis, but also a job and livelihoods crisis” that impacts SDG progress, the authors assert. Absolute falls in export earnings affect the capacity of LDCs to achieve the SDGs overall and to achieve SDG target 17.11, to double their share of global exports by 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated inequalities (SDG 10) and significantly affected female-intensive economic sectors (SDG 5), such as the garment sector, pushing female workers towards extreme poverty (SDG 1).

The report emphasizes that the realization of the gender-related aspects of the 2030 Agenda “are at risk.” The economic crisis disproportionately impacts women in several ways outlined in the report, including an “exponential increase in the time women devote to care work,” which affects their ability to keep jobs or remain engaged in full-time employment. The result is to move women from stable, protected jobs to more informal jobs. In addition, countries with reporting systems have reported a surge in domestic violence against women.

On the environment-related SDGs, the pandemic has had “observable positive effects” on levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and the quality of air, soil, and water. Fish exports may be “reduced by about one-third in 2020.” The report further suggests a possibility to combine solutions to climate change and COVID-19 into a coherent response. Still, the pandemic has also resulted in negative environmental impacts, including increased volumes of un-recyclable waste, a halt in maintenance and monitoring of natural ecosystems, and disruptions in markets and value chains for biodiversity-based goods and services.

Macroeconomic income shocks from COVID-19 are predicted to affect food security. Therefore, the report recommends encouraging domestic food production and shorter regional food value chains to ensure that in the future, food security is not overly dependent on international markets and to reduce the carbon footprint of global food value chains.

The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the uptake of digital technologies, which have been a “critical tool in maintaining business and life continuity” and allowed for increases in telework, telemedicine, and online education. The Government of Senegal, for example, has facilitated and created an e-commerce platform for easy access to websites of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) selling essential goods, which has allowed business to continue operating.

The report recommends reconstructing a multinational trading system through World Trade Organization (WTO) reform that delivers negotiated outcomes and contributes to post-crisis recovery and longer-term development. In line with SDG target 17.10, the report calls for a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system. The report suggests that one area of reform could be the principles of special and differentiated treatment for developing countries, by replacing the practice of self-declaration of developing country status with objective criteria such as level of per capita income and share in world trade.

Overall, the report concludes that the pandemic risks reversing most SDG progress, but government response interventions and multilateral trading system reform offer an opportunity for global trade and national economies to pivot towards a path of long-term growth and sustainable development.

We are facing a planetary emergency – a nature crisis, a climate crisis, and an inequality crisis all at once. Yet the world’s level of ambition to tackle our nature crisis to date has been lackluster, with a recent report highlighting that the world has failed to achieve most of the global biodiversity ambitions that the world agreed to in 2010, as part of a decade-long strategic plan for nature.

The result of low levels of leadership and political will in implementing the global plan, along with ever increasing threats to ecosystem and biodiversity coming from economic sectors, has been predictable – a recent report on the state of biodiversity found that the world has lost 68% of all wildlife populations since 1970.

Funding an ambitious post-2020 global diversity framework requires eliminating “negative money.”

To fully respond to this emergency, we need bold ambition, commitment, and action at all levels, from local to global, and across different sectors and constituencies. We need a multi-pronged “whole-of-society approach” to redefine our relationship with nature towards constructing a nature-based planetary safety net.

This article provides updates on progress in five areas.

Committing to Financing Nature

Funding an ambitious post-2020 global biodiversity framework will require a significant increase in financial resources from all sources, including official development assistance, governments’ domestic budgets, climate financing directed to nature-based solutions, philanthropies, corporations, and new sources of revenue.

It also requires eliminating “negative money.” For example, hundreds of millions of dollars are spent every year as agriculture, fisheries, and other subsidies to incentivize activities that degrade or destroy nature. All told, the finance gap for protecting 30% of the planet is about USD700 billion a year. However, a new report shows that this finance gap is not as large as it seems – it accounts for just under one percent of global GDP, and is a tiny fraction of the USD5.2 trillion we spend in fossil fuel subsidies. Moreover, the benefits of protecting nature outweigh the costs by at least 5:1. The best investment ever!

Reversing Biodiversity Loss by 2030 Through Global Commitment

Global, national, and sub-national leaders can no longer ignore our planetary crisis. Indeed, more than 1,700 jurisdictions have already declared a climate emergency. Now world leaders have begun to mobilize around a pledge for nature. More than 50 heads of state have already signed a pledge for nature, and 30 more are in the process of endorsing.

Among other statements, this pledge includes a recognition of the nature crisis, and calls for an expression of the need for a profound re-commitment from world leaders to take urgent action. To accompany this commitment, the Club of Rome has developed a concrete plan to emerge from our emergency.

Creating a Nature-Based Planetary Safety Net

The year 2021 will see the agreement by the world’s governments on a bold biodiversity framework through 2030, with an eye towards a planet in harmony with nature by 2050.

Building on the indivisible relation between the wellbeing of people and the wellbeing of nature, the 15th Conference of Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP 15) will begin by looking back to the past decade, identifying reasons for hope in national and local action on biodiversity. COP 15 will then look forward, identifying key elements required for achieving success, including bold political will, coherent and aligned government policies, integration and alignment of a wide range of economic sectors, adequate resource mobilization, and decisive action, among others.

Greening Covid-19 Recovery Efforts and Creating Green New Deals

COVID-19 has taught us that business as usual is no longer an option. This crisis highlights the socio-economic threats and costs posed by our planetary emergency, and offers an opportunity to accelerate the transition to more inclusive, greener, and more resilient economies. Decisions made now on how to stimulate growth, respond to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, and prevent the next pandemic will determine the future health, well-being, and stability of both people and the planet.

To take action, countries can:

“green” their stimulus packages and longer-term national recovery plans;

promote green public work programs;

redirect harmful fossil fuel and agricultural subsidies;

integrate nature-climate concerns into agriculture, water resources, forestry, tourism, industry, mining, energy, and infrastructure; and

promote sustainable public/private finance and investments.

Mapping Nature for People and Planet

More than 2,200 satellites circle the earth, enabling humanity to monitor the planet in ways never imagined possible. Enabled by the UNDP-led UN Biodiversity Lab, governments are beginning to use spatial data from these satellites, and combine these datasets with local and national data to generate new insight.

Supported by UNDP, and with funding from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Government of Sweden, and One Earth, five governments – Uganda, Costa Rica, Peru, Kazakhstan and Colombia – have initiated a new process, called Mapping Nature For People and Planet: Essential Life Support Areas. Using satellite data, local and national data, and the principles of systematic conservation planning, these governments are able to pinpoint where actions on nature protection, restoration, and sustainable management will help them meet their nature-dependent national development goals, especially for water, food, climate, livelihoods, safety, and biodiversity. As Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, the new head of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and Francis Ogwal, co-chair of the working group on the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, explain in a recent blog, such maps are an essential component for planning, implementing, and monitoring bold ambition and action on nature.

2020 was supposed to be a ‘Super Year for Nature.’ But even though all major biodiversity events have been postponed or cancelled, the recent gains in these five trends give us reasons for hope. To learn more, and for a dose of hope, visit www.NatureForLifeHub.org.

A key theme of the 30-minute video was the importance of strategic partnerships and collaboration to effectively meet the challenges of poverty in our community, and how the United Way of SDG strives to be a leader in poverty reduction.

“A dollar to the United Way is spent in a collaborative process that allows us to oversee spending and ensure we are sharing costs, sharing expertise and building together the community we call home,” said Juliette Labossière, Executive Director of United Way of SDG, during the live virtual event.

The United Way/Centraide of SDG members continued to grow in 2020 with the organization funding 16 local agencies and 20 programs compared to 14 agencies and 16 programs in 2019. In 2020-2021, the United Way of SDG will invest $337,786 into the community through these 16 agencies who all fall under the organization’s three pillars: moving people from poverty to possibility, helping kids be all they can be and building strong and healthy communities.

Labossière further talked about the increased relevancy of The United Way of SDG and several local organizations during the current pandemic, touching on how strategic partnerships with the Social Development Council of Cornwall & Area, 30 members of the Emergency Response Council, and the generosity of the City of Cornwall and citizens across our entire region contributed to fewer people being negatively impacted by the pandemic than could have been. It was the advocacy and a coordinated approach through these partnerships that enabled the United Way of SDG to distribute $530,000 into our region over the last 5 months. This included Akwesasne, Cornwall and all of our counties.

The work to ease our way out of the pandemic, however, is far from over and the United Way of SDG worries about the real social impact of the pandemic that will emerge in the next few months.

“I urge you to think about the United Way as the united front that will assist our community and non-profits to weather this upcoming storm and support the community on all levels as necessary,” Labossière asked of the viewers as their support is vital to the United Way’s continued work in the community.

David Booyink, Campaign Chair, also shared a few words on why he volunteers, “I’ve always had this growing desire since I was a young boy to save lives, to make a difference.” Volunteering is a way everyone can help, and the United Way of SDG urges you to research its member agencies and look for opportunities to get involved.

Maureen Miller, a mother of two, shared how volunteers changed her life. She discussed her experience with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Cornwall (a United Way of SDG member agency), emphasizing just how much of an impact the program has had on her kids’ lives. It has given them the support and friendships they need to find happiness and explore new opportunities that they may not have had if not for the mentorship of their Big Brothers and Big Sister.

And to end the live event, John Hoyles, Executive Director of the Community Information Centre of Ottawa, shared an important resource that everyone in SDG can use. 211 is an informational helpline and website that connects people to the right information and services to navigate life’s challenges. This resource saw a 20% increase in SDG during the first few months of COVID-19 and Hoyles expects it will increase in popularity as we move into winter.

“The most important thing for us is to get more people to know about 211,” Hoyles stressed as this is a service for people to turn to when they have nowhere to go. His goal is to “make 211 just as known as 911,” and encourages viewers to help spread the word about this lifeline for the people who need it.

There are varied political, social and economic factors across India’s states that determine their attractiveness to foreign direct investment (FDI). In the post-COVID-19 world, these same factors will be influenced by the availability of physical, social, natural, and human capital that the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are aspiring for. Indeed, the COVID-19 pandemic is a critical juncture where countries across the globe are being forced to face their weaknesses in the global supply chains, which have increasingly come under China’s hegemony in recent years. While India’s flagship ‘Make in India’ policy is largely guided by an attempt to attract FDI and nurture value chains that begin and end in India, the prime minister’s clarion calls of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’a or ‘Vocal for Local’ must not be perceived as roadblocks to foreign investments and international trade. The ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’[a] scheme was introduced to increase the resilience of the domestic economy to the elements of uncertainty posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Through this scheme, the government aims to boost domestic production and make India a ‘self-reliant’ nation; funds worth INR 20 trillion have been disbursed for this purpose.

FDI is crucial for economic development, modernisation, and employment generation; it contributes to technology transfer, human capital formation, entrepreneurship, and efficiency of resource management. Espousing the spirit of ‘competitive federalism’, the Indian states have engaged in competition for FDI amongst themselves. States that have been successful in attracting higher FDI have enjoyed greater benefits from its positive spillovers.

This study maps the regional distribution of FDI inflows into India between 2005-06 and 2018-19. Data on FDI inflows are collected by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) at its various regional offices, each of which often caters to more than one State or Union Territory. This dataset has been decomposed into its state-wise components by employing an appropriate statistical technique. Using this dataset estimated by the authors, the analysis outlines the subnational trends in FDI inflow. It reviews India’s policies on Special Economic Zones (SEZs), land, labour and industry to determine their role in governing the Ease of Doing Business environment, which in turn influences FDI inflow into the domestic economy.

Key Findings

Developing nations in Asia, such as India, are some of the largest recipients of foreign investment in the world, and there is intense competition for FDI in the region. India recorded US$ 49

billion in FDI in 2019, a 16-percent increase from the previous year. This accounted for 80 percent of FDI flowing into South Asia in 2019.

billion in FDI in 2019, a 16-percent increase from the previous year. This accounted for 80 percent of FDI flowing into South Asia in 2019. Analysis of sub-national FDI flows indicate the emergence of two categories of states: Those that have received uniform (i.e. low volatility) and high volumes of FDI between 2005-06 and 2018-19 are called ‘better performing’ states; another group that received low volumes of FDI, with high fluctuations (i.e. high volatility) in yearly inflows, are the ‘poor performing’ states.

The ‘poor performing’ states in India with high FDI volatility are Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh. The ‘better performing’ states with low FDI volatility are Delhi, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.

Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) conditions should be improved to attract more FDI into the regions. For Indian states, this study estimates that a one-percent increase in the EoDB score

leads to a 6.32-percent increase in FDI inflow.

leads to a 6.32-percent increase in FDI inflow. Better performance on the SDGs parameters improves aspects of EoDB, and enables a congenial investment climate. Estimates for the Indian states suggest that a one-percent increase in SDG scores translates into a 0.80-percent increase in EoDB parameters and a 6.77-percent increase in FDI inflows.

The ‘poor performing’ states must establish SEZs with favourable conditions, while the ‘better performing’ states should also focus on the holistic sustainability concerns in accordance with environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations.

Current literature suggests that FDI contributes to domestic capital formation. Competition for FDI among Indian states, employing the driving principles of SDGs, will not only ensure long-term economic growth, but also lead to equitable distribution of the gains from FDI.

Despite the COVID pandemic affecting the community, it was announced the United Way of SDG would be helping even more agencies and programs in 2020. “In 2019, the United Way grew its allocation membership from 13 agencies who we assisted to fund 14 programs, to 14 agencies and 16 programs,” said Labossière. “This year, we’re proud to say that we grew yet again. We’re actually funding the 16 agencies and assisting with 20 programs.”

Article content During the kick-off event, the executive director also discussed the ways in which the way funds collected are tallied. Long gone, several years ago, is the familiar thermometer way of announcing the amount raised. It’s been replaced by what Labossière called an impact-based analysis of funding. The practice enables the organization to increase the impact it has on the many programs and agencies it assists. “A dollar to the United Way is spent in collaboration in a collaborative process that allows us to oversee spending and ensure we are sharing cost-sharing expertise in building, together, this community we call home,” said Labossière. “We continue to fundraise, as dollars are vital to the survival of our partner agencies and are necessary to run the programs that we choose to fund. “We invest your money, right here in our community, where it is needed most.” More On This Topic United Way/Centraide of SD&G launches annual campaign United Way of SDG Community Campaign supporting more agencies United Way / Centraide of SDG in the black, adds new member agencies In all, the United Way of SDG pledged to invest $337,786 to the agencies it assists. The topic of COVID was addressed during the kickoff. Labossière said she believed several factors had led to area residents not being as impacted by the virus as they could have been. These included strategic partnerships the United Way of SDG had established over the last few years, such as with the Social Development Council of Cornwall and Area, as well as the 30 or so members of the Regional Emergency Response Council. In addition, she also praised the generosity of not only the citizens of Cornwall and SDG, but also of the city itself.

This included Big Brothers Big Sisters of Cornwall and Area executive director Ron Graham, as well as John Hoyles, of Ontario 211. In addition, Steven Douris, himself a big brother with the organization, spoke to a local mother, who’s two children have benefited from the BBBS’ mentoring programs. Identified only as Maureen, the woman told listeners how both her daughter and her son were matched with mentors, which then allowed them to blossom in later years. “It’s unbelievable how much it has helped,” she said. “For my son, he’s been given healthy male role models which obviously I cannot be for him. My daughter is a bit shy and her big sister, and her big sister’s family, because they have all welcomed her into their home, they have brought her out of her shell.” fracine@postmedia.com twitter.com/FrancisRacine

Ghana’s quest to bounce back from the dip recorded by some Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, can happen with the active participation of private sector.



Players in the sector according to experts are crucial to nation-building and must be allowed by government to undertake certain development projects to reduce borrowing and ensure debt sustainability.



These were suggestions unanimously made by Dr Charles Boamah a Former Senior Vice President at African Development Bank and Madam Hamdiya Ismaila, General Manager of Venture Capital Fund one of the panel discussion at the ongoing, 2020 Accra SDGs Investment Fair.



The three-day fair seeks to provide a platform to explore new opportunities within the new normal, identify innovative ways to access financial resources during the COVID-19 pandemic and recovery, share experiences relating to individual and corporate adaptability in the wake of Covid-19 and rebuilding momentum for the implementation of the SDGs.



Speaking on the topic, “Financing for Development and the New Normal” Dr Boamah said one factor that was derailing private sector participation was lack of trust among the private people, the government and the citizenry and government could raise funds to implement SDG programmes by increasing taxes, and deepening the capital market.



Dr Boamah said much attention should also be focused on building trust among citizenry, private sector and the government to facilitate workflow and State-Owned Enterprises with financial commercial viability must be weaned off state funds and allowed to borrow to operate.



Madam Ismaila said SDG goal eight and nine could be achieved if the government and the private sector worked hand-in-hand.



“With the participation of the private sector, government initiatives like one-district-one factory (1D1F) and planting for food and jobs. If the 1D1F is left for the private sector to look to raise funds to build, operate and transfer it,” she added.



In the financial sector, she urged the regulators to build a stronger synergy between them and financial institutions to build confidence.","General News of Wednesday, 16 September 2020Source: GNAGhana’s quest to bounce back from the dip recorded by some Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, can happen with the active participation of private sector.

178,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-implementation-and-accountability-bring-on-the-data/,"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: SDG Implementation and Accountability: Bring on the Data,"Next week the UN will hold a virtual UN World Data Forum, featuring the expertise of statisticians and sustainable development professionals from around the world. The Forum will focus attention on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’s role as an accountability framework, as experts showcase the diverse ways that SDG progress can be measured. They are sure to stress the need for identifying, collecting, disaggregating, and analyzing appropriate data as a crucial component for SDG implementation, to ensure that good examples and laggards can be identified, and course corrections can be applied.

Over the past five years, stories in the SDG Knowledge Hub have reveled the multiplicity of approaches, tools, and projects underway to ensure that robust data sets are available and used to drive the SDGs forward. In this brief, we take a broad view of the implementation story that official data sets can tell us, by focusing on the SDG progress reports released each year by the UN Secretary-General.

Every May for the past five years, the UN Secretary-General has issued an SDG Progress Report ahead of the annual July session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The reports draw on the latest available data for the indicators contained in the global SDG indicator framework, which is maintained by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs’ (DESA) Statistics Division, with input from the UN agencies that serve as “custodians” for the indicator data. These data are provided by UN Member States and, as a result, the annual reports are as much a reflection on the availability of globally comparable data as they are a snapshot of SDG progress.

In Year 1, then UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon launched the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Report 2016, which helped to set a benchmark for the 2030 Agenda’s 15-year implementation period. “We are off to a good start,” Ban observed. He said the report showed the need for targeted action to address those who are the furthest behind, first. The Secretary-General also underscored the importance of data and indicators on all groups, particularly those that often go uncounted.

In Year 2, the SDG Progress Report provided a more robust report of progress on each of the 17 Global Goals. Nonetheless, the report emphasized that the amount of data and statistics needed to track SDG progress poses a major challenge to national and international statistical systems. It highlighted the efforts of the global statistical community to modernize and strengthen statistical systems.

In Year 3, the Goal-by-Goal reporting continued to be more detailed. Of particular note, the report indicated that, after a prolonged decline, world hunger (SDG 2) appeared to be on the rise again, and the prospect of ending hunger and malnutrition by 2030 had become more difficult. For Goal 7 (affordable and clean energy), the report said ensuring access for all “has come one step closer,” and noted improvements in industrial energy efficiency. On Goal 13 (climate action), the report noted that 2017 was one of the three warmest years on record, and the world continued to experience rising sea levels. On Goal 16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions), the report indicated progress in regulations to promote public access to information, “albeit slowly,” as well as in strengthening national human rights institutions.

Despite the increased number of indicators that could be used in the analysis for this 2018 report, the report still was not able to reflect all of the SDGs’ 169 targets, due to lack of data or methodological development on some indicators. The report stressed the need for quality, accessible, open, timely, and disaggregated data, brought about through strengthened capacities of national statistical systems.

In Year 4, Heads of State and Government prepared to meet for the first high-level stocktaking of the 2030 Agenda since its adoption. Ahead of this first ‘SDG Summit,’ the UN produced a special edition of the report covering the first four-year cycle of the 2030 Agenda. The 2019 report found that progress had been made on several SDGs and targets, including:

a continued drop in extreme poverty (SDG 1),

a continued decrease in child mortality rates (SDG 3),

an increase in gender-responsive budgeting (SDG 5),

increased access to electricity and improvements in energy efficiency (SDG 7),

a return to the unemployment levels from before the 2008 financial crisis (SDG 8),

a decrease in the proportion of the urban population living in slums (SDG 11), and

a doubling of the proportion of waters under national jurisdiction covered by marine protected areas (MPAs) since 2010 (SDG 14).

The 2019 special report also recorded slow progress on many Goals and targets, including an increase in hunger and childhood malnutrition (SDG 2) and the loss of biodiversity at “an alarming rate” (SDGs 14 and 15). The report indicated that the continued increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (SDG 13) meant that greater urgency and ambition were required, particularly on climate change. On SDG 4 (quality education), hundreds of million children and youth were out of school, and more than 50% of children and adolescents did not meet minimum proficiency standards in reading and mathematics. On SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), billions lacked safe water, sanitation, and handwashing facilities. Millions were deprived of security and rights (SDG 16), inequalities persisted along urban-rural and other lines (SDG 10), and the report cautioned that there was “no way” the world could fulfill the 2030 Agenda without achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls (SDG 5).

The SDG Progress Report for Year 5 drew on data available as of April 2020. Reflecting on the worrisome trends highlighted in the special overview edition in 2019, the report shows that the world was already addressing multiple vulnerabilities. The 2020 SDG Progress Report focuses on where the COVID-19 pandemic “imperils progress” on each SDG. In particular, it reports that the least developed countries (LDCs), land-locked developing countries (LLDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and countries in humanitarian or fragile situations “stand to be hit hardest” due to fragile health systems, limited social protection coverage, limited financial and other resources, vulnerability to shocks, and dependence on international trade.

We have a new vantage point for anticipating how the next SDG Progress Report will look. Due in May 2021, the report for Year 6 of the 2030 Agenda will no doubt focus on a year’s worth of impacts of the global pandemic on SDG implementation. Its findings will no doubt be sobering, but they may also help to show the way forward.

At the 2020 HLPF, the Secretary-General said the antidote for some of the pandemic’s worst impacts already exists in the form of the SDGs. The data that make these assessments possible, and can help to show where lessons and best cases may exist, will help to monitor the recovery process in a manner that would not be possible if the SDGs had not been adopted in 2015. The data will provide the evidence necessary to help keep governments on track for the future that we still want.

During the last three weeks, the following countries have indicated their intention to present a Voluntary National Review (VNR):

Antigua and Barbuda, Djibouti, Nicaragua, and San Marino, for their first VNRs;

Cabo Verde, Cyprus, Dominican Republic, Japan, Namibia, and Tunisia, for their second VNRs; and

Colombia, for its third VNR.

The following 30 countries had already expressed an interest as of 30 September 2020:

First-time presenters: Angola, Bolivia, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Marshall Islands, and Myanmar;

Second-time presenters: Bahamas, Bhutan, Chad, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Iraq, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Madagascar, Malaysia, Norway, Pakistan, Paraguay, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, and Zimbabwe; and

Third-time presenters: Azerbaijan, Guatemala, Mexico, Qatar, Sierra Leone, and Uruguay.

The President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) has indicated that no more than 42 countries will be able to present VNRs during HLPF 2021, due to time constraints.

An informal “group of friends” made up of UN Member States, established in 2019, will support the countries presenting VNRs in 2021. The group is coordinated by the delegation of Mexico to the UN.

The 2021 session of the HLPF will convene from 6-15 July under the auspices of ECOSOC. It will focus on the theme, ‘Sustainable and resilient recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, that promotes the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development: Building an inclusive and effective path for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda in the context of the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development.’ HLPF 2021 will review nine SDGs in depth:

Goal 1 (No poverty);

Goal 2 (Zero hunger);

Goal 3 (Good health and wellbeing);

Goal 8 (Decent work and economic growth);

Goal 10 (Reduced inequalities);

Goal 12 (Responsible consumption and production);

Goal 13 (Climate action);

Goal 16 (Peace, justice, and strong institutions); and

Goal 17 (Partnership for the Goals).

The reviews will include targets with a 2020 timeline.

One outcome of the HLPF is expected to be a ministerial declaration adopted at the end of the ministerial segment. At the 2020 HLPF, governments did not reach agreement on the ministerial declaration. UN Member States had attempted to remotely negotiate the ministerial declaration leading up to the HLPF, which was held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but were unable to finalize negotiations. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin reported that if the meeting had taken place in person, governments could have voted on the draft, but “in the absence of online voting procedures, the adoption of the declaration had to be deferred.” Negotiations between Member States resumed after the session, but no agreement was reached.

In September 2020, the Group of 77 developing countries and China (G-77/China) tabled a proposal for a meeting of the HLPF and ECOSOC on an exceptional basis to reconsider the draft, but the Council did not adopt it. ECOSOC President Munir Akram indicated that he would to pursue consultations with interested delegations and seek advice from the UN’s Office of Legal Affairs.

Akram has explained that notwithstanding the lack of agreement on a Ministerial Declaration, in the HLPF discussions, Member States:

Expressed their firm commitment to a multilateral response to COVID-19;

Stressed that vulnerable countries must not be left behind in the recovery;

Called for adequate financing, debt relief and debt waivers to be provided, particularly for low- and middle-income countries; and

Acknowledged that once developed, a COVID-19 vaccine should be available to everyone and everywhere, rich or poor, at affordable prices.

He said governments expressed that the means of implementation for the SDGs must be strengthened to meet both the scale and ambition of the 2030 Agenda, and the need for a speedy recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. He cited, in particular, financing, sustainable infrastructure and investment, international trade, science and technology, capacity building and partnerships.

The study was carried out by custodian bank Caceis and the Dutch association for sustainable investment VBDO and covered 32 medium-sized and small pension funds in the Netherlands. Some 58% of these invest at least part of their assets according to one or more of the SDGs.

Climate Action (SDG 13) is the most popular SDG, with half of the surveyed pension funds including it in their ESG policy. Clean & Affordable Energy (SDG 7) and Decent Work & Economic Growth (SDG 8) jointly come second with 32%.

Maurits Daarnhouwer, product development manager at Caceis, said pension funds tended to choose these three goals because they were easy to measure.

“For example in the form of [avoidance of] carbon emissions, a certain amount of renewable energy that is generated, or certification of suppliers to check whether they meet certain labour standards,” he said.

SDGs 3 (Good Health & Well-Being) and 6 (Clean Water) are also popular with pension funds (see chart), while Life on Land (SDG 15), Life below Water (SDG 14) and Gender Equality (SDG 5) are only chosen by an handful of the Dutch funds.

The SDGs 16 (Peace, Justice & Strong Institutions) and 17 (Partnership for the Goals) were not chosen by any of the funds included in the study.

Pension funds often select SDGs following member surveys in which they ask which SDGs they want to be reflected in the fund’s investment portfolio.

Pensioenfonds Detailhandel, the fund for retail workers, has modelled its entire equity portfolio according to the SDGs. Funds that don’t apply SDGs say they find it difficult to translate them into concrete investments, according to Daarnhouwer.

The event underscored that accelerating ocean-based solutions can support recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and delivery of the SDGs.

According to the UN Global Compact’s Ocean Stewardship 2030 report released in May 2020, five tipping points could secure a healthy and productive ocean. These are:

Fully traceable sustainable seafood;

Decarbonized shipping (“set sail for zero”);

Harnessing ocean electricity;

Mapping the ocean; and

Ending waste entering the ocean.

During the review event, five CEO Roundtables addressed these tipping points. The review resulted in an Outcome Document of the 2020 CEO Roundtables on Ocean, identifying actions business can take to advance the five areas. On sustainable seafood, the outcome document recommends: contributing to standardize traceability data, harmonize standards and promote interoperability of traceability platforms through the seafood value chain; and increasing the recognition of seafood in the climate and food agendas.



On decarbonizing shipping, recommendations include: providing incentives to develop and scale up low- or zero-carbon fuels, and support transparency and financial capacity; engaging with governments and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in setting up a global research and development fund and calling for further policy action; and sharing best practices regarding technology for zero-emission vessels.



On harnessing ocean energy, the document highlights action areas related to: developing a framework for global strategic planning by governments, in dialogue with relevant stakeholders; and increasing standardization of the industry and setting up global certifications and key performance indicators.

On ending waste entering the ocean, the document calls for: defining the “rules of the game” such as through dependable regulations for the private sector, to facilitate greater public-private collaboration to end ocean plastic; and determining the institutions needed to rapidly scale plastic pollution solutions across countries, as well as funding them.



On mapping the ocean, the outcome document recommends: conducting a gap analysis to take stock of ongoing ocean data initiatives, and data and information needs; and identifying enabling factors and the necessary means to implement them, including support for developing countries, in collecting, sharing, and using ocean data.

On delivering on the Decade of Action, participants identified barriers and actions for business and governments to realize the ambitions highlighted in the Ocean Stewardship 2030 report. SDG 14 (life below water) addresses the need to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Four of the targets of SDG 14 are due to be achieved by 2020.

182,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-releases-baseline-report-on-disability-inclusion/,"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Releases Baseline Report on Disability Inclusion,"The UN has released a report on implementing its Disability Inclusion Strategy, providing a “first baseline on the status of disability inclusion” across the UN system. The Strategy was launched in June 2019 in the context of the 2030 Agenda’s principle of leaving no one behind.

The Strategy aims to enable the UN system to support the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), the SDGs, the Agenda for Humanity prepared for the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit, and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. The Strategy will be implemented for five years and then reviewed and updated as needed.

The Strategy features four core areas: leadership, strategic planning, and management – including senior leadership that champions disability inclusion, and establishing teams with expertise on disability inclusion; inclusiveness – which entails ensuring full accessibility for all, and actively involving persons with disabilities in all of its work; programming, such as joint initiatives to accelerate progress, and supporting disability-inclusive programming through practical guidance for the field and headquarters; and organizational culture. This means evolving internal systems to attract, recruit, retain, and promote persons with disabilities in the UN workforce, and building staff capacities to understand disability inclusion. The Strategy is accompanied by 15 performance indicators to facilitate progressive improvement.

The first report on implementation of the Strategy establishes a baseline on the status of disability inclusion in the UN system. It also provides recommendations for the system, including ways to support Member States in implementing the CRPD and achieving the SDGs. The report identifies challenges in achieving disability inclusion associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and disability-inclusive response and recovery efforts.

Highlighting the report on 13 October 2020, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said the Strategy aims to advance “transformative and lasting change for persons who are too often left behind.” It seeks to spark action to raise the standards of the UN’s performance on disability inclusion, to make an impact with its policies, programmes, and operations, and to “meaningfully engage persons with disabilities, and not just see them as a vulnerable population, but also as actors of change.”

Mohammed reported that the UN Secretariat requested all parts of the UN system to demonstrate what they are doing to meet the objectives set in the Strategy’s accountability framework. She said action has been taken across the UN’s three pillars – human rights, sustainable development, and peace and security – both at Headquarters and in the field.

The UNGA’s Third Committee (social, humanitarian, and cultural issues) is considering a draft resolution on ‘Inclusive development for and with persons with disabilities’ (A/C.3/75/L.9).

The SDG Impact Standards for Private Equity Funds will be supplemented with a voluntary assurance framework that will include an ‘SDG Impact Seal’ in recognition of best practice.

The Standards aim to meet the need for clear guidance and fill a knowledge gap for businesses seeking ways to make a positive impact. The Standards provide a common language to help private equity, venture capital, and other funds in private markets achieve social and/or environmental impact through their investments. The Standards were developed by the UNDP initiative ‘SDG Impact,’ along with industry experts. SDG Impact seeks to empower investors and businesses to support and authenticate their contributions towards achieving the SDGs.

In launching the Standards, Elizabeth Boggs Davidsen, SDG Impact, said they will help focus approximately USD 4 trillion toward sustainable investments and solutions that can address challenges related to health, poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, and peace and justice. UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner highlighted the private sector’s role as a ‘first responder’ to the COVID-19 pandemic, through the provision of technology, innovation, skills, services, and employment, saying the private sector can now also play a critical role in building back better.

The Standards are:

focused on impact management and decision making, and emphasize transparency and governance;

flexible so they can be used by funds of any size, at any stage of development, and at any location;

grounded in existing principles, and provide context for applying other tools and frameworks, including metrics, taxonomies and reporting frameworks; and

voluntary and freely available.

SDG Impact is also developing Standards for Bonds and Standards for Enterprises, which are currently in the public consultation phase.

This year’s work will include negotiating the 2020 Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review of the UN’s operational activities for development (QCPR).

On 5 October 2020, the Committee, chaired by the Permanent Representative of Nepal, held an in-person session to adopt its programme of work for the year. The Committee also began its general debate on the theme of ‘Building back better after COVID-19: Ensuring a more equitable global economy, inclusive societies and sustainable recovery.’

We must take full advantage of the improvements we have made to the UN development system, to help countries recover better from COVID-19.

The Chair said the Committee will focus on issues affecting groups of countries in special situations, including the least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). He also highlighted:

the Food Systems Summit being planned for 2021,

the Committee will discuss the modalities for the midterm review of the Water Action Decade 2018-2028, through a high-level event convening from 22-24 March 2023, in New York, and

it is time to conduct the QCPR, which takes place every four years and was last conducted in 2016.

In a keynote address to the Second Committee, Joseph Stiglitz, Columbia University, said the international community cannot squeeze water from a stone: developing economies and emerging markets cannot find financial resources to address the COVID-19 pandemic without significant debt restructuring. He expressed support for the issuance of special drawing rights.

Stiglitz also called for multinational corporations pay their fair share of taxes, such as by creating a minimum global corporate income tax at the level of 2%. He added that greening economies can be timely, targeted, labor-intensive, and provide good stimulus.

Liu Zhenmin, head of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), said COVID-19 stimulus packages will be most effective if they prioritize public investments that contribute to achieving the SDGs, including climate change mitigation and adaptation, and digital infrastructure.

Member States speaking during the debate emphasized the need for stronger international cooperation to face the “seemingly endless cycles” of COVID-19, especially in States that lack recovery financing. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) urged “vaccine multilateralism” to ensure equitable, universal, and affordable access to COVID-19 vaccines. Another delegate suggested considering vaccines and therapeutic treatments as global public goods.

The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) noted some government’s “retreat” from the development agenda and climate change commitments. She also noted the inability of SIDS to access available climate finance because of “cumbersome processes and competition with other better capacitated countries.”

Canada, Australia, and New Zealand (CANZ) said “there should be no rollback of existing commitments,” and it is vital to promote full participation of people with disabilities, women and children, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. He supported new approaches to addressing the debt crisis and maintain jobs, particularly in the LDCs. The general debate continues until 9 October 2020 in a virtual format.

Also during the Second Committee’s in-person meeting on 5 October, UN Deputy Secretary‑General Amina Mohammed’s provided a briefing on the 2020 QCPR, noting that it takes place at the outset of the Decade of Action for sustainable development.

Recalling that the previous QCPR in 2016 “paved the way for the deepest transformation in the history” of the UN development system, Mohammed reported that the UN has since established a new coordination system to better respond to the 2030 Agenda, including a funding compact with Member States. In May 2020, during the UN Economic and Social Council’s (ECOSOC) Operational Activities Segment, she said governments decided to move forward on other mandates set out in the 2016 QCPR, including to operationalize a new regional architecture, strengthen support to multi‑country offices (MCOs), and bolster independent system‑wide evaluations for accountability.

Mohammed said that now, to help countries recover better from COVID-19, “we must take full advantage of the improvements we have made” to the UN development system. She called on Member States to give strategic direction to this process through the 2020 QCPR, particularly in the following ways:

Additional resources are needed in priority policy areas, including climate change, economic transformation and employment, women’s empowerment, and digitalization;

At the country level, the UN is introducing integrated national financing frameworks for the SDGs, and the QCPR can provide clarity on expectations;

Coherence between the UN’s pillars;

On leaving no one behind, the QCPR “can give visibility to those excluded and on the margins,” including persons with disabilities and women and girls. She said the process can also clarify Member States’ expectations for a recovery from COVID‑19 that is anchored in inclusive and green economies, and noted that greater investment is needed in data for evidence‑based decision‑making; and

Completing the “unfinished business” of the 2016 QCPR, such as meeting the targets of the funding compact.

In addition to deliberations on its official agenda items, the Committee will hold three other events. A joint meeting with ECOSOC will address ‘Developing sustainable infrastructure and utilizing science and technology in response to COVID-19,’ on 14 October. A virtual side event on ‘Disaster risk-informed and resilient COVID-19 recovery’ will take place on 15 October. An annual dialogue with the executive secretaries of the UN regional commissions is scheduled for 19 October.

Action on draft resolutions is expected to take place in November.

The webinar took place on 16 September 2020 with the participation of 400 experts and actors in the area of chemical safety.

In an overview of the eChemPortal, Valérie Frison and Sally De Marcellus, OECD, recalled that it was developed in collaboration with the European Chemicals Agency and with government contributions, and launched as a prototype in 2007 to contribute to the sharing of knowledge, information, and data priority of the Strategic Approach for International Chemicals Management (SAICM). The new website was launched in February 2020 with an improved design and user experience.

The OECD representatives said the portal: enables searches by substance identification, chemical properties and effects, and classifications; searches data from multiple sources simultaneously; provides direct free access to information; and describes the type of review data have undergone. Information from third-party data sources supports health and environmental decisions concerning chemicals management for all stakeholders regardless of geography or purpose.

The portal includes approximately 800,000 substance records from 34 databases of authorities and international organizations regarding chemicals, pesticides, and biocides. The number of data sources participating in eChemPortal is continuously increasing. Over four million searches were conducted in 2019 by users from industry, government, academics and the general public.

In an exchange of country experiences, Gerlinde Knetch, German Environment Agency (UBA), said UBA prioritizes chemicals that pose the greatest risks but there are gaps in the portal’s data and information in this regard. However, the portal represents a good example of bringing all databases together in a ‘one-stop shop.’ She highlighted the April 2020 launch of the SAICM Knowledge Platform, and the portal’s contribution to the platform’s data and information component.

Jake Sanderson, Environment Canada and member of the steering group for the eChemPortal, highlighted the inclusion of two Canadian databases in the portal. He noted his government’s frequent use of the portal, which he said is internationally recognized as the repository for chemical information used by regulatory authorities for risk assessment and prioritization. He stressed the importance of data quality and reputation, and increased participation of developing countries, and suggested that the portal could offer more collaboration opportunities between regulators.

Representing industry and academic perspectives, Violaine Verougstraete, Eurometaux (non-ferrous metals producers and recyclers in Europe), addressed trends in Europe, including the EU Green Deal, which, she said, all lead to a less toxic future. She mentioned the revision of measures to address pollution from large industrial installations, and said industry should view chemicals management, which is also about value chains and downstream users, as a global issue.

On students’ use of the eChemPortal, Verougstraete said students welcomed the number of databases included in the portal, but stressed the need to know what is behind the data and whether the data are reliable. In addition, they said common formatting would be helpful, noting possible confusion when assessing data from different databases.

During the question and answer session, panelists suggested that OECD provide hands-on training and video tutorials on use of the portal, and said potential data sources could undergo a review process before being included in the portal.

The Fourth Ministerial Meeting of the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action convened virtually on 12 October, under the chairmanship of Chile’s Minister of Finance Ignacio Briones and Finland’s Minister of Finance Matti Vanhanen. The meeting was held on the sidelines of the 2020 Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank Group.

In the joint ministerial statement, the Coalition reaffirms its commitment to the 2019 Helsinki Principles, and notes efforts to address the needs of citizens and economies during the COVID-19 crisis and to ensure an inclusive, low-emission, resilient, and sustainable economic recovery while aligning policies to climate action. The ministers look forward to engaging in dialogue with partners and stakeholders to better understand the technical and political challenges to implementing the Helsinki Principles, and “stand ready” to contribute to “a successful COP 26 in 2021.”

Countries now have a chance to set themselves on a greener, smarter, and more equitable development path.

The ministers also strengthened the Coalition’s governance arrangements through a Charter to support members’ efforts to mainstream climate change in economic policies. They approved the Coalition’s first annual report, and welcomed three recent reports produced for the Coalition:

Addressing the ministers, Vanhanen signaled the Coalition’s readiness to support members in addressing climate change through economic policy measures. He said COVID-19 recovery efforts must be aligned with climate policy targets.

“Countries now have a chance to set themselves on a greener, smarter, and more equitable development path,” said World Bank Group President David Malpass. He highlighted opportunities to deliver the benefits of cleaner air and water, healthier oceans, more resilient cities, and more sustainable food and agriculture systems, as well as new jobs that are sustainable, inclusive, and equitable.

Highlighting climate change as “a profound threat to growth and prosperity,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva called for a carbon price floor covering the majority of global emissions.

Coalition members and institutional partners delivered pre-recorded video statements on how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted fiscal policies related to climate change.

Launched in April 2019, the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action brings together 52 developed and developing countries from all regions, jointly accounting for about 16% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and 30% of global gross domestic product (GDP).

The report is presented as an interactive portal and features 100 “data stories” from around the world.

The report titled, ‘The World’s Women 2020: Trends and Statistics,’ was launched on 20 October 2020 – World Statistics Day, which is marked once every five years. The report seeks to answer the question, “What do data tell us about progress towards the commitments made in the Beijing Platform for Action” 25 years after its adoption?

The report uses statistics to analyze the state of gender equality around the world in six areas. On economic empowerment, the report finds that unpaid domestic and care work has intensified for both men and women during the COVID-19 pandemic, but women globally still spend about three times as many hours on unpaid domestic and care work as men (4.2 hours compared to 1.7).

This restricts women’s participation in the labor market; in 2020, only 47% of women of working age participated in the labor market, compared to 74% of men, and the authors report that this gender gap that has remained relatively constant since 1995. The pandemic is “expected to exacerbate these gender disparities, as many women work in the subsectors hardest hit by COVID-19 and lockdown measures, including in paid domestic work, accommodation and food services, and the retail trade,” the report suggests.

On power and decision making, the data show that women held only 28% of managerial positions globally in 2019, which is almost the same proportion as in 1995. In addition, only 18% of enterprises surveyed had a female Chief Executive Officer in 2020, and that percentage drops to 7.4% for Fortune 500 corporations.

On education, the report finds that girls and boys are participating equally in primary education in most regions of the world. In tertiary education, women outnumber men, and enrollment is increasing faster for women than for men.

On violence against women and girls, an estimated 137 women are killed by their intimate partner or a family member every day. In the past 12 months, 18% of women worldwide have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by a partner.

The other two areas for analysis in the report are population and families, and health. The authors also consider impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The report is presented on an online portal, including an interactive map to find stories by region, and datasets organized by the six thematic areas.

Once in force, the emission reduction commitments of participating developed countries and economies in transition (EITs) become legally binding.

The Doha Amendment’s entry into force, a UNFCCC press release notes, is “critical for the rigorous and successful implementation of the second commitment period.” Its entry into force also means that “accounting of the Kyoto Protocol’s second phase can go ahead as anticipated and that the Kyoto Protocol’s compliance committee can fully fulfill its legal functions.”

Since our last update in July 2019, 15 countries have ratified the Doha Amendment, bringing the total number of ratifications to 145. The Amendment will formally enter into force within 90 days from 1 October 2020, when the 144th instrument of acceptance was received by the Depositary.

The Amendment’s entry into force is critical for the rigorous and successful implementation of the second commitment period.

Angola submitted its instrument of acceptance on 22 September 2020; Bolivia on 17 September 2020; Egypt on 3 February 2020; El Salvador on 18 September 2019; Georgia on 16 June 2020; Ghana on 24 September 2020; Guatemala on 15 October 2019; Jamaica on 1 October 2020; Jordan on 3 January 2020; Nigeria on 2 October 2020; Niue on 10 December 2019; North Macedonia on 18 October 2019; Senegal on 27 May 2020; Sierra Leone on 15 June 2020; and Zambia on 22 August 2019.

The Amendment sets a goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 18% compared to 1990 levels for participating countries. This, according to the UNFCCC, “represents an increase from an average reduction of 5% compared to 1990 levels” during the Kyoto Protocol’s first commitment period from 2008-2012.

“The Doha Amendment’s entry into force is a strong signal of a unified, multilateral commitment to address climate change,” said UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa. She noted that it represents political commitment to pre-2020 action, which, she said, is necessary to build trust ahead of the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, UK.

The entry into force of the Doha Amendment occurs at a time when global emissions are likely to result in an increase of global average temperatures of 3°C above preindustrial levels, the UNFCCC warns. Therefore, new or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) countries are expected to submit in 2020 remain critical for reaching the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement – to keep global warming “well below” 2°C and pursue efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels.

Such information enables policymakers to identify the systemic loss of a country’s economic potential, and revise budgets to support prevention and protection. SDG target 5.2 calls to “eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres.”



The report estimates that 500,000 working days are lost to marital violence annually, as women exposed to domestic violence are typically less productive and tend to take more time off, resulting in an economic loss for them and the economy as a whole. Sexual violence can result in unwanted pregnancies, miscarriages and reproductive health issues.

Nearly one quarter of the UK’s criminal justice system budget for violent crime is spent on domestic violence.

The tool features case studies from Egypt, the UK, Viet Nam and Palestine. In Egypt, the study finds that approximately 5.6 million women experience violence at the hands of their husband or fiancé annually, and the cost for women and families due to violence is approximately LE 2.17 billion. The study reports that disseminating the findings has led to increased recognition of the impact of violence against women on the entire economy and increased advocacy, resulting in:

an increase in the Ministry of Planning’s budget for violence against women-related activities;

an increase in the number of female police officers; and

development of a new draft law on violence against women that is under consideration by parliament.

The UK case study finds that the total cost of domestic violence to society is approximately £23 billion, of which £3.1 billion is borne by the state through support to the criminal justice system, health system, social services, social housing, and legal aid bills to support victims. Nearly one quarter of the UK’s criminal justice system budget for violent crime is spent on domestic violence.

The case study on Viet Nam highlights how the survey results have contributed to increased awareness of the impact of domestic violence and enhanced service provision. UN Women and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) have supported the Government of Viet Nam to pilot an ‘Essential Services Package for Women and Girls Subject to Violence,’ which features a referral system, health care and protection. The pilot also supports the police and criminal justice system to enhance services to survivors of domestic violence. Training has increased the expertise of government personnel and researchers working on domestic violence, positioning them to undertake future costing exercises, and to feature relevant questions in national statistical surveys.

A compilation of lessons learned from the case studies highlights key recommendations for conducting costing studies, given their potential impacts: devote enough time to the preparatory phase for a costing study, including engaging the government to ensure ownership of the findings and a commitment to implement recommendations; consider the study’s scope, including clear definitions of what is included and what age range is selected; employ innovative and participatory approaches, such as a case study of a particular service or area; design the questionnaire to ensure that the methodology is culturally appropriate; produce and disseminate robust estimates; and develop an advocacy plan and use the findings at the outset, such as developing an advocacy plan to target key government leaders and engaging the media to maximize dissemination of the findings and raise awareness among the public and policymakers.

Uncategorized SDG Group: Leading Into The Next Normal Through the Power of Data & Analytics by Analytics Insight October 27, 2020

SDG Group is a Global Data & Analytics Consulting Firm, offering in-depth expertise that empowers its clients’ strategies to become data-driven enterprises and bridges the gap between data and business decisions.

With a global presence, the company’s mission is to transform data into better business decisions, making the results of its projects a core and sustainable differentiator for its clients. SDG Group believes in “Data As A Transformational Asset” (“D.A.T.A.”), meaning data is used as the basis for new ways of performing various functions and operating as a business.

The company has a technology-agnostic approach, which allows the firm to innovate its value proposition with the latest and best technologies to provide the ultimate data and analytics solutions in the market.

Mitigating the Impact of the COVID-19 Crisis

When the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the world, SDG Group looked for opportunities to use its data and analytics expertise to help. They collaborated with global healthcare experts and used the latest technologies to develop, DocDot, a revolutionary AI-assisted remote diagnosis app, recognized by The World Health Organization (WHO) for being one of the most innovative digital health solutions worldwide. The app detects vital signs remotely to help healthcare professionals safely visit patients and enables the digital health taskforce to manage and monitor patients and customers through a Patient Management Dashboard.

SDG Group also collaborated with the Red Cross on its “Red Cross RESPONDS Plan.” The initiative takes action to address COVID-19 in all affected areas of society; emergencies, health, social inclusion, education, employment, and the environment. SDG Group deployed an Open Data Platform that made data centralized and current, and the actions of the Red Cross transparent to the public and key stakeholders.

Helping Clients Overcome New Challenges

In addition to assisting in healthcare and nonprofit organizations, SDG Group manages the pandemic’s impact on its clients. The company helps them create new strategies and solutions to thrive in the “next normal.”

A primary focus is moving data and analytics into the Cloud. SDG Group believes the Cloud is critical for reacting quickly to disruptions because it provides an agile, secure, scalable, and reliable way to extract data. The Cloud also enables its clients to focus more on getting value from data, instead of only spending time managing and maintaining infrastructure.

Another concentration related to the Cloud is Data Sharing. SDG Group believes that having a single data vision where there are no information silos is the most optimal way to address business challenges. The company facilitates Data Sharing within its clients and, in parallel, ensures they have reliable data and speak the same data language through effective Data Management and Data Governance practices.

Also, a Digital Analytics Strategy is more critical than ever now that digital channels are the only means for connecting with people and finding new business opportunities. SDG Group helps its clients discover new ways to reach their customers. With a customer-centric vision, the company developed SDG Eagle Digital Analytics, a solution that provides a comprehensive view of data from all channels.

The economy and recession are also concerns. Amid the pandemic, SDG Group launched the SDG CashFlow War Room Solution to provide its clients with visibility into cash flow to evaluate every possible scenario. The solution helps its clients better manage liquidity and pursue new growth opportunities.

Lastly, SDG Group uses disruptive technologies such as AI, Machine Learning, and Advanced Analytics as catalysts for innovation that will enable its clients to excel in a post-pandemic world.

The company has been successful with its mission because it manages the company by its values. This success has led to growth and new business locations in Italy, Spain, France, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, Egypt, Algeria, United Arab Emirates, Colombia, and the United States.

Their success has also led to recognition and awards. Over the last decade, SDG Group has been named a key consulting firm in the Gartner Market Scope for Europe, and a Global Representative Vendor in Gartner’s Market Guide for Data & Analytics Service Providers, which includes only 37 companies worldwide.

Leaders in local markets also endorse the company. Some of these recognitions are from Analytics Insight in the United States, BARC in Germany, Penteo in Iberia and Latin America, and Industrial Process News in the United Kingdom.

After two deadlocked secret ballots today at County Council, the Mayor of South Glengarry came out on top when the winner’s name was drawn from a hat to settle the role.

Fraser, North Dundas mayor, had put his name forward as a candidate in the annual vote for warden at the County Council table, alongside the incumbent Prevost, South Glengarry mayor.

‘Warden’ is the title for the head of council at the upper-tier SDG municipal government. The position is not directly elected by the people but is instead decided each fall by the 12 local mayors and deputy mayors serving on the Cornwall-based council.

Today’s initial vote produced a 6-6 tie, a result replicated on a second try. So CAO Tim Simpson and Clerk Helen Thomson placed all of the ballots into a hat, and Thomson announced Prevost’s re-appointment after reaching in to decide the matter.

While it was the third time in recent memory a vote for warden has been decided this way, the result produced the first three-time warden in SD&G’s 170-year history.

“It is an honour to be named Warden of the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry for a third time,” said Prevost, who first served in the position in 2000 before being returned to the role for a second time late last year. “COVID-19 has had a tremendous impact on the residents and businesses of SDG over this year. I look forward to meeting the challenges of 2021 and with the help of my colleagues around the council table, as well as administration, we will work to ensure a strengthened new year for everyone.”

Both contenders for the position agreed the prosperity of the United Counties was paramount in light of the global pandemic.

“I congratulate and look forward to working alongside Warden Frank Prevost, as well as my council colleagues, as we are all committed to doing our best for the residents of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry in the year to come,” said Fraser.

Five years into the journey and a decade left, this time serves good to assess the progress made and to ascertain possible modifications and alternate routes that could yield better fruit.

Access to modern and sustainable energy is fundamental to a nation’s growth and development. Despite this, severaldeveloping countries and India in particular, have been struggling to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energysources and meeting the ever-increasing energy demand.

COVID-19 pandemic bought about an unprecedented shock for the world economy in form of a massive health and humanitarian crisis. It has further affected the developmental objectives of several countries, the impact of which can be glaringly felt on the global goals including SDG-7. Along with creating an influx of new challenges, the pandemic has harshly intensified the sting of the existing ones. Identifying the unpleasant repercussions of this pandemic on the energy sector and its progress to attaining the 2030 targets are cardinal to planning and devising additional policies.

Access to electricity

SDG target 7.1 aims to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services by 2030. India’s journey so far has been remarkable in achieving near-universal access to electricity in the last one decade. As per the Saubhagya dashboard, 99.9% per cent of rural households in India have been electrified and less than 20,000 households lack electricity access as of March 2019, but as per NSS-76, more than 6 per cent households in rural areas and 1 per cent households in urban areas had no access to electricity till December 2018. Majority of the states have above 97 per cent access, but larger states such as Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Odisha still lag behind the national average. Rural areas of Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand are most deprived with 80 and 85 per cent access to electricity respectively.

According to NFHS-4, in 2015-16, Bihar ranked at the bottom of all states with just 60 per cent of its households having access to electricity. Since then, it has made significant progress in expanding its electricity access to near-universal coverage in the last three years. But despite attaining near-universal electrification for the majority of states, securing continuous and quality supply of electricity to remote villages and poorest households still remains a mighty concern.

Access to clean fuel

Compared to electricity access, larger variations can be observed in the access of cleanfuel among the Indian states.Meghalaya, West Bengal, and EAG states excluding Uttarakhand still lag in providing universal access to clean cooking fuels, whereevery second households have no access to clean cooking fuels.A significantly low national average portrays the lack of access to clean cooking fuels posing a core developmental and health challenge. Even Kerala despite high living standards has witnessed glaringly low progress in this aspect. Also, as per NSS-76, there exists a blatant country wide rural-urban divide in the access of clean fuel.



Also read: How Will President Donald Trump’s Contraction of COVID-19 Influence The US Elections Campaigning?On average, the beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) go for only 3.1 cylinder refills in a year. For the year 2019-2020, around 4.14 crore families never opted for a refill of more than three cylinders. Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan fair the worst in this regard. According to the information stated at the Rajya Sabha recently, since the beginning of the new financial year in April till August 2020, around 1.84 crore families refilled their LPG cylinders only once. This information comes in when the government claimed of providing free cylinders among the poor since the COVID-19 lockdown.

Hence, the challenge further remains to not only increase the access of cleaner fuels to households but to increase the overall consumption per household. Access to cleaner cooking fuels is rather a multi-dimensional issue both in characteristics and implications. The deficiency in access manifests in several forms such as poor health, unequal rural development, poverty, inferior opportunities and a threat to the environment. The stakeholders involved must further consider safety, fuel availability, affordability and quality.

Towards renewable energy

The energy productions of all type contributes for about 70 per cent of CO2 emissions across the globe. Energy-related CO2 emissions grew 1.7 per cent in 2018 to reach a historic high of 33.1 gigatons of carbon dioxide globally. It was the highest rate of growth since 2013, and 70 per cent higher than the average increase since 2010.However, the global energy demand in the first quarter of 2020 declined by 3.8 percent relative to the first quarter of 2019, resulting to 5 per cent lower CO 2 emissions as well. But this seemingly desirablechange, mainly caused by national lockdowns, may not continue for more than a few months.

To sustainably move towards a better future, it is now essential that we cope with our energy needs, giving due consideration to the environment that has been long neglected and continues to be. The energy transition from conventional to renewable sources is the biggest need of the hour. Owing to this, target 7.2 aims to increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030.

Amongst the BRICS nations, Brazil has been leading the way in the share of renewable energy from its total energy mix, drawing advantage from its high potential of electricity production from wind and solar energy sources. India’s share of renewable energy in its final energy consumption stands at 32.2 per cent as of 2017, suffering a decline since the past many years. Even though India’s share of renewable energy is in comparison higher than countries like Russia, USA, China, Japan and Europe, the decline in this share must be controlled. Whereas for countries mentioned above able to sustain the share of renewables in their total energy mix, intense efforts of increasing that share must be realised too.



Energy Statistics 2020 has reported substantial growth in renewable energyshare in the total installed electricity generation from 13.4 per cent (2015-2016) to 17.7 per cent (2017-2018), owing to significantinvestments and expansions made in wind and solar power generation. Recent IEA analysis shows that in 2018, India’s investment in solar energy was greater than in all fossil fuel sources of electricity generation together.

Improving energy efficiency

SDG-7 target 7.3 aims to double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030. Energy intensity indicates the amount of energy needed to produce one unit of GDP – where a smaller value is always desirable pointing towards greater energy efficiency. India has made significant progress in delivering energy efficiency even better than major economies namely China, USA, Russia, several European countries. It has showcased exemplary performance on this front and achieved energy intensity level of 4.1 MJ/US$ that is even lower than the global average of 54.1 MJ/US$.

Energy efficiency and increasing share of renewables are fundamental in achieving several other sustainable development goals. Without accelerated clean energy innovation and transition towards renewables, these agenda 2030 seem far-fetched. As the nation faces the grim economic impact of the pandemic, energy efficiency offers several opportunities to provide the much-needed boost to the economy in the form of employment generation and so on. Although a great deal of uncertainty exists with regard to SDG-7.

COVID-19 impacts

The pandemic has enhanced the need for domestic manufacturing to meet our energy requirements instead of depending on imports. We have been highly reliant on China for its solar imports, and the repercussions of this was felt during the lockdown, affecting renewable projects under construction. India’s renewable energy trajectory will highly depend on initiatives and policies the government takes up during and after COVID-19, to meet the 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022 and 450 GW by 2030.

The energy demand will show signs of recovery with the unlock measures taken, but careful and wise decisions regarding India’s energy transition are mandatory. Over focus on domestic coal mining and thermal power, policies are likely to compromise not only the environmental safeguards but even the energy transition prospects. The renewable industry seeks gains after years of gradual and increasing investments in innovation and capacity building.

Dwindling investments by buyers due to higher costs associated with renewable energy or reduced confidence in committing to new projects could potentially disrupt the meeting of these goals. On to the bright side, there was an increase in the share of renewable power generation for the months in lockdown as compared to previous years, owing to a ‘must run’ status given to them by the government offering assurance of the government’s will towards energy transition.

The IEA 2020 report stated that companies developing clean energy innovation are likely to receive reductions in R&D budgets. The economic recovery plans being developed must provide opportunities that support clean energy jobs and accelerate technological progress. A recent CEEW analysis stated that 10 GW of additional integrated solar cell and module manufacturing could create 26,000 jobs. On the contrary, a ‘just’ energy transition is principle to ensure that India navigates its way through these difficult times prioritizing equity and welfare of its people.

Though the coal industry has its grave and dark side, it has been a source of government revenue for jobs and public services for years, which cannot merely be replaced by the renewable industry. Hence, this time serves as an excellent opportunity to start conversations of a just energy transition, that will eventually pave the way for India to recover sustainably from the bondage of problems we have been facing for years.

198,http://www.sarajevotimes.com/this-years-sdgs-award-trophy-is-made-from-recycled-plastic-and-3d-printed-by-unique-robot-arm/,"Sat, 03 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Sarajevo Times,This year’s SDG’s Award Trophy is 3D Printed and made from recycled Plastic,"New technologies are opening new horizons for humans. 3D printing technology has begun to revolutionize the way we produce physical objects of all sizes in the last few years. The range of items produced by 3D printing today is vast and continues to grow. We can 3D print anything: from boats and houses, to simple toys, clothing or tools. We can also use technology to produce musical instruments and even human body parts. Yes, you did read that right. The potential, it seems, is endless. The materials used for 3D printing are expanding and becoming more diverse, with growing attention on use of recycled materials.

Bosnia and Herzegovina is not lagging behind these world trends.

According to Emir Salkic, Sarajevo-based architect, “One man’s trash is another man’s treasure”, and he illustrates this with his work, where he uses recycled plastic to create various items through 3D printing.

For example, he uses 3D technology for architecture and furniture prototyping, as well as supports skills development among young people to use 3D printing.

This Sarajevo architect has always been interested in the potential of recycled PET plastic. Emir’s Future Station project envisages 3D printing of a public transport bus station from recycled plastic. His project became part of the Smart Sarajevo initiative, supported by UNDP. This initiative aims to bring the notion of the future cities closer to the residents, business and authorities and offers possibility to collectively re-imagine the city

Using 3D technology, Emir is creating this year’s SDG Business Pioneers Award trophy.

“This will not be a polished and shiny award. It will be made by a unique robot-arm-upgraded-to-3D-printer using recycled material and in the shape of the SDGs symbol” – says Emir, adding that the trophy will be unique as it will be “walking the talk” on applying sustainable development thinking in practice. The idea behind having 3D-printed SDG Pioneer Award trophies made from recycled plastic was inspired by the UNDP Accelerator Lab’s work on establishment of single-use plastic free workspaces.

Company that does the actual recycling of plastic into usable, 3D printable, material is Omorika-Pet, a company that was itself one of the finalists of the last years edition of SDG Business Pioneers Award.

It takes roughly 3.5 plastic bottles to create one SDG trophy, once the plastic from bottles is recycled.

Emir uses a robotic arm, which he named Eva, for 3D printing, but it can be used for many more things – on it can be mounted a drill, laser cutter, welder, grippers, water jet…","3D printing technology has begun to revolutionize the way we produce physical objects of all sizes in the last few years.

199,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/world-bank-shows-sdg-data-trends-with-interactive-atlas/,"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,World Bank Illustrates SDG Data Trends with Interactive Atlas,"The World Bank has released the 2020 edition of its SDG Atlas. This resource uses interactive storytelling and innovative data visualizations to expand understanding about indicators and trends for the 17 SDGs and selected targets. The Atlas introduces concepts to inform readers about how some of the SDGs are measured, and where data are available, it highlights information on the emerging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the indicators and trends.

A short overview of indicators, data and stories included in the Atlas is as follows:

In the chapter on SDG 1 (no poverty), a series of charts and graphs reviews progress and challenges in addressing extreme poverty. The Atlas concludes that, if poverty reduction trends remain unchanged, “some countries will take decades to eliminate extreme poverty” and, for “countries in Sub-Saharan Africa where poverty is declining, the median year in which extreme poverty might be eliminated is 2040.”

On SDG 2 (zero hunger), it indicates that, “after declining for a decade, the undernourished population is now rising. In 2019, more than 690 million people experienced hunger – an increase of nearly 60 million in 5 years.”

On SDG 3 (good health), in a discussion on Universal Health Coverage, the Atlas indicates that, according to estimates for 2015 (the most recent available), “90 million people have been pushed into extreme poverty (that is, below the international poverty line of $1.90 a day) because of spending on health.”

On SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), the Atlas includes photos from Gapminder’s Dollar Street project to illustrate the handwashing facilities at different household income levels in different countries. The Atlas also indicates that, in 2017, “about half of countries lacked data on access to safely managed water services and nearly 60 percent lacked data on access to safely managed sanitation services.”

On SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), the Atlas features nighttime satellite imagery to show artificial sources of light around the Earth and offers the user the ability to compare different locations with similar population densities, often illustrating striking inequality in access to electricity. Despite these dramatic inequalities, the Atlas highlights progress on this Goal, noting that “in 2018, 90 percent of the world’s population had access to electricity, up from 82 percent in 2008, and 63 percent had access to clean fuels and technology for cooking, up from 55 percent.”

On SDG 14 (life below water), for SDG indicator 14.5 (By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information), the Atlas notes that more than 16,000 marine protected areas have been established, covering 7.4 percent of the world’s ocean. An accompanying map identifies the distribution of these marine protected areas globally in 2020.

Where data are available, the Atlas highlights the emerging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the SDG. For example, on SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), the chapter includes a map of “stringency measures” around the world and a comparison of public spending on the economic crisis by rich countries and poor countries.

The Atlas draws from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators database and other data sources from scientists and researchers worldwide. It was released on 16 November 2020.

The 2018 edition of the World Bank SDG Atlas used over 1,400 World Development Indicators and data from up to 50 years ago. [Publication: Atlas of Sustainable Development Goals 2020] [World Bank Data Blog post about Atlas]","The World Bank has released the 2020 edition of its SDG Atlas.

200,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-updates-guidance-for-voluntary-national-sdg-reviews/,"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Updates Guidance for Voluntary National SDG Reviews,"The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) published a handbook for countries preparing voluntary national reviews (VNRs) in 2021. It provides practical information on steps that countries may take when preparing VNRs, presenting the VNR report to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), and following up after the HLPF.

VNRs are presented during the annual HLPF sessions convened under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). Conducted voluntarily by national governments, the reviews are intended to track progress in implementing the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs at the country level, and comprise part of the follow-up and review of the Agenda. Since 2016, 205 VNRs have been presented by 168 countries. For the 2021 session, 43 countries are expected to present a VNR.

The 2021 VNR handbook was released in November 2020 as an updated version of the 2020, 2019, and 2018 editions. The 2021 edition recommends that countries include a section on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on SDG implementation, measures undertaken to ensure a sustainable, green recovery, and impacts on VNR preparations.

The handbook notes that the ten countries conducting their first VNR will be allocated 30 minutes. These countries are: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Bolivia, Cuba, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Djibouti, Marshall Islands, Myanmar, Nicaragua, and San Marino.

The 33 countries presenting second and third VNRs will present them in a panel format with 20 minutes each during the three-day ministerial segment of the HLPF. Twenty-four countries are conducting their second reviews: Bahamas, Bhutan, Cabo Verde, Chad, China, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Germany, Iraq, Japan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Madagascar, Malaysia, Namibia, Norway, Pakistan, Paraguay, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, Tunisia, and Zimbabwe. Nine countries are conducting their third reviews: Azerbaijan, Colombia, Egypt, Guatemala, Indonesia, Mexico, Qatar, Sierra Leone, and Uruguay.

The handbook makes specific recommendations for countries preparing a VNR for the second or third time, including that countries should show progress made since their first VNR, and avoid repeating information presented in a previous VNR. The handbook encourages countries to address how they overcome challenges in SDG implementation and share lessons learned and good practices adopted.

On UN support for countries’ VNR preparations, the handbook notes that DESA is organizing three global workshops for working-level officials closely engaged in the national preparatory process, as follows:

October-November 2020: A virtual workshop to facilitate peer learning and exchange between countries conducting VNRs in 2021 and those that have previously carried out VNRs, as well as to cover key components of the preparatory process;

Spring 2021: In-depth exchanges on the preparation and presentation process, drafting sections of the VNR report, and presenting the VNR report; and

On 11 July 2021 in New York, US, a workshop covering final preparatory matters and addressing anticipated follow-up to the VNRs.

In addition, the five UN Regional Commissions are expected to organize workshops on the margins of their respective regional sustainable development fora to discuss regional specificities and lessons learned by previous VNR countries.

On deadlines, governments must submit main messages – the principal findings of the review – by 2 May 2021. The final VNR report is due on 11 June 2021.

The handbook concludes with suggestions for concrete follow-up steps after the HLPF. These include: presenting outcomes of the VNR presentation at the HLPF in a press conference; debriefing the VNR project team on the outcomes of the HLPF presentation; and sharing the VNR at the regional level. Further, the handbook suggests that countries promote concrete action on priorities contained in the VNR, such as through convening a cabinet meeting to consider VNR follow-up, and developing an action plan or road map that addresses the “who, what, where and when” of priority actions.

The 2021 HLPF is scheduled to convene from 6-15 July.

201,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/desa-synthesizes-messages-from-47-vnrs-presented-in-2020/,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,DESA Synthesizes Messages from 47 VNRs Presented in 2020,"The UN has released a synthesis report of the voluntary national reviews (VNRs) conducted in 2020. A total of 168 countries have presented VNR reports during the annual sessions of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) since 2016. In 2020, 47 countries did so, despite having to complete much of their reviews during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The ‘2020 Voluntary National Reviews Synthesis Report’ prepared by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) is the fifth such synthesis report of VNRs. Liu Zhenmin, head of DESA, writes in the foreword to the synthesis that the reports highlighted countries’ alternative approaches to preparing their VNRs when the COVID-19 pandemic hampered stakeholder engagement. The VNR reports were “open and candid” about challenges amid the pandemic, enabling others to learn from each country’s experiences. Liu also notes that despite limited evidence and data challenges, the majority of the 2020 VNRs incorporate data, and over half of all VNR reports presented since 2016 include a statistical annex.

The synthesis report outlines action and insights on each of the 17 SDGs, as reflected in the 2020 VNR reports.

On SDG 1 (no poverty), numerous countries said progress could be stalled or reversed amid the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On SDG 2 (zero hunger), the VNRs identified mechanisms to: support sustainable agricultural production through small-scale and family farmers; reduce land degradation; and conserve agricultural biodiversity.

On SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing), some countries reported a drop in maternal mortality rate and the mortality rate of children aged five and under. The prevalence of tuberculosis and malaria are also declining in some countries, but non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory disease, and cancer continue to rise in many areas.

On SDG 4 (quality education), countries emphasized the need for education policy to ensure inclusion, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, to reach marginalized groups.

On SDG 5 (gender equality), over half of the reporting countries described measures and policies to address violence against women and girls during the pandemic.

On SDG 6, countries reported increasing issues related to water scarcity – due to the effects of climate change – but said the pandemic has raised awareness of proper sanitation and hygiene practices.

On SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), countries reported on efforts to guarantee access to energy for all, promote electricity generation from renewable sources of energy, and phase out the use of fossil fuels.

On SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), several countries reported on use of artificial intelligence (AI), digitalization, and a digital economy.

On SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), countries reported progress in upgrading, diversifying, and greening infrastructure and industry. Reports also highlighted a focus on advancing digitalization and improving health infrastructure.

On SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), all countries’ VNRs addressed income inequalities. The majority reported this problem has remained largely the same or gotten worse.

On SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), many VNRs stressed the need to ensure housing quality and affordability, improve infrastructure, and reduce pollution.

On SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), VNRs highlighted sustainable food systems, sustainable lifestyles, sustainable public procurement, sustainable building and construction, sustainable tourism, and consumer information. They also stressed the implementation of the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production.

On SDG 13 (climate action), many reports described the impacts of climate change on agriculture, water, and human settlements, and stressed the importance of disaster risk preparedness.

On SDG 14 (life below water), the synthesis notes that a majority of VNRs dedicated a specific section to this goal, including several landlocked countries.

On SDG 15 (life on land), reports noted that many of the SDG 15 targets are far from being met, but progress has been made to increase protected areas, preserve wetlands, and increase forest coverage.

On SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), efforts to achieve progress toward SDG 16 were “widely reported” by the 2020 VNRs.

On SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals), reports noted that before the pandemic, several aspects were already challenged, such as mobilizing financial resources, the multilateral trading system, and data availability.

The VNRs are a central focus of the annual HLPF sessions held under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). In 2020, countries were given the option of livestreaming their presentation, sending pre-recorded presentations, or mixing these two options. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin produced a summary of the 47 VNRs, with links to the full documents. In May 2020, 48 countries were scheduled to present VNRs.

In September 2020, DESA released a synthesis of the 2020 VNRs with a specific focus on the reported impacts of COVID-19 in each country.

202,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/survey-finds-surge-in-private-investment-needed-for-sdg-achievement/,"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Survey Finds Surge in Private Investment Needed for SDG Achievement,"A survey of the world’s top 300 investment firms finds that investment is not going where it is needed to achieve the SDGs: only 20% of firms are aware of the SDGs and only 13% of their USD50 trillion of investment is linked to the SDGs. The survey explores how to close the emerging market sustainable investment gap to achieve strong returns and significant, positive impacts.

Between July and August 2020, Standard Chartered surveyed the world’s top investment firms, with combined total assets under management (AUM) of more than USD50 trillion. The results show that:

Almost two-thirds of respondents’ AUM are currently invested in Europe and North America;

Asia makes up 22% of AUM;

Only 10% is invested in the Middle East, Africa, and South America combined; and

Currently, 68% of respondents’ investments are related to SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), and SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure).

The company shared the findings in an interactive report titled, ‘The $50 Trillion Question,’ which argues that sustainable investment is gathering pace, as 81% of firms have moved beyond screening to a more integrated, focused approach to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment. However, this progress is not enough: SDG investment is “still trillions of dollars short of the capital needed to meet their 2030 target.” Further, the “vast proportion” of ESG strategies do not relate directly to meeting the SDGs; the report argues that conscious consideration on how impact can be delivered to meet the SDGs is critical for ESG investment to deliver on the 2030 Agenda.

The main barriers to emerging-market investment are reported to be: market volatility, bribery and corruption risk, government and interference in business, heightened political risk, and expected returns not justifying the increased use. On barriers to benchmarking investments against the SDGs, 55% of respondents said the SDGs are not relevant to mainstream investment, and 47% said that SDG investment is too difficult to measure. In addition, 66% said they do not make investments that contribute to the SDGs. At the same time, 50% responded that they plan to start measuring investments against the SDGs.

On tools and incentives, 63% of respondents said more SDG investment would be spurred by favorable tax treatment of SDG-linked investments, as well as more evidence that investing in SDGs will not lead to underperformance.

The report argues that the COVID-19 pandemic “has made the imperative to act even stronger.” The report suggests that the SDGs can become a strategic framework for simultaneously achieving returns and impact. According to 74% of investors surveyed, a green recovery that focuses on cutting carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions as part of a “build back better” approach is now a global priority. In addition, 61% said the COVID-19 crisis has encouraged their firm to direct investment towards a green recovery.

The report also features a section on how Standard Chartered is helping to close the SDG capital gap. In 2019, Standard Chartered launched the world’s first Sustainable Deposition, in which every dollar deposited is referenced against sustainable assets that support SDG delivery. Standard Chartered first highlighted the multi-trillion-dollar opportunity for private-sector investors to help achieve the SDGs in emerging markets in a report, ‘Opportunity 2020: The Standard Chartered SDG Investment Map.’ [Publication: The $50 Trillion Question] [Business Wire press release]","The survey explores how to close the emerging market sustainable investment gap to achieve strong returns and significant, positive impacts.

OECD plans to launch an additional three reports at its upcoming roundtable on cities and regions for the SDGs.In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors note that the SDGs provide “a long-term vision and an integrated framework to rethink the ‘new normal’ through the lens of sustainability” and to engage local stakeholders in co-creating more resilient cities and regions. The two pilot reports focus on Bonn, Germany, and Kópavogur, Iceland.

The Bonn report recommends considering the transport needs of a growing and elderly population when promoting public transportation to reduce air pollution.

The city of Bonn has linked its 2030 Sustainability Strategy with the SDGs to address key challenges faced by the city and to manage trade-offs across economic, social, and environmental policy outcomes. The report titled, ‘A Territorial Approach to the Sustainable Development Goals in Bonn, Germany,’ shares how Bonn plans to provide affordable housing (SDG 11), expand and maintain green spaces (SDG 11), shift to clean forms of energy and transport (SDGs 7 and 13), and provide employment opportunities for all (SDG 8), particularly low-skilled workers (SDG 4). It reports that Bonn’s City Council declared a climate emergency in July 2019, and in November 2019 adopted a resolution to make Bonn climate-neutral by 2035.

The report recommends key actions to make the most of a territorial approach to the SDGs in Bonn, including:

Using the SDGs to strengthen the link between the climate agenda and the social and economic dimensions of sustainability, such as by managing the trade-offs between providing additional affordable housing and maintaining and developing green spaces, and by considering the transport needs of a growing and elderly population when designing measures to promote public transportation to reduce air pollution;

Continuing efforts to mainstream the SDGs in budgeting processes to ensure resource allocation to implement the Sustainability Strategy and the 2030 Agenda and to ensure policy continuity across political cycles;

Developing actionable, evidence-based guidance for policy decisions, building on Bonn’s sustainability reporting and OECD data on the city’s distance from the SDG targets;

Better leveraging the potential of the private sector to contribute to the SDGs; and

Fostering direct involvement of cities and municipalities in national processes for implementing, measuring and reporting on the SDGs.

Kópavogur, Iceland, has a high performance on many SDG targets, but progress on some environmental SDGs is hindered by car dependence and per capita municipal waste. The report titled, ‘A territorial approach to the Sustainable Development Goals in Kópavogur, Iceland,’ provides guidance on how the SDGs can help to address these and other challenges through an integrated approach. Specific recommendations include using the SDGs as a tool for public service motivation to attract new staff, creating a national-level Task Force to strengthen vertical SDG coordination, and using the SDGs as a budgeting tool to prioritize resources allocated to the strategic plans supporting the implementation of the local strategy.

The Third OECD Roundtable on Cities and Regions for the SDGs will convene from 16-17 November 2020, co-organized by the OECD and the County of Viken, Norway. It will focus on the theme, ‘A Territorial Approach to the SDGs as a framework for long-term COVID-19 recovery strategies in cities and regions.’ Participants will discuss how the SDGs can help cities and regions shape and implement COVID-19 recovery strategies by sharing lessons, considering how to harmonize SDG measurement frameworks, and building on the OECD localized indicator framework, which measures the distance to the SDG targets for over 600 regions and 600 cities.

One session will discuss a policy brief titled, ‘OECD Policy Responses to COVID-19 in cities,’ that shares ten lessons for building back better in cities, related to clean mobility, public spaces, and circular economy, among other areas. Also during the roundtable, OECD will launch three additional reports on a territorial approach to the SDGs, focusing on Flanders, Southern Denmark, and Viken.

204,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/webinar-explores-role-of-voluntary-sustainability-standards-in-achieving-sdgs/,"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Webinar Explores Role of Voluntary Sustainability Standards in Achieving SDGs,"The International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) and the University of Geneva’s Faculty of Law organized a webinar to explore how voluntary sustainability standards (VSS) across a range of commodities could be integrated into trade agreements, market access regulations, export promotion measures, and procurement policy to advance sustainability goals.

Part of a joint series on trade and sustainability, the 10 November webinar focused on the theme, ‘Voluntary Sustainability Standards, Public Procurement, and Trade Policy: Trends, Challenges, and Development Implications.’ Participants also discussed the implications of integrating such standards into trade policy, in particular for developing countries and least developed countries (LDCs).

Cristina Larrea, Lead, Sustainability Standards, IISD, moderated the discussion. She said the webinar built on a report titled, ‘Scaling up VSS through Sustainable Public Procurement and Trade Policy,’ produced by the UN Forum on Sustainability Standards (UNFSS), in collaboration with the University of Leuven (Belgium).

Larrea defined VSS as initiatives that support industry actors in making informed decisions to advance sustainability, and highlighted that while not mandatory, VSS can act as de facto requirements. She noted that according to IISD’s Global Market Report, VSS-compliant production in commodities such as cocoa, cotton, coffee, and palm oil, grew between 2008-2018, reaching an estimated 20-30% of total production volume.

Santiago Fernandez de Cordoba, UNFSS, outlined the role of VSS as a tool to transform the way we are producing, consuming, and trading. He said UNFSS aims to harness VSS’ potential to achieve the SDGs by: facilitating developing countries’ access to global markets, stimulating well-informed dialogue among stakeholders, and elevating capacities for producers, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and exporters who can be marginalized by VSS in global trade.

De Cordoba highlighted five proposals to integrate VSS into public policy:

Enhance national capacity;

Incorporate VSS within the trade regime by using the Standard International Trade Classification;

Avoid proliferation of VSS systems through mutual recognition mechanisms;

Curb over-certification; and

Conduct policy dialogue on the benefits of scaling up VSS.

Axel Marx, University of Leuven, highlighted the role of governments in facilitating the adoption and use of VSS through sustainable public procurement (SPP) to drive sustainable development. He recommended that in their efforts to integrate VSS in SPP, government buyers prioritize credible VSS over non-credible ones. Marx pointed to the emergence of VSS references in free trade agreements (FTAs), and said governments could use VSS as a conditionality in market regulation and export promotion.

Liesbeth Casier, Policy Advisor, IISD, said in order to ensure that VSS deliver on their full potential for SPP, it is important to address implementation, procurement agencies’ ability to determine what is sustainable, and compliance verification, among other issues. She underscored the need to ensure that “sustainability does not become a burden” and that public policy for VSS does not “crowd out” SMEs, which are crucial for job creation. Casier said governments can take complementary actions to ensure that SMEs have access to the SPP market by using e-procurement systems and introducing quotas for contracts to be awarded to SMEs, among other actions.

Nathalie Bernasconi-Osterwalder, Senior Director, Economic Law and Policy, IISD, highlighted that while “trade and environment discussions are picking up again,” including in the World Trade Organization (WTO), and FTAs increasingly incorporate environmental provisions, few contain references to VSS. She highlighted the planned Agreement on Climate Change, Trade and Sustainability (ACCTS), where VSS encourage the promotion and application of ecolabels that are transparent in their criteria and meaningful for consumers. Bernasconi-Osterwalder warned that costly labeling and certification measures may cause developing country producers to lose market access, and recommended that countries undertake ex ante impact assessments of FTAs.

Responding to questions from the audience, participants discussed regulatory versus non-regulatory aspects of VSS, the benefits of mutual recognition between VSS, the need for multiple VSS labels to prevent monopolies, and the role of complementary policies in ensuring that VSS do not marginalize developing countries and SMEs.

In closing, Makane Moïse Mbengue, Professor of International Law, University of Geneva, stressed the importance of cooperation on enhancing developing countries’ capacities to ensure that VSS help them achieve the SDGs.

205,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/wto-members-mull-easing-restrictions-on-humanitarian-food-aid/,"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: WTO Members Mull Easing Restrictions on Humanitarian Food Aid,"Negotiators at the World Trade Organization (WTO) are considering a proposal from Singapore that would ensure humanitarian food aid is exempt from export prohibitions and restrictions, ahead of the trade body’s General Council meeting on 16 December.

Proponents say the move will make it faster and easier for the World Food Program (WFP) to provide urgently-needed assistance to save the lives of people in crisis situations – and ensure that trade rules support progress towards SDG 2, which commits governments to ending hunger and malnutrition.

The move follows a declaration by agriculture ministers from the Group of 20 (G20) on 21 April, reaffirming their agreement to exempt from export restrictions food bought for humanitarian purposes by the WFP.

After a wave of food price spikes in the late 2000s, G20 leaders made a similar statement at their Cannes summit in November 2011 – although disagreement among WTO members prevented the trade body adopting an agreement on the issue at its ministerial conference in Geneva one month later.

This year, the issue has again risen up the trade agenda as several countries initially responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by restricting food exports, raising concern that poor consumers in net food-importing countries would face difficulties in accessing food. Although many such measures have since been lifted, WFP staff told an informal WTO meeting on 10 November that the organization had faced difficulties procuring humanitarian aid in the new market and policy environment.

With the WFP now set to receive the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its work to combat hunger, especially in conflict-affected areas, trade officials acknowledged that there was increased awareness of the agency’s work, and a stronger determination among WTO members to support it. “It would be a good moment for the WTO to deliver”, one developing country trade official told IISD.

Growing momentum

Around 30 countries would be willing to co-sponsor Singapore’s initiative, which would take the form of a General Council decision, trade sources told IISD. Furthermore, as many as 50 members are believed to have expressed support for the move. Countries in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and the Pacific are among those co-sponsoring the proposal, including those which are recipients of food aid.

Support is also spread across different world regions and negotiating coalitions, including both exporting and importing countries, and those classed as developed, developing, and least developed countries (LDCs) at the WTO.

On 23 November, a virtual ministerial meeting of the cross-regional Ottawa Group of trade ministers discussed the proposal and “agreed to encourage” its adoption by the wider WTO membership, according to a press release issued after the event. The meeting was convened by Canada’s Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade, Mary Ng.

Sources told IISD that the EU is also consulting internally on the proposal, while the US has spoken in support of the move, and China voiced cautious support. The LDCs are reportedly also in favor, along with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group, although some countries in the group are seeking to address the concern that food aid procurement could exacerbate domestic shortages. India is the only WTO member to express objections to the proposal in its current form, trade officials said.

However, negotiators said some countries’ concerns may have been allayed by the WFP’s presentation for WTO members, which emphasized the agency’s “do no harm” principle underlying its procurement policy. WFP Chief Economist Arif Husain outlined the steps the organization took to support food security through its food purchases, as well as describing the obstacles which food export restrictions create for the safe, timely, and efficient delivery of humanitarian aid.

Both rice and maize procurement had both been affected by export restrictions, Husain said. In the case of maize, procurement costs were higher, and deliveries took two to three times longer, resulting in the loss of at least 3.9 million meals. In the case of rice, food aid to West Africa was delayed by at least one month, and rice procurement prices rose by 20 percent.

WFP Executive Director David Beasley has also spoken out in support of the initiative, telling a meeting of the agency’s Executive Board in November that the proposal “will help us save both money and time in reaching the most destitute.” He asked Board members to urge their governments to support the exemption.

Seven issues

The topic of export restrictions is one of seven issues on the agenda of the WTO agriculture committee’s negotiating body. Members are also discussing: domestic support to the farm sector; the issue of public food stockholding; market access issues, such as tariffs and other border measures; a “special safeguard mechanism” for developing countries; export competition, including export subsidies and comparable measures; and cotton.

The chair of the WTO agriculture negotiations, Costa Rica’s Ambassador Gloria Abraham Peralta, has asked facilitators to support her efforts to identify potential areas of consensus on the seven negotiating issues. Leonardo Rocha Bento (Brazil) is facilitating the talks on export restrictions, and, alongside other facilitators, reported back on his discussions to date at the 10 November meeting.

Most members consider there is positive momentum towards a General Council, Rocha Bento told the meeting. However, there was less consensus around a separate question concerning how governments could best improve transparency when food export restrictions are imposed.

Prospects for progress

Rocha Bento is due to convene an informal meeting open to all WTO members on 26 November to hear their views on the issue and discuss possible ways forward.

Progress on WTO agriculture negotiations has been slowed by the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, negotiators said, with the postponement of the next WTO ministerial conference one factor affecting the dynamic in the talks. The transition to a new administration in the US and the delay in concluding the selection process for the new WTO Director-General have also affected the mood among members and the political context for the negotiations.

However, trade officials were at pains to emphasize that WFP food aid represents only a tiny fraction of total global trade in food – and that humanitarian principles, rather than traditional trade issues, were at stake. “We’re just trying to help WFP to do its life-saving work”, one supporter of the proposal told IISD.

The report titled, ‘Navigating the Nuances of Net-zero Targets,’ lauds the accelerating momentum for net-zero targets, noting that the number of net-zero pledges from cities, regions, and companies has about doubled since late 2019. In total, regions, cities, and companies with net-zero targets now represent over 880 million residents, 24.9 million employees, and 10 gigatons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

However, the report warns, nuances in target implementation approaches can determine the extent to which an actor’s target contributes to deep decarbonization. These nuances have implications for the additionality of the impact, the integrity of the actor’s claimed outcome, and the extent to which the approaches support or hinder efforts to solve decarbonization challenges.

The report categorizes the nuances according to whether they target the direct reduction of emissions, claim to neutralize emissions through offsetting, or support carbon dioxide (CO2) removal. For example, under the direct reduction of emissions category, the report highlights a broad range of approaches for claiming the neutralization of electricity-related emissions and for supporting the reduction of supply chain and out-of-boundary emissions.

The report analyzes the impacts of different types of renewable energy delivery approaches and the risks and opportunities associated with the claiming of offsets in the post-2020 global governance framework under the Paris Agreement on climate change.

As uncertainties persist related to methodologies for calculating the climate impact of CO2 removal, the report recommends that these methodologies not be considered as equivalent to direct GHG reductions in claiming neutralization and that actors specify targets for emission reductions and emission removals separately.

The report finds that transparency enables accountability, unraveling ambiguity to assist the public in understanding and encourage an actor’s ambition. As transparency enables constructive dialogue about challenges faced, it results in greater solution-oriented ambition than making net-zero claims based in opaque accounting practices, it notes. Conversely, non-transparent net-zero targets can mislead stakeholders about environmental impact, resulting in decisions and behavior that can cause an increase in GHG emissions.

The report concludes by listing ten criteria for net-zero target transparency, including recommendations to chart a decarbonization pathway with interim targets and to commit to a timeline to revise and ratchet ambition.

The NewClimate Institute supports research and implementation of international action against climate change by generating and sharing knowledge on international climate negotiations, tracking climate action, climate and development, climate finance, and carbon market mechanisms.

In the last year, countries including China, Japan, the EU, and the Republic of Korea, as well as close to 200 companies and the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance were among the actors to pledge or announce significant strides towards net-zero targets.

In a joint declaration the Banks pledge to align financing decisions with the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The Summit took place virtually from 9-12 November 2020. It was organized by the Government of France in support of the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement on climate change, which will be marked in December 2020. It was also envisioned as a key milestone ahead of the Glasgow Climate Change Conference (COP 26), the UN Biodiversity Conference (CBD COP15), and the Generation Equality Forum.

The organizers noted that public development banks provide the funding for large infrastructure projects in the energy sector, among others, and are key for redirecting finance from projects that rely on fossil fuels to lower-carbon projects. Public development banks make 10% of all global investments from public and private sources.

The banks issued a joint declaration pledging to increase their focus on the climate emergency. The signatories “commit to align our activities with the objectives of the Paris Agreement” and to support Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and long-term strategies to reach zero net emissions as early as possible. The Banks also “will mainstream resilience and adaptation in our strategies and operations and enhance action to fund the definition and implementation of national adaptation plans. We will help redirect private financial flows in support of low-carbon and climate-resilient sustainable development.”

Pledges also address: the energy transition; biodiversity, oceans, and nature; health; gender equality; digitalization; and leaving no one behind. The declaration highlights the need for a “global framework for SDG-compatible finance.” Further on SDG financing, it supports the convergence of practices towards “core standards” set out in the 2018 report of the G20 Eminent Persons Group on Global Financial Governance. The declaration cites instruments to shift more investment to sustainable assets, such as by using a shadow price of carbon and providing information on SDG reporting.

The declaration ends with a section on “the road ahead,” which notes that the second Finance in Common meeting will be convened in 2021 to take stock of the first initiatives and set up a method for monitoring progress on the declaration.

Marcos Neto, UN Development Programme (UNDP), said that building on the pledge, the governments that fund each public development bank must ensure their mandates tie lending practices to lower emissions.

Before the Summit, a group of European development banks issued a separate pledge to phase out fossil fuel investments, and said they will work towards a stronger position on investment in coal in time for COP 26.

The report finds that rapid breakthroughs in the areas of energy, industry, transport, human settlements, ocean and coastal zones, water, nature-based solutions and land use, and climate resilience are approaching “the tipping points necessary to reach zero emissions by 2050.”

The ‘Climate Action Pathways’ seek to provide a “blueprint” to coordinate climate action by cities, regions, businesses, and investors in the runup to the Glasgow Climate Change Conference in November 2021. The pathways identify the near- and long-term milestones for limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels in each of the eight sectors considered. They provide an overview of “synergies and interlinkages across the thematic and cross-cutting areas that assist all actors to take an integrated approach.”

As an example, the transformational actions and milestones needed to achieve zero-carbon economy for ocean and coastal zones include:

Overfishing and destructive fishing practices are ended by 2021, and science-based management is implemented to restore fish stocks in the shortest time possible;

30% of fully and highly protected marine protected areas are designated and implemented by 2030;

Resilience and adaptive capacity of ocean-dependent coastal communities (fisheries and aquaculture) are increased, and vulnerability assessments are conducted by 2025; and

Stable market of zero-carbon fuels is ensured by 2030.

Speaking at the launch, High-Level Climate Champion Gonzalo Muñoz (Chile) underscored the need for “a major transition, from where we are today to where we need to be by 2050” to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. “[I]t is vital that we have a clear map of the route ahead,” he said.

The Climate Action Pathways, which complement the Yearbook of Global Climate Action, were unveiled during the Race to Zero Dialogues, running from 9-19 November 2020. The dialogues aim to explore ways to drive the systems’ transformations needed to mitigate climate change and build resilience to its impacts.

Led by the UNFCCC High-Level Climate Champions, the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action supports implementation of the Paris Agreement by promoting collaboration between governments and cities, regions, businesses, and investors.

The 2020 Leaders’ Summit focused on the theme, ‘Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All by Empowering People, Safeguarding the Planet, and Shaping New Frontiers.’

The ‘G20 Riyadh Summit’ convened virtually from 21-22 November. The Saudi G20 Presidency focused on issues including structural inequalities and debt repayments at a time when resources are needed to address the pandemic and ensure sustainable development.

In the Leaders’ Declaration, the G20 Leaders commit to leading the world in shaping a “strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive post-COVID-19 era,” and emphasize the importance of “coordinated global action, solidarity and multilateral cooperation” to overcome current challenges and realize opportunities for all by “empowering people, safeguarding the planet and shaping new frontiers.” The Declaration focuses on four areas:

rising to the challenge together to address the pandemic, including through implementing the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) and endorsing the Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the DSSI;

building a resilient and long-lasting recovery, including points on health, trade and investment, and other financial topics;

ensuring an inclusive recovery that tackles inequalities, including points related to sustainable development, access to opportunities, employment, women’s empowerment, education, tourism, and migration and forced displacement; and

ensuring a sustainable future, through work on environment, energy and climate, agriculture, and water.

A G20 press release notes that the G20 DSSI will provide the poorest and most vulnerable countries with “urgent and immediate liquidity relief from official bilateral creditors.” The Initiative provides USD 14 billion in 2020 to tackle the pandemic and its economic and social impacts. In addition, multilateral development banks (MDBs) are working to provide US 75 billion to DSSI-eligible countries between April and December 2020, as part of a broader USD 230 billion package for low-income and emerging countries. According to the release, G20 countries have also provided USD 21 billion to enhance pandemic preparedness and response, and over USD 1 trillion to support the global economy.

On building a resilient and long-lasting recovery, leaders addressed, inter alia:

the importance of tackling health and global pandemic preparedness, prevention, detection and response and achieving universal health coverage (UHC), and tackling antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and zoonotic diseases based on a One Health approach;

trade and investment, including endorsing the G20 Actions to Support World Trade and Investment on the Future of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and recognizing the contribution of the Riyadh Initiative on the Future of the WTO in allowing an additional opportunity to discuss and reaffirm the objectives and principles of the multilateral trading system (MTS) and to demonstrate ongoing political support for WTO reform. Leaders further recognize the need to increase the sustainability and resilience of supply chains to foster the integration of developing and least developed countries (LDCs) into the trading system and to promote inclusive economic growth, including through increased participation of micro-, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in international trade and investment;

transportation and travel, including ensuring that global transportation routes and supply chains remain open, safe and secure;

international finance architecture, including a commitment to continue the process of International Monetary Fund (IMF) governance reform and an invitation to the IMF to prepare an analysis of external financing needs in low-income developing countries in future years, outlining sustainable options;

financial sector issues, such as a commitment to the Financial Stability Board’s principles underpinning national and international responses to COVID-19 and a work plan to improve the resilience of the non-bank financial sector;

digital economy, recognizing that universal, affordable, and secure connectivity is a key enabler for the digital economy and a catalyst for inclusive growth, sustainable development, and innovation;

international taxation; and

anti-corruption, including welcoming the first G20 Anti-Corruption Ministerial Meeting and endorsing the G20 Call to Action on Corruption and COVID-19.

On ensuring a sustainable future, leaders committed to safeguarding the planet and building a more environmentally sustainable and inclusive future for all, including through conserving the marine and terrestrial environment in advance of the upcoming 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Leaders launched the Global Coral Reef Research and Development Accelerator Platform to conserve coral reefs and the Global Initiative on Reducing Land Degradation and Enhancing Conservation of Terrestrial Habitats to prevent, halt, and reverse land degradation. They reaffirmed commitment to reduce marine plastic litter and to end illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Leaders further recognized the importance of expediting universal access to affordable and reliable energy for all, and endorsed the Circular Carib Economy Platform.

Signatories to the Paris Agreement on climate change reaffirmed their commitment to its full implementation, reflecting common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR) and respective capabilities.

Addressing the Summit, UN Secretary-General António Guterres outlined three key areas where G20 leadership is key to building an inclusive, sustainable, and resilient future:

halting the further spread of the pandemic;

He said we have a “moral obligation” to ensure that the trillions of dollars “we are borrowing from future generations” for COVID‑19 recovery “does not leave them burdened by a mountain of debt on a broken planet.”

In an address, WTO Deputy Director-General Alan Wolff identified three challenges facing WTO members: using trade to boost the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic; facilitating trade in essential medical products needed to treat the pandemic; and reforming institutions that govern global trade, including restoring the WTO’s deliberative and negotiating functions and providing binding dispute settlement. He said a trade finance initiative should be seen as an essential part of economic recovery, and urged the G20 to support WTO action on economic recovery, pandemic response, and WTO reform.

The G20 brings together some of the largest economies, amounting to around 85% of global gross domestic product (GDP), to discuss the most challenging socioeconomic global issues. The G20 consists of 19 countries and the EU.

Two proponent groups of WTO members launched initiatives to deepen discussions on sustainable development at the Organization.

The Trade and Environment Week took place from 16-20 November. As we note in our preview, it included meetings of the WTO Committee on Trade and Environment (CTE), a high-level session on the role of trade in promoting an environmentally sustainable and inclusive recovery from COVID-19, and a series of WTO member-led events and workshops, which explored “issues at the forefront of the trade and environment agenda,” showcased experiences in making global trade more sustainable, resilient, and inclusive, and exchanged ideas on what role trade and the WTO can play in “building back greener and better” from COVID-19.

The Week also featured two sessions organized by civil society. A panel convened by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) brought together stakeholder perspectives on trade, environment, and sustainable development. An event organized by Geneva Trade Platform, the UN Environment Programme’s (UNEP) Environment and Trade Hub, the Graduate Institute Geneva’s Global Governance Centre, and Chatham House’s Hoffmann Centre for Sustainable Resource Economy sought to identify priority areas for the trade and environment debate at the WTO.

The Week’s discussions provided an important impetus to the preparations for the 12th Ministerial Conference.

The Week kicked off with a CTE meeting where the EU introduced its European Green Deal, describing it as “a decisive action” “to transform the EU’s economy for a sustainable future” while leaving no one behind. The EU highlighted efforts to introduce a carbon border adjustment mechanism to manage the risk of “carbon leakage” to make up for situations where “climate action ambitions are not shared globally.” The EU is conducting assessments covering the measure’s various impacts and its legal feasibility in light of WTO rules, EU trade agreements, and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).

Canada, Colombia, India, Norway, Paraguay, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, the US, and Turkey offered comments on the European Green Deal, with several, including the US, expressing concerns over the carbon tax. Members called for the EU to ensure its initiatives comply with WTO rules and bilateral and regional agreements, recognize the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR), ensure costs are not solely born by producers, and maintain transparency in policy making, among other actions.

On 17 November, a group of WTO members launched “structured discussions on trade and environmental sustainability.” Its proponents intend “to collaborate, prioritize and advance discussions on trade and environmental sustainability” and involve interested WTO members and external stakeholders. The structured discussions will be based on a statement to the CTE by Australia, Canada, Chad, Chile, Costa Rica, the EU, the Gambia, Fiji, Iceland, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Liechtenstein, Maldives, Mexico, Moldova, Montenegro, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Norway, Senegal, Switzerland, Chinese Taipei, and the UK. It is supported by 49 members.

Another group of members launched an “open-ended informal dialogue” to promote a sustainable plastics economy. The informal dialogue aims to “explore how improved trade cooperation, within the rules and mechanisms of the WTO, could contribute to domestic, regional, and global efforts to reduce plastics pollution and transition to a more circular and environmentally sustainable global plastics economy.” Proponents of this process are Australia, Barbados, Canada, China, Fiji, Jamaica, and Morocco.

In addition, the SDG Knowledge Hub provided coverage of the following events convened during the WTO Trade and Environment Week:

The events sought to help inform the deliberations of the CTE, which reconvened on 20 November. Several members reported back on the events they had organized during the Trade and Environment Week. Chad Blackman, Ambassador of Barbados to the WTO and CTE Chair, expressed confidence that the Week’s discussions provided “an important impetus” to the Committee’s work and the preparations for the 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12).

Other updates and presentations heard by the CTE covered, among other issues:

Ongoing discussions among Costa Rica, Fiji, Iceland, New Zealand, Norway, and Switzerland relating to the Agreement on Climate Change, Trade and Sustainability (ACCTS), which is now in its third round of talks;

The Glasgow Climate Change Conference scheduled to take place from 1-12 November 2021, with the UK pledging to accelerate progress towards reaching the goals of the Paris Agreement;

Environmentally friendly coffee growing in Colombia;

Sustainable mechanized production systems for agriculture in Paraguay;

Manufacture of paper from bio-waste in Sri Lanka; and

Members’ trade-related environmental measures as reflected in their 2019 Trade Policy Reviews (TPRs) where the agriculture and energy sectors were found to have the highest number of such measures.

Convened by the UN Environment Program Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance brings together institutional investors committed to transitioning their investment portfolios to net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 and to aligning them with the the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1.5°C scenario.

The ‘Draft 2025 Target Setting Protocol’ lays out plans for reducing emissions, increasing investment in the net zero emissions transition, and enhancing influence on markets and government policy. The protocol gives alliance members the flexibility to employ a combination of approaches to achieve their unique decarbonization and engagement strategies.

There are profound changes and opportunities that will come from the net-zero economy.

Alliance members will set individual portfolio targets during the first quarter of 2021, resulting in emissions reductions between 16-29% per member by 2025 from 2019 levels. Targets are designed to be “transparent and unique” to fit individual institutions while allowing aggregated progress to be tracked and reported.

A UNEP FI press release highlights members’ dual goals of transitioning their investment portfolios to net zero GHG emissions by 2050, and achieving this through engaging on corporate action and public policies. Members do not seek to “engage in a divestment exercise,” rather they intend to engage with portfolio companies to assist them in adjusting their business models, UNEP FI notes.

“Reaching net-zero is not simply reducing emissions and carrying on with the business models of today,” said Günther Thallinger, Alliance Chair and Member of the Board of Management, Allianz SE. “There are profound changes and opportunities that will come from the net-zero economy,” he noted, highlighting “new business opportunities and strong wins for those who are ready to lead.”

The Protocol is available for comment for one month, from 13 October till 13 November.

Alliance members have also made commitments under other asset decarbonization initiatives, including the UN Global Compact Business Ambition for 1.5°C, the Science Based Targets Initiative for Financial Institutions (SBTIFI), the Paris Aligned Investing Initiative (PAII) of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), and the Investor Agenda Investor Climate Action Plans (ICAPs). The draft protocol builds on the Net Zero Investment Framework, a draft investor guide for achieving net zero emissions by 2050, launched by the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIPGG) in August 2020. The Framework was developed with 70 leading global investors representing USD 16 trillion in assets. [Publication: Draft 2025 Target Setting Protocol] [UNEP FI Press Release]

Launched ahead of World Cities Day 2020, the publication highlights the importance of local leaders and city governments in implementing the SDGs, and notes that VLRs are gaining in momentum.

‘Asia-Pacific Regional Guidelines on Voluntary Local Reviews’ was launched on 30 October 2020. The guidelines were developed by ESCAP and the Penang Platform for Sustainable Urbanisation (PPSU) in partnership with cities in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kiribati, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines, and Thailand.

In the report’s foreword, Stefanos Fotiou, ESCAP, and Norliza Hashim, PPSU, explain that by pursuing sustainable urbanization, cities can be “change agents” and help solve the climate crisis, unsustainable resource use, widespread inequality, discrimination and injustice. This is particularly true of Asia-Pacific cities, where most of the world’s urban population lives. They add that most of the global SDG indicators have an urban dimension, and about one-third of SDG indicators are measured at the local rather than national level. Therefore, the authors write, “any country serious about [achieving the SDGs] will find the path to sustainable development runs through its cities.”

The report notes that VLRs can help cities and regions to: localize the SDGs; demonstrate their capacity and commitments; rethink their planning process; better engage local communities to understand their needs; and get communities involved meaningfully in recovery strategies and long-term development efforts.

However, no specific template or official format exists for VLRs. The publication provides the first region-specific guidance on how to conduct a VLR and produce a report.

The guidelines build on existing resources to provide practical tools, checklists, and templates for conducting a VLR. The resources are designed to be complimentary with the respective country’s Voluntary National Review (VNR). The publication includes an overview of the VLRs produced already by several Asia-Pacific municipalities, including: Hamamatsu, Japan, which reviewed all 17 SDGs and has incorporated them into its 30-year development plan; Kitakyushu, Japan, which includes a focus on pollution abatement; and Shimokawa, Japan, highlighting extensive stakeholder engagement.

Observing World Cities Day 2020, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said “local action is the key” to rebuilding from the COVID-19 pandemic and engaging in the Decade of Action for the SDGs. He said that the pandemic response has brought the value of communities “into sharp focus…. Let us maintain this recognition of their value.”

UN-Habitat Executive Director Maimunah Mohd Sharif said the only way to achieve the SDGs is to create wider opportunities for communities to “network, co-create and finance their initiatives.” She said the value of communities “goes far beyond supporting emergency responses…. communities must be at the centre of designing their own, longer term solutions.”

Additional guidebooks launched in 2020 to help communities develop VLRs include:

‘State of Voluntary Local Reviews 2020: Local Action for Global Impact in Achieving the SDGs‘, a review of the publicly available VLRs as of February 2020 prepared by the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES);

‘European Handbook for SDG Voluntary Local Reviews,’ which provides examples of official and experimental indicators that municipalities can use to monitor local SDG implementation; and

‘Guidelines for Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs)’ in a VLR Series by United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) and the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat).

214,https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/323894/world-risk-poll-provides-compass-sdg-road-map.aspx,"Mon, 09 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Gallup Poll,World Risk Poll Provides a Compass for the SDG Road Map,"The 17 goals that make up the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) build on the earlier success of the Millennium Development Goals and provide a framework for policymakers and others to use to focus global development ambitions. The 169 targets and 231 unique indicators that quantify each of the 17 goals provide a multidimensional lens to view the development challenges that each of the goals tackles.

The SDG indicators are extensive, but the indicators themselves do not have a hierarchy. This makes it challenging for policymakers to determine what needs to be prioritized. The Lloyd's Register Foundation World Risk Poll offers a potential solution to this problem because it asks people directly to identify what's most important to them -- what their priorities are.

In 2019, the World Risk Poll asked people in 142 countries and areas the following open-ended question: ""In your own words, what is the greatest source of RISK TO YOUR SAFETY in your daily life?""

With road-related hazards topping the list, the World Risk Poll data clearly highlight the significance of SDG 11.2: ""By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety.""

Bar chart. In 2019, the World Risk Poll asked people in 142 countries and areas to name their biggest source of risk in their lives. Road-related injuries were mentioned most often.

Despite some of the successes of the World Health Organization's decade of action for road safety, road traffic injuries are still the leading cause of death among young people aged 5 to 29. The World Risk Poll reinforces calls for a second decade of action, to double down on activities to address this self-identified greatest global risk.

Although road safety is the most frequently given response to the ""greatest risk"" question, residents of countries that have the lowest numbers of road traffic fatality rates per hundred thousand are those most likely to report road safety as the greatest issue.

Bar chart. Percentage worldwide who name road-related hazards as the top risk to their daily lives, according to country income group and traffic fatality rates.

The individual country-level data provide insights into what underpins this apparent contradiction. Madagascar, the country with the lowest levels of road safety reported as the ""greatest risk,"" has 28.6 deaths attributable to road safety per 100,000, about six times greater than Finland, which -- at 4.7 per 100,000 -- is the country with the highest levels of road safety reported as the largest risk.

The prevalence of more-pressing risks to daily life in lower-income countries such as Madagascar helps explain why people in lower-income countries and territories were less likely to mention road-related risks than people in higher-income countries. People living in low-income economies often face extreme poverty, poor infrastructure and weak public services, all of which form relatively more immediate threats to safety in daily life than road- and traffic-related risks.

Therefore, these threats may overshadow road-related risks despite the statistics that show how many people are injured in road accidents. This is true in Madagascar, where crime and violence are the single-largest risks, with 30% of Malagasy mentioning them.

With 12% of people worldwide mentioning crime, violence or terrorism as their top risk, people in Madagascar are hardly alone in their concerns. It also illustrates why achieving SDG target 16.1, to ""significantly reduce all forms of violence and related deaths everywhere"" is so crucial, and why leaders need a laser focus on indicator 16.1.4 -- the proportion of the population that feels safe walking alone at night where they live.

Based on World Poll data that measure indicator 16.1.4, while Malagasy in 2019 were not the least likely in the world to say they feel safe walking alone at night where they live, they did rank 133rd out of 144 countries on this measure.

Implications

The United Nations' most recent progress report on its Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 maintains that, ""conflict, insecurity, weak institutions and limited access to justice"" remain threats to sustainable development. These threats have only been amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, further jeopardizing the world's admittedly slow progress toward achieving ""peaceful and inclusive"" societies.

If the SDGs are designed to be a road map to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all by 2030, the World Risk Poll provides a complementary compass of how to navigate safely toward that destination.","The Lloyd's Register Foundation World Risk Poll offers a potential solution to this problem because it asks people directly to identify what's most important to them -- what their priorities are.

The Forum convened in a virtual format from 11-13 November 2020.

Debates focused on the role multilateral action can play to enhance action in a number of areas, including: addressing challenges posed by climate change, new technologies, migration, and global inequalities; improving biodiversity governance; and strengthening South-South platforms. Dedicated sessions addressed, among other topics, drug policy and public health, conserving nature to avoid pandemics, city action towards a green and equitable recovery, supporting vulnerable populations during pandemics, and education in the post-COVID-19 era.

Addressing the Forum, UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for fully integrating climate and environmental action into stimulus packages to rebuild sustainable and inclusive economies and societies. He proposed three “lines of action” to put the world on a trajectory towards limiting the global average temperature rise to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels:

Mobilization of a “global coalition for carbon neutrality” in 2021 to “leap forward towards carbon neutrality,” while taking into account “the common but differentiated responsibilities of one and all”;

More preventive action, including through channeling more finance to adaptation; and

Enhancing private and public financing for climate action.

The Forum included the Finance in Common Summit where representatives from multilateral development banks (MDBs) explored pathways towards economic and social recovery while redoubling efforts to achieve the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change.

Private sector actors joined the business track of the Paris Peace Forum to improve the collective response and resilience to the pandemic, while reforming production and trade systems at the same time.

Several initiatives were launched during the Forum. The Ministerial Meeting of the Alliance for Multilateralism launched the ‘One Health’ High Level Expert Council, which will “aim to gather and disseminate reliable information on the links between human, animal, and environmental health in a context of biodiversity erosion.”

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) launched the OECD-UNDP Framework for SDG Aligned Finance to help public and private actors identify and prioritize investments that contribute to the SDGs.

Her portfolio features a variety of homes in a number of master-planned communities throughout California, and she’s been a member of the SDG team for two decades.

For the last two years she’s focused on Mariner’s Cove, a 7.5-acre master-planned community in Vallejo. Construction of the 175 single-family homes and two parks will begin next year.

“Re-establishing and expanding Vallejo’s connection to the waterfront was a major objective of the project,” she said. “There’s going to be even more public access, park space and amenities for everyone to enjoy. We worked closely with Gates Associates on how our housing designs integrated with their landscape and urban plan, with more accessibility to the waterfront through paseos and trails. Through the project’s view corridors you can see sailboats and the waterfront from several vantage points.”

Mastro holds extensive knowledge and experience in the fields of home design, project entitlements and construction documentation. Her methodical approach ensures her work gets delivered on-time and within the set budget. She’s an advisor to SDG’s project teams, providing guidance and direction to all of the firm’s project managers. Her diligent project management skills allow for trusted and enduring relationships with every client she serves.

She earned her degree in architecture at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and began her career as an intern with SDG Architects in 2000. Now she serves as a principal for the company, overseeing a plethora of projects related to residential design and development. Mastro also mentors up-and-coming designers through Professional Women in Building, a part of the Building Industry Association.

In this interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, Mastro talks about her favorite projects, how she stays organized and what she enjoys most about her work.

Q: What are some of your favorite projects you’ve worked on?

A: I’ve designed a variety of housing types in Northern California, including a big new waterfront project in Vallejo for Callahan Development. It’s called Mariner’s Cove and features 175 single-family townhouses and a pair of parks on 7.5 acres near the waterfront. The homes take advantage of their location close to the waterfront and the greenspace corridors. Homes next to paseos have direct access for taking walks or going to the ferry. The homes have garage access via alleyways so you have a really pleasing front-door entry off of paseos and pedestrian oriented streets. We’ve also stepped-back the homes so that they don’t feel tall and imposing next to pedestrian areas.The floor plan layouts, the detailing inside and out, the materials, everything has been designed for modern tastes and needs while also reflecting Vallejo’s neighborhoods and styles. We think Mariners Cove will fit in well and provide much needed housing and recreation space for the community.

Q: What else is in your portfolio?

Details Jennifer Mastro, principal, SDG Architects. Mastro started with the firm as an intern in 2000 and became a principal in 2015. Her portfolio includes homes at the Wilder Ranch community in Orinda and SummerHill Homes development in Mountain View. Most recently she's worked on designs for Mariner's Cove, a 7.5-acre waterfront community of 175 homes in Vallejo which will begin construction next year. Located east of Mt. Diablo in Brentwood, SDG Architects' portfolio includes residential, mixed-use, hospitality and commercial projects. The firm prides itself on sustainable, LEED-certified designs and has more than two decades of experience in the fields of master planning, community development and urban design. See More Collapse

A: We do a lot of homes for developers throughout California. One of our recent projects was Wilder Ranch in Orinda where we designed custom homes for that project. I also helped with the design of three separate projects for SummerHill Homes in Mountain View. These projects are all a learning experience. When we can work with the city and the builders collaboratively we can achieve a high level of design. It can be a little frustrating to get through the process with each city because it’s a learning experience. I’ve found projects turn out nicely when they require a high level of design from our builders.

Q: What’s one of your favorite parts of your job?

A: I enjoy working with different builders, taking a project through entitlement and getting to know each city and what they’re looking for in terms of architectural articulation. I myself enjoy the day-to-day aspects such as entitlements, which is the process where a design goes through the planning department. I’m also very fond of laying the floor plan out. You think a lot about how the home will be used and design it so that it is most beneficial to its owner.

Q: How do you stay organized?

A: I work to keep good notes, and remembering what each city and client might want as their standard keeps me organized. Notes, either handwritten or on the computer, play a major role in staying on task. We’re working on developing more tech-based solutions to stay organized. We have a database with our contacts and project specs, and the technology side makes the information available to everyone, which is especially helpful when you’re not working on-site.

Q: Are there any trends are you noticing about contemporary architecture?

A: I see us thinking more about the way people are living. There’s a big shift towards homes having offices or tech centers or smaller rooms that can be closed off. This is because people are working more from home or have kids who are doing remote learning. That seems to be the design trend of the moment. We have redone floor plans for a lot of our builders, so this might be more of a permanent thing. The most important thing is to listen to the client and learn what they’re trying to achieve.","Energetic, stylish and thoughtful, Jennifer Mastro proves on a daily basis why she’s an integral member of SDG Architects.

In an attempt to capture some progress and further focus the negotiations, the Chair of the WTO negotiating group in charge of fisheries talks, Ambassador Wills of Colombia, introduced a revised version of the draft consolidated text he had initially circulated to WTO Members in July. The text, however, was not discussed in detail by negotiators.

Delegations also considered a range of pending issues to narrow down differences, including: the duration of a possible subsidy prohibition for actors engaged in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing; unassessed stocks; dispute settlement and remedies; and special and differential treatment for developing countries. Gaps between WTO members’ positions, however, remain significant on a number of key topics.

A number of new proposals were also presented last week. These include a proposal from the Philippines on dispute settlement in cases where territoriality is disputed; a “discussion text” from Chinese Taipei on dispute settlement procedures; and a proposal from four landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) – Afghanistan, Mongolia, Nepal, and Paraguay – concerning transit transportation of fish and technical assistance. A new proposal by Brazil proposing quantitative limits to the total amounts of subsides WTO member would be allowed to disburse was discussed intersessionally between the two last meeting clusters.

While progress has been achieved in negotiations in recent months, delegates and observers alike warn that clinching a deal by the talks’ 2020 deadline enshrined in SDG target 14.6 will require a quick and significant intensification of negotiations. Last week, a group of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) launched a global campaign titled, ‘Stop Funding Overfishing,’ to support the conclusion of a meaningful WTO agreement by the end of the year. The campaign’s policy statement, which has been signed by 169 organizations from around the world, including leading environmental NGOs, such as WWF, Greenpeace, Oceana, and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), calls on governments around the world to “fulfil their commitment to curb the public money that supports overfishing and degrades our ocean.”

The last meeting cluster of 2020 is planned for the week starting on 30 November.

A Step Forward

The revised draft consolidated text presented last week updates the first version of the draft consolidated text presented by the negotiations’ Chair on 25 June 2020. All WTO members accepted this text as a basis for further discussion, a step that was widely perceived as a significant sign of progress. For the first time in more than a decade, negotiators are focusing on one single negotiating document and proposing amendments to it based on common concepts.

Most key delegations have also reportedly started to think in terms of possible options for compromise and flexibilities. While this has not led to tangible headway in terms of substance yet, this change of dynamics is perceived as a necessary step towards concluding a deal.

The revised draft consolidated text presented by the Chair last week is an attempt to move in that direction. It contains a number of revisions of varying degrees of importance as well as a number of additions, in particular to replace some of the placeholders that were included in the first version of the text.

“I am confident that all delegations will find things to like in the changes that I am proposing, and that this revision thus will represent a step forward in the evolution of our work toward that full consensus,” the Chair said when introducing the document, according to the WTO Secretariat.

What’s in the Revised Draft Consolidated Text?

In essence, WTO negotiators are currently considering new subsidy disciplines in three substantive areas: (1) subsides to IUU fishing; (2) subsidies to the fishing of stocks that are already in an overfished condition; and (3) subsidies that contribute to overfishing and overcapacity more broadly.

No major changes were introduced in the new text regarding the rules related to IUU fishing and overfished stocks. In the case of IUU fishing, the most notable revision is simplification of the language that describes the conditions a determination of IUU fishing would have to meet in order to trigger a prohibition to subsidise a vessel or operator. The revised text states that an IUU finding would need to be based on positive evidence and follow due process, without specifying the steps required.

The most significant modification concerns the possible qualitative prohibition of subsidies that contribute to overfishing and overcapacity. The previous version of the text stated that subsidies that reduce the operating costs and capital costs of fishing would be prohibited in specific situations where fishing capacity or effort is excessive. The revised text simply lists a number of subsidy types that would be prohibited, including subsidies for fuel, boat construction and modernization, or price support.

This simplification increases the potential reach of the prohibition, but is closely linked to another change made to an exception to this rule. To benefit from this revised exception and continue to provide subsidies, WTO members would need to show that they implement measures to maintain relevant stocks at sustainable levels. The revised exception drops the requirement that such fisheries management measures be effective, meaning that it would likely be easier for members to invoke the exception to continue to subsidize fishing.

In order to clarify which marine species the proposed agreement would apply to, the revised text also introduces a definition of “fish,” which, like other key definitions, has been taken from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) Agreement on Port State Measures. This constitutes an attempt by the Chair to move forward on an issue some members feel required a disproportionate amount of time during the previous meeting cluster in October.

The Chair also proposed new text to replace three placeholders relating to: transparency and notification requirements, with specific information to be notified still to be defined; institutional arrangements; and dispute settlement.

Finally, the revised Chair’s text includes a new exception for subsidies for disaster relief – a general idea around which there seemed to be convergence during the October meeting cluster – under certain conditions.

Quick Intensification Needed to Meet 2020 Deadline

Despite positive signs in the dynamics of fisheries talks in recent months, significant efforts will be needed from delegations to overcome their differences on various parts of the disciplines. Recent work by IISD highlights that a number of important decisions will need to be made by WTO members in order to successfully reach an agreement.

One of the key questions for negotiators relates to the issue of special and differential treatment (S&D) for developing countries, a notoriously sensitive topic in the context of WTO negotiations. The topic is underlined in the negotiations’ mandate and in SDG target 14.6, which specifies that “appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries should be an integral part of the World Trade Organization fisheries subsidies negotiation.”

Last week’s cluster of meetings highlighted the divergence of views on this topic. Ambassador Didier Chambovey of Switzerland, recently appointed “Friend of the Chair” to facilitate S&D discussions, said members’ positions remain “quite far apart.”

While some members would like S&D provisions to exempt developing countries from parts of the main subsidy prohibitions, others think that new disciplines should instead provide only for transition periods and technical assistance for implementation. Ambassador Chambovey called on delegations to be pragmatic, creative, and flexible to find acceptable solutions that could gather consensus.

With only weeks before the start of the last meeting cluster on fisheries subsidies in 2020, S&D is only one of the numerous questions still outstanding in WTO fisheries talks. To be able to clinch a deal by the 2020 deadline, WTO members will need to intensify efforts in the coming weeks and to demonstrate they have the political will to reach compromise on these various issues.

Introduction

The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is a subregional forum established in 1997. The member states include five from South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka), and two from Southeast Asia (Myanmar and Thailand). The 4th BIMSTEC summit in 2018[1] identified 14 pillars of cooperation, including agriculture, public health, poverty alleviation, and climate change. It also called for intensifying cooperation towards attaining food and nutrition security in the region.

All of the BIMSTEC countries are categorised as either low- or middle-income. The majority of the poor in these countries live in rural areas, lack formal education, and are often employed in the agricultural sector. Large populations in these countries continue to lack adequate access to education, healthcare, electricity, sanitation, and clean drinking water,[2] and have low levels of nutrition and overall health. Indeed, by 2018 data, more than half of all stunted children under the age of five live in Asia.[3],[4] South Asian countries, overall, account for 36 percent of those living in extreme poverty in the world and suffer from various other deprivations and development gaps.[5] Twelve percent of the Asian region’s population, or 490 million people, are undernourished, most of them from South Asia.[6] Given that South Asia is home to these large populations of the global poor, achieving the global SDGs becomes an impossible task without progress in the region.[7]

In 2015, all United Nations member states adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)[8] which are especially relevant for South Asian countries whose development challenges are daunting. The Joint Statement of the first BIMSTEC Ministerial meeting held in 2019[9] reiterated these goals, noting that “agricultural cooperation among BIMSTEC Member States can contribute to food and nutritional security, farmers’ prosperity, job creation, poverty alleviation and enhanced agricultural trade and investment.”

This paper makes an assessment of the progress (or lack of it) that the BIMSTEC states have achieved in reducing poverty, and promoting food security and nutrition outcomes. It outlines the nutrition policies of these countries and explores the opportunities that they have in meeting, in particular, the SDG on Zero Hunger.

Poverty, Food Security and Nutrition

Across the world, those who live in poverty suffer from food insecurity, and lack of education, healthcare, and other essential needs.[10] The World Bank estimates that 40 to 60 million people will fall into extreme poverty in 2020, with incomes under US$1.90 per day.[11] The global poverty rate could rise to nine percent in 2020, or a 0.4-percent increase from 2019.[12] This is the result of various factors including the burgeoning global population and resulting scarcity of resources, as well as the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The first half of the 20th century saw a massive increase in the incidence of poverty across the globe, amidst both growth in industrialisation and a rise in population. Beginning in the 1970s to the end of the last century, poverty declined. In the years to come, however, analysts largely agree that continually increasing global population and climate change will reverse this pattern, and poverty will likely rise.[13] Indeed, South Asia’s contribution to the global poor has increased from 27 percent to 33 percent during the period 1990-2013, better only than Sub-Saharan Africa which accounts for the largest share, approximately 50 percent, of the global poor.[14] To be sure, in absolute numbers, the population of people living in poverty in South Asia decreased by 148.8 million during the same period of 1990-2013.[15] The poverty rate in the region, however, is still considerably higher (based on 2013 figures) than those of East Asia, the Pacific, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East, and North America.[16]

In Asia, a facet of poverty that has become magnified in recent years is its being highly urban. In several countries, the number of impoverished people has risen between the years of 1990 and 2008, just as these same countries were seeing an expansion of urbanisation; scholars call it the “urbanisation of poverty.”[a],[17] In most of developing Asia, such as in India, Bangladesh, and other BIMSTEC member countries, urbanisation has been accompanied by the growth of slums,[18] worsening living conditions, increasing food insecurity, and severe pollution risks. According to the UN-Habitat, Asia has 60 percent of the world’s slum population,[19] excluding the many more who live in slum-like conditions that are not officially categorised as such.

The BIMSTEC region remains among the poorest in the world. World Bank data[20] on Poverty Headcount Ratio[b] records a high of 25.2 in Nepal, followed by 24.8 and 24.3 in Myanmar and Bangladesh, respectively; India is at 21.9, Thailand, 9.9; Bhutan, 8.2; and Sri Lanka, 4.1. Per capita GDP is low and other socioeconomic indicators of poverty remain high. The combined domestic exports of BIMSTEC member states are worth US$2.7 trillion.[21] According to 2016 data, trade among member countries was worth US$69.7 billion.

As resources become even more scarce—and weather extremes like droughts and floods more frequent—BIMSTEC states have aimed their sustainable development initiatives at their poor populations and their heightening insecurity.[22] The following paragraphs outline the most salient nutrition outcomes and explain the prevalent nutrition inequities and their determinants in the BIMSTEC countries.[23]

Nutrition Outcomes

Figure 1. Malnutrition Burden in BIMSTEC Countries

Figure 1 shows stunting rates to be highest in India at 38 percent, followed by Bangladesh and Nepal (36 percent) and Bhutan and Myanmar at 34 and 29 percent, respectively. The lowest rate of stunting is Thailand’s 11 percent. Overall, the incidence of stunting in the region has declined over the years;[25] however, the countries have recorded different levels of performance. Only Bangladesh and Thailand seem on-course to meet the global targets[26] of 40-percent reduction in the number of stunted children under-five; for their part, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Sri Lanka have shown some progress.

Another indicator of malnutrition, wasting, is highest in India, and has not improved[27] for the past decades. Bangladesh (14 percent) and Sri Lanka (15 percent) also have higher rates of wasting compared to the developing country average of 8.9 percent. There has been some progress in Thailand, Bhutan, Myanmar, and Nepal in terms of achieving global targets of reducing childhood wasting at less than five percent.

Overweight in under-five children is also a cause of concern. Bhutan and Thailand, at eight percent of under-five children, have the highest incidence in the region. Thailand has recorded a reduction from 10.9 percent in 2012; And Bhutan increased from 4.4 to 7.6 percent from 2012 to 2016. Thailand, Nepal and Myanmar are on-track in meeting the global target of arresting overweight in under-fives.

Figure 2. Incidence of Anaemia and Underweight in Women (15-49 years)

Figure 2 shows a high prevalence of anaemia in women (15-49 years) in most of the BIMSTEC countries. India tops the list at 51 percent, followed by Myanmar (46 percent) and Bangladesh (40 percent). The other countries also record one-third of their 15-49-year-old women as anaemic. This is a cause of concern, as anaemia contributes to the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition and poverty. For one, maternal undernutrition and anaemia increases the risk of low birth weight (23 percent) and subsequent stunting or wasting in children.[29] Most of the countries in the region have performed poorly in reducing the prevalence of anaemia. Moreover, underweight in adult women is also prevalent and ranges from a high of 24 percent in India to eight percent in Thailand.

Maternity benefits are important for good health and nutrition for women after childbirth and also help promote exclusive breastfeeding. Most of the BIMSTEC countries[30] do provide for paid maternity leave to women working in the public sector, with some provisions for paternity leave or “breastfeeding breaks”. Unfortunately for the women in the private sector, this provision depends on the employer’s initiative.

Figure 3. Child Nutrition

The initiation of breastfeeding averages at 50 percent amongst the BIMSTEC countries except for Bhutan, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. When it comes to sustaining the breastfeeding practice, however, there is a decline as seen in Bhutan and Myanmar. Sri Lanka has the highest rate of exclusive breastfeeding at 82 percent. The delayed initiation of breastfeeding is associated with the socio-cultural practice of giving pre-lacteal feeds[32] in some South Asian nations: India (42 percent), Bangladesh (27 percent) and Nepal (26.5 percent). The minimum acceptable diet with food from 4+ food groups[c] and frequency is low for most of the countries: India (10 percent),[33] Myanmar[34] and Bhutan[35] at 16 percent each, Bangladesh[36] (23 percent), Nepal[37] (36 percent), and Thailand[38] (54 percent). The exception is recorded by Sri Lanka[39] at 80 percent. Sub-optimal feeding practices can increase risk of illness, leading to impaired growth and development. Improved education[40] on complementary feeding along with behavioural change is necessary to improve feeding practices.

Health Outcomes

Most of the BIMSTEC countries have low levels of health outcomes and have made little progress in the past decades. Health experts have come to refer to this as the “Asian Enigma” of undernutrition.[41]

Child Health: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand have all improved in their rankings of under-five mortality rates since 1990 (See Figure 4). In terms of health progress across all BIMSTEC countries since the time the forum was founded, all of them have succeeded in recording significant declines in their infant mortality rates. In 1990, Bangladesh had the highest infant mortality and Sri Lanka, the lowest. By 2015, Myanmar had the highest infant mortality rate; Sri Lanka remains the poorest performer in reducing infant mortality. The greatest progress has been seen in Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. Both India and Myanmar have gone from fourth and fifth rank, respectively, amongst BIMSTEC members in 1990, to being second and first in 2015.[42] Other indicators of child health include the infant mortality rate and neonatal mortality rate, and data shows marginal/slow progress in child deaths in both Myanmar and India. Bangladesh has made the greatest progress amongst BIMSTEC countries: from having the highest infant mortality rate in in 1990, to being fourth highest today.

Figure 4. Infant Mortality Rate (per 1,000 live births, 1990-2018)

Maternal Health: Across all seven BIMSTEC countries, there has been a steady decline in the maternal mortality rate (See Figure 5). Nepal[44] saw the greatest decline in maternal mortality from 553 per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 186/100,000 live births in 2017. Indeed, Nepal has taken vast strides in their healthcare delivery to prevent and treat the most important causes of child and maternal mortality though an array of community-based and federal approaches.[45] In 2000, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Myanmar had significantly higher rates of maternal mortality (56/100,000 live births) than Sri Lanka and Thailand (43/100,000 live births). The progress is likely because both Sri Lanka and Thailand have strengthened their primary healthcare delivery and pursued universal health coverage.[46] Overall, the gradual decline in maternal mortality across the BIMSTEC member states in the past two decades, indicates the level of growth and development in their healthcare delivery.

Figure 5: Maternal Mortality Ratio (per 100,000 live births, 2000-2017)

Water, Sanitation, Hygiene: In terms of sanitation, some BIMSTEC countries have made more significant progress than others (See Figure 6). India and Nepal have increased the percentage of people using at least basic sanitation services by 43 percent and 46 percent, respectively. Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Thailand have also made steady improvements in the proportion of their populations accessing basic sanitation services. Myanmar, however, has seen a regression. Myanmar’s health system is financed largely by the government. In the last couple of decades, public health expenditure as a percentage of GDP has increased by more than six times.[48]

Figure 6: Reach of Basic Sanitation Services (% of population, 2000-2017)

Tracking Progress on SDGs

The 17 SDGs and the 169 specific targets are particularly relevant for South Asia—after all, the region is home to a huge 36 percent[50] of the world’s impoverished, and nearly half of all undernourished children. With South Asian countries, including member states of BIMSTEC, holding such a weight on their shoulders, global progress on the SDGs cannot be achieved without success in the region. It is a difficult task, given that South Asia, and particularly India, failed to meet the predecessor Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Most recent available data suggest that the South Asian region, comprising the majority of BIMSTEC members, is far from being on-track in accomplishing the SDGs.[51]

Indeed, the fulfillment of these goals has little correlation with both levels of per capita income and degree of development, as seen in the case of India. As the largest and most diversified economy in the region, it unfortunately has recorded poorer performance compared to its fellow BIMSTEC members. Bhutan and Nepal, for example—both with lower levels of development than India—have achieved significantly greater progress towards the SDGs.[52] The only SDG which all BIMSTEC states appear to be on-track to achieving is the goal of eliminating poverty, the metric for which is living below a minuscule $1.90 per day.[53] In all other goals, all BIMSTEC countries have recorded moderate progress that is inadequate for meeting the goals by 2030. With the current rate of progress in the region, overall, 14 out of the 17 SDGs will be missed by the BIMSTEC countries by 2030.

The COVID-19 pandemic has only enhanced the risks of falling short. According to the Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020, the 15-year effort of people across the globe attempting to achieve the 17 SDGs was already off-track by the end of 2019.[54] Figure 7 shows the performance on the SDGs (out of 10) for BIMSTEC countries and their world rankings. Among the BIMSTEC countries, Thailand is the best performer with a score of 74.5; the poorest is India at 61.9.

Figure 7. Performance on SDGs for BIMSTEC Countries

The SDG 2[56] on Zero Hunger has seen the least progress since 2015, and COVID-19 is likely to cause a reversal of whatever achievements have been made so far by many countries across the globe. The reason for the slow progress is linked to the increase in people undernourished as well as overweight.[57] The pandemic is likely to increase the problem of food security and malnutrition in the low-income countries. Achieving SDG 2—or recording some progress, at least—has been a challenge in most of the BIMSTEC countries, with India contributing to the large number of undernourished. If India were to eradicate undernourishment, the world can come closer in achieving the target of zero hunger.

The COVID-19 pandemic has already taken a toll exceeding 500,000 lives; confirmed cases are at more than 10 million people.[58] The challenges posed by the pandemic are making it more difficult for the global community to succeed in achieving the SDGs by 2030.

Government Policies on Nutrition: An Overview

BIMSTEC states have adopted various policies to direct their nations on the path of achieving the SDGs. At a forum on sustainable development in October of 2018 held in Kathmandu, representatives of the BIMSTEC states agreed that achieving the SDGs by 2030 will require implementation action at the global, regional, national and local levels.[59] The polycentric approach of BIMSTEC involves both private and public stakeholders; the stakes are manifold, and covers the political, social, environmental, and economic domains.[60] Within this cooperative framework are policies and mandates that seek to pursue sustainable development. BIMSTEC’s mandate and goals are broad, with objectives looking at economic, technical, social and scientific sectors. Environmental challenges including climate change and environmental degradation are important in addressing poverty as these exacerbate the political, economic, and social tensions in the region. Improving food and agriculture[61] can have a substantial impact on the attainment of the other SDGs by strengthening economic growth, and combating climate change.

Some initiatives taken by the Bay of Bengal Association for Sustainable Development (BOBAS) work towards increasing economic activity in the Bay of Bengal in a sustainable manner.[62] BOBAS also offers itself as a platform for small entrepreneurs and innovators of the member states. The business models they share address issues like monitoring and surveillance of fishing, sustainable aquaculture, small-scale power projects along the Bay of Bengal coastline, and low-energy wastewater solutions.[63] Such attention to the environment is important as the Bay of Bengal, with its triangular shape, flat coastal terrain, and shallow depth, is an epicentre of the ‘World’s Hazard Belt’.

The following paragraphs describe the respective nutrition strategies that BIMSTEC states have adopted to improve food security for their people.

Nepal: In 2018, Nepal enacted the Multi-Sector Nutrition Plan-II, with the aim of improving maternal, adolescent, and child nutrition by scaling up essential nutrition interventions to improve nutritional status of under-five children, lower incidence of low birth weight, and reduce energy-deficiency in women.[64] Nepal scaled up multisector nutrition programmes across the country, developed campaigns to create positive nutrition behaviour among the people, and fostered cooperation in sharing best practices on improving nutrition. Data shows improvement in the nutritional aspects of the country: the prevalence of stunting and wasting among children under five has declined, and so has the incidence of low birth weights.[65]

Bhutan: The government of Bhutan articulates its development plans every five years. Currently on their 12th five-year plan, Bhutan aims to achieve 16 “national key result areas” that are based on regional and international commitments, including the UN SDGs.[66] Bhutan’s food and nutrition security policy, enacted in 2014, acknowledges the need for a multisectoral approach to ensuring nutrition security. In prioritising nutrition, the Bhutanese government established a national school and nutrition programme for addressing micronutrient deficiencies.

Bangladesh: Bangladesh enacted its National Nutrition Policy in 2015 with the goal of preventing and controlling malnutrition, and improving nutritional status especially of the women and children. The most common form of undernutrition in the country is stunting.[67] In response, the government has taken initiatives to mainstream nutrition into both public health and family planning services.[68] The National Nutrition Policy emphasises the goal of ensuring adequate nutrition for all demographic groups including children, women, pregnant women, men, and the elderly. By enhancing food security at the home-level and encouraging investment in nutrition-sensitive agriculture, the 2015 nutrition policy has provided necessary direction.

Sri Lanka: As a country in economic transition,[d] Sri Lanka is also undergoing a nutrition transition and faces a triple burden: overnutrition, undernutrition, and micronutrient deficiencies.[69] Interventions from the Sri Lankan government in addressing food insecurity have been ongoing since 1942 when it implemented a universal food subsidy scheme.[70] Since the UN adopted the 2030 SDGs, Sri Lanka has seen progress in their food insecurity issues through the Thriposha Program that was introduced long ago, in 1970. The food expenditure share of total household income expenditure in Sri Lanka has been steadily declining over the past five years with increases in household income. The overall provision of health infrastructure has improved the nutritional outcomes of Sri Lanka since 2015, and social welfare indicators illustrate the country’s impressive performance.[71]

Thailand: Since adopting the SDGs, Thailand has integrated a framework for food security in its policies with a National Food Safety and Nutrition plan. Even prior to the formulation of the SDGs, Thailand was already seeing a decline in undernourishment, parallel to its economic growth. From 1990 to 2012, GDP increased by 113 percent, and undernourishment dropped by 87 percent.[72] The government’s policy efforts have led Thailand to perform well in essential nutrition parameters such as reducing underweight and stunting. Amidst the achievements in decreasing hunger, however, another malnutrition issue has emerged, and that is of the prevalence of overweight. One-third of the adult population, and one-third of the child population, face overweight issues.[73]

India: India’s national nutrition strategy is critical if the country is to achieve the SDGs. High levels of maternal and child undernutrition have continued in India despite efforts from the government and legislators’ policy, plan and programme commitments. The National Nutrition Strategy, first adopted in 1993, has been committed to ensuring that every child, adolescent girl, and woman achieves optimum nutritional status.[74] In addition to the improvements seen in India’s overall nutritional status as a result of the national strategy, the Poshan Abhiyan programme (National Nutrition Mission) under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also been an effort in the right direction. The policy aims to set up an information and communications monitoring system in which the nutritional status of populations across the country could be tracked more efficiently.[75] While the intent of the policy is sound, the implementation poses a challenge to India, which is already falling behind in the SDGs amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

Myanmar: Myanmar is on-course to meet global targets for under-five underweight and exclusive breastfeeding for infants, but is still off-track in the other nutritional indicators.[76] Nutritional deficiencies as well as overweight and obesity issues are worsening in the country. The National Plan of Action for Food and Nutrition (NPAFN) was adopted by Myanmar with the goal of ensuring adequate access to food that is safe and well-balanced. By aiming for increased and diversified domestic food production, the promotion of healthy food, and the prevention of food-borne infectious diseases,[77] the NPAFN policy has helped Myanmar make great strides in attaining the SDGs.

Towards Food Security: Key Strategies

Despite the progress that has been achieved in advancing food security and alleviating poverty, the number of hungry people in the world continues to grow, reductions in child stunting remain insufficient, and obesity is on the rise.[78] The three principal sources for these undesirable trends are economic shocks, climate change, and interstate conflicts. These drivers are deeply complex and exacerbate poverty and malnutrition in many dimensions.

BIMSTEC’s platform—emphasising shared aspirations of growth, development, commerce and technology—enables the South Asian and Southeast Asian nations a level of regional connectivity that can enhance economic cooperation.[79] After all, economic slowdowns result in increased unemployment and decreased wages, and therefore pose massive challenges to access to food and essential social services especially for the poor.[80] Additionally, access to high-quality and nutritious food becomes more difficult, making bigger populations more susceptible to poor nutrition. Unfortunately, recent world economic reports highlight that there may soon be another massive economic downturn, with global growth being the slowest it has been since the global financial crisis a decade ago.[81] In order to protect the food status of populations that face economic shocks, policies and resilience capacities must be built.[82]

Trade policy also has substantial implications for nutritional outcomes in areas of food insecurity, as it has the potential to make healthy food available to populations and create demand for more nutritious food. However, with trade policy virtually never being concerned with nutritional outcomes or healthy diets, it often even contributes to forms of malnutrition. For example, the health impacts of changes in trade regarding food and agriculture are mixed and dependent on a multitude of factors, and foreign direct investment has been shown to be a driver in the growth of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption,[83] which has contributed to the global prevalence of overweight and obesity.

Multisectoral policies for reducing poverty must be addressed if the world is to bridge the social inequalities perpetuated by the direction of national and global economies. The physical availability of food is important, specifically through the promotion of marginal and small farmers’ productivity. Additionally, facilitating trade of food products increases the availability of food commodities at lower prices for poorer consumers.[84] Equally important is economic access to food. Social protection systems, work promotion programmes, support for poor farmers, and rural development programmes must be built as long-term strategies for increasing access to nutritional food for the poor populations.

Along with the fragility of the global economy and its detrimental impacts on global food security, climate change is also a key obstacle to the fulfillment of the SDGs. Climate change affects all four dimensions of food security: food availability, food accessibility, food utilisation, and food systems stability.[85] Populations who are already food-insecure will likely be the first to be severely affected by the consequences of climate change. The imperative is for governments to enact policies that will protect food security through climate adaptation measures. Beyond the policy level of the required change in order to achieve the SDGs, community-led initiatives can also play a vital role.

Nutrition and home gardens can improve food security. Nutritious, dense food like fruits and vegetables that can be produced at home are known to improve health and result in cognitive, behavioural, and physical benefits for both adolescents and adults.[86] Over the last century, there has been a growing interest in strengthening and intensifying local food production in order to avoid the adverse effects of global economic shocks and food price volatilities. Home gardens are a proven strategy to enhance household nutrition and food security in addition to them being an integral part of local food systems. Home gardens are part of the agricultural landscape of developing countries across the globe and have been useful throughout the centuries.[87]

The practical approaches available to combat food insecurity in the developing world and beyond are restricted to the existing social, political, and economic conditions along with the resources available for intervention. Food insecurity and economic hardships often force people to consume less and settle for food of low nutritional status. This leads to adverse health effects, due to the lack of basic micronutrients and other important vitamins and minerals; indeed, more than 35 percent of deaths worldwide are caused by factors attributed to nutritional deficits.[88] At-home food production of vegetables and fruits can address micronutrient deficiencies and improve the quality of diets by facilitating year-round production and availability of nutritious food.

Home gardens and community gardens do not only improve food diversity, availability, and overall health, but can also elevate the socioeconomic status of resource-poor families.[89] In a review of a number of case studies, Mitchell and Hanstad[90] assert that home gardens can contribute to the economic well-being of a household. Gardening activities can be developed into a small industry, and earnings from the sale of home garden products can lead to higher disposable incomes that can be used for other domestic purposes.[91]

Across the BIMSTEC countries, various studies have found that nutrition gardens are a sustainable model to enhance food security and diversity. A research study from Bangladesh, for example, has shown a 300 to 400-percent increase in the variety and quantity of fruits and vegetables among families who have kitchen gardens.[92] Another kitchen garden model in rural Bangladesh has resulted in reduced expenses on vegetables, improved intake of fruits and vegetables, and income generation.[93] School gardens in Nepal[94] and Bhutan[95] have been found to improve food preferences in children, bringing about behavioural changes. A study from Sri Lanka suggests that home gardens are a sustainable model to improve food security and the nutritional status of households.[96] Indian states like Odisha[97] and Gujarat[98] have utilised backyard spaces to grow seasonal fruits and vegetables—they have brought improved nutrition and economic conditions to the families.

India’s Reliance Nutrition Garden provides a specific example of how community-led nutrition gardens can help bridge the nutrition gap in rural households.[99] A huge 62 percent of rural households across India have met their vegetable requirements and reduced their spending on food because of their home gardens.

Conclusion

The BIMSTEC countries are not on-track to achieve the SDG of Zero Hunger by 2030. It was already evident, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, that many BIMSTEC nations were falling behind the targets set by the United Nations. The pandemic has further aggravated the situation and the number of people affected by hunger is projected to surpass 840 million by 2030.

There is hardly any doubt that achieving the SDGs will be a far-fetched goal without ending hunger and malnutrition. There is a need for sustainable and resilient food systems to achieve the goal of zero hunger. This can be achieved by comprehensive efforts to ensure food is available to all. There is a need for a renewed focus and innovative strategies to build capabilities both at the individual and community level.

An integrated approach is required in response to the diverse and interconnected causes of hunger and malnutrition. Countries can learn from each other’s successes and scalable models to ensure food systems that deliver improved nutrition and sustainable and resilient communities. As the UN has stated, “A sustainable food systems deliver food security and nutrition for all in such a way that the economic, social and environmental bases to generate food security and nutrition for future generations are not compromised.”[100] Investment in nutrition, along with a multisectoral approach that includes both nutrition-sensitive interventions (healthcare, water, sanitation) and nutrition-specific ones that empower women—will help end all forms of malnutrition in the long run.

“The global coronavirus pandemic, which has already caused unimaginable devastation and hardship, has brought our way of life to an almost complete halt,” he said. “The outbreak will have profound and lasting economic and social consequences in every corner of the globe.”

The Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, certainly seems to agree with Defoe (see below) that the world should now look on things with “differing eyes”.

“Another plague would remove the animosities among us, and bring us to see with differing eyes, than those which we looked on things with before.”

These are the words of Daniel Defoe in A Journal of the Plague Year, a vivid account of life in London in 1665 when bubonic plague wiped out 15 percent of the city’s population, and brought the economy of the whole of England to a standstill.

Many of those who didn’t die, lost their livelihoods, and just as in the global pandemic of 2020, after a period of fear, isolation and hysteria, the great and pressing concern was how to build a better world from the devastation. Defoe’s graphic description of the plague, and the subsequent economic ruin has distinct echoes for our times.

Some economists are forecasting a V-shape recovery; a fast bounce-back. But many more suggest the most likely outcome will be an L-shaped impact – a rapid dip followed by a long period of no significant growth, perhaps continuing for many years.

The United Nations, in its response to the pandemic is perhaps facing the greatest test since its inception in 1945. But the organisation is determined not to be blown off course in its pledge to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the end of the decade.

The task of finding a way through this world-wide catastrophe has fallen to 71 year old Mr Guterres who became Secretary-General of the UN in 2017 having served two terms as Prime Minister of his native Portugal. The leader of the country’s Socialist Party, he was widely admired at home and abroad for his support for humanitarian causes. He began his career at the UN as High Commissioner for Refugees where he became convinced that sustainable development would be essential for the eradication of poverty and inequality.

Since his appointment as Secretary-General, he has enthusiastically championed the UN’s blueprint of 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which aims to achieve “a better and more sustainable future for all”. These include an end to poverty and hunger, promotion of good health and education, gender equality, clean water provision, clean energy and action on climate change.

This holistic response to the root causes of conflicts – integrating peace, sustainable development and human rights – was going to be challenging enough without an unforeseen global crisis like the Covid-19 virus.

The UN had hoped to achieve their SDG aims by the end of the decade, but the pandemic has thrown a giant spanner in the works, threatening destabilisation in many of the developing countries of the world, most notably in Africa, where progress was being made towards the SDG target.

Mr Guterres, attending a virtual high-level UN the meeting aimed at finding solutions to tackle the damage done by the pandemic to the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, warned that Covid-19 would cause “unimaginable devastation and suffering around the world”. He predicted that millions would be pushed into extreme poverty, that there would be famines of “historic proportions”, and that we would witness the sharpest contraction of the global economy since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

“Despite all the technological and scientific advances of recent decades, we are in an unprecedented human crisis – because of a microscopic virus,” he said.

He said that there must be immediate, collective action in six crucial areas: Global liquidity and solutions to debt; incentives for creditors; incentives to boost sustainable development; a crackdown on illicit financial dealings; the alignment of incentives in global financial systems with SDGs to boost confidence and relaunch investment in sustainable development; and finally, the creation of an over-arching global framework to aid rapid recovery.

“All our efforts must go towards building sustainable and resilient pathways that enable us not only to beat Covid-19, but to tackle the climate crisis, reduce inequality and eradicate poverty and hunger,” he said.

“Getting through Covid-19 and recovering better will cost money, but the alternative will cost far more. This is a global crisis and it’s up to all of us to solve it. Let us continue to wage peace, defeat the pandemic and build a better future.”

Mr Guterres has been at pains to insist that in the pursuit of sustainable economic recovery world governments must build upon the UN’s SDG blueprint. There was a triple imperative, he told the UN’s Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in May, to stem the pandemic, safeguard development gains already made, and ensure that all recovery efforts followed the SDG 2030 Agenda.

“Working together, with our foot on the pedal and our eyes on the (SDG) 2030 Agenda, we will get through this crisis and reach our destination, protecting hard-won development progress and accelerating our joint efforts,” he said. “Our objective remains clear; to help countries navigate and accelerate progress towards achieving the goals.”

One element of the SDGs is gender equality, and Mr Guterres singled out the role of women in the world economy. The pandemic, he said, had laid bare the extent to which national economies are sustained by the unpaid domestic labour of women. He urged governments to tackle the issue in the post-pandemic world to ensure a better recovery. “Returning to our previous path is simply not an option,” he said.

His words were echoed by ECOSOC president, Mona Juul, who said that the pandemic had exposed the disproportionate burden on women who perform unpaid care work and are overrepresented as frontline health workers. She said that the inclusion of a gender perspective, as enshrined in SDG, into social and economic responses to the virus was essential.

Mr Guterres emphasised that bold action taken now, based on the UN’s SDGs, would not only protect the weakest, it would help ensure a stronger recovery. And he again stressed the regularly-quoted phrase that he would “leave no-one behind”. The recovery, he said, had to be focussed on building inclusive and sustainable economies that are more resilient in the face of future global challenges.

At the beginning of the year, the UN announced a “Decade of Action” for SDGs. The conversation at the time was about how to build momentum in the final ten years of the initiative. In its 2019 SDG report, the UN had warned that progress towards the goals was slowing, even reversing in some areas.

Now there are many who paradoxically believe the pandemic, far from being an unanticipated obstacle to SDG progress, may help reinvigorate the project. The UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development (UKSSD), for instance, pointed to the way many businesses supported communities and the vulnerable during the pandemic, showing a willingness to help society and go above and beyond the normal.

UKSSD blogger, Emily Auckland, said: “It is only by working together that we will create a post-pandemic future that is fairer, just and sustainable.”

Failure to respond quickly at this point in history, said Mr Guterres, could jeopardise progress already made towards achieving SDGs. The UN has drawn attention to several areas where a substantially improved outcome might be achieved because of the effects of the pandemic – one being the question of remittances.

Remittances – the money sent by migrant workers in developed nations to their families in poorer countries – currently account for more than five percent of GDP in as many as 60 low-income countries. During the pandemic, this flow of cash has been dramatically reduced, causing great hardship in developing countries.

But the pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities in the global remittance system, said Gilbert F. Houngbo, president of the UN agency, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). He called for an overhaul of money-transfer systems to ensure more of the cash reaches needy families, and less is lost in transfer fees. IFAD is currently in negotiation with financial technology firms, mobile operators, banks and postal networks to find a solution to high transaction costs.

Mr Guterres focussed specifically on the effects upon mental health as a result of the pandemic, especially among the young. “Mental health is at the core of our humanity,” he said. “The virus is not only attacking our physical health, it is also increasing psychological suffering. Throughout my life, and in my own family, I have been close to doctors and psychiatrists treating these conditions. I became acutely aware of the suffering they cause. Even when the pandemic is brought under control, grief and anxiety will continue to affect people and communities.”

His observations were confirmed in late May 2020, when the International Labour Organisation (ILO) warned that more than one in six young people worldwide had lost their jobs due to the coronavirus.

The ILO reported that under 30s had been particularly hard hit, claiming that their financial prospects could be blighted for decades. Guy Ryder, the ILO’s Director-General said that many young people would simply be left behind. Youth unemployment in the EU for instance, which still stands at around 15 percent, had never fully recovered from the financial crisis of 2008, he said.

This was just one aspect of the potential fall-out from the pandemic. Mr Guterres also drew attention to the plight of the world’s developing nations, especially those in Africa, whose progress towards the UN’s SDG targets was being thrown off course as a result of the economic damage caused by coronavirus.

Mr Guterres had earlier called on UN member states to adopt a “war economy” to fight the effects of the virus. Defeating coronavirus, he said, was the first stage, but the world should seize the opportunity to create a global economy which was more “inclusive and sustainable going forward”.

“We need to prepare for a recovery for a better economy, a more sustainable and inclusive economy,” he said. “We don’t need to replicate exactly the economy of the past. Many things will change, I would say irreversibly in our lives.”

He said that the world needed to use the current situation wisely; “to seize it as an opportunity” to achieve more inclusiveness and sustainability in national economies. He also expressed the hope that another effect of the pandemic would be to force governments to re-evaluate relationships with the environment, and redouble efforts to combat climate change.

Unsurprisingly for a man who sees his fundamental role as UN Secretary-General to be the achievement of the eradication of poverty and inequality, Africa is at the heart of his Covid-19 concerns.

As the virus began to spread across the continent, Mr Guterres called on warring factions in several African states to agree to a general ceasefire, in the hope that the pandemic would somehow make peace easier to achieve.

Mr Guterres knows that the pandemic will not be defeated until Africa is safe. Economic instability could lead to catastrophic collapse in the region, leading in turn to more conflict, famine and an upsurge in migration.

“In recent years Africans have done much to advance the well-being of the continent’s people,” he said. “Economic growth has been strong; the digital revolution has taken hold. A free trade area has been agreed. But the epidemic threatens Africa’s progress. It will aggravate long-standing inequalities and heighten hunger, malnutrition and vulnerability to disease.”

It was already the case, he said, that African exports were in serious decline because of coronavirus, and demand in the continent’s tourism industry had all but dried up. The opening of a pan-African trade zone, upon which so much is staked, and which was due to take place in 2020, has been postponed as a direct result of the pandemic.

Mr Guterres praised the way African countries had moved rapidly to establish regional co-operation to fight the spread of the disease, including co-ordinated quarantines and lockdowns. He also commended African governments for drawing on their experience of epidemics like HIV/Aids and Ebola in the fight against rumour and misinformation, debunking anecdotal speculations and overcoming mistrust of government agencies.

But the international community, he argued, had to step in to help strengthen local health systems, and try to avoid a financial crisis which could push millions of Africans into poverty.

Elsewhere, Inger Andersen, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) shone the spotlight on the effect of the pandemic on environmental issues, insisting that the world’s response must not be seen as simply a philanthropic reaction. Sustainable recovery and development will need to be fully future-proofed, she said. The threat posed by rising global temperatures increases the likelihood of more pandemics, flooding, droughts and the destabilisation of economies.

Meanwhile attention has also been focussed on the generational response to the crisis. Those reaching adulthood in the early 21st century – Millennials and Generation Z – were initially accused of having too carefree an attitude to the virus, even being blamed for helping to spread infection. But it is becoming clear that the response of young people is leading to intergenerational innovation to find ways to survive and grow.

Millennials and Generation Z make up nearly 40 percent of workers in fragile areas such as childcare, restaurants, and tourism – and are bearing the brunt of the economic impact of measures designed to tackle Covid-19. But these young people are also collaborative, comfortable with electronic communication and the use of technology, and above all, adaptable.

They are the generations most likely to seek out sustainable brands, say economists. Unilever, the giant Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company, is a pioneer of in this field. In 2018 their 28 Sustainable Living Brands grew 69 percent faster than the rest of the business – up from 46 percent the previous year. Much of this growth, Unilever believes, is down to the attitudes of younger generations.

Elizabeth Uviebinené, the British author of Slay in You Lane: The Black Girl Bible, summed up this opinion, saying: “Despite the uncertainty ahead, I take comfort in the fact that millennials are a resilient and adaptable generation because we’ve always had to be, and this setback will be no different.”

The Business & Sustainable Development Commission, launched in Davos, Switzerland in 2016, believes that at least $12 trillion could be unlocked through the expansion of sustainable business over the next decade, creating up to 380 million new jobs by 2030.

Elizabeth Boggs Davidsen, the Director of SDG Impact at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), says that the pandemic has exposed the world’s weaknesses, and “reminded us about how interconnected all our fortunes are”.

“We now have the opportunity to create a better, stronger, more sustainable, resilient and inclusive future for all,” she says. “Rather than assume that the pandemic makes our task harder, we should capitalise on the opportunity and space it provides to challenge conventional wisdom.”

In 2018, KPMG reported that of the world’s 250 largest companies, only 101 mentioned SDGs in their corporate reporting, and of these, just eight made the business case for SDGS.

Ms Davidsen says: “Too often the SDGs are used as just another reporting lens to communicate existing activities differently, rather than to make different decisions. While interest in the SDGs has been building, business leaders tell us they still do not have all the tools and information they need.”

Her role, as the pandemic recedes, is to build a common business framework to guide companies, creating a greater sense of confidence in an uncertain time, she said.

António Guterres believes that people have finally become conscious of the seriousness of the virus and its effects, and now understand that global solidarity and co-ordination of action was required not only to defeat coronavirus, but also to keep the wheels of the world economy turning.

Despite the apparent chaos in the global response to coronavirus, the conflicting advice of experts, the attempts to pin blame, the rhetoric of leaders like Mr Trump, the failure to follow WHO guidance by some, the opportunistic crackdown on civil liberties by others, Mr Guterres remains optimistic that the world can recover, and a new, equitable future be created.

And it would seem that his cautious optimism is shared. Global Web Index, a London-based consumer research body, believes that optimism is a key factor in navigating the coronavirus crisis – and its extensive market research appears to bear that out.

An internet survey of 14,000 people across 13 countries conducted during the height of the pandemic in March 2020 found a reassuringly high level of optimism for recovery among respondents, though there were significant variations between countries.

China saw the highest levels of optimism at 93 percent, while in Japan only 17 percent were hopeful of a positive outcome. In the USA and UK, there was an approximate 50:50 split between confidence and pessimism. According to Global Web Index, good communication appears to be the key to maintaining consumer optimism, with those who felt well-informed being generally less concerned for the future.

The Great Plague of 1665 was the first time the citizens of England had suffered such pestilence since the dreadful years of the Black Death in the 14th century. It took them by surprise in much the same way as coronavirus shocked a modern world where such events were seen as things of the past. The Black Death wiped out almost 45 per cent of England’s population in the mid-1300s, and in doing so, also obliterated the feudal system, laying the foundation for a modern nation. Similarly, the Great Plague, followed the next year by the Great Fire of London, allowed the city to transform into a progressive capital. From calamity can come hope.

In his journal of the plague year, Daniel Defoe echoes this conviction with a grimly comic observation that there may yet be cause for hopefulness:

“This is a world of corpses strewn in the streets and pits, yet in the deadcart itself a drunken piper wakes up to cry, ‘But I an’t dead tho’ am I?’”

New Delhi: United Nations Development Program and Invest India have launched the SDG Investor Map for India, laying out 18 Investment Opportunities Areas (IOAs) in six critical SDG enabling sectors, that can help India push the needle forward on Sustainable Development.

“India occupies a key role in determining the success of the SDGs, globally. Invest India is pleased to have partnered with UNDP India to develop the first-ever 'SDG Investor Map for India'. This initiative is an instrumental stride in India's development trajectory, and I believe it couldn't have come at a better time. We hope our data-backed research and insights serve as useful blueprints to understand how best the SDG financing gap can be narrowed in India”, Deepak Bagla, CEO & MD, Invest India, said on the launch occasion.

Shoko Noda, Resident Representative, UNDP India said on the occasion, “The Map comes at a critical time for India. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the financing gap for the SDGs in India has only widened further and decades of development progress is nearly on the verge of reversal. Investing in the SDGs at this point is crucial to ‘Building Back Better’ and making the economy and our societies more resilient and sustainable. Enhanced productivity, technology adoption and increased inclusion are all critical factors that this map uses to identify the most attractive sectors for investors.”

Key highlights of the SDG Investor Map:

Of the 18 IOAs identified, 10 are already mature investable areas that have seen robust Private Equity and Venture Capital activity, and feature companies that have been able to unlock scale and demonstrate profitability. The remaining eight IOAs are emerging opportunities, which have seen traction from early-stage investors.

The map has also identified eight White Spaces, which have seen investor interest and have the potential to grow into IOAs within a 5-6-year horizon. However, these require further policy support and private sector participation to mature into commercially attractive IOAs.

Nearly 50% of the shortlisted IOAs have historical investments that have yielded IRRs in excess of 20%.

84% of the IOAs have investment timeframes ranging from the short term (less than 5 years) to the medium-term (between 5- 15 years).

83% of the identified IOAs address job creation and industrialization needs, 70% focus on inclusive business models and 50% leverage digital technologies to deliver commercial returns and impact at scale.

Notable IOAs include ‘Online Supplementary Education for K12’ (Education), ‘Tech-Enabled Remote Care Services’ (Healthcare), ‘Digital Platforms to service input/output needs of farmers to enable easy access to markets’ (Agriculture) and ‘Access to credit by Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Low-Income Groups especially through digital platforms for Income Generating Purposes’ (Financial Services).

The observations from the map present a strong case for investing in SDG enabling sectors and IOAs, bridging the gap between high-level development targets and the need for commercially viable returns. Moreover, investing in the SDGs is crucial to ‘Building Back Better’ from COVID-19 and enhancing India’s resilience to future threats.

Investing in opportunities that enhance employment and employability, push forward the inclusion of underserved communities and leverage technology will be of essence to India as it grapples with the challenges of a post-COVID economy.

By mapping the overlaps and gaps between public sector priorities and private sector interest, the SDG Investor Map lays out pathways that can bring together private-sector investment and public sector support for 6 SDG-enabling sectors including Education, Healthcare, Agriculture & Allied Activities, Financial Services, Renewable Energy & Alternatives and Sustainable Environment.

These sectors and the IOAs within them were selected through a rigorous analytical process that included extensive consultations with a number of major domestic and international investors, government stakeholders and think-tanks. This ensured that the Map’s findings were truly reflective of market sentiment.","UNDP, Invest India launch SDG investor map for India, 18 investment opportunities areas identifiedNew Delhi: United Nations Development Program and Invest India have launched the SDG Investor Map for India, laying out 18 Investment Opportunities Areas (IOAs) in six critical SDG enabling sectors, that can help India push the needle forward on Sustainable Development.

The map has also identified eight White Spaces, which have seen investor interest and have the potential to grow into IOAs within a 5-6 year horizon. However, these require further policy support and private sector participation to mature into commercially attractive IOAs.

""The Map comes at a critical time for India. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the financing gap for the SDGs in India has only widened further and decades of development progress is nearly on the verge of reversal. Investing in the SDGs at this point is crucial to 'Building Back Better' and making the economy and our societies more resilient and sustainable,"" said Shoko Noda, Resident Representative, UNDP India.

It’s only morning.”

An OPP cruiser, lights flashing, was parked in front of the Ingleside Foodland. There, a few volunteers and two auxiliary sergeants were on hand to collect monetary donations as well as food donations — and they were quite busy.

It was a different story for the SDG Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) Stuff the Cruiser event however. Held on Saturday at various locations — Alexandria, Winchester, Ingleside, Chesterville and Morrisburg from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., the fundraiser that aims at filling local food bank shelves was a hit.

INGLESIDE — The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected local food banks — more residents are now using their services, while fundraisers struggle to collect enough funds to keep up with the rising demand.

In order to help the fundraiser, Foodland offered shoppers the chance to purchase bags of already assembled, non-perishable foods. These were made up of food staples — beans, pasta, pasta sauce and cans of soups.

Nearly every shopper that left the store had one in their cart, which they gently placed inside of giant barrels resembling cans of soup.

Yet it wasn’t just food donations that were handed out — so was money and lots of it.

“Usually, we have people handing us five dollars or something like that,” said Chris Quenville, another Agape Centre volunteer. “But today, we had people giving us forty dollars and even fifty dollars. It’s incredible. We even had someone give us 60 dollars. We’ve never seen this.”

Both Auxiliary Sgt. Doug Behn and Auxiliary Sgt. Lambia Kavitsiotis were also impressed with the amount of donations that were flowing out of the store during the fundraiser.

“The feedback we’ve been getting is very positive,” said Kavitsiotis. “People are really being generous today, it’s great.”

“This is their biggest food fundraiser and the barrels they brought are already nearly full,” added Behn.

The Agape Centre, like many other local food banks, has seen its customer base increase during the COVID pandemic.

“We serve 90 to 100 a day for hot lunches, three days a week,” said Quenville. “Some of them are also people we don’t recognize, people that have never had to come to us before.”

According to him, some of the Agape’s clientele is now made up of individuals having come from as far as Toronto or Ottawa.

“When the pandemic happened, they left the big hubs for smaller places,” he said. “It’s been very busy at the Agape.”

Although the exact number of donations had yet to be tallied, last year’s event resulted in a total of $3,700 in monetary donations and 4,400 pounds of food.

Article content Four facilities in SDG are on the list of 74 long-term care homes that’ll receive additional funding, the province has announced. The Ontario government said its modernized funding model is a $761 million investment to build and renovate 11,000 spaces. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser. Additional funding for LTC homes includes four in Cornwall, SDG Back to video The list includes Parisien Manor and Heartwood, both in Cornwall, Woodland Villa in Long Sault and Dundas Manor in Winchester. “Our government has been taking historic steps to improve the quality of life for our loved ones by adding capacity and upgrading Ontario’s long-term care homes,” said Minister of Long-Term Care Dr. Merrillee Fullerton. “We introduced the modernized funding model to build and renovate these homes faster, and we’re already seeing results, with thousands of new, safe, and comfortable spaces in progress.” Fullerton and Municipal Affairs and Housing Steve Clark announced details in a news conference in Eastern Ontario, at the Maple View Lodge in Athens, northwest of Brockville.

Article content The government said the additional funding is part of the province’s new funding model that helps break down historic barriers and accelerates the construction of urgently needed long-term care projects, providing seniors with the high-quality care they deserve. Under the project name Southbridge Cornwall (Parisien Manor), there are 95 spaces to be developed, and 65 existing spaces to be upgraded. Total funding is just under $185 million, which includes about $177 million in original funding, and over $7.4 million in additional funding under the modernized funding model, which is a four per cent increase. If this reads like old news, it’s because a lot of it is. In Sept. of 2019, while Parisien Manor was celebrating its 50th anniversary, it was announced there’d be a new, state-of-the-art, 160-bed facility built by 2022. Heartwood in Cornwall will have 10 new spaces developed, and 118 existing spaces upgraded. Total funding of just over $44 million includes just over $6 million under the new funding model, a 16 per cent increase over the original funding amount. Rural Healthcare Innovations, operating as Dundas Manor, will have 30 new spaces developed, and 98 existing spaces upgraded. Total funding of just under $75.5 million includes just under $6 million (eight per cent increase) added under the new funding model. In mid-March, Fullerton was in Winchester for a news conference that announced Dundas Manor was approved for the 30 new beds and redevelopment of 98 existing beds.

Article content Woodland Long-Term Care (Woodland Villa) in Long Sault will have 17 new spaces developed, and 111 existing spaces upgraded. Total funding of just over $55 million includes just over $6 million (12 per cent increase) added under the new funding model. Maxville Manor is not on the list, but back in Sept. the process moved forward when it got the green light from Infrastructure Ontario, financing approved for up to $20 million of what will be a $24-million capital project over the next 25 years. Maxville Manor’s ask has been for 38 new beds, which would bring its total up to 160. The government said the modernized model has boosted support for 74 projects that represent nearly 11,000 LTC spaces; 3,957 are new beds, and 6,796 are older beds being redeveloped to modern standards. Of the 74 projects, 49 involve the construction of a new building. The government said that as of June, there were 38,500 people on the waitlist to access an LTC bed. “The number of people in (SDG) who will need long-term care is expected to increase significantly over the next decade,” MPP Jim McDonell said. “The work underway here will make sure that our loved ones will have a comfortable, modern place to live, near family and friends, with the support they need, when they need it.” The government said the new funding model is helping the government deliver on its commitment to create 30,000 beds over 10 years. The new model moves away from a one-size-fits-all approach, and instead, provides tailored incentives to address the needs of developers in different markets: rural, mid-size, urban, and large urban. It also introduces an up-front development grant to address high cost barriers to construction. “Bringing the long-term care funding model into the 21st century means we have a targeted approach for improving and expanding long-term care capacity in our communities,” Minister Clark said. “For example, under the modernized funding model, Maple View Lodge (in Athens) will receive an additional investment of close to $7 million. This will help the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville build 132 new and much needed spaces in Athens Township sooner.” thambleton@postmedia.com twitter.com/FreeholderTodd

234,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/wto-members-delay-agreement-on-fisheries-subsidies-to-2021/,"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,WTO Members Delay Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies to 2021,"World Trade Organization (WTO) members did not conclude negotiations on an agreement on curbing harmful fisheries subsidies by the 2020 deadline. A new schedule for meetings in 2021 is being developed, with the aim of bringing “this negotiation to the finish line.”

The WTO’s 11th Ministerial Conference (MC11) and SDG target 14.6 give negotiators the task of securing an agreement on eliminating subsidies for illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing and to prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing by the end of 2020. In March 2020, the COVID-19 crisis resulted in the suspension of in-person meetings, and members used online meetings and written exchanges to continue negotiations. Despite their efforts and “almost daily” meetings in late November, WTO members were unable to finish negotiations at the 14 December informal meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee.

Throughout 2020, members have negotiated on the basis of a draft consolidated text first introduced in June 2020 and then on a revised version introduced in early November 2020. The draft text addresses all the main pillars of the negotiations, including prohibitions on subsidies, a placeholder for a capping mechanism and a list of non-harmful subsidies, provisions for special and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries (LDCs), technical assistance and capacity building, notification and transparency, institutional arrangements, and dispute settlement. During the final “cluster” of discussions in the 2020 work programme, heads of delegations provided drafting suggestions on IUU fishing, overcapacity and overfishing, and special and differential treatment for developing countries.

On overfishing and overcapacity, a provision in the draft text allows members to maintain or grant certain capacity-building subsidies if a member can demonstrate that fishery management measures are being implemented to maintain a sustainable level of fish stocks. Brazil and the US urged elaborating on a capping mechanism in the text to complement overcapacity prohibitions that are currently in the draft.

On special and differential treatment, members reiterated varying positions during a 2 December meeting. India had proposed draft text to exempt from subsidy bans developing countries that meet certain fishing volume and gross national income (GNI) thresholds. Several members observed a lack of convergence around this text although members also signaled openness to explore and refine the proposed criteria-based approach.

The chair of the negotiations, Ambassador Santiago Wills of Colombia, said “while I am disappointed that we will miss the 2020 deadline, I am not discouraged.” He stressed “real progress” was made on the negotiations during 2020, despite difficulties caused by COVID-19-related disruptions, and emphasized that WTO members are committed to build on their progress and reach a conclusion.

WTO Deputy Director-General Karl Brauner recognized WTO members’ “intensive work on fisheries subsidies” at the Trade Negotiations Committee and Heads of Delegation meeting on 14 December. He agreed with Ambassador Wills’ assessment and observed that the negotiations have made “considerable concrete progress towards finding a solution that all Members can accept.” Brauner said greater political will, pressure from civil society, and renewed engagement will help members finalize an agreement. He called for “compromise by everyone, on all issues” and accelerated activity in 2021 that continues “until we deliver” an agreement.

For the UN’s 75th, a concerted effort focused on asking a million members of the public for help in steering its next 25 years. Governments also spent several months, during a pandemic, negotiating a political declaration with 12 commitments for re-energizing multilateralism, and they have issued a request for a set of recommendations from the UN Secretary-General on ensuring the UN rises to the challenges of current and future generations.

The timeframe set for the UN’s self-reflection – looking to the world in 2045 – is longer than the usual timeframes of international road maps and agreements. We have International Days (so many that some days of the year contain more than one “Day” within them). We have International Years; 2020 is the international year of the nurse and midwife (thank you, nurses and midwives) and the international year of plant health (thank you plants, too). We are also accustomed to titling ten-year periods by broad goals that need worldwide attention and effort. We are in the midst of international decades on biodiversity, people of African descent, sustainable energy, nutrition, poverty eradication, water, peace, and several more.

Setting plans for longer than a decade is a display of ambition but also reflects the scale of the problem. The eight Millennium Development Goals had a 15-year timeframe (2000-2015). The 17 global goals devised to succeed and broaden the MDGs also look 15 years ahead, to what will hopefully be a more sustainable world.

But it is a singular initiative that looks 25 years into the future and sketches its contours by the dreams of the children and youth who will fill and govern that world, and decide how it is left for their own grandchildren. The UN75 process has not shied away from the scale of the problem. This policy brief reviews the milestones since early 2019, who said what along the way, and what might come next.

Timeline of UN75 Actions and Milestones

February 2019: Governments begin negotiating the details of the anniversary commemoration through consultations led by the permanent representatives of Iceland and Singapore.

April 2019: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appoints Fabrizio Hochschild as Special Adviser on Preparations for the Commemoration of the UN’s 75th anniversary.

June 2019: Governments reach agreement (A/RES/73/299) on the theme of the anniversary meeting, date, format, and outcome, and note the importance of engaging civil society and youth in all commemoration activities. They decide to convene a youth plenary as part of the occasion. In this guest article for the SDG Knowledge Hub, Fergus Watt explains the points of contention regarding modalities.

October 2019: The UN announces a public consultation process to help determine how the UN should improve and assess “the future people want, and the UN we need.” Asked what should be done to change public opinion in countries where there is low confidence in the UN, Hochschild says that instead, “we should be letting public opinion change us.”

January 2020: The UN launches the “global conversation” with a one-minute survey. Over the next eight months the outreach process will comprise 1,000 dialogues in 80 countries, with over one million people in all 193 Member States of the UN, scientifically sampled surveys in 50 countries conducted by two independent companies, the first-ever AI analysis of social and traditional media, and university and think-tank research.

February 2020: The permanent representatives of Qatar and Sweden serve as co-facilitators for the political declaration and begin consultations. One speaker at an early meeting says the UN “has enough documents” and it is time to deliver on commitments that have already been made. Delegations highlight the 2030 Agenda and support for small island developing States (SIDS) as particular priorities: “to remain relevant, the UN must be the driving force and catalyst for sustainable development in all countries, especially the poorest and most vulnerable.” Initial discussions also note the importance of engaging women, girls, and all youth. But one says that “hearing all voices is not enough; we must also act on them.” She calls for marginalized groups to have a place at the table to make decisions and take actions with governments and the UN.

March 2020: The UN75 youth plenary is postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It will eventually be rescheduled for early September 2020 and take place virtually. Intergovernmental consultations on the political declaration also shift to virtual formats.

May 2020: Civil society networks hold the UN75 People’s Forum for the UN We Need via virtual formats. Participants adopt a plan for action and priority recommendations for the UN and Member States, including to establish a Member-State-mandated, post-2020 follow-up mechanism to enhance global governance. Signatories see such a mechanism as ushering in a new compact for more equitable and effective global governance and rebuilding confidence in global institutions.

July 2020: Consensus is reached on a political declaration to be adopted by Heads of State and Government at the 75th commemoration. The 2020 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) is less fortunate: the ministerial declaration that was under negotiation for several months through remote means could not be finalized. But statements made during the meeting send a clear message that multilateralism is a priority for surviving the COVID-19 pandemic and shifting more resources to SDG achievement. Many countries stress that the only way out of the pandemic-induced crisis is through global solidarity.

Among the actions proposed for reviving and strengthening multilateralism, as reported by the Earth Negotiations Bulletin, are:

working together to produce a “people’s vaccine;”

using non-GDP related measures of progress;

using broader measures of vulnerability;

reform of international financial institutions;

fair and open global trade;

protection of the rules-based international order; and

more social security and protection.

9 September 2020: The UN holds a UN75 Youth Plenary. One speaker says “people my age are unafraid to make change happen even when the world gives them little opportunity to do so.” Hochschild offers a preview of results from the global conversation, noting that 90% of young people surveyed – more than any other age group – believe global cooperation is vital. He observes, “this does not surprise me at all: young people are deeply multilateral.”

16 September 2020: The UN Economists Network launches a report with advice on steering five current megatrends toward positive outcomes. The authors stress that achieving the SDGs is highly unlikely without an “overhaul of the current disjointed policymaking,” but if the right choices are made quickly, “it is not too late to shape the major trends of our time” in a sustainable, equitable direction.

18 September 2020: A letter signed by 49 leaders calls on governments to undertake institutional retooling of the UN. In a press release, signatory Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland and former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, points to “hard months and years ahead,” and says multilateralism represents the “only path that can deliver a green, sustainable and equitable recovery” from the pandemic.

21 September 2020: The UN75 office releases interim findings of the global conversation. The Special Adviser reports that they reveal “remarkable unity among respondents of all ages, regions, and social groups.” This guest article by Fabrizio Hochschild underlines that regarding the world in 25 years, respondents’ overwhelming concern relates to the climate crisis and the destruction of our natural environment, and this is the top concern even amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents also find international cooperation to be even more urgent due to the pandemic, and believe that more lives would be saved with better cooperation. Finally, people are looking for a UN that better reflects the stakeholders of the 21st century, that innovates more, and that is more diverse, more transparent, more accountable, and more effective.

21 September: The UN General Assembly holds a high-level event to commemorate the UN’s 75th anniversary. World leaders adopt the declaration agreed in July (UN/75/1), which recognizes multilateralism as necessary for a more equal, resilient, and sustainable world, and implementation of the 2030 Agenda as necessary for survival.

October 2020: Meetings following the anniversary event intensify the focus on local-led action (ICLEI/Daring Cities Forum and UCLG gathering of mayors), with UCLG Secretary General Emilia Saiz emphasizing in a guest article, “Local and regional governments are saying it loud and clear. We need to change the game and we are the game changers.” Other events around the world amplify the message that youth are central to a multilateralism that works.

Beginning the Next 25 Years

Writing before the anniversary meeting, the SDG Knowledge Hub editors observed that after a year full of discussions on multilateralism, the international community should be prepared to shape their ideas into “a more precise vision for revitalizing the multilateral system.” If, as governments said during the HLPF in July 2020, the only way out of today’s crisis is through global solidarity, then the international community must make time for action along the lines highlighted at meetings over the past year. If multilateralism is to “survive the pandemic,” on top of all of the other challenges it faces, governments and other actors must find ways to use it in humanity’s time of greatest need. This begins with showing solidarity with others. Cooperating to provide COVID-19 vaccines is a key place to start.

On 15 December 2020, UN Member States will gather in the UNGA Hall to begin discussing the follow-up to the UN75 declaration. They will hear Secretary-General Guterres’ vision for reinvigorating multilateralism and revitalizing the UN. He is also expected to provide a glimpse of the process by which he will develop recommendations, responding to governments’ request in the September declaration.

The public consultation continues until the end of 2020. The final UN75 report will be published in early 2021, and will inform the UN Secretary-General’s response to the political declaration.

Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, has said the interests of individual Member States have repeatedly prevented the international order from functioning as it was intended, forcing the UN to “lag behind its ideals.” This is a moment in history when saving oneself begins with helping others – but this will not be the last such moment. As the end of 2020 is finally near, governments that can afford to do so should prepare to help others in more and deeper ways than they have done before in order to save multilateralism and themselves.

Among these was a proposed ministerial decision for extending some of the support measures LDCs receive for several years after they graduate from LDC status – especially given that some of these countries are expected to undergo that transition in the coming years.

The 16-18 December meeting of the General Council also saw a proposal aimed at supporting the establishment and growth of “cotton by-product industries” in LDCs. Examples of cotton by-products include cotton seed and hulls, with uses ranging from cooking oils to paper production. The proposal was submitted by Burkina Faso, on behalf of the Cotton-4 (C-4) countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, and Mali) and Côte d’Ivoire.

Also on the General Council’s agenda were reports on the implementation of decisions from the past three ministerial conferences, including some that involve LDC issues. These were part of a much larger agenda, which tackled issues ranging from trade and public health to the future of a long-standing moratorium on duties on electronic transmissions.

Twelve-year Extension?

The WTO agreements feature a series of provisions that set out “special and differential treatment” (S&DT) for developing and least developed country members. The approach to S&DT can vary depending on the agreement, ranging from different limits for certain types of trade-distorting subsidies to transition periods for implementing some of the WTO’s rules.

Some of the S&DT measures apply only to LDCs, which is a status based on the UN classification. Others are available to any WTO member that designates itself as a developing country. This is itself a controversial issue given that some large advanced economies, especially the US, have argued that it is vital for WTO rules and negotiations to differentiate among developing countries of varying economic heft and circumstance, while many developing countries of varying sizes have warned that development challenges manifest themselves in myriad ways and complexities and must be acknowledged.

What happens after an LDC “graduates” from that status, however, is less clear. Chad, on behalf of the LDC Group, presented a communication and a related draft Ministerial Conference decision that, if adopted, would extend “support measures” available to LDCs under the WTO agreements for an additional 12-year period after graduation.

Under the draft decision, support measures are defined as “all special and differential treatment measures and exemptions available to a least developed country under existing and future WTO Agreements, Understandings, Ministerial, General Council and other relevant decisions,” as well as technical assistance, capacity building, and other measures under the WTO system meant for LDCs.

The proponents say ensuring a “smooth transition” is vital, noting that under the UN system there are provisions to support this transition. They also note there is only one mechanism at the WTO – the Enhanced Integrated Framework – that is designed to help in such transitions when it comes to the trading system.

“After leaving the category, graduating countries would normally lose access to all trade-related support measures and flexibilities granted to them, unless they request a waiver which must be approved by the whole membership,” the LDC Group’s communication notes.

The communication also warns that this creates particular challenges for LDCs on the cusp of graduation, citing as examples “their economic vulnerabilities and their limited negotiating capacity,” and noting that losing these support measures amid the devastation wrought by COVID-19 has meant that “several LDCs have been reluctant to graduate.” The Group notes that 12 LDCs are in the pipeline for graduation over the coming four years, with more expected.

While no decision was taken during the General Council meeting, according to trade sources, it drew support from China and India, while others were consulting internally. The EU, for its part, referred to existing procedures that graduating LDCs could use under the WTO system, including the use of waivers, while asking for a clarification on why the 12-year period was chosen and why such support measures should be kept in place for all countries graduating from LDC status.

US Ambassador to the WTO Dennis Shea also raised questions about the 12-year period, asking how this would relate to the existing option available under the UN Committee for Development Policy for LDCs to delay graduation for a maximum of nine years. Another option, he said, would be for LDCs to push for that nine-year period to be extended within the UN context.

Notably, Vanuatu graduated from LDC status in early December. The Pacific island nation is a relatively recent member of the global trade club, having acceded in August 2012.

LDCs at the WTO

There are long-standing concerns over the myriad challenges that LDCs face in engaging in international trade, which have been the subject of several negotiating efforts.

For example, the difficulties that LDCs face in acceding to the WTO, a years-long process that involves negotiating with the entire membership and undertaking significant domestic reforms, prompted the adoption in 2002 of dedicated LDC Accession Guidelines. These non-binding guidelines were later updated in 2012 to include benchmarks in goods and services market access, among other features.

The move to develop revised guidelines was in response to concerns that LDCs face a significant negotiating disadvantage in accession talks, though some trade analysts have warned that the benchmarks could have limited benefits and may limit vital policy space. While 30 LDCs joined the WTO at its inception in January 1995, only six (Afghanistan, Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR), Liberia, Nepal, and Yemen) have acceded since, in addition to Vanuatu.

At the Geneva, Bali, and Nairobi Ministerial Conferences in 2011, 2013, and 2015, respectively, WTO members endorsed decisions on select “LDC issues,” extracted from a wider suite of issues being negotiated under the WTO’s Committee on Trade and Development (CTD) in Special Session.

Among the decisions that have been adopted over the years is a decision granting preferential access to services and services suppliers from LDCs, which has been the subject of multiple decisions and follow-up work in Geneva. While over 50 WTO members have notified preferences under the waiver, trade officials and experts say more work needs to be done to ensure the waiver is being used fully, especially given the impact it could have for micro-, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).

Another decision, adopted in 2015, with mixed results, relates to preferential rules of origin for LDCs, specifically for imports from LDCs that are not already subject to trade preference schemes. A “Monitoring Mechanism” was adopted in 2013 to review the implementation of S&DT, in response to written submissions, though it has not since been used.

Meanwhile, the decision for developed countries, as well as those developing countries “in a position to do so,” to provide LDCs with access to their markets without subjecting their products to duties and quotas, dates back to 2005. A subsequent decision to advance progress in this area was adopted in 2013, and SDG target 17.12 calls for the “timely implementation” of this decision and related prior ones, along with making reference to the decision on preferential rules of origin.

As 2020 draws to a close, it is worth noting that there is another SDG target that refers specifically to LDCs and their challenges in the trading system. Target 17.11 calls for “significantly [increasing] the exports of developing countries, in particular with a view to doubling the least developed countries’ share of global exports by 2020.”

Data from the SDG Trade Monitor, a joint effort by the WTO, the International Trade Centre (ITC), and the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), suggest that this target will go unfulfilled for both goods and services exports. The fact that this has gone largely unremarked by the international community is profoundly worrisome, as is the fact that many of the long-standing difficulties that LDCs face across multiple dimensions of trade and trade policy remain unresolved.

He also encouraged the Council to set robust targets for the eighth replenishment of the GEF Trust Fund (GEF-8), and to support the effectiveness of national-level programmes, including by sharing best practices.

Rodríguez further challenged the Council, noting that recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic provides a chance to address overlapping crises triggered by human-caused biodiversity loss and environmental degradation, and highlighting that the GEF plays a role in helping countries to break down institutional and national silos and develop integrated and innovative policy tools to leverage resources for environmental protection, including from the private sector.

The Work Program offers urgent assistance to 87 of the world’s most vulnerable countries.

By the conclusion of the Council meeting, which convened virtually from 7-11 December 2020, and brought together 184 representatives of governments, international organizations, and civil society organizations, Council Members approved a Work Program comprising 62 projects and programs, with total resources amounting to USD 409.2 million. The Work Program is designed to take into account COVID-19, and offers urgent assistance to 87 of the world’s most vulnerable countries. The Work Program also mobilizes USD 2.1 billion in co-financing, of which USD 1.4 billion is from investments. Among the approved projects are the following:

Combating Land Degradation through Integrated and Sustainable Range and Livestock Management to Promote Resilient Livelihoods in Northern Punjab;

Phasing Out Mercury Measuring Devices in Healthcare;

Promotion of Circular Economy in the Textile and Garment Sector through the Sustainable Management of Chemicals and Waste in Ethiopia;

POPs and Mercury-free Solutions for Environmentally Sound Waste Management in Paraguay;

Build a Blue and Stronger Mediterranean, through the Mediterranean Network of Effective and Sustainable MPAs; and

Enhancing Water-Food Security and Climate Resilience in Volcanic Island Countries of the Pacific.

In light of the recent audit report by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) Office of Audit and Investigations (OAI) of UNDP GEF Management, all projects included in the Work Program implemented by UNDP shall be circulated by email for Council review at least four weeks prior to CEO endorsement/approval.

The Earth Negotiations Bulletin summary of the Council meeting notes that Council Members deliberated on the pandemic’s impact on project management, and considered a white paper by the GEF COVID-19 Task Force that outlines how environmental action can reduce future threats of disease outbreak. Additional issues discussed included:

The endorsement of a new private sector engagement strategy, outlining how the GEF will work in a systematic manner with industry groups, companies, and investors to reverse unsustainable global trends and deliver global environmental benefits;

The opening of discussions on the GEF-8 replenishment, the negotiations for which are expected to conclude by April 2022 in order to ensure a smooth transition from GEF-7; and

Governance of the GEF, including an agreement to pilot a co-chairing arrangement by which the elected co-chairperson would be selected from among the GEF’s Members for the duration of one year instead of just one meeting, to facilitate a stronger involvement of the elected chairperson in providing input to the agenda, the chairing of the meeting, and the meeting report.

During the 29th meeting of the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) and Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) Council, Council Members approved a USD 64 million LDCF Work Program, comprising nine projects, including three multi-trust fund projects that combine resources with the GEF.

The sectors covered by the EU ETS must reduce their emissions by 43% compared to 2005 levels to achieve the EU’s 2030 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction target of at least 40% from 1990 levels.

The Commission Decision of 16 November 2020 considers the following aspects in the determination for the cap for 2021:

A 0.46% increase of the linear reduction factor from 1.74 % to 2.2 %, which determines the amount by which the cap will decrease each year;

The implications of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, including that from 1 January 2021, the EU ETS Directive covers the emissions from electricity generation in Northern Ireland, while the emissions from the UK are no longer accounted for;

The latest scientific data concerning the global warming potential (GWP) of GHGs; and

The exclusion from the EU ETS of small installations by Croatia, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia, and Spain.

According to an EU press release, the cap for 2021 does not include the quantity of allowances to be issued in respect of aircraft operators, which is “the result of a bottom-up approach starting from free allocation to aviation.”

Following the appointment of the European Energy Exchange as the EU ETS common auction platform from 2021, the EU expects to publish the 2021 auction calendars in December 2020. The auctions of phase 4 will start “from the first scheduled auction date in 2021” at the end of January or early February 2021.

According to the release, from 2021 onwards:

Phase 3 and phase 4 allowances “will continue to exist in parallel”;

Phase 4 allowances are not eligible to cover phase 3 emissions of compliance entities;

Aviation allowances can be surrendered to meet the compliance obligations of aviation operators as well as stationary installations; and

International credits, including certified emission reduction (CER) units that are generated from clean development mechanism (CDM) project activities under the Kyoto Protocol, can no longer be used in phase 4.

As mentioned in the book ""Summa de Arithmetica"", by the ""father of accounting and bookkeeping"" Luca Pacioli, in 1494, it is a simple calculation in which the rule number is divided by the annual growth rate to obtain the approximate number of years required for doubling. Using this rule for per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP), it can be shown that if per capita GDP grows at 1 percent per year, then it will take roughly 70 years for the average person in a country to become twice as rich as they are today. On the other hand, if per capita GDP grows at 3 percent per year, it will take only a little more than 23 years for the average person in a country to become twice as rich as they are today.

Thus, even small differences in the growth rate of the economy over long periods of time may lead to dramatically different standards of living for the people of a country. So, what are the characteristics of an economy that make it grow faster than others? What policies can the government take to accelerate the pace of economic growth? Regarding such questions, Nobel laureate economist Robert Lucas remarked, ""The consequences for human welfare involved in questions like these are simply staggering: once one starts to think about them, it is hard to think about anything else.""

The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8 acknowledges the importance of economic growth. Unfortunately, Covid-19 has brought in sudden and drastic disruptions that have ravaged the world economy and will most likely produce the greatest rise in global unemployment since World War II. For Bangladesh, the economic fallout from Covid-19 will be multidimensional in nature and massive in magnitude. For example, as of October 2020, real GDP growth for Bangladesh in 2020 has been estimated to be 1.6 percent by the World Bank and 3.8 percent by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Earlier in April, the World Bank had forecasted that on a disaggregated level, real growth in Bangladesh economy in 2020 would be 3.5 percent for the agriculture sector, 2 percent for the industry sector and 3.5 percent for the services sector. At this rate, the agriculture sector would create 0.10 million more jobs, whereas the industry and services sectors would create 0.21 million and 0.9 million less jobs respectively, compared to 2018-19, assuming that employment-to-GDP elasticity would remain equal to that between 2015-16 and 2016-17 and the level of employment would be equal to that in 2016-17. This suggests that the economic slowdown caused by Covid-19 may reduce employment in services and industry sectors, but create jobs in the agriculture sector, which would reverse decades of gradual structural transformation and stall the development of the economy.

Such dismal predictions seem to reflect the ground reality since, as of June 2020, at least 50,000 low-income individuals left Dhaka and returned to their village homes after losing their jobs due to the pandemic.

SDG 8 also asserts the need for decent jobs. Unfortunately, despite the rapid economic growth, Bangladesh has struggled to provide productive employment and decent jobs for its young labour force. In 2017, the youth unemployment rate was as high as 10.6 percent, whereas the national unemployment rate was 4.2 percent. Regrettably, the unemployment rate among the youth who had completed tertiary-level education was 13.4 percent. This implies that the education system in Bangladesh is being unable to endow young people with market-relevant skills. In 2018, the share of the youth Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET) was 26.2 percent in Bangladesh compared to the global average of 21.2 percent. These issues are particularly disconcerting because the country is now at the juncture where it may be able to reap the demographic dividends if it can gainfully employ its enormous young population.

The International Labour Organization has estimated that the fall in working hours in South Asia due to Covid-19 in the first two quarters of 2020 would be equivalent to 161 million full-time 40-hour-per-week jobs. Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modelling has estimated that almost 140 million people in five South Asian countries and 12.37 million in Bangladesh may lose their jobs due to the pandemic. A survey by the Asian Development Bank has shown that the number of online job postings in Bangladesh in April 2020 was only 13 percent of the number of online job postings in April 2019. As of April 2020, 71 percent of urban slum-dwellers and 55 percent of the rural poor had no jobs due to Covid-19.

In the book ""Youth Employment in Bangladesh: Creating Opportunities—Reaping Dividends"", which I co-authored, we put forward a few suggestions for achieving SDG 8 in Bangladesh that are more relevant now in the context of Covid-19. These include: i) creating a database of youth NEET; ii) linking youth with employers; iii) revolutionising the education system so that it can build analytical competence and instil critical thinking skills in students; iv) increasing availability of technology and internet, particularly in the rural areas; v) reforming technical and vocational training to address the current need of industries; vi) ensuring equal employment opportunities for all without discrimination, prejudice or nepotism; vii) improving access to information at national, regional, and local levels; viii) promoting self-employment through entrepreneurship; ix) providing career counselling for the youth from an early stage; x) fostering an enabling environment for female youth; xi) training informal workers; and xii) seeking employment opportunities abroad.

Robeco has launched a credit income fund targeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), while aiming for a 4% to 6% income distribution.

The fund would be benchmark unaware and applied Robeco’s proprietary SDG assessment framework which screen companies that contribute positively to the SDGs.

The SDGs were a set of 17 goals and 169 targets for government, business and society with the aim to reduce inequality, eradicate poverty and protect the environment.

The fund would be an actively-managed global credit strategy that could invest in opportunities across different segments in the credit market, ranging from investment grade to emerging markets credits to high yield.

Stephen Dennis, head of Robeco Australia, said the launch of the fund in the local market provided investors the opportunity to tap into Robeco’s global expertise in credit investing, and market-leading approach to sustainable investing.

“Local wholesale and institutional investors are increasingly responding to the sustainability demands of their clients and members, and the ability to access the SDG credit income fund is a development that will be welcomed by them,” Dennis said.

September 2020 marked the fifth anniversary of the adoption of the SDGs and Robeco urged the global investment community to do more as part of the wider 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

“Sustainable investing is not going away; in fact, it’s only going to continue to evolve and attract further investor demand,” Dennis said.

243,https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/news/how-the-private-health-sector-can-help-achieve-sdg-3-2016305,"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",The Daily Star,How the private health sector can help achieve SDG 3,"The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a collection of 17 interlinked goals designed to be a ""blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all"". The SDGs were adopted in 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly and are intended to be achieved by 2030.

The third goal of SDG, or simply SDG 3, which has health at its core aims to ""ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages"". Under this overarching ambition, the focus areas of SDG 3 include maternal, neo-natal and infant mortality, communicable and non-communicable diseases, tobacco use, universal health coverage, sexual and reproductive healthcare, R&D in health, increasing health financing, training and risk reduction capacities, etc.

The private sector healthcare providers do not only cover doctors and hospitals but also include all prevention, primary through tertiary care facilities, support organisations, and all the technicians, support staff, general employees, and volunteers who are engaged in delivering healthcare services. NGOs—there are about 105 national and 40 international ones—are also a key part of the private healthcare sector.

Here is a general plan on how this sector can be mobilised to help make the SDG 3 a reality.

Public-private partnership

Private sector entrepreneurship covers around 60 percent of the health sector in Bangladesh, having approximately 70,000 doctors and 100,000 hospital beds, providing employment to around 10 lakh people, and investment to the tune of USD 3,500 crore. With proper support and conducive conditions, this sector can be made more efficient and effective bringing in better quality and outcome for the citizens. The foreign currency of about USD 1,000 crore that is going abroad every year for the purpose of treatment, according to one estimate, can be saved by building people's trust in this sector.

EMR and use of National ID card

EMR, or electronic medical records, can be incorporated or interlinked with our National ID (NID) cards so that basic health-related information of the people can be recorded along with their sociodemographic information. The Emergency ID card will contain the medical records of an individual, and doctors can access them easily, allowing them to provide treatment swiftly and safely.

Separate Directorate for private sector

A separate Directorate General for private health sector will help the sector run smoothly by providing one-stop service for the purpose of licensing, etc. which at present is provided from 17 different offices.

Zonal health workers and national referral

In every zone of every district, there should be zonal health workers who will be responsible for the health and welfare of the local community, along with family physicians. There should be a proper referral system to the district hospital for specialist advice. In this way, the burden on specialist medical professionals will be minimised.

Health insurance

Everyone should be brought under the universal health coverage. There should be different packages of health insurance according to the socioeconomic quintiles of people.

Clear paths for health professionals

Healthcare professionals like doctors, nurses, and allied health workers should be categorised according to their type of work, such as academic, administrative and practicing. It should be done in both the government and private healthcare facilities.

Health education and promotion are key

A person's physical, mental, social and spiritual health and healthcare needs should be assessed and taken care of. NGOs, which are already covering many of these areas, can play a pivotal role in this regard. Some of their interventions that contribute to the concept of holistic health include literacy programmes, nutrition, social awareness, primary and preventive healthcare, essential and professional skills building, mass-scale counselling for the workforce in high-risk industries (such as ship breaking), etc. So this can be strengthened by more investment and infusion of private equity.

Environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG)

These should be the three central factors in measuring the feasibility and societal impact of healthcare facilities and interventions. These criteria help to better determine the future impact and sustainability of the healthcare industry.

Grading

All healthcare facilities should be graded like Grade I, Grade II and Grade III, according to the pricing, type and quality of services provided. However, the general quality of clinical services has to be similar across all the grades—the difference will lie only in hospitality and other non-essential perks that can vary from one facility to another.

Non-branded (generic) drugs

Hospitals categorised in grades 2 and 3 will get the opportunity to provide non-branded medicines (generic) to cut the cost of services while preserving quality, as it can be assumed that low-income people will generally frequent those facilities.

Focus on local community clinics

Existing community clinics can be strengthened by organising them under committees, which should be comprised of members from local authorities, public representatives, and led by doctors or medical professionals. Private sector players can support the clinics as part of a social enterprise model.

Accountability

First, Bangladesh Medical & Dental Council (BM&DC) should be strengthened and made the highest body responsible for overseeing activities related to the medical profession, and entrusted with the tasks of registration, recognition, maintenance and monitoring of all medical/healthcare facilities and professionals. Second, there should be a Health Service Ombudsman, answerable to parliament, who will be responsible for protecting the interests of patients as well as health service providers. Third, there should be an independent Health Commission free from the influence of the government and the private sector to oversee all accountability exercises.

Research and Development

Private-sector R&D is critical for future development of the health sector. The research findings can be helpful for the policymakers and should influence decisions related to costing, accountability, and governance. This will also have a critical role while responding to health emergencies like the Covid-19 pandemic—in treatment, vaccination, post-Covid-19 complications, etc.

Accreditation and quality of services

A national accreditation system for healthcare providing organisations, under Bangladesh Accreditation Body (BAB) or some other competent authority, is a must to ensure the quality of services provided and build trust in local health facilities among the general populace.

Finally, to achieve the SDG 3 targets, the public and private sectors should work hand in hand to improve the health and wellbeing of the population in Bangladesh.

Good performance was recorded for all 17 goals, he said today at the virtual launch of the “SDG Indicators, Malaysia, 2019” report — the second report of the country’s SDG indicators published by the Department of Statistics Malaysia.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development includes 17 goals based on five focus areas, namely people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership.

The goals are measured according to 247 indicators set at the global level in 2019.

On indicator assessment, Mustapa said for Malaysia, 128 indicators or 52 percent were available while 73 indicators or 29 percent needed to be developed.

“A total of 13 percent or 31 indicators are not available while 15 indicators or six percent are not relevant to Malaysia,” he said.

Mustapa said the national SDG progress status was also measured based on the performance of 108 statistical indicators.

Among aspects that showed positive progress was under the people focus area, with the overall incidence of poverty improving to 5.6 percent (405,441 households) in 2019 from 7.6 percent (525,743 households) in 2016, he said.

Meanwhile, the prosperity focus area showed the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita at constant prices grew 3.9 percent in 2019 compared with 3.6 percent in 2018.

“In line with the growth in the digital economy especially in the new normal following Covid-19, the percentage of individuals using the Internet has risen 3.0 percentage points to 84.2 percent in 2019 from 81.2 percent in the preceding year.

“For the Internet usage in the cities and rural areas, they increased 2.6 percentage points and 3.3 percentage points, respectively,” he said.

He added that all elements comprising the five focus areas would be continued in the 12th Malaysia Plan (12MP) after having been incorporated into the country’s developmental policies such as the 11th Malaysia Plan and Shared Prosperity Vision 2030

“In fact, a new approach will be taken under 12MP to deal with poverty through a targeted programme based on local needs across all races.

“This is because the poverty issues differ according to demographics and current situations. The way to handle it must suit the local conditions,” he explained.

According to him, the SDG implementation requires commitment from all quarters to continue the people development agenda.

“Hence the role played by the All-Party Parliamentary Group Malaysia on SDG (APPGM-SDG) is very critical to assist in achieving the Agenda 2030 goals.

“The group, which was established following the Dewan Rakyat approval on Oct 19, 2019, comprises 10 Members of Parliament including me,” he said.

Mustapa said APPGM-SDG was involved in SDG at the Parliamentary level by conducting local issue mapping activities and recommending solution ideas.

In the first phase, the group made field visits to 10 parliamentary constituencies in four states.

Next year, he said, APPGM-SDG would do the same programme in 20 parliamentary areas, especially in states that were not visited in 2020.

“The implementation of SDG goals is a continuation from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that ended in 2015.

“The legacy and achievements of of MDGs over 15 years have provided valuable lessons in our effort to achieve SDG goals,” he added. — Bernama","KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) performance improved in 2019 based on the achievement of the goals set, said Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Economy) Datuk Seri Mustapa Mohamed (pix).

The SDGIF was created in partnership with the Ministry of Industrialization and Trade (MIT) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Namibia and supported by the facilities finance partner Standard Bank Namibia and grant facility manager Environmental Investment Fund of Namibia (EIF).

Speaking at the event the Deputy Executive Director of MIT, Michael Humavindu said that by harnessing the comparative advantage and working within the context of their respective mandates, the ministry can collectively make significant progress towards realizing Namibia’s vision 2030 and our growth at home strategy.

According to Humavindu, the SDG Impact Facility provides competitive catalytic funding to Micro-Small-Medium Enterprises (MSME) with commercially viable businesses in targeted economic sectors.

Environmental Investment Fund CEO, Benedict Libanda, said the grant handover ceremony follows the first of three calls for proposals which will be issued during the first phase of the SDGIF. The current window focuses on companies in agriculture, nutraceuticals and artisans. Window 2 (manufacturing and sustainable tourism) and 3 (renewable energy and IT) will be launched in March and July respectively.

“We recognise that there is misalignment of financing mechanism and development priorities. Henc the fund sees this opportunity to engance private sector through the SDGs to enhance the impact of the private sector growth on all the dimensions of the 2030 Agenda. We are happy to note that the UNDP is supporting the government to implement integrated national financing frameworks which brings together public and private finance policy and institutions. We are very much excited to be part of this important initiative.
