The opinions represented in this piece are independent of Smart Cities Dive's views.​

Cities are the future. Today, more than half of all humans (54%) live in urban areas, according to the UN, and the number is expected to hit 66% by 2050. That’s another 2.5 billion people, based on current population growth projections. Cities also are one of our biggest carbon culprits, responsible for a staggering 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions, says the World Bank.

More people produce more traffic, and more traffic increases difficulty of maneuvering through the city. This comes at an enormous cost in terms of increased fuel consumption and lost time for commuters, to name a few. But congestion does not only affect road users. As a result of the constant stop-and-go of vehicles, traffic jams lead to higher levels of air pollution, which negatively affect people living in highly populated areas.

Rethinking how we get around our cities is one of the best ways we can make our cities more resilient while also mitigating climate change. Transportation currently contributes to nearly a third of U.S. carbon emissions, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which indicates there’s ample room for improvement.

There is no single solution for building more sustainable transportation. What we need is choice. The most sustainable and resilient transportation system is one in which city dwellers have a menu of options for getting around, ranging from private to public. After all, urban mobility isn’t just about moving from point A to point B — it’s about the experience along the way.

Disruptive transportation solutions

“Disruptive” and “transportation” might seem like unlikely bedfellows. However, it is now commonly agreed that breakthrough innovation in the field of mobility can help pave the way to a more sustainable city. Moving beyond the internal combustion engine and toward electric vehicles (EV) can help contribute to a healthier, quieter, and more environmentally-friendly metropolitan environment.

The U.S. Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy notes that direct emissions from conventional vehicles such as nitrogen oxides and greenhouse gas emissions, like carbon dioxide, harm both human and environmental health. However, ""all-electric vehicles produce zero direct emissions, which specifically helps improve air quality in urban areas,"" according to the department.

In addition to zero emissions, EVs are paving the way to a low-carbon urban future through silent, green performance credentials coming from strong and safe materials, fast charging, energy recuperating batteries and low-energy consumer electronics.

However, the category of EVs is not limited to just the car — it is expanding from four wheels to two. Not only are electric scooters playing a pivotal role in improving air quality and reducing noise pollution, but they are gaining popularity among city residents and importance among the automotive industry.

In addition to its environmental impact, city residents are turning to the electric scooter as the answer to many of their urban mobility issues, too. It occupies much less space than a car for driving and parking, which reduces congestion issues on city streets; it represents a fast mode of transportation, allowing riders to navigate their urban environments freely, without hassle; and the ability to charge with compact and portable batteries removes the need for dedicated and expensive charging infrastructure on the streets, a common barrier for electric vehicle adoption.

As a result, it turns out “disruptive” and “transportation” are more compatible than originally imagined, and through the combination of clean tech, materials science, smart connectivity, and futuristic design, they are realized through the electric scooter.

How sustainable transit improves the urban experience

Urban dwellers love their cities and everything it has to offer — art, fashion, music, food and more. A full suite of sustainable transportation options makes city living more seamless.

Meanwhile, as the impact of climate change become more apparent, sustainable transportation systems also will be more resilient – allowing urban populations to better bounce back from climate shocks such as superstorms and other extreme weather.

Safety also is a concern, as less traffic can mean less car accidents. You can’t have a truly sustainable transportation system unless human safety is optimized.

Public-private partnerships and transit integration

One way we can accelerate the move toward a more integrated sustainable transportation system is through public-private collaboration. Often, the public and private sectors are locked in their individual silos — they should find ways to break these down and work together. Increasingly, the goals of business and government are aligned, which is driving more collaboration to occur.

As government bureaucracies can struggle to innovate, they should look to the private sector for new ideas and funding. Likewise, the most successful businesses of tomorrow will be those who are willing to work with governments today.

By working together, the public and private sectors can provide the right amount of innovation and opportunity that allows sustainable transportation solutions to scale. This also will help unlock tomorrow’s smart cities, which provide connection and mobility solutions. With all the urban challenges down the road, it’s becoming increasingly apparent that a smart city is also a sustainable one.","However, it is now commonly agreed that breakthrough innovation in the field of mobility can help pave the way to a more sustainable city.

Its streets are packed with cars, lights flicker in offices long after the occupants have gone home, and stark economic divides persist between neighbourhoods.

But beneath the surface, something is working in Washington, D.C., experts say.

In August, the city was the first to receive the top “platinum” certification under a global sustainability programme called LEED for Cities, which tracks performance on energy use, waste management, water, transport and even quality of life.

Washington was joined by Phoenix in December.

The LEED for Cities framework, which celebrated its first birthday last month, is an expansion of the world’s most widely used rating system for green buildings.

Places earning top marks with LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) could serve as a model for officials around the world seeking to prove to investors and others that their cities are clean, green and offer a high quality of life, experts say.

Last month Arlington County, across the Potomac River from Washington, received the first top certification under another year-old framework, LEED for Communities, which is similar to the cities’ framework but covers different geographical scales.

With more certifications expected in early 2018, organizers say surging interest stems from the Paris Agreement on climate change – shunned by U.S. President Donald Trump – which has paved the way for local governments to step up as leaders in caring for the planet.

More than 100 cities around the world have expressed interest in the program so far.

Roger Platt, senior vice president at the U.S. Green Building Council, a nonprofit that created LEED, said Asian partners, including China and India, advised that its initial focus on buildings was too narrow for the breadth and speed at which cities are transforming.

LEED for Cities tracks changes in how a city is performing across 14 metrics. It uses an online platform allowing cities to analyse and compare their progress, focusing on outcomes rather than pledges.

“We’re at the point now where there’s a tremendous amount of information on strategies to be cleaner,” said Platt.

“What’s missing - and what we think we can do - is a very disciplined and rigorous system for determining whether the use of these strategies is actually creating measurable improvement,” he said.

“ We’re at the point now where there’s a tremendous amount of information on strategies to be cleaner. Roger Platt, senior vice president at the US Green Building Council

Early mover

Washington’s top certification under LEED for Cities shows the rapid progress it has made in recent years, Platt noted.

Between 2006 and 2013, it reduced carbon emissions by almost a third, to 11.9 tonnes per capita. Water consumption fell by more than 13 percent in the past five years. And today the city recycles about half of its waste - more than double New York City’s rate.

Washington even does well under the LEED metrics on social equity, which include a city’s affordability and distribution of wealth.

The U.S. capital was an early adopter of strategic plans around sustainability and the data required to measure progress, experts say.

It has focused for years on efficiency in its buildings, as one of the first cities to pass legislation in 2006 requiring use of the LEED for Buildings standard, said Jay Wilson, an analyst with the city’s Urban Sustainability Administration.

It has also regularly raised minimum standards in regulations and enforced rules such as green construction codes.

Wilson said LEED for Cities will now help Washington put all its sustainability data in one place, highlighting potential synergies - for instance, a gauge of miles driven per capita can double as a measure of emissions and walkability.

He also hopes the city can publicize its data in innovative ways, making residents aware of the shift to sustainability and steps households can take to support it.

As more cities go through the certification process, metrics will evolve in line with needs, and new trail-blazers are likely to emerge, organizers say.

“We look to celebrate what has been accomplished by Washington, but it will be a challenge for them to remain in that leadership role,” Platt said.

Much of what I highlighted then remains relevant. For example, if political currents threaten climate finance, then it is more important than ever to demonstrate how to get money where it matters – to communities at the frontlines of climate change.

One year into the Trump presidency, how does the global landscape for sustainable development look? And what might it mean for IIED’s work?

Greater ambition on climate action

President Trump’s announcement that he planned to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement on climate change cast a shadow over last November’s COP23 climate talks.

IIED’s experts felt that the outcomes of the COP23 talks were mixed – but could have been considerably worse. Fiji deserves credit for strong leadership. And the swell of support for climate action from US states, cities, businesses and civil society evident throughout was heartening.

“ A combination of powerful driving forces – growing appreciation of the current implications of global warming, and appreciation of just how far existing plans fall short – is likely to drive a more polarised and urgent debate on climate action in 2018.

Two key processes for 2018 will be finalising of the rule book for the Paris Agreement, and the Talanoa Dialogue, which must drive increased ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Increased ambition is certainly needed because action to tackle climate change is nowhere near where it needs to be.

A mountain to climb

In the wake of 2017’s extreme weather, the supposedly ‘safe’ upper goal for planetary warming of 2°C looks anything but.

Recent research reinforces the case for Paris’ more ambitious goal of 1.5°C. But we are a long way off: if all of the national climate action plans on which the Paris Agreement’s hopes are based were perfectly executed, we would still likely be headed for 3°C of warming by 2100.

A combination of powerful driving forces – growing appreciation of the current implications of global warming, and appreciation of just how far existing plans fall short – is likely to drive a more polarised and urgent debate on climate action in 2018.

We can expect to see growing social activism pushing business and government leaders to take urgent action. This will include increasing use of climate litigation as a weapon to take on vested interests.

At the same time, the debate about climate geoengineering will become more intense, and will encompass solar radiation management as well as carbon dioxide removal. It is urgent that we better understand the potential impacts of geoengineering on poor countries, and boost their voices in the growing debate about the governance of research into these technologies.

Technological advances will also continue to make renewable energy a cheaper and more attractive proposition; improved battery storage will be a key dimension. But less benign technical disruption may occur too. Emerging data on the energy demands of some crypto-currencies – Bitcoin in particular – are staggering, and continued growth of these could eat up energy efficiency gains in other areas.

An important ongoing focus of research will be understanding and documenting the impacts of evolving technologies on the lives and livelihoods of climate vulnerable people, particularly in poor countries with limited resources to respond. Climate changes already under way, including aridification and rising sea levels, will force migration, with huge consequences.

Far larger numbers, not forced or able to move, may question the wisdom of investing time, effort and money in developing livelihoods based on natural resources in the face of climate uncertainty.

Growing sustainable urban spaces

Most urbanisation in coming decades will take place in poorer countries. The shape of these processes will determine to a considerable degree the world’s chances of success across the full range of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

If we don’t have inclusive and sustainable cities we can’t make the progress needed. Shaping inclusive and low-emission urban growth will be challenging in poor, low-capacity countries, but is essential for the future of people and planet.

Supporting displaced populations is increasingly becoming an urban governance issue. In 2016, 60 per cent of the world’s refugees were living in urban areas. Delivering inclusive and functional urban societies in the affected areas requires new thinking and capacities for the international humanitarian system.

Automation and inequality

In 2017 we began to explore the potential implications of automation for future societies in the global South; it is clear that there are many plausible futures where technological disruption leads to more unequal and insecure livelihoods.

Policy responses will be needed. In 2018 the challenges will become clearer: how to shape social protection systems to build community as well as individual resilience; how to support smallholder farmers to take advantage of change without risking assets; how to maintain public revenues in the face of technological changes that enable the rich to circumvent national taxation; how to shape education systems to prepare children both for a changing work environment and for the evolving demands of citizenship in a digital world.

Biodiversity, oceans, and a changing public mood

One of the greatest successes of 2017 came late in the year: on 24 December, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution to negotiate a treaty to protect biodiversity in the ‘high seas’ – the areas of the oceans beyond national waters. It is a process that IIED has welcomed as an opportunity to manage the half of the planet’s surface area that is currently ungoverned.

We will support the Least Developed Countries in these negotiations to ensure that the interests of the world’s poorest people will not be eclipsed by those of rich countries with big commercial fishing fleets.

In many parts of the world British broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough’s powerful second ‘Blue Planet’ television series has had an impact on public awareness, highlighting the threats of climate change, plastic pollution and biodiversity loss.

We hope that over 2018 this consciousness will grow stronger, along with an appreciation that preserving biodiversity on coastlines and on land needs approaches which accommodate the needs of local populations, and foster their active participation.

Changing global frameworks for understanding

The SDGs continue to shift the understanding of development among practitioner communities. The SDGs introduced transformational changes in thinking: that development is a universal process applying to all countries, rich and poor and focused on addressing shared challenges; that all dimensions of sustainable development (social, environmental and economic) apply; that reducing inequality should be a fundamental goal of development action.

While implementation by governments is uneven, interest in the SDG processes is growing in many parts of the private sector and investment communities. A key area of future focus will be how to evaluate the effectiveness of policy and action.

We will also see an increased focus on how to integrate environmental rights into human rights more fully – driven in part by the French-led process to establish a Global Compact for the Environment. This process could help to strengthen environmental principles such as the rights of future generations, and the right to a healthy and sustainable environment, in the global understanding of human rights.

Our place in the landscape

All of the currents of change highlighted here will affect IIED’s work. We will focus on ensuring that we can respond to a changing global environment through strengthening our own capacity to learn and adapt.

One exciting opportunity to learn and share comes in June this year, when Gro Harlem Brundtland, the first woman Prime Minister of Norway and former Director-General of the World Health Organization, will present IIED’s 2018 Barbara Ward Lecture. The Barbara Ward Lectures honour IIED’s founder and celebrate outstanding women in development.

This year’s event comes 30 years after the Brundtland Commission’s ‘Our Common Future‘ – a seminal text that still shapes IIED’s values and priorities in 2018.

As we work to meet the challenges of 2018 and beyond, the Brundtland Commission’s message on addressing the twin issues of environment and development resonates as strongly as ever: “These problems cannot be treated separately by fragmented institutions and policies.”

We look forward to building new networks and partnerships to help us make our best contribution to the challenges ahead.

While still in the development stages, the initiative will build on the principles of The New Plastics Economy. It will see businesses, industry, governments, local authorities, NGOs, media and society as a whole come together to redefine what is possible and create a plastic system that works — a circular economy where plastic is valued and never becomes waste.

As the first step in implementing the New Plastics Economy, the initiative will initially focus on plastic packaging, namely eliminating the use of single-use plastics and ensuring that all plastic packaging is reusable, recyclable or compostable. WRAP and EMF have also identified the need to improve recycling infrastructure, increase recycled content in plastic packaging to drive demand for recycled material, and engage citizens around recycling plastic waste.

“Creating a circular economy for plastics amounts to a huge opportunity for the economy as well as providing a longer-term benefit for the environment. Achieving it will require close collaboration and significant commitment from industry, government and society at large. We are delighted to work with WRAP to unleash such collaboration here in the UK, as a first national implementation initiative of our global New Plastics Economy initiative,” said Dame Ellen MacArthur.

“So far, the solutions to plastic waste have been piecemeal,” said Marcus Gover, CEO at WRAP. “I am pleased to be leading this holistic initiative which will transform the UK’s plastics system. Working with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, we will bring together every ‘body, business and organization’ involved in the life-cycle of plastics to make the move from a throwaway culture to one where resources are used over and over again.”

As in The New Plastics Economy, EMF and WRAP have highlighted the need for stakeholders at all levels — from those producing plastics to those collecting, sorting and recycling it to those using it — to rally around the cause.

Work is now underway to engage all parties, agree on the ambitions and set up the initiative. EMF and WRAP expect to launch the initiative in full in the spring.","While still in the development stages, the initiative will build on the principles of The New Plastics Economy.

The transition is being driven by changing demographics, preferences and technology.

Frost & Sullivan’s Latin America New Mobility Business Models, Forecast to 2023 explores the market for, and impact of, new business models in Latin America, and analyzes the growing trends in shared and integrated mobility towards 2023, focusing on Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico.

The analysis finds that mobility solutions such as eHailing, bike sharing and integrated mobility are experiencing significant growth following enthusiastic consumer adoption. Between 2016 and 2023, bike sharing is expected to experience a 100 percent growth in bike volumes, while the car sharing fleet is set to experience a tenfold increase. According to Frost & Sullivan, eHailing is one of the fastest growing new mobility business models in Latin America, and is expected to generate $34 billion by 2025. Uber, 99Taxis and Cabify are playing a key role in driving this trend.

But consumers aren’t the only ones to embrace new mobility solutions. Municipalities are also looking for ways to incorporate new mobility services within the modality mix. It is, therefore, imperative for stakeholders in the mobility value chain to develop innovative business model solutions to achieve long-term business sustainability and create new avenues for revenue growth.

“Wide-scale disruption with the entry of new mobility business models is heavily impacting traditional market structures and the positioning of traditional ecosystem participants among the new competition. This leads to changes in terms of regulations, investments and market structure,” said Yeswant Abhimanyu, Latin America Mobility Research Manager.

“It is vital for stakeholders to discuss how these new solutions aimed at the better use of existing structures can be included as a part of the public and private mobility mix. In addition, investment in infrastructure in order to enable more integrated and cost-effective services, through direct and indirect incentives, is pivotal. Infrastructure is the bedrock of a well-functioning mobility.”

While shared mobility is on the rise, there remains a focus on traditional modes of mobility, namely personal vehicle ownership. Investments and developments in traditional modes of transport and related infrastructure, and a transition towards technology supported mobility, will continue to be significant, laying the necessary foundation for the offering of new mobility business models.

Fast food giant McDonald’s and major supermarkets in the UK are rising to the challenge, revealing big plans to go plastic-free.

First, McDonald’s has unveiled plans to improve its packaging and drastically reduce waste. By 2025, 100 percent of the company’s guest packaging will come from renewable, recycled or certified (preferably by the Forest Stewardship Council) sources.

“As the world’s largest restaurant company, we have a responsibility to use our scale for good to make changes that will have a meaningful impact across the globe,” said Francesca DeBiase, Chief Supply Chain and Sustainability Officer at McDonald’s.

“Our customers have told us that our packaging waste is the top environmental issue they would like us to address. Our ambition is to make changes our customers want and use less packaging, sourced responsibly and designed to be taken care of after use, working at and beyond our restaurants to increase recycling and help create cleaner communities.”

Currently, 50 percent of McDonald’s customer packaging and 64 percent of its fiber-based packing come from renewable, recycled or certified sources. By 2020, the company intends for 100 percent of its fiber-based packaging to come from recycled or certified sources where no deforestation occurs.

As part of this goal, McDonald’s will eliminate the use of polystyrene foam packaging globally by the end of 2018, a move prompted by engagement by shareholder advocacy group As You Sow. McDonald’s phased out foam cups for hot beverages in the United States after engagement with As You Sow in 2012, but continued to use them in foreign markets. According to a statement on its corporate website, the company said that eliminating foam is an important step “that will continue to raise the bar for our system and our industry.”

In addition to more sustainable sourcing, the fast food giant has also set a goal to recycle 100 percent of its restaurant packaging. Currently, only 10 percent of McDonald’s restaurants are recycling customer packaging globally. The company has attributed this largely to differences in recycling infrastructure, regulations and consumer behavior from country to country, but says it is determined to overcome these challenges and “be part of the solution and help influence powerful change.”

Meanwhile, two British supermarkets have committed to eliminate single-use plastics from own-brand products — and are challenging others to do the same.

Earlier this week, Iceland, a store specializing in frozen food, committed to becoming the world’s first major retailer to replace all plastic packaging from its own-brand products with fully recyclable paper and pulp-based alternatives by 2023.

The company has already removed plastic disposable straws from its own-label range, and its new food ranges, which are set to hit shelves in early 2018, will feature paper-based rather than plastic food trays. Iceland says it will be consulting regularly with Greenpeace and its own-label suppliers throughout the five-year transition period.

“The onus is on retailers, as leading contributors to plastic packaging pollution and waste, to take a stand and deliver meaningful change. Other supermarkets, and the retail industry as a whole, should follow and offer similar commitments during 2018. This is a time for collaboration,” said Richard Walker, Managing Director of Iceland.

“There really is no excuse anymore for excessive packaging that creates needless waste and damages our environment. The technologies and practicalities to create less environmentally harmful alternatives exist, and so Iceland is putting a stake in the ground.”

In a similar move, Waitrose has announced that it will stop selling packs of disposable straws from September 2018.

“Phasing out packs of single-use straws shows how seriously we are taking the challenge of reducing our impact on the environment,” said Tor Harris, Head of Sustainability at Waitrose. “While removing packs of straws from sale seems a small step, the impact on the environment all adds up. Instead of selling packs of plastic straws, Waitrose is working on sourcing paper equivalents.”

The company has also pledged to remove black plastic from its own-label food by 2019.

Currently, a significant amount of black plastic used by supermarkets for food packaging cannot be recycled as lasers used by waste processors cannot sense the color effectively. This means they are not identified for recycling. From the end of 2018, all Waitrose own-label meat, fish and produce will no longer be packaged in black trays. The company has already removed 65 percent of black plastic packaging from fresh fruit and vegetables.

By 2025, Waitrose intends to make all its brand-owned packaging widely recyclable, reusable or compostable. Since 2009, it has reduced its overall packaging by nearly 50 percent.

The announcements from Iceland and Waitrose coincide with a new investigation by The Guardian into supermarket plastics. The news outlet found that major supermarkets in the UK produce more than 800,000 tons of plastic packaging waste each year.

Under an EU directive, supermarket chains such as Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Waitrose and Asda are required to disclose the amount of plastic they put on the market annually. However, the dirty details are not made public and the majority of retailers aren’t interested in sharing. The Guardian and environmental consulting firm Eunomia were, therefore, required to base the study on data provided by Aldi and Co-op and publicly available market share information. According to Dominic Hogg, chairman of Eunomia, the lack of data means the study’s findings grossly underestimate the amount of plastic packaging waste produced by food retailers annually.

While supermarket chains such as Morrisons and Lidl say the information is “commercially sensitive,” critics reason that greater transparency would provide companies with a competitive advantage and help drive down plastic production. Iain Ferguson, Head of Sustainability at Co-op, believes government has an important role to play in pushing the needle forward on transparency and referenced a system currently in place in France, where supermarkets are taxed less for using sustainable and recyclable packaging, and more for using materials that aren't. “There should be a fiscal system that rewards good recyclability and penalizes poor recyclability. We should be able to replicate it in some way in the UK,” Ferguson said.

Others, such as Louise Edge, senior oceans campaigner for Greenpeace UK, are calling for the reform of producer responsibility laws. “Under the current system, just 10 percent of the cost of packaging waste disposal is paid by business, with taxpayers left to pick up the rest of the bill,” Edge said.

Hogg agreed, saying that the existing system promotes “producer irresponsibility” rather than stewardship. “If we had a system where producers were charged fees that were modulated to reflect their environmental impact — and where the fees covered the full costs of managing packaging — we would influence the design of packaging and could specify high quality recycling infrastructure.”

The UK’s new 25 Year Environment Plan, which includes goals to eradicate avoidable plastic waste by 2042, could be the push the industry needs to settle on a more sustainable path by providing the right policy context to create long-term change.","With an estimated 12 million tons of plastic waste entering the world’s oceans each year, consumers and governments are increasingly looking to businesses to eliminate plastic packaging.
Fast food giant McDonald’s and major supermarkets in the UK are rising to the challenge, revealing big plans to go plastic-free.
“Our customers have told us that our packaging waste is the top environmental issue they would like us to address.
“The onus is on retailers, as leading contributors to plastic packaging pollution and waste, to take a stand and deliver meaningful change.

Professor Ricardo García-Mira is currently a Member of the Parliament of Spain, and is the Spokesperson of the Commission for the Study of Climate Change. He is a Professor of Social and Environmental Psychology at the University of A Coruna, and a Visiting Professor at the IPR, as well as the President of the International Association for People-Environment Studies.

Over the past few decades we have accumulated enough scientific evidence to show that our resource-intensive patterns and the resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inevitably lead to a greater scarcity of resources, an appreciable loss of biodiversity and a climate change that is already clearly showing disastrous effects on our lives. Current patterns of production and consumption are not sustainable and are already responsible for problems that are complex to solve – and interconnected with each other. This makes it a priority for any political leader to find the most appropriate ways to introduce a new scenario of ecological transition towards a more sustainable economic model.

The economic crisis has led to a deep recession in many parts of Europe and has underlined the need for a profound transformation of our economic institutions and government in an intelligent, sustainable and inclusive direction. Europe today faces a challenge: in addition to developing sufficient capacities to improve well-being, providing decent employment, reducing inequality, combatting poverty and preserving the natural environment, it must also manage natural resources efficiently and responsibly. It must decarbonise the economy and promote alternative lifestyles less dependent on carbon.

Growth, consumption and well-being

The ways of life in the global North, derived from an increase in wealth, have brought with them intensive consumption of resources that directly affect climate change – and despite the evidence, which shows that materialism imposes a high price on individual welfare, such consumption is still our reference point for what well-being is.

Climate change is now beginning to raise questions about the assumptions on which current socio-economic growth is sustained. It is well known that our lifestyles do not seem to lead to the expected promise of happiness or a more tranquil life. On the contrary, citizens experience more and more pressure on their time, less well-being, and at the same time they realise that our ecological footprint is increasing and that our ways of life are unsustainable.

Recent studies (e.g. Soper, 2007; Kasser & Sheldon, 2009; Kasser, 2011; Unanue et al., 2014) show that citizens of western countries experience a growing sense of dissatisfaction with the current consumer lifestyle and with the accelerated pace of modern life. Hence the equation of economic consumption with welfare has led to a dissociation between economic growth and environmental impact, involving strategies to improve the efficiency of resources on the supply side. Technological advances and carbon prices have been considered key aspects of transitions to a green economy, and all kinds of eco-efficiency strategies and mechanisms have been put in place to clean up production processes and make them more ecological and greener. However, cleaner production processes have not produced the expected effect. Rather, they have generated increases in the levels of real consumption, cancelling out the positive effects that could be rationally expected from a cleaner production process. This makes it clear that the strategies of action for production processes should be complemented by changes in consumption patterns and the reduction of resource consumption levels, while promoting a supply that is more focused on alternative patterns.

New scenarios of consumption reduction

There is a great concern throughout Europe about how new scenarios of consumption reduction might impact the economy, and how the changes that these scenarios elicit could influence employment and its distribution; the balance between work and free time; and, in general, everything that produces a negative impact. It is necessary to be aware of these new scenarios, along with the conditions, potentials and obstacles so that we can identify our priorities and design the necessary regulatory processes and action protocols. Such processes and protocols will serve as the basis for the transformation of our economic system within the framework of the transition towards a more sustainable society, towards a more sustainable lifestyle. They should also include proposals on the most effective means to support and accelerate the green transition, especially in the fields of energy, water, transport and mobility (see García-Mira et al., 2016), as well as in the energy efficiency of building, agriculture and forest policy. It is urgent that we evaluate the impact that the introduction of urban transformations with solutions based on nature could have on adaptation to climate change, health and well-being, social cohesion and sustainable economic development. This implies implementing a green tax system and incentive programming capable of maintaining a constant process of decarbonisation in the economy.

The European strategy: Sustainable lifestyles and the green economy

In 2009, the European Union, in its commitment to energy efficiency and climate change, approved the Legislative Package on Energy and Climate for 2013-2020, consisting of a set of directives that set specific objectives to increase energy efficiency and reduce emissions in production and management for the horizon of 2020. In response to the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel of Experts on Climate Change, the European Council recognised that by 2050 Europe and the developed countries should have reduced emissions by around 80-95% in comparison to the values of 1990 if we want to keep the increase in the average temperature below 2ºC, which coincides with the objective of the 2015 Paris Agreement. If we analyse current trends, it is likely that by the time the necessary changes are made in our technological processes to reduce the impact of climate change and help less developed countries to mitigate the negative externalities that they will have to face, we will still be far from the adoption of truly sustainable lifestyles being a fact on a large scale.

Sustainability initiatives that mitigate the impact of climate change

This being the general panorama, if we put the focus on the local level, there are initiatives in multiple places in Europe that are opening up spaces for a series of ecologically responsible activities (ecovillages, cities in transition, consumer cooperatives and organic food production, institutional programmes for equilibrium between work and private life, cooperatives with climate and energy models, sustainable textile production, etc.), and which are demonstrating the small-scale viability of alternative economic models, such as research carried out within the Europe 2020 Strategy and the European Strategy for Resource Efficiency have shown.

Such research analyses different sustainability initiatives in Europe (see García-Mira and Dumitru, 2017) and shows that, although the collective responses to addressing climate change are not yet articulated, there is enough evidence to ensure that it is possible to move towards a more sustainable economy. This is true even though the challenges of behavioral change and support for the dissemination of sustainable lifestyles on a large scale would require a 180º change in the still-deeply rooted conceptions of what success, self-realisation and consumption mean for the majority of citizens.

The leap that these sustainable lifestyle initiatives will need to make from the micro to the macro requires alternative models that make the current understanding more complex regarding the interaction of social, economic, technological and psychological factors that either promote or restrict the adoption of sustainable lifestyles.

Sustainability, governance and the joint generation of knowledge

The transition to a sustainable lifestyle requires important urban transformations whose main goal is to guarantee an increase in the efficiency of resource management, an improvement in the quality of life and greater environmental resilience. The question of a changing lifestyle naturally involves the places and urban spaces where that life unfolds. The adaptation of cities, therefore, is a priority to be addressed, together with an exploration of the ways in which transformations take place in a sustainable direction, a need that has never been so urgent. We need to think about the most appropriate models, strategies and mechanisms, and consider which governance patterns are most appropriate, reflecting on how power constellations work and how to involve civil society organisations more.

In addition, it is urgent to highlight the importance of researchers, citizens and politicians jointly contributing to the creation of knowledge; this also challenges universities, by reinforcing the link between research and politics, while reinforcing the idea of transforming cities into more sustainable places to live. Close collaboration with citizens, professionals and politicians is characteristic of transdisciplinary research which seeks to guarantee the relevance and transfer of research results to society. Given that effective approaches to climate change require the contribution of all of us, the solutions must be built together, with the involvement of a variety of actors, and that makes the need clear to consider professionals, politicians and civil society in its multiple forms of organisation and manifestation. A new paradigm of knowledge development is therefore needed, based on methodologies that integrate citizens, users, politicians and stakeholders within an integral system of cogenerating knowledge.

A space for social innovation and participation

The creation of an appropriate space for innovation and social participation is also demanded here, where social innovation can emerge as the result of the creative processes that arise from the encounters between the different actors. Creating new spaces in which different disciplines and actors can establish common terms of reference and a shared language is absolutely necessary. But perhaps it is even more important, in addition to a shared language, to share the idea that the social and the environmental – when based on knowledge of the social sciences – can contribute to improving society. Social innovation refers here to introducing changes in the relationships between actors and institutions that incorporate new ways of approaching problems such as environmental migration, unemployment, energy poverty, climate change, inequality, marginalisation and difficulties in accessing certain services. These are new ways of responding to social needs that are not adequately covered when they fall under the exclusive responsibility of public institutions.

Social innovation initiatives experiment with new models of local economy and community relations, and are proving to be viable alternatives to existing modes of social, economic and political organisation. These social innovation initiatives also aim to empower local communities, generating international networks that are implementing changes towards a social and solidarity-based economy, towards the sustainability of our lifestyles and towards democratic regeneration. One of the most important characteristics of this new approach is that it involves bringing together different actors with different opinions, agendas, languages and expectations. Finally, it demands a consensus in the model of governance, which implies commitment to the implementation of participation mechanisms in order to build community policies.

Green Building United is on the case,"In 2002, when the concept of green building practices was still, well, green, a small group of builders, architects, engineers and planners founded the Delaware Valley Green Building Council to promote sustainable design and construction.

Now the organization has changed its name to Green Building United and embarked on the Philadelphia 2030 District initiative, a major new public-private partnership to drastically reduce energy and water consumption, and emissions generated by buildings in Philadelphia.

“The new name as well as the decision to launch the Philadelphia 2030 District further emphasize our organization’s commitment to creating a healthier built environment,” says Green Building United Executive Director Alex Dews. “[It also] acknowledges that the majority of buildings that will be here in 50 years are already built. Our new name reflects our storied commitment to promoting sustainable and healthy buildings. It also better aligns with our organization’s expansion since we joined forces with the local Living Building Challenge and Passive House communities earlier this year.”

The 2030 District is part of a network of 18 such districts in the U.S. and Canada, representing more than 358 million square feet of commercial real estate, and providing participants with access to shared strategies, best practices and other resources to achieve cost savings while lessening environmental impact.

“Due to a lack of federal support, it’s now more important than ever for cities to join the national initiative to create healthier, more sustainable buildings,” explains Dews.

The Philadelphia 2030 District, launched in late October, already has more than 15 million square feet of space in Center City and West Philadelphia pledged to cut energy and water usage, and transportation emissions by 50 percent by 2030. Early participants include Brandywine Realty Trust, a large commercial real estate holder that has committed its entire property portfolio, SEPTA, the School District of Philadelphia and Drexel University.

“In Philadelphia, more than 60 percent of the carbon emissions that cause climate change are produced by the building sector,” says Dews. “An average building wastes 30 percent of its energy. By making an investment in Philadelphia’s 2030 District, we will work with the City to improve its built environment while creating an opportunity to reduce the region’s climate impact.”

Imagine this scenario repeated all over the world through a shared commitment to transform schools into so-called solution hubs as one way to lessen the gap between knowledge and action when it comes to climate change.

Every environmentalist I know emphasizes the critical role of education in addressing climate change, so let’s use the climate crisis as an opportunity to imagine and develop resources that offer students hope and practical solutions to address the complex environmental issues that await them.

As a documentary filmmaker and educator, I have taught media courses about food sustainability, environmental justice and climate change for many years. “So what can we actually do about this?” is the desperate refrain I often hear from students eager to help.

Critical solutions such as eliminating plane travel, red meat or plastic highlight individual decisions and morality but fail to stress the need for collective action. Even using the word “solution” feels awkward given how entangled we are with existing energy systems and a capitalist web of consumption.

It’s easy to feel overwhelmed or complicit, which is why we need alternate stories and guideposts to figure out what to do once we begin to see the scale of our climate dilemma.

Collaborative and interactive storytelling

In response to a need to represent do-able but diverse solutions, I initiated a collaborative online documentary, The Shore Line, to profile the efforts of ordinary people taking actions along our global coast. I involved filmmakers and students across five continents, and together we filmed 43 video profiles over three years.

The goal was to focus on everyday individuals, doable solutions, and to weave hope into each narrative even if the solutions were temporary or incomplete. We cast a wide net, exploring coastal challenges through the lived experiences of artists, scientists, architects, lawyers, activists and educators from nine countries.

To accompany the video profiles, we developed interactive maps with sea level sliders in each storybook page.

We developed an interactive atlas of coastal density and mangrove growth to spotlight future risks to coastal ecosystems.

Our method of involving students and filmmakers from around the world and inviting users to engage with a dynamic platform was the first stage in our process of participatory documentary.

The next stage is sharing this resource with educators. We are currently collaborating with teachers on a range of strategy tool kits under themes such as community resilience, or Indigenous resurgence that are featured in the database area of the site.

We are also developing a set of workshop cards on a range of subjects including environmental journalism and speculative futures that teachers can download. An area called educator’s exchange will spotlight how teachers are using the site and making change. Flood views at the end of each chapter warn users of what some of our largest coastal cities may look like in the near future if we don’t get involved.

Shorelines are powerful and disruptive

Throughout the project, I saw the shoreline as both a frontline and a potent metaphor. More than half the world’s population lives within 60 kilometres of the sea, and three-quarters of all large cities are located on the coast.

Shorelines are powerful, disruptive and awe-inspiring and remind us that we need to rethink the logics that have fuelled unsustainable growth along our global coasts. Our coasts are a frontline for disasters and they are also the frontline of resistance.

At each stage of production, I had lingering concerns. Had we translated the raw data we had at our fingertips into an emotionally resonant experience that would inspire youth to action?

Would we reach enough educators to ensure the project was relevant? And how might we share the follow up to the stories so that students could learn from failed solutions or ongoing challenges?

Building alternative futures through action and resistance

How can we foster the necessary skills for collaboration and community care in our schools? How do we balance the urgent need to act with the need to build resilient, sustainable classrooms and communities? And can a documentary interactive help to construct alternative futures?

For our team, the work of getting The Shore Line into classrooms has just begun. And importantly, the goal of the project is not to “deliver” a ready-made project or solution, but to use the project to incite more collaborative endeavours and to encourage more teachers, students and organizers to pilot their own local solutions through hands-on initiatives.

The Shore Line introduced our team to outstanding individuals across five continents and left us with many insights on communicating climate change and finding solutions.

To begin with, we realized that most of us cannot easily grasp the global threat of climate change, but instantly understand how storms and flooding result in devastation that can include lost loved ones, homes, crops, opportunities and cultures.

We saw that a majority of remarkable solutions are coming from countries with minimal resources and from women and youth.

We need to rethink development from pure economics to terms that address social inequalities and take into consideration the living shorelines we depend on for survival.

The other day, a student in my class asked me when we might see a shift or swell of consciousness around climate change, like the civil rights movement or women’s movements, that will prompt us to act more responsibly towards the planet. I encouraged her to start imagining it and then take the first step towards it.

This is what The Shore Line offered my students and collaborators in the process of production: One small step towards a future we want to defend, together.","As a documentary filmmaker and educator, I have taught media courses about food sustainability, environmental justice and climate change for many years.

Residents have been subject to evictions for at least two decades as city officials have tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to redevelop the area for business or tourism. The neighborhoods are also in the part of the city that is most susceptible to floods and sinking.

Although evictions have temporarily stopped during the administration of Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan, the question remains whether people should live there at all, when the northern parts of the city are sinking so fast. Are the riverside kampungs simply doomed?

One young Indonesian architect doesn't think so. Kamil Muhammad, 32 years old and based in Jakarta, designed a sustainable model home in Kampung Tongkol that has been housing seven families for two years as of January 2018.

As part of Architecture Sans Frontieres Indonesia, Muhammad oversaw the construction of a three-story home built of brick and bamboo that overlooks a branch of the Ciliwung. Residents of the community helped to build and paint it. It's a unique structure, but Muhammad sees it as a template for other innovative housing in these neighborhoods, which he says need not be just preserved or saved, but also improved and beautified.

A model home

Tongkol resident and civil society activist Gugun Muhammad approached Kamil Muhammad (no relation) in 2015 with the idea to brainstorm a better kampung home. They met during a community mapping project called ""Peta Jakarta.""

""We came here to build a pilot house but then realized there were bigger issues at play,"" said Kamil Muhammad. ""Trying to avert evictions quickly took over.""

Everyone in Tongkol had already abruptly ""trimmed"" their houses five meters from the street because of a sudden regulation related to flood prevention. Even today, tiles can be seen up and down the main road in Tongkol that suddenly cut off mid-design. Kamil Muhammad and his colleagues from the University of Indonesia organized community workshops and started mapping the kampung's assets.

Tiles end abruptly where residents had to shave fi Tiles end abruptly where residents had to shave five meters off the fronts of their homes in Kampung Tongkol, Indonesia. Tiles end abruptly where residents had to shave five meters off the fronts of their homes in Kampung Tongkol, Indonesia.

""That's when we realized everyone wanted different things, but what bonded them was the idea of not getting evicted,"" Muhammad said.

This was during the administration of the controversial Jakarta governor Basuki ""Ahok"" Tjahaha Purnama, who tried to evict several kampungs in the area for tourism development, an issue that flared up during the 2017-18 gubernatorial election. The model home was built in three months with a grant from the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights.

There are benefits to preserving these riverside communities that go beyond preservation for its own sake. There are dozens of heritage Dutch colonial buildings in the area, which the kampung residents can help preserve.

""This is in line with cutting-edge conservation and heritage preservation,"" Muhammad said.

Residents of Tongkol have also taken control of their stretch of the river by installing their own septic tanks, so a sense of pride and ownership can have a cascade effect.

""You want to make sure communities are really living here, instead of it being an open-air museum,"" Muhammad said.

Gugun Muhammad, his wife (who grew up in the kampung), and his two children are one of the seven families who live there today.

""It's really excellent,"" he said. ""It makes the whole neighborhood proud.""

A community ecosystem

A kampung differs from a middle-class neighborhood because of the high degree of its residents' interdependence, Kamil Muhammad said.

""It's not about a place to sleep; it's an ecosystem. Middle-class people have very high social mobility; we make friends with whoever we want. In a kampung, you work and socialize with your immediate neighbors. So, the idea of architecture must be fundamentally different,"" he said.

The third story of the model home is made of bamboo, which is light and flexible. Kampung homes tend to be pressed up against each other, which helps them support each other but also requires a clever hand with materials.

On a recent sunny weekday, Subiana, now in her 50s, sold coffee from a riverside shop she has run for decades; Saidi, a three-decade Tongkol resident and retired cab driver, cast a watchful eye on the youngest kampung kids who were running up and down the street, not yet bound to the classroom; and Gugun's wife, Ina, threaded together silver bracelets that she and some other women would take to the market the next day.

Saidi pointed to the kampung across the river and recalled, ""We used to cross on stilts, and now we have boats, to visit our friends on the other side.""

It was exactly the kind of ""sidewalk ballet"" that urban theorist Jane Jacobs famously extolled of the possibilities of city life. Just after lunch, a surprisingly strong earthquake from West Java shook the ground beneath everyone's feet for 20 seconds. The ballet paused — and then everyone laughed it off and went about their day.","The view from the top of the sustainable housing p The view from the top of the sustainable housing prototype is seen in Kampung Tongkol, Indonesia.

She quickly realized that there was a large demand for this type of learning, and the 260-acre farm has since hosted 30 intensive workshops in what they call a “living classroom.”

The farm consists of outdoor gardens, a hoop greenhouse, and a geodesic dome greenhouse. On the farm live herds of sheep, cattle, pigs, goats, and chickens, with an animal barn, industrial kitchen and farm store. There are also 10 small yurts that act as student housing, and one large yurt for classroom learning. All of this is surrounded by the nearby Hay River, fields, forests and ponds.

Farming in the NFTI focuses on regenerative, holistically-grown food that improves the health of the land and wildlife. The farm is completely organic and uses tactics like minimal tillage, and supporting biodiversity and soil health to help maintain a healthy environment. The farm grows a variety of berries, cherries, herbs, greens, carrots, beets, beans, potatoes, radishes and cruciferous vegetables.

To further support a healthy community, NFTI uses produce that is being thrown out by local grocery stores to feed their pigs. In the fall, they teach wool washing, felting and dying. Pigs are used to help clear land for farming, and sheep help weed and fertilize pasture areas. They also work with animals that are more comfortable in colder climates, like Iceland Sheep and yaks, rather than the Rambouillet sheep and Angus cattle so familiar in the US.

During the winter, with just six daylight hours, aurora borealis overhead and a sunset at 3:45 pm, the Northern Farm Training Institute doesn’t sit back and take January off. They grow seedlings inside their greenhouses, using snow to water the plants. The sunlight bouncing off the snow outside creates an ideal lighting effect for the growing plants. And the farm collects and uses discarded shredded paper from local communities to keep the animals warm. They also teach cheesemaking classes and food storage classes.

The farm’s goal can be summed up as this: “Together we can transform Canada’s north. Regenerative agriculture provides the key to our food security, economic growth, and environmental restoration.” If you’d like to check the farm out, you can stop on by, either as a visitor, student or volunteer.

‘Smart Farms’ Making Thai Agriculture Sufficient and Sustainable

By Kalinga Seneviratne

This article is the 20th in a series of joint productions of Lotus News Features and IDN-InDepthNews, flagship of the International Press Syndicate.

CHANTHABURI, Thailand (IDN) – Thai farmers are going back to basics under a “Smart Farms” formula supported by modern information communication technology (ICT) integrated into a Buddhist concept of ‘sufficiency economy’ to make the kingdom’s lifeblood – agriculture and its small-scale farmers – sustainable into the foreseeable future.

“Some farmers use chemical fertiliser to get more fruits [from their trees] (but) their trunks die in three to five years. We use organic fertiliser here and our trunks will last for 30 years” said farmer Sittipong Yanaso, speaking to IDN at his lush multi-cropping durian plantation here.

“We get enough dry leaves for our fertiliser,” he added, pointing to the green mountains surrounding his plantation. Showing the banana plants growing in between his durian trees, he explained that the trunks are used after harvesting the fruits, a technique that has been handed down from ancestors.

Sittipong’s durian plantation also has banana, papaya, rabuttan, mangostean, pepper, coconut and longon plants, which serve to give him an income in between his durian harvests. Recently he has planted some coffee and has a small area of rubber trees that adds to his income. He has also planted bamboo as wind-breakers and the tall bamboo tree trunks provide him material as support for banana trees (when fruits bloom) as well as for picking fruits.

“This is a very mindful orchard,” argues Professor Kamolrat Intaratat, Director of the Centre of Communication and Development Knowledge Management (CCDKM), whose organisation has assisted Sittipong in adopting ICTs to improve his knowledge of organic farming and marketing.

“The philosophy of CCDKM is that we work with conceptual base integration and a partnership model, working with marginal people,” explained Kamolrat, after accompanying IDN on a tour of the farm. “Most important is to create income generating projects… the majority of Thais are small farmers, so we look at how to use ICT to facilitate smart farming in Thailand.”

Kamolrat went on to explain that farmers are trained in ICT literacy and how to access information. “After that we train how to analyse this information (to know) the price of the farm product, and they gain access to many farm pricing [models] … from the government, private and export markets. Farmers can then decide what is the best price for them to sell the product.”

“We show how ICTs can be used with the organic ecological farming systems … Smart farming is not only about ICTs, but also mindset and innovative processes in managing their farms.”

At the end of 2015, around 35 percent of the Thai workforce was engaged in agriculture, mainly as small-scale rural farmers. To safeguard Thailand’s rural farmers and make their livelihood sustainable, the Thai government has introduced many programmes in recent years under the philosophy of ‘sufficiency economics’, which was first mooted by the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej in 1998, when the kingdom faced a grave economic crisis.

Drawing on Thailand’s deep Buddhist tradition, this concept emphasises the ‘middle way’ – the importance of balance. Both sustainability and sufficiency are at the core of this philosophy, with human development as its principle aim. Sharing (knowledge and resources) rather than competition and exploitation are important aspects of this system.

The Thai government has thus been promoting the formation of area-specific farmers’ cooperatives using notions are similar to the ‘risk management’ and ‘stakeholder’ philosophy in Western economics which came into prominence in the 1990s.

To improve the livelihood sustainability of the rural sector, the Thai government has laid out a number of measures under this philosophy, such as loans through village funds and village development programmes for the improvement of people’s livelihood through Pracharat grassroots projects.

One of the campaigns under the Pracharat (“state of the people”) approach is a scheme developed with Kasetsart University and the Thai Chamber of Commerce to develop the “Thai GAP” standard, which is a system for fruit and vegetable safety according to good agricultural practices (GAP), which takes into consideration the quality of land management, soil, seedlings, water management, fertilising, pest management, consumer safety and environmental protection.

Once certified by Thai GAP, producers will receive their own QR Code so that smartphone users (consumers) can find information about the product. This initiative is a way of uplifting the farming sector into the digital era where consumers who want healthy products can reach farmers directly.

CCDKM has been working with ‘Smart Farmers’ to gain this GAP certification and Sittipong’s farm is one of those that have achieved this status. “For most of the GAP (certified) farmers, their produce is not enough for the demand because people are now very concerned about their health,” said Kamolrat. However, “durain and banana in this farm have pre-orders … right now the durian orchard is already booked three months in advance.”

“Our farm is very self-sufficient. Right now the demand is so much we can’t satisfy all,” confirms Sittipong’s wife Narisara. She explained that the farm’s sufficiency is achieved through maximising family labour that includes her daughter and son-in-law.

“We don’t use outside labour. We plan our farm well,” she added, showing her banana plantations where “we get a regular income (in between durian harvests) because we space out planting.”

She also added that the use of ICTs has helped the family to market its produce profitably and obtain a higher price for its fruits, especially supermarkets buying its bananas at a premium price “given that GAP certification indicates it is export quality.”

Sittipong told IDN that he is able to keep his income from the durain harvest “in the bank” because he obtains a substantial income from others crops such as banana, pepper and coconut spread throughout the year.

Sittipong has now become an e-agriculture evangelist in the region, converting other farmers to the sufficiency and sustainable philosophy of organic farming. He points out that even if you buy fertiliser from outside, organic fertiliser costs one-third of its chemical counterpart, so that when other farmers visit his farm and observe his comfortable lifestyle, it is not difficult to be converted.

“This is a pilot farm to tell others that even if you have a husband and wife team, you can do your own farm,” said Kamolrat. “What is important is to plan your crop all the time.”

Meanwhile, the Thai government has begun to spread its sufficiency economics development philosophy overseas. When Thailand took the chair of the Group of 77 developing countries in January 2016, Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai told member states that the ‘sufficiency economics’ model on holistic farm management could be adopted by most of them to achieve all the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

He pointed out that this philosophy is at the core of SDG 12 which calls for reasonable consumption and production, and its ability to provide food security aligns well with SDG 1 on eliminating poverty and SDG 2 on eliminating hunger. [IDN-InDepthNews – 28 January 2018]

In fact, his parents, who were postal workers and raised him in San Francisco, were active members of their local chapter. Glover, 71, known for such films as The Color Purple, Angels in the Outfield and the Lethal Weapon franchise, has carried on and expanded his parents’ work, spending decades involved with community and labor activism, advocating for economic justice and education, in particular.

The actor — whose recent work includes exec producing the Oscar shortlisted crime documentary Strong Island as well as starring in Proud Mary with Taraji P. Henson and the upcoming Old Man & The Gun with Robert Redford — will be honored with the President’s Award at the NAACP Image Awards, which highlight the work of people of color in film, TV and other fields.

How did your upbringing shape your activism?

For me growing up, it was quite fortuitous that everything that was happening in the civil rights movement was in some sense a part of my family discourse. [My parents] celebrated those moments, and since my mother is from the Deep South — a small town called Louisville, Georgia — for me, the civil rights movements played out both in the South and in my own city. It was a key period in my maturation as a child in understanding the importance of things that were important.

When you look back on your career, is there a role that was especially memorable?

Places in the Heart, which was my first major role. It’s the film that’s dedicated to my mother, who passed away on the day, Aug. 22 [in 1983], that I was told I received the role.

You stay busy when it comes to acting. How do you decide what roles to take?

The work that’s done with Louverture Films [Glover’s production company] has opened my idea of the possibility of film. We’ve explored topics like the war on drugs in The House I Live In and climate change in This Changes Everything. The projects that I do, as an actor, are generated from the work that’s available, and I’m fortunate to be able to continue to work. The fact is, whatever my activity as a citizen working with unions or other work, I’m still an actor, and I love acting as much as I loved it from the first moment I decided it was the profession I wanted to be in.

Why were you drawn to executive producing Strong Island?

Yance Ford’s parents were products of the Old South but also products of the new segregation that takes place on Long Island. With this resegregation that happens, you have these enclaves — white enclaves and black enclaves. You can see that happening in cities even today. Strong Island gives us this sense of this other world that they have encountered. Then the death of Yance’s brother unravels the family. For him to make this personal investigation to tell this story of who his brother was, he did a brilliant job. “What is a reasonable threat?” is one of the questions he brings up — that [his brother] represents a threat because he’s black. Historically, we’ve always represented a threat because of the color of our skin.

What advice would you give to young activists who may be experiencing fear or frustration today?

We have to create a culture of sustainable activism. The dynamics in our world are changing rapidly, and new information is in our face all the time. We have new ways of looking at the world. For the young people who will inhabit this planet, it’s essential that we create a culture of sustainable activism.

AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT

William Lucy has worked with Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela

For his decades of work as a labor organizer and justice advocate, William Lucy will be honored with the NAACP’s Chariman’s Award, which recongizes those who “demonstrate exemplary public service and use their distinct platforms to create agents of change.” Previous recipients have included Bono, former Vice President Al Gore and then-Sen. Barack Obama.

Lucy served as the international secretary-treasurer of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees for nearly 40 years, helping union grow from 200,000 to more than 1.4 million members. In that time, he worked with Martin Luther King Jr. during the 1968 Memphis sanitation strike and led a fundraising effort to bring Nelson Mandela on a U.S. tour after the anti-apartheid revolutionary was freed from his 27-year imprisonment in South Africa.

“I am inspired by William Lucy’s activism on a number of civil and human rights issues,” stated Leon W. Russell, chairman of the NAACP National Board of Directors, “and, particulary, that he has not forgotten what it is like to be a person of color in America.”

Glover, 71, known for such films as The Color Purple, Angels in the Outfield and the Lethal Weapon franchise, has carried on and expanded his parents’ work, spending decades involved with community and labor activism, advocating for economic justice and education, in particular. The actor — whose recent work includes exec producing the Oscar shortlisted crime documentary Strong Island as well as starring in Proud Mary with Taraji P. Henson and the upcoming Old Man & The Gun with Robert Redford — will be honored with the President’s Award at the NAACP Image Awards, which highlight the work of people of color in film, TV and other fields. How did your upbringing shape your activism? For me growing up, it was quite fortuitous that everything that was happening in the civil rights movement was in some sense a part of my family discourse. [My parents] celebrated those moments, and since my mother is from the Deep South — a small town called Louisville, Georgia — for me, the civil rights movements played out both in the South and in my own city. It was a key period in my maturation as a child in understanding the importance of things that were important. When you look back on your career, is there a role that was especially memorable? Places in the Heart, which was my first major role. It’s the film that’s dedicated to my mother, who passed away on the day, Aug. 22 [in 1983], that I was told I received the role. You stay busy when it comes to acting. How do you decide what roles to take? The work that’s done with Louverture Films [Glover’s production company] has opened my idea of the possibility of film. We’ve explored topics like the war on drugs in The House I Live In and climate change in This Changes Everything. The projects that I do, as an actor, are generated from the work that’s available, and I’m fortunate to be able to continue to work. The fact is, whatever my activity as a citizen working with unions or other work, I’m still an actor, and I love acting as much as I loved it from the first moment I decided it was the profession I wanted to be in. Why were you drawn to executive producing Strong Island? Yance Ford‘s parents were products of the Old South but also products of the new segregation that takes place on Long Island. With this resegregation that happens, you have these enclaves — white enclaves and black enclaves. You can see that happening in cities even today. Strong Island gives us this sense of this other world that they have encountered. Then the death of Yance’s brother unravels the family. For him to make this personal investigation to tell this story of who his brother was, he did a brilliant job. “What is a reasonable threat?” is one of the questions he brings up — that [his brother] represents a threat because he’s black. Historically, we’ve always represented a threat because of the color of our skin. What advice would you give to young activists who may be experiencing fear or frustration today? We have to create a culture of sustainable activism. The dynamics in our world are changing rapidly, and new information is in our face all the time. We have new ways of looking at the world.

Barack Obama. Lucy served as the international secretary-treasurer of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees for nearly 40 years, helping union grow from 200,000 to more than 1.4 million members.

Danny Glover has a long history with the NAACP. In fact, his parents, who were postal workers and raised him in San Francisco, were active members of their local chapter. Glover, 71, known for such films as The Color Purple, Angels in the Outfield and the Lethal Weapon franchise, has carried on and expanded his parents’ work, spending decades involved with community and labor activism, advocating for economic justice and education, in particular. The actor — whose recent work includes exec producing the Oscar shortlisted crime documentary Strong Island as well as starring in Proud Mary with Taraji P. Henson and the upcoming Old Man & The Gun with Robert Redford — will be honored with the President’s Award at the NAACP Image Awards, which highlight the work of people of color in film, TV and other fields. How did your upbringing shape your activism? For me growing up, it was quite fortuitous that everything that was happening in the civil rights movement was in some sense a part of my family discourse. [My parents] celebrated those moments, and since my mother is from the Deep South — a small town called Louisville, Georgia — for me, the civil rights movements played out both in the South and in my own city. It was a key period in my maturation as a child in understanding the importance of things that were important. When you look back on your career, is there a role that was especially memorable? Places in the Heart, which was my first major role. It’s the film that’s dedicated to my mother, who passed away on the day, Aug. 22 [in 1983], that I was told I received the role. You stay busy when it comes to acting. How do you decide what roles to take? The work that’s done with Louverture Films [Glover’s production company] has opened my idea of the possibility of film. We’ve explored topics like the war on drugs in The House I Live In and climate change in This Changes Everything. The projects that I do, as an actor, are generated from the work that’s available, and I’m fortunate to be able to continue to work. The fact is, whatever my activity as a citizen working with unions or other work, I’m still an actor, and I love acting as much as I loved it from the first moment I decided it was the profession I wanted to be in.

Now consider what that means when there are, as the McD’s likes to boast, over 99 billion served.

In an effort to “improve its packaging and help significantly reduce waste,” the multinational fast food chain has announced a goal to make all packaging come from renewable, recycled or certified sources and to make recycling available in all restaurants by 2025.

“This expands upon McDonald’s existing goal that by 2020, 100% of fiber-based packaging will come from recycled or certified sources where no deforestation occurs,” stated the global food chain.

“As the world’s largest restaurant company, we have a responsibility to use our scale for good to make changes that will have a meaningful impact across the globe,” said Francesca DeBiase, McDonald’s Chief Supply Chain and Sustainability Officer. “Our ambition is to make changes our customers want and to use less packaging, sourced responsibly and designed to be taken care of after use, working at and beyond our restaurants to increase recycling and help create cleaner communities.”

To reach these goals, McDonald’s said it will work with leading industry experts, local governments and environmental associations, to improve packaging and recycling practices.

A post shared by McDonald’s Canada (@mcdonaldscanada) on Jul 20, 2016 at 10:05am PDT

The chain, which once served up burgers in styrofoam clamshells, has already made leaps and bounds.

According to the company, McDonald’s first began its focus on sustainable packaging nearly 25 years ago.

It reports that “currently, 50% of McDonald’s customer packaging comes from renewable, recycled or certified sources and 64 percent of fiber-based packaging comes from certified or recycled sources.”

It also says that an estimated 10% of McDonald’s restaurants globally are recycling customer packaging.

Almost 80 percent of e-waste workers in India suffer from respiratory ailments due to improper standards.

By Urvashi Aneja

The latest Global E-Waste Monitor places India as one of the highest contributors to global e-waste, generating over 2 million metric tonnes in 2016. Posing serious health and environmental risks, growing e-waste represents the hidden cost of our increasingly digital lives in an information society.

With just 33% of the population owning a smart phone, India already has the second largest number of smart phone users in the world, nearly 4 times that of the United States. The amount of e-waste generated will exponentially increase in the coming decade as the cost of consumer electronics decline, middle-class incomes rise, and the frequency at which devices are discarded increases.

As governance instruments are increasingly digitized and industry re-repositions itself to leverage Industry 4.0 solutions, the generation of e-waste will become a byproduct of institutional choices rather than consumer consumption and behavior alone.

India is already a leader in the management and recycling of e-waste. But, over 90 per cent is managed in the unorganized sector by small businesses and individual entrepreneurs, typically from low-income marginalized communities, and often women. E-waste contains various toxic substances such as mercury and lead, prolonged exposure to which can lead to damage of all major body systems.

Almost 80 percent of e-waste workers in India suffer from respiratory ailments due to improper standards and 4-5 lakh children are engaged in e-waste collection without adequate protection and safeguards. The bulk of the dirty and dangerous work supporting our march towards an increasingly digital society is done by those who have the least access to technology gains. Government regulations for the management of e-waste, on the other hand, are becoming more relaxed, presumably as a result of industry pressure. To streamline e-waste management, the government notified Electronic Waste Rules in 2011, based on the concept of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR).

EPR makes manufacturers of electronic products responsible for the end-of-life management of their products, including setting up collection centers. By shifting the burden of EPR to manufacturers, the EPR framework, in theory, creates incentives for more environmentally friendly design. But, the impact of EPR rules on manufacturers have been minimal, at best. The recently released Draft Notification (2017) by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change further relaxes the EPR rule by reducing the e-waste collection targets for industries.

While the efficiency and productivity gains of Digital India are to be welcomed, growing e-waste should draw attention to the broader sustainability of a digital society. Data centers, for example, are one the largest contributors to global warming, contributing a similar amount to global greenhouse emissions as the aviation industry.

This amount is expected to triple in the next decade. In many ways, the sustainability challenge is a ‘wicked problem’ – where possible solutions create a new set of additional challenges and the choice between available alternatives is largely about competing values.

For example, data centers powered by renewable sources of energy such as solar provide a greener alternative, but will also create new forms of e-waste in the form of photovoltaic cells and panels. An unverified estimate suggests that India’s projected solar capacity of 100GW by 2022 will create 7.76 million tonnes of e-waste. Without adequate and preemptive consideration of how this waste should be disposed and recycled, renewable energy solutions can create new negative externalities.

For Digital India to be sustainable, we need to develop anticipatory knowledge for preemptive solutions. It is an opportune moment to think of the broader architecture of a digital society, one that avoids getting locked into unsustainable models of production and consumption, as is the case with many industrialized economies.

The argument that such considerations are premature for India, given high levels of poverty and unemployment, are misplaced. Enquiries into the sustainability of Digital India are no less urgent than the need for sustained job-creating economic growth. These issues should not be addressed in a sequential or linear manner, but in parallel. Else, we will be only partially aware of available choices and their consequences, creating new forms of technological and economic lock-ins.

The value-based choice demanded by the “wicked problem” at hand is one that embraces the idea of a circular economy — one that departs from the linear economic growth model predicated on “take, make, dispose” to embrace a growth model based on creating closed loops of production, consumption, and re-use. A circular economy model is built on the idea of designing out waste and pollution; keeping products and materials in use; and regenerating natural systems. In many ways, India is already a leader in the circular economy.

Alongside, the management of e-waste and other forms of recycling, high levels of repair and reuse are distinctly observable. A number of reports note that the informal waste management sector in India works better than systems in many industrialized economies.

A circular economy vision for Digital India would include organizing informal waste management systems, including safety and social protection initiatives for workers; revising and tightening existent e-waste rules for increased accountability by manufacturers both in terms of durable design and responsible disposal; green data centers; and building future Smart Cities with a view towards energy and water efficiency, among others.

A recent report by the Ellen McArthur Foundation and the World Economic Forum also estimates that a circular economy path to development could bring Indian annual benefits of Rs 40 lakh crore or $624 billion in 2050. Greenhouse gas emissions could also be 44% lower in 2050, compared with current development path.

Unsurprisingly, Nordic countries are leading the way in promoting the idea of a circular economy. Sweden recently announced tax breaks for repair related activities and Finland hosted the first global conference on the circular economy earlier this year. The circular economy provides an opportunity for India to capitalize and leverage an already existing culture of circular activities, and promote it as a policy agenda that will create new forms of employment while facilitating sustainable environmental management.","Almost 80 percent of e-waste workers in India suffer from respiratory ailments due to improper standards.

Kuala Lumpur has hosted the UN Habitat ninth World Urban Forum (WUF9) over the past week. The focus was implementing the New Urban Agenda that the United Nations adopted in December 2016. Urban leaders, business and community organisations and academics came together to share leading practice and knowledge on urban futures.

The forum, the first held in the Asia-Pacific region, brought together 61 national ministers with 30,000 participants. The Australian participants were very disappointed that their government was not represented. We have much to share and learn as one of the world’s most urbanised nations.

Cities can be drivers of change

The conference theme was “Cities for all Cities 2030”. In opening the forum, the new head of UN Habitat, Maimunah Sharif, said:

Cities have the potential to lead a country’s growth, as drivers of sustainability and as tools for social integration and equality. Cities often symbolise hope and possibility. Well-planned, well-managed urbanisation is a tool for development.”

Sharif is one of 24 leaders in urban sustainability interviewed for my recently published book, Sustainable Pathways for Our Cities and Regions: planning within planetary boundaries. A former director of George Town, mayor of Penang and president of Seberang Perai, Sharif has been a champion of sustainable development that is meaningful and works with local communities.

The leaders I interviewed stress the need for clear targets based on a 20- to 30-year urban vision with well-defined sustainable outcomes. Examples include the 100% Renewable Energy cities alliance (including Canberra), more cycling than cars in Copenhagen (with a target of 50% cycling to work and studies by 2050), and the UN Habitat target of 15% green open space for communities in every town.

Social inclusion is a central message. This is because a divided society is no foundation to tackle the complex problems urban communities face. Housing is critical.

The challenges are almost overwhelming. Nearly 1 billion people are living in poverty. That compounds the impacts of climate change on urban communities, including heat, coastal storms and rising sea levels.

The New Urban Agenda identifies five key strategies for achieving more sustainable urban growth: national urban policy; urban legislation, rules and regulations; urban planning and design; municipal finance; and local physical implementation.

National urban policy is central to achieving more integrated outcomes. The UN Sustainable Development Goals, the OECD Urban Policy Reviews and, in interviews, urban leaders around the world all agree on this. National policy developed in partnership with sub-national governments and community input is fundamental to creating more sustainable cities and regions.","Urban leaders, business and community organisations and academics came together to share leading practice and knowledge on urban futures.

Cities worldwide account for more than 80% of global GDP. In Afghanistan, a country affected by longstanding conflict which has led to large numbers of internally displaced persons and returning refugees, cities play a key role as hubs for employment, especially youth, innovation and peace. Indeed, the Afghan population is expected to double within the next 15 years with the urban population reaching 50% of the total population.

In order to capitalize on the great potential of well-planned, well-governed and well-financed urbanization, the Government of Afghanistan is currently implementing an innovative programme addressing urban governance in Kabul and 11 other cities under the name of City for All (CFA: 2016-2020).

Under the chairmanship of the Minister of Urban Development and Housing, a National Steering Committee meets every three months to assess the developments and challenges, as well as taking executive decisions over the programme. The Steering Committee is comprised of high-level representatives of key urban national and local stakeholders, namely the Independent Directorate for Local Governance (IDLG), the Deputy Ministry of Municipalities (DMM), the Independent Land Authority (ARAZI), as well donors EU and USAID, with technical assistance from UN-Habitat.

At the UN Conference on Housing & Sustainable Urban Development, Habitat III, in 2016, the United Nations reached a consensus on the transformative force of urbanization as an engine for growth and prosperity, focusing on three key aspects: urban legislation, urban planning and improved municipal finances. The integrated approach of these three key elements, also referred to as the “Fundamentals of Urbanization”, are the first basic steps that national and local governments should take while aiming at improving the condition of their cities. The New Urban Agenda, the UN roadmap for sustainable urbanization calls on national and local governments to work together on these three aspects as a pre-condition for urban development.

Despite the volatile security situation in the country, Afghanistan is one of the few countries in the world that has taken systematic actions to comprehensively implement the fundamentals of urbanization through the CFA programme. How is the work of the CFA programme impacting the daily lives of Afghan citizens?

a) Effective Land Management

CFA is supporting Afghan municipalities to survey and register all properties within their boundaries (estimated 500,000 in Kabul and 500,000 in eleven other cities) and providing technical assistance to Afghanistan Land Authority (ARAZI) to issue occupancy certificates in informal urban areas. Issuing occupancy certificates to 1 million urban households is an unprecedented measure that will enhance tenure security for urban residents, especially the displaced populations. Investing in effective land administration is a sure way to improve the living standards of the Afghan population while eradicating the grabbing of state-owned land. The legal framework for the issuance of occupancy certificates is in place following the approval of the relevant regulation in December 2017. Starting in March 2018, thousands of households will receive occupancy certificates guaranteeing their right to stay on their properties without the threat of eviction.

b) Strategic Urban Planning

CFA is assisting local communities in targeted cities to develop strategic action plans by identifying and prioritizing local infrastructure projects that will improve the delivery of basic services). The strategic planning approach ensures that the voices of local residents through the so-called ‘people’s process’. The peoples’ process uses participatory methods to facilitate the involvement of community members in planning and decision making through workshops and consultations at local level. These consultations produce strategic action plans including capital investment plans that guide municipalities on public investment for urban infrastructure for a period of five years. Strategic actions plans have been completed for five districts in Kabul (district 1, 5, 6, 13 and 16) and for the cities of Kandahar, Mazar-e-Sharif, and Bamyan. This process will improve access for huge urban populations to urban basic services by ensuring that infrastructure projects are actually implemented. For that to happen, the process needs to be linked to a transparent, accountable and inclusive budget management process.

c) Improved Municipal Finance

The financing of municipal infrastructure projects in Afghanistan depends on collection of local revenues and sound financial management systems. CFA is working with targeted municipal authorities to improve revenues from business licensing and safayi (municipal service charge), as well as participatory planning and budgeting that incorporates Municipal Advisory Boards and citizen representatives in the municipal financial cycle. CFA supports municipal district offices to produce and distribute safayi invoices and business licenses. Since October 2017, 47,000 safayi invoices have been distributed and 2,400 business licenses issued. A total of Afs 48 million (the equivalent to $690,000) have been collected in revenues.

The combination of the three fundamentals of urbanization is a strategic choice by the Government of Afghanistan that will hopefully expand local revenues for municipalities and increase tenure security in Afghan cities, promoting employment, prosperity and stability. From experiences in other countries around the world, the way cities are governed, planned and financed is directly linked to the economic and social development of a country.","The New Urban Agenda, the UN roadmap for sustainable urbanization calls on national and local governments to work together on these three aspects as a pre-condition for urban development.

Increasingly, community foundations are being viewed as “essential partners in achieving the United Nations [UN] Sustainable Development Goals,” writes Catherine Cheney for Devex. One reason for this shift is the expansion of the community foundation idea: while US community foundations still have far greater assets, the majority of community foundations (about 1,050 of 1,800) now operate outside the US. An added factor is that unlike the UN’s 1990–2015 Millennium Development Goals, which largely focused on developing countries, the 2015–2030 Sustainable Development Goals apply more broadly to both the Global South and Global North.

The Sustainable Development Goals are both broader and also more ambitious in scope than the UN’s Millennium Goals were. Notably, the UN’s millennium goals did not promise to end poverty, but rather sought to cut extreme poverty in half between 1990 and 2015. That goal was achieved five years early, in 2010. Even so, 800 million people worldwide still live in what the UN defines as extreme poverty, earning less than $1.25 a day. The very first two Sustainable Development Goals, by contrast, aim to “end poverty and hunger everywhere by 2030.”

In addition to being more ambitious, the Sustainable Development Goals are broader, with the number of overall goals increased from eight to 17. Some of the new goals arguably just provide greater specificity in the area of environmental sustainability. Six of the goals— clean energy, clean water, sustainable cities, responsible consumption and production, protection of life on land, and protection of sea life on water—could fit within that category. But others—such as reduced inequality, decent work, infrastructure, and strong institutions—are entirely new.

The bottom line is that the UN framework introduces a much broader agenda that could conceivably touch nearly every community. As Diana Campoamor wrote for NPQ in 2016,

Many of us hear “sustainable development goals” and picture a poor rural village in Sierra Leone, or a hungry child in Bolivia. But the 17 goals that all 193 countries that are members of the United Nations (UN) adopted at a summit in 2015 aren’t just a framework for faraway international issues. In fact, many of the issues addressed by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are all too real in the US: gender inequality, poverty, hunger, quality education, environmental sustainability…the list goes on.

“Local Leadership, Global Impact,” a report authored by Natalie Ross, vice president of external relations at the Council on Foundations, the leading US community foundation trade association, was released in conjunction with the North American Community Foundations Summit, a meeting that took place in Mexico City in early February. In the report, Ross writes that the combination of “Unmatched convening power, together with a mission that relates directly to improving the social fabric of communities, makes community foundations ideal partners to achieve the SDGs.”

“The report,” adds Cheney, “evaluates how the more than 1,800 community foundations operating around the world can connect their local work to this global agenda, highlighting what is working, and outlining 10 steps for how community foundations who aren’t already focusing on the SDGs can get started.”

Those 10 recommended steps are as follows:

Learn: Study all 17 SDGs Contextualize: Map the SDGs to Local Challenges Define Targets: Use Existing Data to Create Local 2030 Goals Track Grantmaking: Communicate and Grow Your Base Educate: Tell Others About the SDGs Partner: Build a Local & Vocal Coalition Innovate: Leverage Global Ideas for Local Pilots Co-Create: Build Solutions Together Monitor: Track Progress & Report Out Support: Build an Enabling Environment for Success

“Community foundations are grassroots partners that bring the SDGs to life in a place-based strategy,” explains Ross. “They can, at the same time, be hyperlocal and be channels for philanthropy that goes beyond their community.”

As noted, community foundations outside the US don’t have near the assets of their US counterparts, largely because they are so new and haven’t had the time to build up large endowments. Still, these foundations can develop programs that are designed by residents, rather than imposed from the outside and can play an invaluable “scouting” role, helping funnel international funder dollars to those programs. As Ross notes, community foundations in the Global South “tend to work more like operating foundations, implementing programs on the ground.” Earlier this month, NPQ’s Cyndi Suarez wrote about how the Puerto Rico Community Foundation effectively was doing this by getting money out quickly to the community groups most in need of immediate funds in the wake of Hurricane Maria. For her part, Cheney identifies many other examples of this approach, including in Colombia, Indonesia, Ghana, Kenya, and Zambia.

Emmett Carson, chief executive officer and president of Silicon Valley Community Foundation—the world’s largest community foundation (with $13.5 billion in assets) and also the third-largest foundation (after Gates and Soros and before Ford)—remarked at the 2018 Corporate Philanthropy Institute in San Francisco that, “Our democracy, our nation, and our world are at risk today.” Carson called on corporate social responsibility practitioners to use the SDGs to organize their actions. Cheney added that Carson also “made an appeal for Puerto Rico, asking people ‘to go outside business as usual’ in order to contribute what they can, and asking that they do so together with the Puerto Rico Community Foundation.”—Steve Dubb","February 16, 2018, DevexIncreasingly, community foundations are being viewed as “essential partners in achieving the United Nations [UN] Sustainable Development Goals,” writes Catherine Cheney for Devex.

The U.S. is one of the biggest nations facing climate disparity right now, since the Trump administration chose to pull the country out of the global Paris Agreement last summer. As the federal government's support for climate issues lags, however, U.S. cities have vowed to uphold the charter's principles — and commitment to climate hasn't stopped there.

Some states have banded together to form the U.S. Climate Alliance, nearly 70 mayors have signed the Chicago Climate Charter, and more than 230 U.S. mayors jointly sent a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to oppose its proposed repeal of the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan.

A core way cities are moving toward greater sustainability is through promoting cleaner energy supplies. That can include well-known renewables like solar and wind, but also emerging and rapidly expanding options like energy storage and microgrids. Transitioning to a more sustainable future isn't easy, though, and some cities stall before gaining much traction.

""This is not an illusion, that cities are running into a wall,"" said Dylan Siegler, sustainability specialist for NRG Energy. ""The energy market landscape has become increasingly complex, so the sophistication that’s required to navigate the proliferation of new technologies [and] the new parity, or near parity, of renewables is genuinely difficult.""

Siegler experienced the challenges firsthand during her time as the sustainability manager in Austin, TX. She led NRG's sustainability experts in releasing a report, Powering Sustainable Cities: Key Trends and Pathways to Success for City Leaders, to provide an overview of municipal sustainability and to act as a guide for city leaders seeking cleaner energy solutions.

""This is not an illusion, that cities are running into a wall."" Dylan Siegler Sustainability Specialist, NRG Energy

""If you are confused and/or having trouble managing and understanding all of the complexities associated with this while doing all of the rest of the things that sustainability professionals in cities are expected to do with very little budget and stakeholder engagement... that's real. We feel you,"" Siegler said. The report can assist leaders with ""understanding what the options are for them and make the right decisions to bring us closer to a sustainable outcome.""

The report found that leading cities shared four main successful tactics in their efforts to boost sustainable energy: dedicated staff resources, employing unique assets, finding funding and accessing expertise. In short, dedicating at least one employee to sustainability is important, but all solutions don't look the same and municipalities should leverage their own strong suits.

Another key point is that devising energy policies and programs is easier and often more successful when achieved through partnerships. The obvious partners might be energy companies or consultants, but they could also include organizations such as the Environmental Defense Fund or STAR Communities, interns and recent graduates who bring fresh ideas and expertise from academia or peer connections formed through networking and attending industry conferences. ""Partnerships can take many forms, and you don't have to do just one,"" Siegler said.

Partnerships and shared resources can be particularly beneficial for small cities and rural areas, which might feel left out of the sustainability game. ""I think we have a political climate in the U.S. that has brought into [view] the differences in opportunities in rural areas, and energy is no different,"" Siegler said. Lesser populated areas' sustainable energy futures mirror their access to broadband internet service, which is to say that ""rural areas have fallen behind and often don't even have an incorporated municipality to complain to.""

Regardless of a municipality's size, ""there is a way forward"" on the sustainable energy front, Siegler said. It's a matter of conducting a solid analysis of needs and desired outcomes in order to ""understand the landscape well enough to identify the solution... It’s not going to be the right solution if doesn't take into consideration the entire context.""

""Low-income populations [and] people of color are impacted by climate change in a way that is not proportional to their presence in the world."" Dylan Siegler Sustainability Specialist, NRG Energy

Similarly, cities are prioritizing equitable distribution of sustainable energy resources in other underserved areas, such as low-income neighborhoods. Although approaches vary, the most forward-thinking cities — such as New York and Los Angeles — actively focus on overcoming inequitable resource distribution.

""Low-income populations [and] people of color are impacted by climate change in a way that is not proportional to their presence in the world,"" Siegler says. Low-income neighborhoods disproportionately feel the effects of climate change because, for instance, they tend to have less greenery, less access to public transit and closer proximity to high-pollution travel routes and industrial parks. Low-income residents also tend to live in less energy efficient homes than well-off residents, so they end up paying more for the energy that they use.

""The solutions that might start to tackle that issue are also not equitably distributed,"" Siegler said. ""That's something a lot of cities are grappling with right now.""

Despite cities' sizable challenges toward more sustainable energy solutions, experts say not to fret.

""This is not insurmountable. There are resources around you to take advantage of,"" Siegler said. ""Don't be afraid [because] there is a solution for you.""","A core way cities are moving toward greater sustainability is through promoting cleaner energy supplies.

22,https://www.greenbiz.com/article/us-cities-are-vanguard-sustainable-future,"Thu, 22 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",GreenBiz,U.S. cities are the vanguard for a sustainable future,"In the absence of federal leadership on climate change, America’s cities have become the vanguard of the country’s efforts to create a sustainable future. Recently, 233 mayors from 46 states and territories, representing 51 million residents across the country, have signed an open letter opposing the repeal of the Clean Power Plan (CPP), the nation’s most comprehensive strategy to combat climate change.

Last year, after Donald Trump announced the U.S. departure from the Paris Agreement, mayors from across North America came together in Chicago to affirm their commitment to the goals of the Paris Agreement. Those goals — including improving energy efficiency of buildings and transportation systems, building sustainable infrastructure, and securing more energy from renewable resources — not only combat climate change, but strengthen our economies, create jobs and make our communities more resilient.

Participating mayors are making strides to cut carbon pollution locally, including in Chicago, where the city reports a 19 percent reduction in carbon emissions in the last two years from buildings required to benchmark and report their energy use (PDF). In Michigan, cities and their residents are calling on an electric utility to rethink building a new natural gas plants and, instead, to invest those funds in cleaner, more cost-effective clean energy options, such as energy efficiency and renewable energy. But cities recognize that climate change must be addressed at all levels of governments, which is why an increasing number of American mayors are calling for federal action to combat this threat.

Last year alone brought more destructive storms, wildfires and yet another year of record-breaking heat. In Chicago, extreme storms are becoming the norm — even with massive additions to the region’s stormwater system, infrastructure cannot keep up. When violent storms dump incredible volumes of rain in very short periods of time, the Chicago River literally runs backwards, flowing into Lake Michigan — the source of drinking water and quality of life for millions. Chicago’s infrastructure — like most of the country’s — was not built to deal with the changes brought by the changing climate.

Every community in every city whose mayor signed the letter in defense of the CPP has its own story that speaks to the urgent need for climate action. The CPP also has garnered wide support based on the advantages created by a transition to clean energy. Even in public hearings held deep in coal country, the vast majority of the thousands of people that testified spoke in favor of the health, economic and environmental benefits of the CPP.

The mayors’ letter reflects the voices of communities across the country that are bearing the worst effects of climate change and are eager for solutions. It shows that cities won't sit on the sidelines while the Trump administration attempts to take away our country’s best hope to cut carbon pollution and address climate change.","In the absence of federal leadership on climate change, America’s cities have become the vanguard of the country’s efforts to create a sustainable future.

A new geography of power is emerging, made up of global city networks. All in all, the attractiveness of cities is based on the hope of higher purchasing power through greater opportunities, for a better quality of life. Megacities have the potential to effectively fight against poverty and enhance living conditions for a large proportion of the population – if they are managed correctly and make the most of their advantages. Nonetheless, there is a drastic need for new urban models to tackle the associated social, economic, and environmental pressures in a sustainable way.

Cities are the new engines of growth in the global economy, responsible for 80% of global GDP. It is no longer just countries that compete, but cities as well. Like there is great power competition, so will the world’s great cities increasingly compete. Every city will have to gain a competitive edge to differentiate itself from the rest. Flexible and agile cities that can diversify their resources and offer economic, social, and cultural opportunities to their citizens will not only survive but thrive. The cities that are best equipped to produce innovative, inclusive, and ethical solutions in the face of multiplying risks and threats will emerge as leaders. A clear picture emerges: cities will compete and collaborate globally as interdependent entities and will drive the future.

Speaking about megacities, let’s look for example at Mumbai, which is the financial capital of India and the second-most populated city in the world. It is not only the subcontinent’s city with the highest GDP but also ranks among the world’s top ten trade centers. The city contributes 25% of industrial output and 70% of capital transactions to India’s economy. Important financial organizations such as the Reserve Bank of India and the National Stock Exchange of India are in Mumbai. It houses the headquarters of various multinational companies and has thus become an influential commercial and entertainment center of India. It would be foolish to ignore such cities in tomorrow’s global economy.

City diplomacy could be considered a form of decentralization of international relations management, choosing cities as the key actors. In many cases, the representatives of cities involved in city diplomacy will be the mayors, given that they are often responsible for the international relations of their communities. On behalf of their cities, these key actors can engage in relations with other actors on the international stage through two-sided or multiple-sided interactions. There is a lot of room for city diplomacy to grow. It can be driven by image or investment interests, development and strategic communications complete each other.

A city relationship is formally created when the mayors or highest elected or designated leaders from two communities sign a memorandum of understanding establishing the partnership. Nevertheless, this is usually the result of a long process that involves the local city organizations along with the municipalities and other local institutions. It takes a lot of work to get to this stage, so, as in many other cases, sustained effort and clear vision pay off. So, time to shape up the in house mayoral or county staff and consolidate a stellar local talent team of global reach.

Competition matters but so does cooperation. Collaborating with neighboring or nearby cities enables cities to plan and implement actions to address emissions from energy infrastructure, public transport, food systems, waste management, and other services that often operate across municipal borders and to address cross-border climate risks. It also helps cities overcome regional or national climate-policy barriers, share the cost of staff and equipment, and secure better access to data, funding, and technical assistance – all of which can motivate other cities in the area to participate as well.

Image and Investment demand a third I in the 2020s: Innovation. The fastest way to connect cities and counties is using technology. The technological progress of recent decades has had not only a powerful but also a transformative influence on urban life. As technology progresses and becomes more affordable, the functionality and sustainability of urban practices undergo significant advancements as well. At the same time, increased access to information consolidates the role of knowledge as a powerful engine of economic growth. This enables the development of knowledge-based and connected societies. Under these continuously evolving conditions, many concepts about the organization and management of the new technological capabilities have become popular, including the smart city.

To establish an approach for the ideal future of an urban settlement that harnesses technology should be part of the integrated processes that connect cities at a regional level. In the best-case scenario, a city that aspires to become „smart‟ has an integrated, forward-looking plan that includes a vision and a methodology focused on benefiting from digital technologies to improve urban functions and develop knowledge ecosystems. Like any strategy, the plans for smart cities must be adapted to the needs, priorities, and constraints of their circumstances.

Funding for smart city projects is still carved out of overall city or department budgets, either through existing spending (e.g., IT, lighting contracts) or designated ‘smart city’ spending, which is typically relatively small. It is therefore difficult to identify the exact amount local authorities allocate to such projects. Even though a lot of the investment for smart city projects comes from the general city budget, cities have found it most beneficial to have earmarked funds for innovation initiatives. At the moment, what is clear is that the funding and budgeting has to match the ambitions of big cities and transform the smart city objective into reality.

National governments are also encouraging cities to increase funding by boosting the participation of the private sector in delivering smart city projects. Businesses’ experience with participating in the delivery of smart city projects has been dominated by pilot projects often utilizing public sector grant funding. There is room for much more. Local authorities need to make more strides towards scaling pilot projects and procuring large-scale solutions. The city must be able to articulate clearly the challenges it faces and develop a more open way for the market to respond. The sky is the limit, if the game is played well. An innovative image and investment diplomacy operation is an important way forward.","Nevertheless, this is usually the result of a long process that involves the local city organizations along with the municipalities and other local institutions.

While it has long been criticized by consumers, brands and governments are finally beginning to recognize that the short-term strategy has no place in the low-carbon economy — and are taking action to promote transparency and resource efficiency.

The French government is considering a new labeling scheme that would make the lifespan of products — and therefore, planned obsolescence — more transparent. According to EURACTIV, the so-called “lifetime” label would be voluntary and would rank products on a scale from one to ten according to criteria such as durability, reparability and upgradeability.

The idea is not novel — a similar program is already in place in Austria. A label demonstrating product durability and reparability is currently in use to grade items such as household appliances.

The proposed labeling system is part of a larger scheme to transition the economy to a more circular model. A considerable part of France’s circular economy package focuses on extending the lifecycle of everyday products, be it pantyhose, printers or toasters.

Implementation of the label would begin on 1 January 2020 and, at this stage, its adoption would be voluntary, left up to the discretion of individual brands. “Ideally, the label could be taken up at a European level and displayed alongside the (existing) energy label,” the French government said in a statement.

France has been at the forefront of this issue since 2015 when it deemed planned obsolescence to be a criminal offense. But critics say the voluntary nature of the proposed “lifetime” label diminishes its efficacy. “It is not enough to simply postpone responsibility for action on a European scale, but to set an example in France, whilst arguing in favor of a broader compliance with best practices in Europe,” argued the Halte à l’Obsolescence Programmée, a French association against planned obsolescence.

The French and Austrian government are also calling on the European Commission to consider a ‘voluntary European label, covering in particular: the product’s durability, eco-design features, upgradeability in line with technical progress and reparability.” While the outcomes of these requests are yet to be determined, they mark an important step forward in creating the right conditions for a circular economy.

Meanwhile, startup Sheerly Genius is combatting planned obsolescence with its rip-proof, snag-proof pantyhose.

Pantyhose epitomizes the concept of planned obsolescence — the average woman spends around $250-$875 a year on sheers that typically last one to two wears. Nylon — the fabric used to make tights — is traditionally a hard-wearing textile, but to ensure a constant stream of profits, its chemical formula was altered to weaken the fabric.

Frustrated by the amount of waste and sartorial emergencies that resulted from sub-par pairs of pantyhose, Katherine Homuth, Founder and CEO of Sheerly Genius, set out to develop the world’s first pair of indestructible sheer pantyhose.

“Like most women, I have an entire drawer filled with nothing but ripped pantyhose — I call it the pantyhose graveyard,” Homuth said. “One day, I decided that there had to be a solution, so I sought it out. I tried all of the ‘revolutionary’ brands out there but it was all marketing, no substance. Sheerly Genius is the only pair that will live up to the hype. We’ve used real material science to get done what everyone from manufacturers to suppliers told us was impossible.”

Homuth and her team were able to create a proprietary fiber that is strong, flexible and sheer. The material is so strong, in fact, that it can’t be handled by conventional machinery. As a result, Sheerly Genius also designed a proprietary manufacturing process built to withstand the strength of the material without compromising the wearability of the end product.

The tights are also stain resistant, which has considerable implications for their longevity. According to research done by Savers, around 300 million pieces of clothing are thrown out by millennials over a lifetime due to stains. Combined with their near indestructible nature, this further enhances the brand’s ability to divert textile waste from landfill. According to Humoth, one pair of Sheerly Genius sheers can help prevent more than 25 pairs of conventional tights from entering landfill.

“Sheerly Genius pantyhose has been tested to last up to 50 wears, compared to the average pair of sheers, which are generally considered disposable and last only one to two wears,” Humoth told Sustainable Brands. “By replacing the $8 billion worth of disposable pantyhose that are sold each year with a more sustainable product, we can save more than 320 million pairs of pantyhose from the landfill every year.”

Sheerly Genius isn’t the only stocking brand to set its sights on revolutionizing the fashion industry. Sweden’s Swedish Stockings is using pre- and post-consumer nylon waste to produce sustainable nylon stocks in zero waste factories. Endeavoring to become a closed-loop operation, the company has initiated a hosiery recycling program. Swedish Stockings encourages consumers to send old or ripped stockings (from any brand) to its Stockholm-based operation for a 10 percent discount on new tights.","As increasing emphasis is being placed on circularity, the concept of planned obsolescence is being called into question.

Switzerland Joins Sustainable Development Solutions Network

By Jaya Ramachandran

BERN (IDN) – The global Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) has launched its 25th network, SDSN Switzerland, co-hosted by the Centre for Development and Environment at the University of Bern and BIOVISION Foundation, foundation for ecological development, with a view to shaping multi-stakeholder dialogue, fostering sustainable development solutions, and advising decision-makers on the implementation of the Agenda 2030 and the Paris Climate Agreement.

SDSN Switzerland was officially launched on February 15 with a conference under the banner 'Where Society, Science and Politics Create Solutions.' The network claims to have 19 members from key institutions around Switzerland who are committed to implementing SDGs at the local level.

The global SDSN was launched in 2012 under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General. It mobilizes global scientific and technological expertise to promote practical solutions favorable to sustainable development. SDSN collaborates with UN agencies, multilateral financing institutions, the private sector and civil society. A Leadership Council of approximately 100 global leaders on sustainable development acts as the board of SDSN.

Spanning six continents, the SDSN Networks Programme currently draws upon the knowledge and educational capacity of over 700 member institutions, most of them universities, organized around 25 National and Regional Centres. National and Regional SDSNs develop long-term transformation pathways for sustainable development, promote education around the 2030 Agenda, and launch initiatives at the local level.

According to organizers, the SDSN Switzerland Launch Conference brought together around 250 representatives and decision-makers from science and research, think tanks, government, civil society, business and international bodies to discuss how to effectively implement these international sustainability agreements in Switzerland and beyond.

The Conference featured plenary sessions on various topics, including: SDSN as a tool to build bridges and create solutions; making Switzerland sustainable; and Switzerland’s opportunities and responsibilities for a sustainable world. Nine parallel breakout sessions were held in innovative formats, including ""collective story harvesting,"" to exchange experiences and ideas.

The 2030 Agenda also calls on the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), to carry out voluntary, state-led national reviews to provide a platform for partnerships.

Rio+20 called for the HLPF in 2012, in its outcome document, 'The Future We Want.' This universal intergovernmental high-level political forum replaces the UN Commission on Sustainable Development. Since 2012, the HPLF has held five annual meetings. The fifth session, in July 2017, addressed the theme of 'Eradicating poverty and promoting prosperity in a changing world.' It carried out thematic reviews, reviewed the implementation of several SDGs, and also adopted a Ministerial Declaration.

Katrin Muff of the Business School Lausanne facilitated the Conference. She emphasized that SDSN Switzerland is not just another new initiative, but rather a network that will enable existing initiatives to scale and speed up, and make new connections.

Muff introduced SDSN Switzerland Co-Chairs Océane Dayer, Swiss Youth for Climate, and Urs Wiesmann, University of Bern. Highlighting the role of peace and justice in achieving ""a healthy planet,"" Dayer said meaningful sustainability is not a question of fixing issues one by one, but that a sustainable world demands interdisciplinary work and cooperation.

Wiesmann outlined the history of Switzerland’s sustainability agenda and commitment to the SDGs. He drew attention to the interrelationships among the SDGs, and identified the challenge of addressing them in concert, taking into account the social dimensions.

He said sustainability cannot be achieved within country boundaries, but needs to be a global effort, and called for a move from sectoral sustainability policy to a broad-based movement for sustainability involving all actors, including government and civil society. He stressed the important role of promising initiatives that bring together different stakeholders and forms of knowledge.

Dayer said the conference aims to: bring together unlikely allies; foster transformative solutions; and advise makers.

Guido Schmidt-Traub, SDSN Global, introduced SDSN, noting serious sustainability challenges around the world. He highlighted that the network aims to promote sustainable development through knowledge and to propose solutions to nudge policy-makers.

Welcoming SDSN Switzerland to the global network, he encouraged the Swiss network to help the country better take on its international responsibility by improving education and training, and providing pathways for the sustainability transition, including practical solutions on data.

Bertrand Piccard, explorer and initiator of the Solar Impulse Foundation, which performed the first solar-powered flight around the world, gave a keynote address. Piccard said that upon completion of this flight, he realized that ""the rest of the world lives in the past."" He identified a ""tremendous gap"" between the people fighting for environmental protection and those who focus on economy and profit.

Noting the need to speak the language of industry and politics, Piccard said solutions already exist that can help to halve CO2 emissions from transport, construction and industry, and at the same time create jobs and make profits. He noted that the way forward is to create the biggest market for industry, namely by replacing out-dated and inefficient technologies.

Piccard highlighted the strength of the technology pull, but felt that the current legal framework is ""completely out-dated."" He suggested fixing this at the government level, starting with information, including the fact that if all actual costs are included, sustainable electricity is already cheaper than conventional electricity.

Piccard also drew attention to '#1000solutions,' a Solar Impulse initiative that aims to identify 1000 solutions that protect the environment in a profitable way. He said: ""Even for climate change deniers and people who have no compassion for the environment, there are only advantages in sustainability.""

Sibyl Anwander from the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment shared her experience in Haiti 30 years ago, noting that inefficient political systems can lead to bad education and poverty, which in turn cause serious environmental concerns. Citing the example of the ""Go for Impact"" platform, she highlighted the need to use a holistic approach and promote innovations that address the global challenge.

Nicola Blum from ETH Zürich outlined her research and entrepreneur experiences with regard to promoting sustainable development. She underscored the need for collaboration among different stakeholders in order to bring solutions to society that are conducive to sustainability.

In the ensuing panel discussion, Piccard said it is naïve to think that a group of people with good intentions can change the world, since ""these are not the people who run the world."" He noted that the people who run the world are billionaires who own businesses and politicians who want to be re-elected. Blum responded that this underlines the importance of educating future world leaders. [IDN-InDepthNews – 26 February 2018]

Opinion: Wetlands essential for sustainable urban future PNG

Article content This past weekend marked World Wetlands Day, an opportunity to recognize one of the most under-appreciated environmental resources in our region — urban wetlands. Urban wetlands are areas flooded with water, either seasonally or permanently. They are found in and around cities or their suburbs, and include rivers and their plains, lakes, swamps, as well as their coastal variants, such as tidal and salt marshes. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Try refreshing your browser, or Opinion: Wetlands essential for sustainable urban future Back to video These natural resources provide several critical yet often over-looked functions for local communities. Urban wetlands help reduce flooding by absorbing water from heavy rainfalls and serve as buffers against storm surges. They also help replenish drinking water and improve local water quality, as their silt-rich soil and plant life act as natural filters, reducing the amount of harmful toxins, agricultural pesticides, industrial waste and household sewage that can seep into our water systems. Their abundant vegetation also helps improve local air quality.

Article content In Metro Vancouver, where so much of our environmental landscape is tied to water, urban wetlands have never been more important for the future sustainability of our cities. With more than one million new residents expected to call this region home in the next two decades, urban wetlands will play a critical role in maintaining the livability of Metro Vancouver and the health of its surrounding ecosystems. However, rapid development taking place across the region presents challenges. As cities grow and demand for land increases, wetlands are all often viewed as areas available to dump waste or to be converted for other purposes. Globally, more than 64 per cent of the world’s wetlands were lost during the last century. This is a trend that must be reversed, and there are several key steps that should be taken to help preserve these prized lands. First, there needs to be greater awareness and more conservation efforts focused on our local wetlands. North Shore Wetland Partners, with support from the B.C. Wildlife Federation Wetland Education Program, conducts educational initiatives about the importance of these natural resources. We also monitor half a dozen wetlands on the North Shore and undertake local restoration projects. For instance, since 2015, we have helped restore the Mackay Creek Estuary, so the habitat can support salmon and other wildlife. Mackay Creek also served as the location for our annual World Wetlands Day event, where our partner organizations were joined by dozens of participants for a tour, monthly bird survey, and hands-on cleanup of the area.

Article content In addition, we must integrate urban wetlands into our regional development and management plans, which will require leadership and collaboration from the public, private, and non-profit sectors. For example, the Port of Vancouver is a crucial partner in protecting urban water bodies. It ensures stormwater run-off is managed at terminals in the Port of Vancouver, Canada’s largest port, through a comprehensive environmental review process, development of stormwater prevention plans, and installation of necessary infrastructure. The port authority also helps improve sensitive habitats, such as Lynn Creek Estuary — a multi-year project that involves a diversity of partners, including the BCIT Rivers Institute, North Shore Streamkeepers, Echo Ecological, District of North Vancouver, and Fisheries and Oceans Canada. Lastly, provincial and municipal governments should also consider how best to incorporate wetland conservation into a broad range of relevant policies, including: building regulations, pollution controls, greenbelts to limit sprawl, and programs that encourage residents to help protect local wetlands. Ultimately, growing cities, like Metro Vancouver, often face a practical dilemma: how to meet the increasing demands placed on a limited land base while protecting these natural resources. The key will be recognizing these considerations are not mutually exclusive, and that wetlands are critical components for sustainable urban development that help make cities livable. The theme of this year’s World Wetlands Day — wetlands for a sustainable urban future — could not be more appropriate for our region. So, marking World Wetlands Day, let’s celebrate the under-appreciated and ensure these natural treasures remain top of mind as we chart our growth. Fiona Wright is coordinator for North Shore Wetlands Partners, which promotes conservation of the wetlands through a network of organizations.

27,https://sustainablebrands.com/read/behavior-change/want-economic-equality-change-your-shopping-habits,"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Sustainable Brands,Want Economic Equality? Change Your Shopping Habits,"The more mature you get, the more you start to understand that the little, normal things you do and the routines you follow make a big impact over time. Leave the water running while you’re brushing your teeth, and you’re wasting up to 200 gallons of water each month. Bike to work every day, and you’re cutting down on household emissions by at least 6 percent while lessening vehicular pollution by about .97 pounds per mile. If you drive 500 miles to and from work each year — an underestimate — you’re spewing 485 pounds of pollution into the air.

Shopping is another routine activity, and no doubt you’re used to thinking critically about the products you purchase. But have you ever thought about where you shop? I’m not talking about whether you go to the closest co-op or Walmart. I’m talking about the actual location of your shopping destinations.

The Difference Location Makes

In a recent study, French researchers used network science to analyze data on over 150,000 people in Barcelona and Madrid. They looked at more than 95,000 business transactions, noting which neighborhoods were economically disadvantaged and which were not. An experiment was then conducted with the data.

The findings revealed that if people were to alter just 5 percent of their shopping trips, rerouting them to economically disadvantaged neighborhoods instead of upper-class ones, the cities would reach economic equality over time. In other words, people in underprivileged neighborhoods would gain more wealth if people from other neighborhoods decided to change their habits and shop in the disadvantaged neighborhoods just five times out of one hundred.

This makes particular sense in cities where there are plenty of local businesses owned and staffed by people who live close to them. But even rerouting trips to big-box stores in underprivileged areas can help. Near big-box stores, other businesses spring up when entrepreneurs discover there’s an influx of shoppers who need goods and services the big stores can’t provide.

Businesses less than a year old create 1.5 million jobs annually. Shopping in economically disadvantaged areas helps new businesses get started and creates new jobs. Even if you shop at a big, corporate store such as Walmart in a poor neighborhood, you’re helping the people who work there keep their jobs, while providing the opportunity for further advancement. The money you spend pays their wages, and they redistribute it to other businesses in their area. Eventually, they may even start their own businesses.

This is especially relevant now in America. The phrase “shopping trip” increasingly refers to sitting down at a computer to order something from Amazon. About 99 percent of companies are small to medium-sized businesses, meaning there are ample opportunities to shop at stores in poor neighborhoods instead of buying from corporate giants, where your dollar doesn’t go as far towards supporting the local community.

Last year, Amazon acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion and vowed to slash prices by up to 43 percent. It would seem that going to Whole Foods supports local and regional manufacturers and farmers while simultaneously supporting Amazon and Whole Foods employees. But when was the last time you saw a Whole Foods in an economically depressed neighborhood? Say you go to Whole Foods 100 times during the year. Take five of those trips and alter them to a local retailer in a less affluent neighborhood, and you’re making a difference.

Decreasing Economic Inequality and Increasing Sustainability

When it comes to global income inequality, 71 percent of adults have less than $10,000 dollars to their name. In part, this is linked to a rise in trade. As the following graph shows, trade has risen dramatically since the 1950s. 2010 saw trade increase at a rate of nearly 5,000 percent.

Of course, shopping at a Walmart in an economically disadvantaged area is better for promoting economic equality than shopping at one in a wealthy neighborhood — but shopping local is better overall.

Businesses that sell local, regional, or American-made products contribute to less pollution than businesses that sell imported products. In fact, there’s evidence that pollution from Chinese manufacturing contributes to smog in the United States. Although emissions from China’s exports to Europe and North America decreased by 20 percent between 2007 and 2012, there’s still the fact that they see longer trips to get here than American-made goods do.

I’m not implying that local businesses in poor areas don’t sell imported products. But it is possible to find small businesses in these neighborhoods that sell American, regional, and locally made goods. When you go out of your way to shop at these businesses, you’re doing both the economy and the environment a favor. It just takes a simple change in your shopping habits.","They looked at more than 95,000 business transactions, noting which neighborhoods were economically disadvantaged and which were not.

A new mixed-use community on the former Globe and Mail site at Front and Spadina, The Well will add residential, commercial, retail, and recreational space to a previously low-rise office/industrial area, and serve as a progressive example of resilient urban development o the west side of Toronto’s downtown.

As if the project weren't already expansive enough, Allied Properties and RioCan—two of the companies heading up The Well’s development—announced its partnership with Enwave Energy Corporation to extend the Deep Lake Water Cooling and hot water distribution networks to the site. The partnership will mean the installation of new thermal energy storage tanks underneath ‘The Well’, to provide low carbon cooling and heating services to the site and nearby properties.

Enwave is a privately-owned corporation and one of North America’s largest district energy systems, committed to providing sustainable energy services in cities across the continent. With over 1 million square feet of office space, 500,000 square feet of retail, and some 1,800 residential units over seven mixed-use towers, the westward Enwave extension will enable a significant expansion of the network. Set for phased completion over the next several years, projected demographic statistics for 2022 expect an increase in population in the area of nearly 70,000 from at least 40,000 new dwelling units. The Well poses to address at least some of these numbers, and Enwave will in turn benefit the area's future residents, bringing more sustainable energy solutions.

Aligning especially well with Toronto’s efforts for urban resilience and its commitment to conserve energy and reduce carbon emissions (partially dictated by Toronto Green Standard for new development projects), Enwave seems an obvious partner to provide energy solutions to the site and the surrounding area at large. The process includes installing a thermal energy storage facility below The Well’s six underground levels which otherwise consist of parking, loading, below grade retail and other back-of-house uses.

Two 6-million-litre tanks will store temperature-controlled water fed by Enwave’s current Deep Lake Water Cooling system and its recently developed high-efficiency hot water network, able to service over 20 million square feet of commercial, retail and residential space at The Well and beyond. This will be the first low-carbon, resilient cooling and heating energy system in Toronto’s downtown west, and is set to provide long-term benefits both to the area and the City of Toronto, in its objective to reduce emissions and set exemplar standards for energy usage in cities around the world.

Carlyle Coutinho, Enwave Canada’s President and Chief Operations Officer, said in a prepared statement ""The development is a reflection of our joint commitment to build resilient, urban communities incorporating intelligent energy solutions and utilizing future-focused technologies.""

Michael Emory, Allied Properties’ President and CEO noted the importance of this partnership as a continuation of Toronto’s bar-setting approach to environmentally conscious community-building. The Well is to serve as a prime example of forward thinking urban development, focused as it is on ""resilience and the need to decarbonize municipal energy supplies."" While The Well will act as an anchor site for Enwave’s energy service system, the benefits of the thermal energy tanks will be realized beyond the site in the greater King West community which will have access to the low-carbon cooling and heating sources. Enwave's current heating and cooling network operates through central Downtown Toronto. With the expansion to The Well, its energy network could extend further north to service more of the city’s downtown west and northwest areas.

How Enwave's Deep Lake Water Cooling system differentiates itself from other forms of energy distribution and usage is by effectively decentralizing the supply of energy away from reliance on the central electricity grid. A network of underground pipes that connect to Enwave’s existing system will extend throughout The Well site and its surrounding area, able to distribute and store thermal energy during off-peak times of energy usage. Energy will recycle or ‘loop’ heated or cooled water throughout buildings depending on their typical hours of highest use. Residential buildings, for instance, will be on a ‘Residential Loop’, serviced according to their hours of energy usage, typically between 6 PM and 8 AM. In turn, 'looped' energy will be conserved within the underground storage tanks and deployed as necessary, reducing strain on the energy grid and avoiding expensive peak power costs.

The first development phase of The Well has consisted in the demolition of The Well’s site, completed in late 2017, with shoring and excavation of the site's underground levels now taking place and continuing for several months. While the development is a approximately five to seven years away from completion, we'll be following its progress and keeping you up to date with any new details as they come up.

The technology is based on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a material that has the largest internal surface area of any known substance compared to its volume, enabling it to collect greater levels of ions such as sodium and lithium from water than current techniques.

Monash University professor Haunting Wang and his research team have developed a method of desalination that may be more cost-effective and efficient than current methods.

Dr Huacheng Zhang, professor Huanting Wang and associate professor Zhe Liu and their team at Monash University, in collaboration with Dr Anita Hill of CSIRO and Professor Benny Freeman from the University of Texas, recently discovered that MOF membranes could replicate the filtering function of organic membranes to selectively collect ions.

In recent years, MOF research has been aimed at the removal of hydrogen and carbon dioxide, but the Monash team developed a membrane structure aimed at removing salts and lithium ions, both of which are prevalent in saltwater.

Extracting the ions in the past has been based on creating a pressure differential across the membrane, but the MOF developed by the Monash project uses a small electrical potential to drive the ions to a collection point, therefore using significantly less energy than a pressure-based system.

Still in its early stages of research, Professor Wang said there was potential for the MOFs to be more cost-effective and efficient than current water desalination techniques by slashing energy consumption by as much as 2-3 times and processing water at a much faster rate. The membranes can also be reused once the ions have been extracted.

“We can use our findings to address the challenges of water desalination, instead of relying on the current costly and energy intensive processes,” Professor Wang said.

“This research opens up the potential for removing salt ions from water in a far more energy efficient and environmentally sustainable way.

Lithium potential

There’s also the potential for the technology to be used as a novel way to harvest lithium.

“We’ll continue researching how the lithium ion selectivity of these membranes can be further applied,” Professor Wang said.

“Lithium ions are abundant in seawater, so this has implications for the mining industry that currently use inefficient chemical treatments to extract lithium from rocks and brines.

“Global demand for lithium required for electronics and batteries is very high. These membranes offer the potential for a very effective way to extract lithium ions from seawater – a plentiful and easily accessible resource.”

CSIRO’s Dr Anita Hill said the research offered real-world uses for the next-generation material.

“The prospect of using MOFs for sustainable water filtration is incredibly exciting from a public good perspective, while delivering a better way of extracting lithium ions,” Dr Hill said.

For communities that rely on water with a high level of salts, such as bore water, the development of MOFs may present a solution for cleaner, safer, more reliable water sources.

Professor Wang said with further research, there was potential to create a system that removes a number of ions in one process by stacking successive membranes with ion selectivity into one system.

The next step in the research is to look into the viability of creating “real life” membranes for commercial applications.","Monash University professor Haunting Wang and his research team have developed a method of desalination that may be more cost-effective and efficient than current methods.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing rapidly, thanks to ever-more-powerful computing, massive growth in the availability of digital data and increasingly sophisticated algorithms.

The world’s largest technology firms are investing billions to develop their AI capabilities, and companies across industries, from travel to real estate to fashion, are racing to bring AI-enabled services to market.

AI has the potential to bring significant social benefits, including healthcare (via improved diagnostics), transportation (through self-driving vehicles) and law enforcement (with improved fraud detection).

AI also brings new social risks, including discrimination (from algorithmic bias), privacy (through the misuse of personal information), child rights (through lack of informed consent) and labor rights (because of the mass displacement of workers by machines).

Thinking strategically

While by no means exhaustive, we believe the following seven considerations are essential for our members to factor into their AI strategies.

AI is relevant for all industries, not just technology companies.

The development of AI today is being driven by Silicon Valley, and it is understandable that private-sector participation in the dialogue about the social implications of AI has been dominated by technology companies.

However, it is an urgent priority for companies in other sectors using AI – such as financial services, healthcare, infrastructure, public services and retail – to understand how AI impacts their business models, employees and customers.

The human rights and ethics impacts of AI are especially important.

The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights were created to guide the integration of human rights into business decision making and should be deliberately applied to the development and deployment of AI.

This means asking and addressing questions like “What are the most severe potential impacts?”, “Who are the most vulnerable groups?”, and “How can we ensure access to remedy?” Companies should take a human rights by designapproach to AI.

Environmental issues are important, too.

While significant attention has been paid to the ethical and human rights implications of AI, we have a tremendous opportunity to embed environmental learning into AI – as Google has done to radically improve the power use effectiveness of its data centers.

AI can also be used as an environmental solution – as Microsoft’s AI for Earth commitment demonstrates. At the same time, it will be important that the data processing needs created by AI don’t substantially increase energy use.

Research, product development and marketing teams are essential to engage on sustainability.

In our 2017 annual survey of sustainable business leaders, we asked which functions were most important to achieve substantive progress on sustainability – and only 24 percent mentioned product development, 13 percent mentioned research and development and 8 percent mentioned marketing.

These functions will have a significant influence on the development and deployment of AI, so it is crucial that they participate actively in the conversation around AI and sustainability.

Companies will need to communicate the complexity of AI in accessible ways.

AI is extremely complex, and only a very small number of people in the world – mostly concentrated inside companies – understand how it works. If AI is to fulfill its potential while mitigating accompanying risks, civil society, rights-holders and vulnerable populations should have access to information about the issues at stake and channels to participate meaningfully in discussions about its application.

Ethics and principles for AI are developing rapidly, but implementing them in practice is challenging.

It is noteworthy how rapidly the AI field has developed principles, with organizations such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the Software and Information Industry Association, the Information Technology Industry Council and the Future of Life Institute all publishing statements of ethics.

Initiatives like Partnership on AI, the Ethics and Governance of AI Fund and AI Now are embarking on substantial efforts to explore key dilemmas and facilitate dialogue on them. However, turning theory into practice will require thorough review of real-life cases.

The future of AI is uncertain, but decisions today can have long-term consequences.

Taking responsible approaches to AI will require grappling with rapid change, uncertainty and complexity. We can’t know exactly what path the development and deployment of AI will take, so we should be prepared for different versions of the future and think through the possible long-term implications of today’s decisions.

Futures thinking, also known as strategic foresight, can provide structured ways to explore multiple possible futures and chart a path forward that considers the various possible outcomes that might unfurl.

In our recent report on the Future of Sustainable Business, we listed the intersection of technology, ethics and human rights as one of the three big issue sets we believe need to be front and center on the business agenda – not only for sustainability reasons, but because these questions will be increasingly central to business performance and strategy.

We have much to lose if AI does not evolve in ways that support the public good, and we look forward to working with you to help ensure that it does.

32,https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2018/02/21/solar-power-essential-sustainable-development/,"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Modern Diplomacy,Solar Power: Essential for sustainable development,"Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, crude oil and natural gas have been playing a key role in the geopolitics of the Caspian region. Hydrocarbon revenues became an important source of economic growth for the Caspian Basin countries such as Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. Shortly after gaining independence in the early 1990s, the Caspian states implemented energy policies that protect their national interests. According to the BP 2020Statistical Review of World Energy total proved energy reserves of the Caspian states are: Kazakhstan has30.00 billion barrels of oil and 2.7 trillion cubic meters of gas, Azerbaijan 7.00billion barrels of oil and 2.8 trillion cubic meters of gas, and Turkmenistan 0.6billion barrels of oil and 19.5 trillion cubic meters of gas.

Such rich hydrocodone reserves allowed the Caspian states to contribute significantly to the global energy markets. Today, the Caspian states are supplying oil and natural gas to various energy markets, and they are interested in increasing export volume and diversification of export routes. In comparison with Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan, which supply energy sources mainly to China and Russia, Azerbaijan established a backbone to export energy sources to Europe and Transatlantic space. As the Caspian Sea is landlocked, and its hydrocarbon resources located at a great distance from the world’s major energy consumers, building up energy infrastructure was very important to export oil and gas.

To this end, Azerbaijan created the milestone for delivery of the first Caspian oil and natural gas by implementing mega energy projects such as Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline and Southern Gas Corridor (SGC).Now, one can say that both energy projects resulted from successful energy policy implemented by Azerbaijan. Despite the COVID-19 recession, the supply of the Azerbaijani oil to the world energy markets continued. In general, the BTC pipeline carries mainly Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) crude oil and Shah Deniz condensate from Azerbaijan. Also, other volumes of crude oil and condensate continue to be transported via BTC, including volumes from Turkmenistan, Russia and Kazakhstan. As it is clear, the BTC pipeline linked directly the Caspian oil resources to the Western energy markets. The BTC pipeline exported over 27.8 million tons of crude oil loaded on 278 tankers at Ceyhan terminal in 2020. The European and the Asian countries became the major buyers of the Azerbaijani oil, and Italy (26.2%) and China (14%) became two major oil importers from Azerbaijan.

The successful completion of the SGC also strengthened Azerbaijani position in the Caspian region. The first Caspian natural gas to the European energy markets has been already supplied via Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) in December 2020, which is the European segment of the SGC. According to TAP AG consortium,a total of one billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas from Azerbaijan has now entered Europe via the Greek interconnection point of Kipoi, where TAP connects to the Trans Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP). The TAP project contributes significantly to diversification of supply sources and routes in Europe.

Another historical event that affected the Caspian region was the rapprochement between Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan. The MoU on joint exploration of “Dostluk/Friendship” (previously called Kapaz in Azerbaijani and Sardar in Turkmen) offshore field between Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan was an important event that will cause positive changes in the energy map of the Caspian Sea.

The Assembly of Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan Parliament have already approved the agreed Memorandumon joint exploration, development, and deployment of hydrocarbon resources at the “Dostluq” field. It should be noted that for the first time two Caspian states agreed to cooperate in the energy sector, which opens a window for the future Trans-Caspian Pipeline (TCP) from Turkmenistan to Azerbaijan. Such cooperation and the future transit of Turkmen oil and gas via the existing energy infrastructure of Azerbaijan will be a milestone for trans-regional cooperation.

The supply of the Caspian and Central Asian natural gas to European energy markets was always attractive. Therefore, the TCP is a strategic energy project for the US and EU. After the signing of the Caspian Convention, the EU officials resumed talks with Turkmenistan regarding the TCP. The May 2019 visit of the Turkmen delegation headed by the Advisor of the President of Turkmenistan on oil and gas issues was aimed at holding technical consultations between Turkmenistan and the EU. Turkmen delegation met with the representatives of the General Directorate on Energy of the European Commission and with the representatives of “British Petroleum,” “Shell” and “Total” companies. TCP is a project which supports diversification of gas sources and routes for the EU, and the gas pipeline to the EU from Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan via Georgia and Turkey, known as the combination of “Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline” (TCP), “South-Caucasus Pipeline Future Expansion” (SCPFX) became the “Project of Common Interest” for the EU.

Conclusively, Azerbaijan is a key energy player in the region. Mega energy projects of the country play an important role to deliver Caspian oil and gas to global energy markets. However, the Second Karabakh War has revealed the importance of peace and security in the region. The BTC pipeline and the Southern Gas Corridor linking directly the Caspian energy to Western energy markets were under Armenian constant threat. As noted by Hikmat Hajiyev, the Foreign Policy Advisor to the President, “Armenia fired cluster rocket to BTC pipeline in Yevlak region”. Fortunately, during the Second Karabakh War, Azerbaijan protected its strategic infrastructure, and there was no energy disruption. But attacks on critical energy infrastructure revealed that instability in the region would cause damages to the interests of many states.

In the end, Azerbaijan changed the energy map of the Caspian Sea by completing mega energy projects, as well as creating the milestone for energy cooperation in the Caspian region. After Azerbaijan’s victory in the Second Karabakh War, the country supports full regional economic integration by opening all transport and communication links. Now, the importance of the Caspian region became much more important, and Azerbaijan supports the idea of the exportation of natural gas from Turkmenistan and the Mediterranean via SGC. Such cooperation will further increase the geostrategic importance of the SGC, as well as Azerbaijan’s role as a transit country.","Such rich hydrocodone reserves allowed the Caspian states to contribute significantly to the global energy markets.
As it is clear, the BTC pipeline linked directly the Caspian oil resources to the Western energy markets.
The successful completion of the SGC also strengthened Azerbaijani position in the Caspian region.
Mega energy projects of the country play an important role to deliver Caspian oil and gas to global energy markets.
The BTC pipeline and the Southern Gas Corridor linking directly the Caspian energy to Western energy markets were under Armenian constant threat."

Sustainable Livelihoods Behind Street Vending in Thailand

By Kalinga Seneviratne

KHAOSAN, Bangkok (IDN) – When people talk about sustainable development there is rarely any mention of the many street vendors who make a living on streets in Thailand, as across the rest of Asia.

Even attempts to stop them doing business – like the unsuccessful year-long attempt by the governor of Bangkok to clean the city’s streets of street vendors – passes unnoticed in the media.

“Street vending tends to attract tourists to Bangkok, it is part of Thai lifestyle and tourists want to experience that,” says Pattama Vilailert, a tourism consultant. “Some tourists come to Thailand (especially) to taste reasonable street food.”

Vilailert notes that after visiting Bangkok, many Chinese tourists, for example, post photos of a street food stall on social media that go viral and others will then come to eat, take a photo and post it on the same social media. “It is part of their travel accomplishment,” she argues. Last year, a staggering 10 million Chinese visited Thailand.

In April last year, a month after Bangkok was named as the finest street food destination in the world by CNN, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) announced that it was going to rid Bangkok’s pavements of street vendors in the interest of cleanliness, safety and order.

Wanlop Suwandee, chief adviser to Bangkok’s governor, said then that “street vendors have seized the pavement space for too long and we already provide them with space to sell food and other products legally in the market, so there will be no let-up in this operation.”

In June last year, representatives of street vendors from Bangkok’s 50 districts submitted a letter to Prime Minister General Prayut Chan-o-cha asking that they be allowed to continue trading on the streets because it was their livelihood. It was reported by the Nation news group that the vendors described the measures by the government and the BMA to confine Bangkok’s street vendors to designated areas and markets as too harsh.

One of the areas that was exempt from the ban was the backpacker tourist haven of Khaosan, a historic area bordering the Chayo Prayo river. For decades this area has been a magnet for budget travellers with its cheap hostels and guesthouses … and street vendors.

Today, not only Westerners but also thousands of Asian travellers are attracted to its street vending culture, creating a carnival-like atmosphere after sunset, with streets lined by the folding tables and chairs of food stalls, virtually closing thoroughfare to traffic. Besides the many neighbourhood hotels and pubs that also set out their own folding tables and chairs on the street, numerous ‘tent’ stalls are put up on the pavements selling objects like clothes, shoes, bags and souvenirs, among others.

Over the years, studies have shown that street vending is a major livelihood for many Thais with a low level of education and it has thus become a major source of income for urban poor families, some of which have migrated from the villages.

Here in Khaosan, vendors are said to pay monthly fees to someone, be it rent to the land or shop owner where they sell their food, bribes to police or fees to informal neighbourhood organisations.

However, Nut, a food vendor in her 40s who has been selling noodles from her mobile cart here for many years, told IDN that mobile stalls do not pay the police. “If I have a stationary shop I have to pay” she told IDN, adding, “I have a family in Bangkok to feed from what I earn from this.” But, a juice seller who gave his name as Tot complained, “I have to pay money every day to do business. No money, police arrest me. They come every day to take money.”

One of the street food vendors, whom one of his Burmese employees told IDN is a Cambodian, said that he runs his stall 24 hours a day. “I supervise at night. My sister comes in the morning,” he explained, refusing to give his name. He was not willing to say if he has to pay the police but he did indicate that he has to pay “someone” to operate here.

He employs about eight young workers – men and women – from Myanmar. He has his kitchen and the tables and chairs for his customers under five tents. All of these are taken out and stored in the back of a pick-up truck on Monday morning and brought back out on Tuesday evening, because street stalls are not allowed to operate on Mondays.

Casually talking to street vendors, IDN noted that most of the vendors who sell non-food items like clothes, shoes and bags are from Myanmar, some of Nepali origin. Most seem to be in their 20s and 30s. They were unwilling to give their names. A Burmese woman in her 30s selling bags said that her “boss” pays her 350 Bhat (about 10 dollars) a day plus a two percent commission on every 1,000 Bhat of sales.

A 28-year-old man who gave his name as Kumar said that he is of Nepali origin but a Myanmar citizen from Mandalay. “We come getting the passport chopped (at the border) and work here. We’re legally here,” he insisted. “No jobs in Mandalay. We cannot starve there. I get about 15,000 Bhat (about 425 dollars) a month from boss. This is not my shop. Boss pay the police for me to have shop here ... not me.”

In January it was reported that the Thai authorities had arrested over 1,600 illegal migrants, mainly from Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos who were working as street vendors or in restaurants. Under a new law, they could be sentenced to five years in prison or fined up to 100,000 Bhat (about 2,800 dollars), and employers of illegal migrants also face hefty fines.

A Thai social worker, who has worked with Myanmar refugees for over two decades, but did not want to be named, told IDN that there are about four million Myanmar people working in Thailand and only about 200,000 have legal status to work here. “They pay agents in border areas to get work permits … Thai brokers makes thousands of Bhat from each of them,” she explained.

“As long as they can speak Thai they are tolerated and Thais don’t care” she added. “These migrants come from a culture where almost everything is done illegally so they don’t see anything wrong in getting things done by paying someone.”

She did not see a problem for the Thai street vendors (who usually operate food stalls) in terms of sustainable incomes for themselves from street trading.

In fact, she noted, these migrant workers may contribute towards making street vending more profitable and sustainable for the locals because “undocumented migrants can’t go for higher paid jobs ... so they would work for bosses to run their street shops or work as kitchen hands.” [IDN-InDepthNews – 15 February 2018]

35,https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2018/02/13/unesco-chanel-empowering-women-madagascar-sustainable-tourism/,"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Modern Diplomacy,UNESCO and CHANEL empowering women in Madagascar through sustainable tourism,"When someone said, “getting there is half the fun,” they must have been talking about Switzerland. This European gem has such a vast availability of public transport throughout the country.

Moving past the occasional traffic jams and road constructions, they know how to make traveling comfortable for everyone. Their public transit network is orderly, on time, pristinely clean, and much popular among the locals.

So, if you are in Switzerland and are planning to travel, the number of ways you can enjoy the serenity is endless. But the first step on this journey is to get travel from the airport to your desired destination.

Zurich airport transportation gives you three ways to enter the cities from the airport with much ease. You can either take the train for a view of nature or the tram if you want to enjoy the city’s sights or take a taxi, which is the most comfortable option but is also expensive.

Read on for some helpful tips that will make traveling easier for you in Switzerland.

1. Utilize Free Public Transportation

If you are traveling to Geneva, Lucerne, Bern, Basel, or Lausanne, transportation will not be something you’ll have to worry about. Switzerland offers everyone free public transportation in their most traveled cities, including these. You can not only save taxi fares but also be able to explore the whole city for free.

Most of the time, the hotel you’re staying at will provide you with a transport card which you can use to travel for free. So, if you are staying at a hotel, make sure to ask at the reception for potential freebies.

2. Don’t Purchase Travel Passes.

A travel pass should be your last option. It takes up a good amount of funds, and if you don’t end up using public transport a significant number of times, then the pass hasn’t been put to use well.

Before you finally settle on buying a pass, you may ask yourself what all places you will travel to? Will you cover long distances at all, or will you stay around the same area? How frequently will you use the pass? These questions might help you understand if the pass is necessary or not.

3. Get a Free Bike

Geneva, Zug, Bern, Zurich, the Canton of Valais, and Neuchatel are some places that will offer you bikes for free. And if you are in one of these cities, you’re in for a treat. You can rent bikes for a few hours, a whole day, or for an even longer time. All you will need is your valid ID and a small deposit amount, which you get back after returning the bike.

If you are not in one of these places, you can still rent out a bike. They may not be for free, but they are still cheaper than other public transports or taxis.

4. Grab the Free Activities

You will be surprised to know that there are so many things that you can enjoy for free when you are in Switzerland. You have to pay attention and look in the right direction.

Many free walking tours take place all across the country. You can visit the free wildlife parks in Winterthur, Interlaken, Zurich, St. Gallen, and other places. Museums, churches, hills for hiking, and Old towns are open and free to all.

Take a toll through parks, bridges, and botanical gardens. You can visit Europe’s largest waterfalls, that is, the Rhine falls in Schaffhausen.

Experience the cheese factories and enjoy all the free samples. Talk to people and explore, and you’ll find there’s always something left yet to explore.

A few bonus tips to make your trip budget-friendly in Switzerland.

Avoid staying in major cities. No doubt staying in a major city has its perks, but it’s too expensive, and you also miss out on the scenic beauty of nature that Switzerland is all popular for. You can instead find a hotel or Airbnb far outside of the city and the postcard Switzerland you came for.

Avoid high seasons. The high seasons are winter and summer when tourists flood this country. This is also the time when rates go very high because of the demand. If you want a good deal, then plan your visit during the spring or autumn when accommodations are cheaper, and there is a lesser crowd.

Cook your meal. Carry mini gadgets that can help you cook your food, like a mini rice cooker. Stay in a place that has a kitchen, so you don’t have to buy your food.

Rent an apartment if you’re planning to stay for long. This way it is much cheaper, and you can cook your food.

Take advantage of the Swiss Pass. If you do end up getting a Swiss Travel Pass, ensure you make full use of it. Visit the museums, castles, enjoy free rides as much as you can.","Utilize Free Public TransportationIf you are traveling to Geneva, Lucerne, Bern, Basel, or Lausanne, transportation will not be something you’ll have to worry about.

After the Golden State legalized medical marijuana in 1996, the nascent cannabis industry spread throughout much of Northern California’s remote regions and into the Central Valley. But today anxiety is high in weed country, which desperately needs the industry to survive.

The cost and risks of coming into compliance with county ordinances and state laws have deterred a lot of the Emerald Triangle’s underground growers from choosing the path to legitimacy. With a larger and more lucrative black market beckoning outside of California, many cannabis farmers have opted to continue operating outside the law by exporting their product.

In order to become a licensed grower in California, there are various agencies one must seek approval from. One has to take all the necessary steps to obtain local permits (including payment for legal and licensing fees); register fingerprints with the state Department of Justice; submit proof of compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA); submit cultivation, business and environmental plans, proof of ownership or right to use the cultivation space, any streambed or water alteration plans; implement a technically complex track-and-trace system; get a seller’s permit from the state, and more.

Securing local and state licenses to cultivate cannabis is costly. And even after small growers pay for the property improvements, lawyers, architects, land use and permitting experts, and licensing fees, many will find themselves taxed out of existence.

Under California’s new tax scheme, growers are taxed by the state at a rate of $148 per pound of cannabis flower and $44 per pound of cannabis leaves. In many places, growers pay an additional tax to the city or county of $25 per square foot of garden space.

Costs cannot simply be passed onto the consumer. Customers—both medical and recreational—are already being squeezed at the register. The state has imposed a 15 percent excise tax on all cannabis products. Several cities and counties have imposed an additional local tax that’s as high as 15 percent. California sales and use tax, which ranges from 7.5% to 10%, is then applied not just to the retail cost, but to the excise tax as well (in other words the excise tax is taxed).

What’s more, cannabis businesses may be penalized an additional ten percent if they pay their quarterly tax installments in cash!

Given that banks aren’t supposed to service federally illegal marijuana companies, cash is the only viable option for the cannabis industry in California at this point.

The Los Angeles Times estimates the high rate of taxation could lead to retail prices going up 70 percent in 2018, thereby ensuring that the black market will persist as an alternative for cannabis consumers as well as producers.

Supply Glut

“The future of Mendocino is kinda bleak for small farmers,” says cannabis industry veteran Anna Foster. “The way the regulations are being set up, it isn’t helping them compete.”

The challenges facing Mendocino farmers, according to Foster, are magnified by inconsistent county and city rules across the state and the current supply glut that is causing a sharp decline in per-pound prices. Taxes do not adjust with the price the supply is sold at.

The 2017 fall harvest brought the lowest prices in the legal medical market yet, with some growers saying they are unable to move even their top shelf at a break-even price. It is typical for growers to wait until post-harvest prices start to rise again before moving their product, but many are expressing concern they won’t be able to move it at all.

Concerned about the adverse environmental impact of Green Rush grow-ops, Mendocino and Humboldt have implemented measures to limit the size of gardens and the number of cultivation licenses given to those who were in the area before legalization. This approach, however, has made it very difficult for the region’s responsible growers to compete with better funded, large-scale industrial farms in other parts of California and the booming black market.

In Mendocino, for example, the largest garden size allows for a total of 22,000 square feet (including walkways and spaces not utilized for growing). A few hours south in Salinas, the agricultural town best-known as the setting for John Steinbeck’s novels, Monterey County regulations allow huge cannabis cultivation operations.

Related Story: How Science And Technology Will Make Growing Cannabis Better

Harborside Health Center, one of the largest and highest-grossing cannabis dispensaries in the world, recently shifted from sourcing most of its supply from smaller medical farmers and producers to its own 47-acre farming operation in Salinas.

“How are we going to be a weed county if we can’t even grow a whole acre of cannabis?” asks Foster, who lives in the Mendocino town of Willits.

Foster fears that the un-level playing field will devastate Northern California’s small cannabis farming communities. With the wholesale price of cannabis on the decline yet heavily taxed, some farmers “are looking at jobs outside of cannabis, because it’s not profitable or sustainable,” she explained. “They have always been farmers, but now they have to be businesspeople. And they don’t know how to be businesspeople because they’ve always been farmers.”

Looking For Work

Foster grew up in the world of marijuana cultivation and activism before the Green Rush and has been employed in the cannabis industry for most of her life. Her father, Will Foster , was arrested in 1995 for growing cannabis in his Tulsa, Oklahoma, basement to treat his degenerative arthritis. In 1997, he was convicted and sentenced to 93 years in prison, generating national coverage and outrage. During Will’s incarceration, Anna moved to Oakland, California, where she lived and worked with author/activist Ed Rosenthal and his wife Jane Klein, who ran a cannabis-oriented publishing company and other businesses affiliated with the early Bay Area medical marijuana movement.

More recently, Foster teamed up with Karen Byars, a longtime Emerald Triangle cannabis grower and advocate who has been hosting educational events to help the region’s responsible actors transition into a legal, regulated industry.

Byars relocated from Amarillo, Texas, to the Emerald Triangle in 1990 to participate in the Redwood Summer protests that sought to disrupt the logging industry and protect the disappearing old-growth redwood trees the region is famous for. Her work as an environmentalist exposed her to the underground cannabis farming community during Operation Green Sweep, a federal crackdown on marijuana growers who sympathized with the “tree huggers.”

After the passage of Proposition 215 in 1996, Byars began to cultivate medical marijuana with an all-women’s collective in Mendocino’s Round Valley. Two decades later, when cannabis was legalized for adult use, she and Foster organized a job fair, resume-building workshops, and other vocational development services to support the establishment and growth of stable industry businesses in the region.

In late 2017, their organization, Mendocino Cannabis Resource, hosted its first job fair. Over 600 people attended, twice the expected number. With just 16 vendors hiring farm laborers, managers, scientists, accountants and other workers, the demand for jobs clearly outweighed the supply. Half of the job seekers were locals, while others came from the eastern U.S. or as far away as Chile and China; most of them wanted to find a way to make money from growing marijuana.1

Small was Beautiful

In the past, when the cultivation scene was completely underground, successful growers would reinvest their money in small, local businesses – both by choice and because other kinds of investment required considerable illegal maneuvering. Growers spent their cash on community development, contributing to independent radio, local theater productions, and start-ups that doubled as community centers.

“It used to be that you kinda knew this guy’s sound studio wasn’t paying the bills,” Byars recalled, “but there was this cool place everyone had access to.”

Today, Byars is concerned that out-of-town land-grabbers and speculators betting on cannabis grows are extracting wealth from small communities in the Emerald Triangle without contributing much in return.

“People are coming up here and ‘green rushing’ these communities without knowing what they are doing,” she cautioned.

In the pre-legalization marijuana market, most of the money accrued to the growers. The price per pound peaked after the passage of 215. But as the medical market evolved into the post-prohibition commodity market, the economic focus has shifted from growing marijuana to processing, taxing, distributing and retailing it.

In post-prohibition California, new regulations siphon much of the profits from farmers to fill the state treasury. “People are treating growers like ATMs because they know all the money is in the weed. All the middlemen profit. The farmers and consumers lose,” said Foster.

Going Broke

Kevin Simmonds is a licensed contractor and cannabis cultivator who’s been serving the Bay Area market since 2010. Based in Santa Rosa, he struggles with lifelong pain due to arthritis, which is why he started growing medical cannabis. Simmonds uses an indoor compartmentalized grow system so that he is perpetually harvesting fresh product for dispensaries every week.

But now Simmonds is also struggling with the costs of coming into compliance, the glut of growers, and the plunging price per pound – and he may not survive. It would be much easier for him to keep turning a profit if he chose to move his product on the black market, which he has no interest in doing.

“It’s always been my intention to participate in whatever regulation scheme they come up with. This is it, I am stuck dealing with it and I am going broke,” says Simmonds.

To become compliant with the regulations that went into effect on Jan. 1, he had to invest nearly $100,000 in his indoor operation. He will be taxed per square foot of his garden’s canopy by both the state and Sonoma County. Additionally, he had to front tens of thousands more to get state licensing. Meanwhile, his margins are shrinking fast as prices drop in the legal market. He is worried that with the low wholesale price, high taxes and black market competition, legalization could bankrupt him.

“I have some cost projections for the coming year, and it’s going to be super tight. It is going to be a matter of if I can move all my product and have successful runs that yield well, every time. Without all those components, I will fail,” Simmonds confides.

Simmonds currently has three to four employees that tend the gardens and four full-time trimmers relying on work from his operation. “What I am up against,” he emphasizes, “are some well-financed operations starting up, people who can afford to lose money for a good long time.”

He said if he must take a significant corporate buyout to survive, he would happily do so at this point.

“I was born with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The prediction for me was that I would be on public assistance the rest of my life. Through [growing] cannabis, I was able to find a way to financially prosper and raise my kids. I put them through private schools and bought a house. All of these things would never have happened if it wasn’t for the small business models created by [Prop 215, which established] the foundation for my ability to start with nothing and make something,” Simmonds explains. “Now if anyone wants to make something with cannabis, they have to come in with at least a million dollars.”

Beyond California: The National Export Market

Adam Smith has seen this scenario play out before on a smaller but significant scale in Oregon. A longtime proponent of drug policy reform, Smith has been working both to save and promote responsible, locally-owned cannabis businesses in the Beaver State, which legalized recreational marijuana in 2014.2 Ultimately, the success of these farming communities may rest upon the ability of West Coast cannabis companies to export and sell product in a legal national market and beyond.

“It’s desperately important that we end federal prohibition, that we allow export,” asserts Smith.

“Northern California, like Southern Oregon, is deeply dependent on the fact that those small farms have supported thousands of families and whole communities,” he explains. “And there is a very good chance, in California in particular, that [the regulators] just wipe that out. If the export market was available right now, those farms would have a chance through branding themselves nationally and internationally as ‘Real California Cannabis,’ which is the product of an authentic, generations-old Northern California cannabis culture.”

With the roll-out of legalization in Oregon, Smith quickly recognized how big outside investment could negatively impact local economies in cannabis-dependent regions. “Those out-of-state interests had more money and resources than the local industry, but we’ve had an industry here for generations. It is an indigenous industry. It’s not Massachusetts with millionaires opening mega-grows.”

How can the indigenous cannabis industry in Northern California and Southern Oregon avoid being steamrolled by outside forces?

“With craft beer, if you don’t support your local brewer he can sell beer to [out-of-state] markets,” Smith notes. “If you don’t support your local cannabis growers, they go out of business or back to the black market.”

Smith recently founded the Craft Cannabis Alliance (CCA), a membership association of cannabis businesses in Oregon that share a “commitment to an authentic craft cannabis industry that respects and serves people, place, planet and plant.” The goal of the CCA is to build an industry that benefits small producers in cannabis-reliant economies by defining and promoting “craft cannabis” and providing resources to businesses with aligned missions. Smith intends to work with growers from California and other legal states as well.

A Different Kind Of Capitalism

“Oregon Cannabis has a global brand and people should know about it,” Smith explained. “When the walls [of federal prohibition] come down, if the shelves here are dominated by international and out-of-state companies, then that’s who is going to own the export market, and we will never buy it back. We will just be a low wage factory for the enrichment of other places and other people. Even if it is grown here, if you are buying cannabis and it’s owned by a Texas investment group or a Florida company or a Canadian company, you are just sending the profits out, bleeding money out of state, while we sort of give away our local industry. What do we do about that?”

Smith continues, “Our message is that we are not doomed to be in this sort of extractive capitalist model that will steal this from us or bleed this [region]. We can create and support an industry here, that is locally owned and where the money reverberates back through this economy. This is something that is worth saving and if we can bring in tourism to support this part of the industry, it can build communities, institutions and wealth here.”

The CCA defines the craft cannabis industry around six basic tenets: clean product, sustainable growing methods, ethical employment practices, community engagement, substantial local ownership and “meaningful participation in the movement to end the drug war, not just opening up the next cannabis market — because otherwise you’re just profiteering off of 80 years of ruined lives and destroyed communities, and that’s not moral and it shouldn’t be okay with consumers.”

As Smith sees it, the cannabis industry provides the “perfect vehicle to express a different kind of capitalism.” But steps need to be taken now at the federal level to stabilize the markets.

“This is why we have to tear down the federal walls as quickly as possible,” says Smith. “A lot of people are going to go out of business. If cannabis is allowed to be sucked into an extractive corporatist system, leaving people who care about deeper things on the fringes of this industry … it will not only be an economic disaster, it will be a cultural disaster.”

Last year Australians imported more than 5.22 million rose stems between February 1 and 14, mostly from Kenya. Assuming typical bouquets of 24 roses, that’s 217,500 bouquets sold in two weeks.

The problem is that our pursuit of goodwill and affection towards humanity through the giving of cut flowers is hurting the number-one lady in all of our lives: Mother Nature. If those 217,500 bouquets were each wrapped in 75cm of plastic cellophane, that adds up to more than 163km of plastic wrapping used in a two-week period – just for roses, just in Australia.

But facts about cellophane probably won’t win over your sweetheart. So with Valentine’s Day just around the corner, let’s consider making smarter, more sustainable flower purchases.

Petal power

In Australia alone, there are more than 900 flower farms intensively cultivating 4,470 hectares in order to supply almost 2,000 florists. However, the majority of cut flowers sold in Australia actually originate overseas, with imports from Ecuador alone valued at A$1.9 million in 2015. If you’re asking yourself “why are delicate flowers shipped halfway around the world?” this is a great question.

Countries near the Equator, like Ecuador, benefit from good growing conditions, including 12 hours of daylight all year round. In these regions, the contribution of the flower industry to the economy of small or less developed countries is often significant.

In eastern Africa, for example, flowers account for more than 10 per cent of total exports, second only to tea.

Lower wages in countries like Ecuador and Kenya also contribute to the economics of flying cut flowers around the world. Unfortunately, this often comes at a cost for local growers and pickers, who experience poor working conditions.

The thorny carbon issue

In the United States, the roughly 100 million roses grown, shipped and purchased on a typical Valentine’s Day produce some 9,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, from field to florist.

But, as with most things in our complex and busy world, the question of a flower’s carbon footprint isn’t as straightforward as it might seem. The Netherlands is one of the world’s biggest exporters of cut flowers, where the majority are grown in heated or refrigerated green houses.

Maintaining the controlled environmental conditions inside these buildings requires artificial light, heat and cooling, so each rose grown in The Netherlands contributes an average of around 2.91kg of CO₂ to the atmosphere. In contrast, a single rose grown on a farm in Kenya contributes only 0.5kg.

This is largely because Kenyan hot houses do not use artificial heating or lighting, and most farm workers walk or cycle to work. As a result, flowers grown in tropical regions are sometimes considered low-carbon (of course, this doesn’t always factor in international transport).

Pesky pesticides

As flowers are not an edible crop, they are typically exempt from regulations on pesticide use. As a result, the cut flower industry is one of the biggest consumers of pesticides worldwide.

In Kenya and other countries, chemicals such as methyl bromide (and others that are banned in countries like the US) are regularly imported in significant quantities by flower growers for pest control.

Worryingly, methyl bromide is an ozone-depleting substance. In some cases, run-off of these chemicals from growing fields adjacent to water bodies, such as Kenya’s Lake Naivasha, has resulted in the collapse of fish stocks that are crucial to local communities.

So what can you do?

We don’t want to be responsible for a downturn in expressions of love (or a corresponding uptick in conflict), and the good news is that there are plenty of eco-friendly ways to show your devotion.

The best option is to grow your own flowers to give as gifts. You can also give a living plant that can grow in your garden for years to come, reminding you of that special person and day. This is a rule in both of our households, and one our husbands are happy to accommodate – our gardens have never looked so good!

If growing or giving living plants isn’t an option, go for locally grown organic flowers, as this means fewer “flower miles”. Native species or hardy breeds like lilies and birds of paradise require fewer resources and survive for longer in transport, meaning there’s less wastage.

If you decide to buy imported flowers, look for Green Labels like FairTrade and MPS Florimark indicating that suppliers are members of regulatory schemes.

It’s also worth asking (or insisting) that your local florist switch from plastic cellophane wrapping to butcher’s paper (or similar).

“ Our pursuit of goodwill and affection towards humanity through the giving of cut flowers is hurting the number-one lady in all of our lives: Mother Nature.

To get you on your way, here are some sustainable flower growers in different corners of the globe:

Australia:

The Little Flower Farm (Melbourne)

Organically certified flowers from Byron Bay, so pure they’re actually sold as an edible product

Give a (living) gift that keeps on giving for months or years to come, from companies such as Growing Gifts

Europe & the Americas:

Florverde Sustainable Flowers (based in Colombia) provide social programmes for their workers and implement a range of environmental standards, including rainwater collection and air pollution filters. Florverde are a major exporter to Europe, so look for their label in this region

For 15 years, Organic Bouquet (based in Florida) has helped to convert more than 8,000ha of land to organic and sustainable horticulture

Eco-stems Flower Shop (based in Toronto) doesn’t just pride themselves in sustainable flower supply, but takes things a whole lot further. All furniture and fixtures are reclaimed/recycled in store, they only use 100 per cent energy efficient lighting, waste water is collected and re-used, delivery vehicles are hybrid, etc. These guys are definitely going the extra mile!

The objective is to work together to meet the objective of producing at scale affordable advanced Biofuels. This is the largest multilateral platform to promote research, development and demonstration in clean energy. Use of fossil fuels for transportation contributes significantly to global greenhouse gases (GHG) emission. The sustainable biofuels have ability to reduce the GHG emission load.

Biofuels, in the form of liquid fuels derived from plant materials, are entering the market, driven by factors such as oil price spikes and the need for increased energy security. However, many of these first-generation biofuels that are currently being supplied have been criticised for their adverse impacts on the natural environment, food security, and land use. The challenge is to support second, third and fourth-generation biofuel development.

Second-generation biofuels include new cellulosic technologies, with responsible policies and economic instruments to help ensure that biofuel commercialization is sustainable. Responsible commercialization of biofuels represents an opportunity to enhance sustainable economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and Asia. A healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes and reduce dependency on fossil fuels, especially in the transport sector.

Brazil’s production of ethanol fuel from sugarcane dates back to the 1970s. development of resistant sugar cane varieties is a crucial aspect of disease and pest control. Crops like Jatropha, used for biodiesel, can thrive on marginal agricultural land where many trees and crops won't grow, or would produce only slow growth yields.[47][48] Jatropha cultivation provides benefits for local communities.

Pongamia pinnata is a legume native to Australia, India, Florida (USA) and most tropical regions, and is now being invested in as an alternative to Jatropha for areas such as Northern Australia, where Jatropha is classed as a noxious weed. A study by researchers at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) found that growing sweet sorghum instead of grain sorghum could increase farmers incomes by US$40 per hectare per crop because it can provide food, feed and fuel,according to Wikipedia.","A two-day International Conference on Sustainable Biofuels is jointly being organized by Department of Biotechnology, Govt.

FAO urges investments in urban forests to address pollution, climate change, and lack of water supplies

20 March 2018, Rome - Investing in green spaces can help transform cities into more sustainable, resilient, healthy, equitable and pleasant places to live, said FAO ahead of the International Day of Forests (21 March 2018).

If planned and managed well, cities can be great places to live, but many urban developments cause environmental havoc - ultimately leading to problems such as high temperatures, flooding, and air pollution. The cost for citizens is deteriorating well-being. The costs for the planet include increased greenhouse gas emissions, the degradation of soils and waterways, according to the FAO forestry publication Unasylva, the latest issue of which is devoted to urban forestry in celebrating the International Day of Forests.

""Well managed forests and trees in and around cities provide habitats, food and protection for many plants and animals, helping to maintain and increase biodiversity,"" said FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva in his video message on the occasion of the Day. He stressed the need ""to join forces to protect forests and trees to make urban environments more sustainable"".

Cities need forests and trees

More than half the world's population now lives in cities, and by 2050 almost 70 percent of the world will be urbanized. Although cities occupy only three percent of the Earth's surface, they consume 78 percent of energy and emit 60 percent of carbon dioxide.

Woodlands, forests and trees in a city and on its fringes perform a wide range of vital functions - such as storing carbon, removing air pollutants, assisting in food, energy and water security, restoring degraded soils and preventing drought and floods. In a medium size city, for instance, urban trees can reduce the loss of soil by around 10,000 tons per year.

By shading and cooling the air, forests and trees in urban areas can reduce extreme temperatures and mitigate the effects of climate change. Indeed, trees properly placed around buildings can reduce air conditioning needs by 30 percent. In cold climates, by shielding homes from the wind, they can help save energy used for heating by 20-50 percent.

Urban and peri-urban forests can increase the resilience and quality of watersheds and water reservoirs by preventing erosion, limiting evapotranspiration and filtering pollutants. And planting fruit-bearing street trees can increase the availability of food within cities.

Inspiring stories from around the world

Many cities are already demonstrating their commitments to a more sustainable future and there are many excellent examples of green urban development, according to a new FAO publication called ""Forests and sustainable cities - Inspiring stories from around the world"" also launched today on the occasion of the International Day of Forests.

The publication highlights different ways in which cities around the globe have used forests and trees to improve the living conditions of their citizens, which may serve as inspiration for others.

Beijing's afforestation miracle

Beijing is one of the world's most populated and polluted cities. Without large forests and other green areas the city risks becoming concrete jungle with increasingly serious effects on health and wellbeing of urban dwellers.

In 2012, Beijing initiated the largest afforestation programme in its history. In suburban and peri-urban areas, most lands were afforested after moving low-end industries. Forests, which cover now more than 25 percent of the city plain - an increase of 42 percent - provide neighbourhoods with more space for recreation.

Community involvement in Nairobi

Karura forest in the central north of Kenya's capital Nairobi was once a crime-ridden area. The forest's proximity to the rapidly growing city led to plans to reduce the forest area to make way for property development. But when the local communities became involved in its management, its fortunes turned around.

Conservationists, led by environmental activist Wangari Maathai, launched a highly publicized campaign to save the forest. Collaboration with various stakeholders, including local authorities, private sector, community and resident associations, donors and non-governmental organizations, played a decisive role in improving forest management of the Karura forest.

Local people have benefited considerably from direct participation. The forest is no longer a place of danger for them but rather a source of opportunities. It employs 46 permanent workers, 36 of whom are from surrounding communities. It has also become a significant tourist attraction: from zero visitors in 2009, the forest now welcomes on average 16 000 visitors per month.

Lima: reducing risk of natural disasters

In Lima/Peru, the municipality launched an afforestation project to reduce the threat of landslides in 2015. Local people were taught in afforestation that helps to reduce the risk of disasters because it stabilizes slopes, controls and prevents rock falls, retains mud and sediments, and improves the environment.

An area of 14 hectares - the size of five football fields - has been designated for a park, which includes trails, viewing points and family recreation spaces. As a result, 23000 native trees have been planted and a drip irrigation system installed using treated wastewater.

FAO's work on urban forests

FAO supports the adoption of urban forest solutions for cities with guidelines as well as technical and communication tools.

In Niger, for example, FAO assisted the Government in elaborating a national policy for the management of green spaces in and around cities to protect the environment and mitigate the effects of climate change.

In Cape Verde, FAO supported the Government in developing integrated urban forestry plans in Praia and in other major cities through organizing trainings for technicians on planning, design and management of urban green spaces and constructing new nurseries.

International Day of Forests

Given that this year the High-Level Political Forum will be reviewing SDG 11 on making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, and SDG 15 on protecting terrestrial ecosystems, the choice of the theme for the International Day of Forests this year, which highlights the various benefits of urban forests and trees, could not have been more timely.

On 21 March, FAO will celebrate the Day and its theme ""Forests and sustainable cities"" at a special ceremony at FAO headquarters in Rome which will be attended by city administrators from Lima, Ljubljana, Philadelphia and Mantova. The event will be webcast here.","He stressed the need ""to join forces to protect forests and trees to make urban environments more sustainable"".

“This is part of a growing movement for change. It is time for the retail industry to show what it can do for the common good. We are taking collective action to build a better, more prosperous and sustainable world, and demonstrating how we are making a positive contribution to society, in terms of the supply chain, food packaging and waste,” said Richard Pennycook, Chairman of the British Retail Consortium.

“Retail is a driving force for our economy and our recently launched Retail Sector Council will seek to boost the industry’s economic health and sustainable growth,” Andrew Griffiths, Retail Minister, added. “Through our Industrial Strategy and the Good Work Plan, we have already made steps to create a stronger, fairer society and it’s encouraging to see retailers come together to fulfil these ambitions through the Better Retail, Better World initiative.

The initiative includes a series of stretch targets for the retail industry to achieve by 2020 and 2030. The goals draw on SDGs 8 (Decent Work & Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and 13 (Climate Action). The BRC will work with retailers to address human rights issues with actions such as embedding policies to eliminate recruitment fees and supporting people from underrepresented demographics progress in employment.

In addition to working to create safer, fairer working environments, the initiative also focuses on transitioning the industry to a more sustainable, less environmentally impactful model. Signatories have pledged to reduce waste sent to landfill, adopt responsible sourcing practices, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and collaborate to eliminate deforestation by 2030.

Other retailers participating in the Better Retail Better World initiative are Aldi, Baukjen Group, Boots, C&J Clarks, Debenhams, DFS, Dixons Carphone, Fenwicks, Greggs, The House of Bruar, House of Fraser, IKEA, Kingfisher, Morrisons, Musgrave Group, NEXT, Ocado, Signet, WHSMITH and Wilko.

“We are delighted to support the Better Retail Better World industry goals which provide BRC members with some of the best information and guidance to engage with the Sustainable Development Goals,” said Tanya Steele, Chief Executive of WWF. “The goals are what the SDGs are all about: bringing business, civil society and government together to bring about change in the world.

The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) on Wednesday launched Green, Green, Green, a unique assistance program that aims to make the country’s 145 cities more livable and sustainable through the development of public open spaces.

A component of the Duterte administration’s national infrastructure development program Build, Build, Build, Green, Green, Green will support city governments in creating open spaces through the establishment of forest parks and botanical gardens, upgrading streets and waterfronts and revitalizing plazas.

According to Budget Secretary Benjamin E. Diokno, P2.5 billion has been appropriated for this in the 2018 budget.

The Green, Green, Green program aims to improve the connectivity and accessibility of spaces through construction of eco-friendly bike lanes and walkways.

Sustainability of spaces will also be enhanced through the construction of green infrastructure like bioswales and pervious surfaces, which can aid during rainy season and flooding.

Green, Green, Green is also expected to improve livability of urban areas through various activities and methods, such as landscaping, turfing and tree planting; and transform streetscapes through installation of eco-friendly street furniture, fixtures and shading.

With the rising urban density in the country, creating more challenges for the local government units (LGUs) and citizens, overcrowding and traffic congestion, as well as lack of open spaces where people can socialize and practice an active lifestyle, are now daily obstacles to urban dwellers.

These conditions significantly make cities less livable and less sustainable, and also make communities more vulnerable against natural and man-made disasters.

With these intensifying issues, there is a pressing need for LGUs and citizens to find ways to manage urban evolution to steer their cities toward sustainable development.

According to a World Health Organization report, successful cities provide a minimum of 9 square meters of green space per citizen. Thus, by acknowledging and building on the great potential of public open spaces in cities and urban zones, governments and citizens can improve the overall quality of life.

DBM Assistance to Cities Program Manager Julia Nebrija said they also plan to reclaim the spaces in Metro Manila.

“There are many unutilized spaces we can repurpose. In New York and other congested cities, they were able to find ways to establish open areas,” Nebrija said.

DBM Director Leila Rivera of the Local Government and Regional Coordination added there will be conditions for participation of city government.

“City governments have to submit an expression of interest and conceptual design of proposed projects,” she said, adding that a circular will be released to specify the funding guidelines.

Nebrija and Rivera are also set to lead the technical workshop on Green, Green, Green, which will begin on March 15.

The workshop, to be attended by city mayors and two officers from each local government, will focus on discussions on the importance of establishing and maintaining well-designed public open spaces in an urban area, as well as the best practices and lessons on designing public open spaces in the Philippines.

Award-winning landscape architect and urban planner, Paulo Alcazaren, and landscape architect and University of the Philippines College of Architecture lecturer, Faith Dumaligan will be the resource speakers for the workshop.","After “Build, Build, Build” and “Jobs, Jobs, Jobs” comes “Green, Green, Green.”The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) on Wednesday launched Green, Green, Green, a unique assistance program that aims to make the country’s 145 cities more livable and sustainable through the development of public open spaces.

Haptic Architects and the Nordic Office of Architecture have just released plans to create a city next to Oslo Airport, known as Oslo Airport City (OAC), that will be the “first energy positive airport city.”

OAC will use only energy created within the city itself, and driverless, electric vehicles will roam its streets. “This is a unique opportunity to design a new city from scratch,” said Tomas Stokke, director of Haptic Architects, to Dezeen. But, what exactly makes this such a sustainable city? Let’s explore:

The city will be extremely walkable. Those living there or just visiting won’t have to take any form of transportation, it will be easy for them to walk to most places.

The city’s center will be entirely car-free. This will be made possible, in large part, by the city’s innate walkability.

OAC plans to use a host of boundary-pushing, green technologies. While not all tech has been specified yet, the city will use driverless cars, auto-lighting, “smart” waste tech, and security tech.

The city will only use only the renewable energy that it produces. This will cut down on fossil fuel use and the energy used to transport fuel and energy.

OAC will sell excess energy that it produces, and it will also use excess energy to de-ice planes – cutting down the airport’s fuel usage.

Only electric cars will be used inside of the city.

Public transportation will be extremely close, a cycling route, and a host of outdoor activities that don’t require electricity.

This location might seem random, but it could be ideal for the utopian city being planned. Oslo Airport expects its employees to double by 2050. This city could be a perfect location for their families to reside alongside visitors in transit.

So, how possible is OAC, the sort of place that seems almost too good to be true? “We believe the future of airport city development in Norway and Oslo is not a matter of if, but when,” said Thor Thoeneie, managing director of OAC, to Dezeen.

Construction is slated to begin in 2019 and the city is set to be completed by 2022. This seems ambitious, and the timeline might change, but with the country’s dedication to sustainability, it isn’t so far-fetched that this city of the future will soon become reality.

Promoting the integrated management of water resources, the Decade aims to create a platform for sharing good practices, advocacy, networking and partnership-building at all levels. It will support achievement of the water-related aspects of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, and the Paris Agreement on climate change.

Organized by the UNGA President, the high-level launch event took place on 22 March 2018 at UN Headquarters in New York, US. World Water Day is celebrated annually on 22 March.

Delivering remarks on behalf of the UNGA President, Mahmoud Saikal, Permanent Representative of Afghanistan and UNGA Vice President, noted the success of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water, and underscored the centrality of water to the achievement of all the SDGs. He said the Decade of Action needs to be defined by: water and sanitation as priorities for the budgets and policies of national governments; a surge of cooperation on water management and disaster risk reduction (DRR) between different stakeholders, including the UN, governments, international financial institutions, businesses and civil society; and increased water-related investments and innovations.

António Guterres, UN Secretary-General, said with demand for freshwater projected to grow by more than 40% by 2050 and climate change having a growing impact, water scarcity is “an enormous concern.” He added that, by 2050, at least one in four people will live in a country where the lack of fresh water will be chronic or recurrent. He further noted that: 40% of the world’s people are affected by water scarcity; 80% of wastewater is discharged untreated into the environment; and more than 90% of disasters are water-related. More than two billion people lack access to safe water and more than 4.5 billion people lack adequate sanitation services.

The Secretary-General presented the Action Plan of the Decade for Action, which has three objectives: transforming the current silo-based approach to water supply, sanitation, water management and DRR into an integrated one to better tackle water stress, combat climate change, and enhance resilience; aligning existing water and sanitation programmes and projects with the 2030 Agenda; and generating the political will for strengthened cooperation and partnerships.

Emomali Rahmon, President of the Republic of Tajikistan and Initiator of the Decade for Action, presented the report titled, ‘Making Every Drop Count: An agenda on Water Action’ on behalf of the members of the High-Level Panel on Water. Autumn Peltier, civil society representative, explained why water is sacred and noted that water should be protected by human rights.

During the ensuing plenary, the Prime Minister of Kyrgyzstan said, in the future, water will possibly be the key element in the relations between states and communities. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Maldives, for the Alliance of Small Island Developing States (AOSIS), stressed the need for investment in developing infrastructure for the effective management and efficient use of water. He also called for capacity building support for data collection. The Minister of Water of Ethiopia emphasized the need for international support and partnerships to address the gap in access to clean water and sanitation. The Minister of Water and Irrigation of Jordan called for advancing effective management of shared water resources.

Guyana, for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), called for increasing official development assistance (ODA), awareness, and cooperation on water issues at all levels. Supported by Palau for the Small-island Developing States (P-SIDS), she emphasized the centrality of SDG 13 on climate action to achieving SDG 6 on clean water and sanitation. Egypt, for the Group of the 77 and China (G-77/ China), called for developed countries to increase their investments in water and sanitation projects in developing countries. Paraguay, for Land-locked Developing Countries (LLDCs), said integrated approaches to water management are essential to achieving the Vienna Programme of Action for the LLDCs (VPoA) for the LLDCs.

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) announced the inclusion of water-related issues in its humanitarian efforts. Israel highlighted the importance of developing innovative technologies, explaining that it solved the issue of water scarcity by making its agricultural system rely on treated waste-water. Peru and the Netherlands spoke about water’s importance to achieving SDG 16 on peace and security through creating a conducive environment for peace. He announced the planned launch of the ‘Valuing Water’ global coalition in collaboration with the World Bank, the UN, and other water stakeholders including youth and indigenous people, on the margins of this year’s High-level Political Forum for Sustainable Development (HLPF). Peru spoke about the development of indicators for the implementation of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) water governance principles.

Germany said it would support the strengthening of UN-Water and the creation of a dedicated space for intergovernmental discussions on the implementation of water-related goals and targets within the UN. Japan highlighted the need for investment in DRR. Australia presented the Water for Women Fund which has invested US$110 million and partnered with civil society to address the gender aspects of water-related challenges. Switzerland called for greater emphasis on water within the UN.

During a panel on the ‘Contribution of the Water Decade to the implementation of water related SDGs,’ Ali Al-Ghezawi, Minister of Water and Irrigation of Jordan, emphasized that regional cooperation on water issues is especially important for LLDCs. Henk Ovink, Special Envoy for International Water Affairs of Netherlands, noted that UN’s approach to water is currently unorganized, and the Decade for Action should contribute to addressing this issue.

Danilo Türk, Chairman of the Global High-Level Panel on Water and Peace and former President of the Republic of Slovenia, suggested that water specialists should be included in UN Peacekeeping operations to enable them to address the water-related aspects of civilian protection. Priscilla Achapka, Executive Director Women Environmental Programme, highlighted the need to integrate the gender-related aspects in water planning and management. Sadhguru, Founder of the Isha Foundation, stressed the need to make ecology a lucrative field for the vast number of people involved in it.

During a panel on the ‘Role of relevant stakeholders in mobilizing necessary resources for the implementation and follow-up of water related SDGs,’ Katalin Bogyay, Permanent Representative of Hungary, said the importance of water should be accurately captured by the current efforts of reforming the UN development system. Mohamed Asim, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Maldives, spoke about the involvement of private sector, through public-private partnerships, in an ambitious series of desalination projects that are essential for providing Maldives with drinking water.

Andries Nel, Deputy Minister for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs of South Africa, highlighted the need for strengthening the rural-urban linkage when it comes to water access and management, as well as for a citizens’ participatory approach to urban planning. Mariet Verhoef-Cohen, President of Women for Water Partnership, underscored the important role women play in water management and called for them to participate on an equal footing with men in water programs. She added that women’s experience with water resources will be essential for water programs’ success.

And then I got hungry. Very hungry.

Because if I am honest, the thing that most hit home to me was the way in which climate change would affect food and food systems. I couldn’t imagine – and didn’t want to imagine – a world in which not only the joy of eating was gone, but so too was our ability to feed the planet.

So I decided to get my hands dirty. I turned my tiny 13th-floor apartment balcony in the heart of Sydney into a vegetable garden. This was an odd choice, so my friends enjoyed pointing out, for a dedicated inner-city TV news anchor, but it was a life-changing one. It sparked a far deeper connection to what I consume, and it has changed my life, taking me on a ten-year journey to understanding how growing food in our cities can be truly transformative.

It turns out my journey has been mirrored in the scientific community as our understanding of how we will grow enough food in a climate-changed world has deepened. In fact, pushing for change in the food and agricultural industries may be tantamount to getting the climate action we need, according to a recent report by the Meridian Institute. Food, in fact, could be the crux of both the problem and a needed transformational solution to the problems we face.

{articleGUID}

The report underlines that food systems have significant, adverse effects on climate change and that climate change impacts food systems in many complex ways – global food demand is set to increase by at least 60 percent by 2050, and global meat consumption alone will double as populations grow, especially in developing countries. The carbon emissions associated with meat production are even greater than for the agricultural industry. An already stretched system will be under even more pressure, at the same time as climate impacts such as droughts, floods and fires increase and make food production more of a challenge.

What’s more, the report acknowledges the circular nature of this relationship: our food choices impact on the planet, and meanwhile the conditions to which we contribute make it more difficult to maintain reliable food systems which will stand up to a changing climate. Think about the processes involved in the production of one loaf of bread. It may contain wheat from the Ukraine, poppy seeds from France, soybean oil from Brazil, and preservatives from multiple origins, all combined in a German factory before being sold in several countries.

Many parts of the process are wasteful and compromise certain people and environments, whether through exposure to chemicals, the clearing of land to grow commercial crops or corporate monopoly over the market. This is before even mentioning the energy involved in harvesting, storage and transportation.

On the other hand, many of the fruit and vegetables which I tried growing were from local and heirloom varieties, untouched by modern agricultural methods. My harvest hadn’t travelled thousands of miles or contributed to deforestation.

As the Meridian paper says, “actions need to consider local, Indigenous, and practitioner knowledge”. We must learn from the methods used for centuries to grow food without a huge environmental footprint. We must also adapt those techniques to fit new environments, like our urban roofs, balconies and walls.

{articleGUID}

And those messages are starting to gain ground. This week’s Parabere Forum in Malmö, Sweden will feature guests from all over the world discussing the role that women, in particular, can play in the food sector. I will be sharing the result of my journey – that women can lead the charge to grow our own Edible Cities, that producing food is empowering and re-energising. Food systems have caused problems, but when viewed holistically, they can also be a part of the solution for communities and the environment.

Although my personal journey is tiny in comparison to the global changes which need to take place, my experience shows how quickly change can come about. If I managed to provide food for my loved ones in a concrete urban environment, there is huge potential for wider-scale innovative food production. If we are to improve food security and reduce the contribution of food systems to climate change, we need to become more adaptable and start using all the space we have.

Vail is once again receiving international recognition for its collective sustainability efforts by being named the Best of the Top 100 Sustainable Destinations. A delegation from Vail is in Europe this week to accept the award in the Best of the Americas category, which is being presented in partnership with ITB Berlin, the world’s leading travel trade show, which runs March 7-11.

Vail is among 33 finalists being recognized as the World’s Best Sustainable Destinations. The selection was made by a jury representing 12 international organizations from among 100 top sustainable destinations. Categories included Best of Cities, Communities & Culture, Best of Nature, Best of Seaside, Earth Award (for environment & climate) and also the best of each geographic region of the world.

The award is presented by Green Destinations, a non-profit organization for sustainable tourism via a global partnership of expert organizations, companies and academic institutions with participation by destination representatives and stakeholders. Vail was named a finalist in the award competition in February after being named to the top 100 list during the Global Green Destinations Gala in Portugal last September.

Presentation ceremonies on Wednesday, March 7 are being attended on behalf of the community by Kim Langmaid, founder and vice president of Walking Mountains Science Center and a Vail Town Council member, along with Kristen Bertuglia, Town of Vail environmental sustainability manager, and Mia Vlaar, Town of Vail economic development director. They also attended a reception on Tuesday, March 6 hosted by Vail Resorts and their German sales team.

Vail and the other finalists were required to provide extensive information about their sustainability initiatives and their local and global impacts. The review process included an evaluation of 15 core criteria of the Green Destinations Standard, including cultural heritage conservation, solid waste reduction, accessibility and landscape and scenery.

“It is an honor to be recognized by the ITB, and a tremendous opportunity to help increase the visibility of sustainable destinations in the tourism industry,” said Vlaar.

This is third year for the Top 100 Sustainable Destinations competition and the first year for Green Destinations’ partnership with ITB Berlin.

Bertuglia says the award does much to recognize efforts at the grassroots level. “At the root of our economy and our identity as a community is the natural world, we have a responsibility to ensure that tourism is a force for good and Vail is a model sustainable mountain resort,” she said.

An emphasis on collaboration is also at the heart of the recognition, according to Langmaid. “It’s an honor to work with all of our partners in Vail to accomplish this prestigious award. Vail has a strong history of leadership in environmental sustainability and we’ll continue to raise the bar as we look to the future.”

The spirit of collaboration is also shared by Vail Mountain’s Environmental Manager Brian Rodine. “This designation is a testament to the collaboration of many throughout the Vail community on the journey towards sustainability. We are proud to be able to align our Epic Promise for a Zero Footprint goals with this very important effort.”

A total of 155 nominations were received from 57 countries during the competition. All nominations were evaluated by experts of the Green Destinations Top 100 Team and by members of the special Top 100 Selection Panel, which included over 60 tourism sustainability experts.

In addition to the Top 100 Sustainable Destination award, Vail is awaiting word from the Global Sustainable Tourism Council on its application to become the first certified Sustainable Destination in the U.S. Other initiatives include a goal to reduce local emissions by 20 percent by 2020 and collaborative actions at the national, state and local levels to address climate change.

50,https://www.greenbiz.com/article/can-new-principles-drive-money-sustainable-fishing,"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",GreenBiz,Can new principles drive money into sustainable fishing?,"With a growing list of adopters and endorsers, Environmental Defense Fund, Meloy Fund and Encourage Capital launched new guidelines for investing in global fisheries to drive needed capital into scaling sustainably managed fisheries and restoring our oceans to abundance.

Although billions of public and private dollars are invested in fisheries every year, more often than not, sustainability is neither the driver nor the intended outcome of those investment dollars. That means we are missing a major opportunity to solve the global overfishing and food security problem, which requires significantly more and better-aligned investment from a variety of capital providers.

The announcement was made last week at the World Ocean Summit 2018 in Riviera Maya, Mexico.

The Principles for Investment in Sustainable Fisheries are designed to do just that: to move new and sidelined capital into fishery investments, align that capital with responsible management and give investors confidence that building environmental and social sustainability into fisheries also will yield a return on their investments. The principles also train a spotlight on human rights for investors, especially when it comes to bringing new capital to small-scale fisheries and coastal communities. They already have been endorsed or adopted by more than 15 foundations, investment funds, project developers and non-profit organizations.

Our hope is that these principles will help drive investment and allow us to scale sustainable fisheries and restore our seas to health more quickly. ""The principles reinforce the notion that good management, science and monitoring and enforcement are not only critical to sustainable fishing — but to sustainable investments, too,"" said Amanda Leland, EDF senior vice president, oceans. ""Governance reform is the foundation of sustainable fisheries management and investment because it de-risks the system. Our hope is that these principles will help drive investment and allow us to scale sustainable fisheries and restore our seas to health more quickly. That would be welcome news for hundreds of millions of people around the world, especially the poorest and most vulnerable communities that rely on the oceans to meet their most basic everyday needs.”

Momentum is building for the guidelines. The three major fisheries impact funds — Meloy Fund, Encourage Capital and Althelia Ecosphere — have agreed to adopt the principles as founding adopters and apply them in investment decisions.

""Rare and the Meloy Fund decided to join forces with EDF and Encourage to co-author and become a founding adopter to these principles because we are committed to establishing a sustainable wild-caught fisheries investment sector that prioritizes the best outcomes for ocean resources and fishing communities. We need to help define a common ground for the impact investing field and we are already applying these principles routinely as part of our due diligence and supervision processes,"" said Manuel Bueno, fund director at Meloy Fund.

The principles apply globally to all debt and equity investment products deployed to finance a project or company, and where the project or company has or is expected to have an impact on wild-caught fisheries and their associated ecosystems and communities. Modeled after the Equator Principles, they complement existing guidelines and frameworks governing environmentally and socially responsible investment.

These principles take into account the market-based research and practical experiences of commercial investment organizations that are trying to lead the way. ""Encourage is proud to be a part of the development of these sustainable fisheries principles under the leadership of EDF. We believe these principles take into account the market-based research and practical experiences of commercial investment organizations that are trying to lead the way in demonstrating how deploying private capital into sustainable fishing and seafood companies is good for investors and good for the oceans,"" said Jason Scott, co-managing partner at Encourage Capital.

""Althelia is a founding adopter of these principles because we wholeheartedly believe that sustainable fisheries investing can bring about the best possible environmental and social outcomes: healthy oceans; nutritious food; good jobs,"" said Simon Dent, director of new ventures at Althelia Ecosphere. ""We look forward to applying these principles to support the Sustainable Ocean Fund’s investment activity and decisions.""

The principles are expected to be endorsed by non-investor institutions such as non-profit organizations, project developers, philanthropic foundations and other public and private stakeholders interested in promoting the sustainable management of fisheries through investment.

To boost bathroom recycling, beauty brand Garnier has teamed up with TerraCycle and DoSomething.org to launch the second year of Rinse, Recycle, Repeat, a national recycling campaign and college campus competition that aims to educate young people on how to responsibly recycle their beauty and personal care products. Through the campaign, Garnier hopes to divert 1 million empty personal care products from landfills by the end of 2018.

Sustainable Packaging?

Check out our

SB'18 Vancouver program!Beauty and personal care product packaging bearing a #1 or #2 symbol can be recycled through curbside recycling programs, but many other products cannot, including flexible tubes, caps, pumps, lipstick and eyeliner. These items will be the focus of this year’s Rinse, Recycle, Repeat campaign. The campaign will also showcase best practices to identify recyclable items, such as checking the numbers on packaging before tossing it out, and provide campaign participants with tips on what can and cannot be recycled.

“We’re excited to work with young people around the country to make a positive impact on the environment,” said Aria Finger, CEO at DoSomething.org. “We’re proud to be working with Garnier, a brand that continuously demonstrates its commitment to sustainable beauty, to once again activate young people to give these products new purpose and to help them reach their goal of collecting 1 million empties in 2018.”

To mark the start of the campaign, Garnier has released a public service announcement, starring actress and Garnier brand ambassador Mandy Moore, to educate young consumers about how to responsibly recycle their bathroom empties.

Once the bin is filled with 10 pounds of beauty empties, participants can print a free shipping label to send their empties to TerraCycle. Once collected, TerraCycle will recycle the packaging into pelletized lumber, which will then be used to build Garnier Green Gardens.

On April 1st, a competition will kick off on 50 college campuses nationwide to collect the most beauty empties. The college team that collects the most empties by April 30th will be rewarded a garden for their community furnished by Garnier and TerraCycle.

The Rinse, Recycle, Repeat campaign is part Garnier’s larger Beauty Recycling Program, a free, national beauty and personal care recycling program for the collection of empties that cannot otherwise be recycled. Since its inception in 2011, the Beauty Recycling Program has diverted more than 10 million empties from landfill.

These empties have been turned into pelletized plastic lumber for raised garden beds, benches, trash receptacles and other elements for community parks, playgrounds and gardens in Nebraska, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio and New York. Garnier and TerraCycle have already installed nine Garnier Green Gardens throughout the United States that engage hundreds of thousands of individuals in the surrounding communities, and will plant an additional two by the end of 2018. One garden will be granted to the winner of the Rinse, Recycle, Repeat challenge and the other to a local NGO in New York City, the location of the brand’s US headquarters. This garden will be planted by L’Oréal USA employees through the company’s annual Volunteer Day initiative.","Despite the rise of recyclable packaging for beauty and personal care products, only half of US consumers responsibly dispose of these products.

This has been challenged by outspoken Brisbane councillor Jonathan Sri, who said market-based solutions would fail to meet the needs of the growing city.

Mirvac head of residential Stuart Penklis said the Brisbane City Council’s efforts to increase density in the inner ring of the city would increase liveability, because it would create insulated communities that reduced the need for car travel and encouraged sustainable lifestyles.

“The mood in Brisbane is changing to one where people want to live in holistic environments that cater to their specific needs, in communities where potential congestion isn’t an issue and they can enjoy a strong sense of community,” he said.

Mr Penklis said the council had taken steps to reform the planning process to encourage smart development, and increasing the density of the inner five kilometre ring 50 per cent by 2031.

“It marks a substantial and important shift in the way we plan our cities,” he said. “Smart, responsive development will ensure Brisbane remains the healthy and connected city in 2050 that it is today – and aspires to be.”

This would be best achieved by allowing the cream to rise to the top of the market, Mr Penklis suggested.

But Cr Sri — who has repeatedly criticised the council’s approach to neighbourhood plans and densification, claiming it erodes the character of Brisbane and makes the inner city only livable to high-income earners — said the city’s infrastructure was not adequate to support increased inner city density.

“It’s naive and idealistic to pretend that the necessary transition towards a more sustainable city can be market-led by private developers, who in recent decades have consistently placed maximising profits ahead of sustainable design,” he said.

“It’s true that increasing density can facilitate more efficient public transport networks, but private developers actually need to contribute more towards the cost of infrastructure and services. Cramming people into concrete shoeboxes without sufficient public transport, green space and community facilities is not especially sustainable.”

While Mirvac clearly favoured the market-led approach to smart and sustainable development, Mr Penklis agreed there was opportunity to compel developers to stump up to help build and maintain infrastructure.

“I think as planning starts to evolve and become more sophisticated we see contributions to state infrastructure by developers as the way of the future because governments simply can’t afford to pay for all of the infrastructure, Mr Penklis said. “Where we have uplifts in zonings value capture mechanisms are certainly the way of the future.

“It’s not just public transport; it’s also social infrastructure, public schools and libraries.”","Brisbane is headed down the right track to become a well-planned and sustainable city, according to an executive from one of Australia’s leading developers.
This has been challenged by outspoken Brisbane councillor Jonathan Sri, who said market-based solutions would fail to meet the needs of the growing city.
Mirvac head of residential Stuart Penklis said the Brisbane City Council’s efforts to increase density in the inner ring of the city would increase liveability, because it would create insulated communities that reduced the need for car travel and encouraged sustainable lifestyles.
“It’s naive and idealistic to pretend that the necessary transition towards a more sustainable city can be market-led by private developers, who in recent decades have consistently placed maximising profits ahead of sustainable design,” he said.

Though offices certainly produce their share of waste and generate inefficiencies, home offices with their material duplications — think multiple printers and copiers or internet routers — have their own problems. What’s a responsible worker to do?

Businesses and workers need to come together to determine where they can cut back on waste and whether a return to the office is better than going remote. Here are three key factors to guide your decision.

Location, Location, Location

Your business’s location is one of the most important factors when determining whether remote work makes sense. Big cities, for example, are more likely to provide sharable transportation that can reduce commuters’ carbon footprint. If a handful of your employees are based in the suburbs, though, it may be better to allow them to work from home; idling in urban traffic can have serious environmental consequences. Research into full-time telecommuters suggests they save $4,000 a year in food, clothing and transit costs, and that’s a lot of gas, dry-cleaning chemicals and plastic cups.

If you want to offer all staff remote work options, consider encouraging urban team members to take advantage of co-working spaces. These membership-based communal offices can reduce home energy waste and provide centralized equipment like faxes and copy machines. They’re a good way for remote workers to maintain focus and motivation outside of the traditional office.

Inside the Home Office

While location depends on the business, individual workers can do a lot to make remote work more sustainable. Smart chargers and dimmer switches, for example, can reduce electrical use. Workers who have already equipped their homes with solar panels or passive heat are also better positioned to make the shift to remote work without sacrificing sustainability.

Remote workers should also focus on minimizing paper usage and buying refurbished or energy-efficient equipment whenever possible. Many office appliances now come with an Energy Star rating, indicating that they reduce greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, buying refurbished equipment may mean using a slightly older, less efficient device but eliminating electronics waste or additional materials mining.

A Smarter Office

As businesses invest more in their properties, including constructing LEED-certified offices, the comparative benefits of working onsite compared to working at home will become greater, but LEED-style construction isn’t the only structural factor at play. Modern eco-friendly buildings are making use of data from built-in IoT to reduce energy waste and make ambient adjustments. And as an added bonus, besides reducing waste, these changes can make the workplace more comfortable by adjusting the lighting throughout the day, monitoring temperature and even adjusting the humidity.

When it comes to the race to go green, the difference between working from home and working onsite isn’t set in stone. Instead, it all comes down to the little differences — how people travel to work, what equipment they use and what structural changes businesses make to reduce their impact. Workers are clamoring for the flexibility to work from home, but they’ll have to collaborate with owners and management to make that a sustainable option.

The award was presented at a ceremony keynoted by Los Angeles-based Pritzker Prize winner Thom Mayne at the 2018 ADI Awards Ceremony in Mexico City.

With an iconic curved roof, the new Wilshire Grand Tower stands 73 stories tall, and features 900 hotel rooms, 45,000 square feet of restaurant and upscale retail space, and 20 floors of leasable office space. The 70th-floor sky-lobby with an observation deck and pool has quickly become a destination for its sweeping views. The technologically sophisticated tower was designed by L.A. firm AC Martin, which is known for pushing the boundaries in sustainable design. Construction was completed by Turner Construction, one of the largest construction management companies in the United States.

The building took nearly five years to complete and created 11,000 jobs through the design and construction phases.

“Turner Construction is honored that this project is being recognized by such an esteemed association,” said Kevin Dow, Vice President and General Manager of Turner’s L.A. office. “This award is an important acknowledgement that modern and sustainable design are the future of construction world-wide.”

This is the fourth year of the ADI award, which is an outgrowth of the Los Angeles Business Council’s 2014 trade delegation to Mexico City with Mayor Eric Garcetti. The award honors a growing business alliance between the sister cities and shared priority to promote sustainable building practices.

“The LABC is proud of long-time member Turner Construction and the rest of this award-wining team for pulling off the feat of creating one of the tallest, most environmentally sustainable office towers in the world,” said LABC President Mary Leslie. “This award is an important recognition of the shared importance for L.A. and Mexico City to embrace design that enhances the well-being and health of our communities while minimizing the impact on the environment.”

A Mexican design project will receive a reciprocal award at LABC’s 48th annual Architecture Awards on June 1. LABC is also hosting its second annual Mexico and Los Angeles Economic Forum later this year. The event is a convening focused on promoting business relationships between companies in L.A. and Mexico, with an emphasis on bilateral investments, development, and sustainability projects.

06/03/2018, by Startups 06/03/2018, by Marissa Trew , in News

Four Asian social enterprises have qualified as part the top ten travel startups to participate in this year’s Booking Booster Programme, by Booking.com. They will join six others in Amsterdam this May to take part in a three-week long accelerator programme, designed specifically for startups working in sustainable tourism.

The four Asian startups are: Community Homestay Network (Nepal), Global Himalayan Expedition (India), Sakha Consulting Wings: Women on Wheels (India) and HiveSters (Thailand).

The programme is part of Booking.com’s activate effort to cultivate and strengthen the sustainable tourism sector. Alongside the Booking Booster Programme, it launched Booster Labs and the Booking Cares Fund last year.

The Booking Booster Programme includes a series of lectures, workshops and coaching. Its climax is a startup pitch wherein participants compete to win up to €500,000 out of Booking.com’s €2M fund, to help the next stage of the startups projected growth.

Each startup is selected based on how its business model is designed to tackle issues associated with tourism that are largely overlooked by many travellers, from female empowerment to support for local communities.

HiveSters for one, specialises in tours and activities throughout Thailand that are designed to not only generate income for Thai communities but to also preserve local heritage, tradition and practices. It also works directly with local communities and other social enterprises through its own “Hivesters incubation programme” that helps create and promote social activities.

The Community Homestay Network on the other hand, is a community-based homestay network that connects travellers with local hosts in Nepal. It aims to encourage interaction between indigenous communities and the rest of the world, through tourism, with support going to village schools and learning centres.

Global Himalayan Expedition is an expedition organiser to remote areas of the Himalayas, which supports the set up micro solar grids across villages within the territory. Providing villages with electricity granted residents with the tools to develop their own businesses like homestays, generating income for the local community.

Sakha Consulting Wings is a social enterprise that launched safe transport options for women by women in selected Indian cities, including full and on-call chauffeurs, as well as cab hire services. The startup recruits and trains women from lower income and marginalised areas as drivers. They are also taught self-defense by police, should they encounter any issue.

The founder of Sakha Consulting Wings commented that with the support of the programme, “we hope to reach out to hundreds of more women enabling them to break barriers and take on non‐traditional livelihoods that can potentially transform their lives.”

Collectively, this year’s selection spans six different countries and continents, including the USA, Netherlands, Switzerland, parts of Africa and even Antarctica.

Participating startups will also have access to several months of mentoring and coaching from Booking.com’s network of travel experts. It also offers startups the opportunity to collaborate with the company’s other innovation initiatives, designed to foster startup growth.

“Our aim is to build a network of like‐minded organisations and individuals that are leveraging technology to create a more sustainable future for destinations worldwide,” said Booking.com’s CEO, Gillian Tans.

DOHA: The National Human Rights Committee (NHRC), the Police College and Qatar University celebrated the Arab Day for Human Rights by holding several events and joint activities on this occasion.

Dr. Mohammed Saif Al Kuwari, a NHRC Member, spoke at two separate lectures at the Police College and Qatar University, about human rights and sustainable development and their definitions, as well as focusing on sustainable integrated economic growth, environmental stewardship and social responsibility, making it a process of developing land, cities and communities provided that they meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to achieve their goals.

He also touched on the relationship of sustainable development to human rights, which was highlighted by the United Nations Declaration on the Right to Development in 1986, linked to international human rights instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the two International Covenants and other relevant conventions and instruments of the international organization.

He referred to the most important development goals of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the State of Qatar is working on, namely poverty eradication, the provision of good health and well-being, gender equality, decent work and economic growth, noting that the implementation of the development goals underlines the need to provide a range of rights, such as the right to education, housing, dignity, well-being, health and labour, as well as the rights of workers and women, the right to gender equality and non-discrimination and other rights.

Dr. Asma Abdullah Al-Attiyah, Head of the Psychology Department at the Faculty of Education at Qatar University, said that human rights in the Arab world are issues that must be considered from all angles, whether social, cultural or political as dealing with this important issue can not be limited to one side alone, because human rights are the fruit of the right human societies in their basics and in their spiritual and intellectual building.

Dr. Al-Attiyah pointed out that the theme of this year’s Arab Human Rights Day is “Human Rights and Sustainable Development”.

“Therefore, it is not possible to talk about sustainable development and intergenerational communication unless the human being have the basic rights that enable them to contribute strongly to development, stressing that any sustainable development must depend on human, first and last, before the development of plans and strategies.”

The celebration of the Arab Human Rights Day falls on March 16 each year, the day the Arab Charter on Human Rights entered into force in 2008 after it was adopted in May 2004 at the Arab summit in Tunisia.

The theme of “Human Rights and Sustainable Development” was chosen for this year’s celebration, in terms of their close and direct relationship as they support each other.

Landscape architect Cynthia Knauf in her office

Cynthia Knauf wants to help her clients live outdoors. No, not in tents or teepees. Rather, as the sketches in her office illustrate, the Burlington-based landscape architect designs extensions of their homes — in front yards, driveway perimeters, back patios, and often-overlooked nooks and crannies.

""You have to be creative and see the potential in any given space,"" she says.

Knauf's clients typically are looking for privacy, places to unwind and entertain, or room for kids to play. Others want to create backyard habitats or grow vegetables organically. Depending on their budget, wish lists can be simple or complex; desired features might include fireplaces or grills, stone patios, pathways, or water features.

In any functional outdoor space, it's the details that count. This is especially true for city lots of limited size, according to Knauf. One case in point: her landscape design for a traditional urban home in Burlington that was part of last summer's Flynn Garden Tour.

That project — a complete redesign of outdoor areas on a lot that measures less than a quarter acre — followed an extensive renovation of an 1894 home by Maclay Architects of Waitsfield and Burlington-based Redmond Interior Design. Knauf's goal was to create a private and peaceful sanctuary out of the steep, overgrown property in a densely developed neighborhood.

""How much can you make of an urban lot?"" Knauf asks rhetorically, looking over the master plan. Quite a bit, apparently; her design won a 2016 industry award from Green Works, the Vermont Nursery & Landscape Association.

""It's rewarding when a small backyard design transforms an unusable and/or unsightly place into a sanctuary that ignites all of the senses,"" she says. ""I think that the change can be more dramatic with a small space versus a large one, because the scale of a small backyard is more similar to a room inside — so the yard truly feels like an extension of the indoors.""

Typical of hilly Burlington, slope issues and drainage were significant factors in the overall design. A two-track brick driveway, pervious joints in the stone floors and paths, and substantial drainage behind stone walls help mitigate stormwater runoff.

""The key to making this usable was to terrace on two levels,"" Knauf explains. ""Each of these is broken into different areas of unique character.""

Retaining walls and stairs built with Champlain fieldstone create a series of outdoor rooms. Stones from the home's original foundation — excavated during the renovation and likely quarried less than a mile away — were incorporated into the hardscape by Church Hill Landscapes.

Sketch for Hill Section landscaping

""The challenge of small spaces is that everything has to integrate well,"" says Nate Carr, owner of the Charlotte-based company. ""We worked around a large black-walnut tree when building the fence and elevated the foundation of the shed to protect the tree roots.""

Other mature trees — red cedar, pear and magnolia — were identified and protected throughout the construction process. Yews and boxwood were planted to help define spaces. Hydrangeas give the front-porch entry an old-fashioned look.

Carr also likes the sculptural stone that was added to a circular garden. That detail came about when his masons found a boulder with unique character during the construction process. Church Hill installed it as a stand-alone vertical accent.

Those who took the Flynn Garden Tour last July were likely impressed by the vegetable garden that runs along the west side of the property, as well as its lovely white-painted gate. With a stepping-stone path set in gravel and raised beds for good drainage, this area supports homegrown edibles such as salad greens and cherry tomatoes. Blueberry shrubs were planted nearby, and grapes now grow on the perimeter fence.

An outdoor breakfast nook near the rear of the lot offers early-morning shade and just enough room for a table and four chairs. Surrounded by drifts of feathery astilbe, ferns, bugbane and Japanese forest grass, the area is cool and calming. Soft Irish moss grows in between the fieldstone pavers.

Other notable details in this landscape include a garden shed with a pink door; Adirondack chairs in a back corner of the lawn; and drifts of flowers, such as white daisy, blue agastache, heliopsis, delphinium, purple monkshood, persicaria and shrub roses. Katherine Lee of Waterville-based Sisters of Nature designed the flower beds.

""Flow is important,"" Knauf observes. ""One of the big goals during the design process is to create good circulation and gentle transitions.""

She notes that Japanese landscape design principles can be employed on just about any property. ""The composition of balance, contrast, scale, pattern, texture and perspective, which overlap and intertwine, is key to creating movement and sense of enticement through the landscape,"" Knauf says. ""Also, it's important to keep the palette simple and subtle so that flow is almost Zen-like, gentle and unimpeded, as in nature.""

These days, residential landscaping is as concerned with sustainability as aesthetics and functionality. On a sketch she's made for a proposed backyard project, Knauf points out the raised garden bed near the kitchen, a bistro seating space and a lounge area surrounded by fragrant greenery. The design allows for al fresco dining — with freshly picked veggies — in the middle of the city.

""For me, a sustainable landscape is a gentle and comfortable coexistence of humans and nature,"" says Knauf. ""However, the American Society of Landscape Architects has a clear and comprehensive description for it: 'Sustainable landscapes are responsive to the environment, regenerative and can actively contribute to the development of healthy communities. Sustainable landscapes sequester carbon, clean the air and water, increase energy efficiency, restore habitats, and create value through significant economic, social and environmental benefits.'""

That may seem like a tall order in a single residential backyard. But in cities, those lots are part of a larger ecosystem, and it's critical to follow sustainable practices that help protect the surrounding environment.

Knauf recommends that homeowners make space for a compost pile, so that soil can be renewed and enriched every year from garden cuttings and biodegradable kitchen scraps. (Besides, Vermont's Act 148 requires recycling or composting food scraps and lawn or garden debris to be phased in through the year 2020.) For clients who maintain gardens, she advises going organic, with zero pesticides.

To Knauf, creating sustainable landscapes also means supporting biodiversity. Those blueberry shrubs or tomato plants her clients want to grow need pollinators; using plants that support bees is increasingly important. Bee-friendly favorites that work for sunny, small-scale lots include native false sunflower, gayfeather, purple coneflower and late-blooming dwarf aster.

Some landscaping tactics are as easy as they are rewarding. On her latest sketch, Knauf recommends planting a diversity of thyme around the pavers on a pathway. ""Thyme is a wonderful low ground cover that tolerates foot traffic, so it can be easily integrated into your patio, terrace or walkway paver system for added texture, color and even fragrance,"" she says.

Bonus: Thyme is a pollinator, entices butterflies and is an edible, healthful herb. Multipurpose and multisensory, the plant is but one of Knauf's sustainable solutions for the city she calls home.","One case in point: her landscape design for a traditional urban home in Burlington that was part of last summer's Flynn Garden Tour.

You want to make the grower earn money and monetize the product.""

Before he rushes off to a meeting, this remark from Massimo Bellotti of French plastic packaging company Groupe Guillin shows the conflict at play between the commercial interests of the fresh produce industry and a tide of anti-plastic sentiment sweeping across the globe.

In the words of Will Mercer of British company Coveris, technical advances in plastic packaging have extended shelf life and improved hygiene by warding off microbial threats while also substantially cutting food waste and the associated environmental footprint.

""But the big bit that we actually forgot was to bring the consumer along,"" Mercer said during a talk at Fruit Logistica in Berlin last month.

So where exactly have consumers been left behind on this journey? And how can the fresh produce and packaging industries get them back on board while also responding to shifting preferences towards more environmentally-friendly solutions?

The cold turkey approach to plastic adopted by a section of society and retail will undoubtedly help alleviate the gargantuan problem of plastic islands floating around the world's oceans, but a real solution needs to be systemic and involve the plastic companies themselves.

In this special feature, we take a look at the challenges of making 'green' packaging affordable and accessible, the competing environmental interests of plastic waste versus food waste, and the innovators harnessing new materials for the shopping aisle.

Compostable, biodegradable, recyclable

These three traits are exactly what Canadian company CKF has on offer through its EarthCycle packaging for the fruit and vegetable industry, but president Ian Anderson is making no apologies about the extra cost.

""It’s more expensive. It's the nature of the process and the materials and the energy - it's a thermoform article and you have to be willing to invest,"" he says of his packs which combine a blend of virgin and recycled wood fibers.

""What we’re offering here today is something for people who want an alternative to plastic. Plastic is a litter issue around the world. It gets into the oceans, it accumulates and it doesn’t go away.""

But EarthCycle's origins were not entirely environmentally sound. Before the brand was sold to CKF in 2013 it was based out of Malaysia, and while the end product was compostable and biodegradable, the raw material came from more questionable origins.

The palm fibers used were a byproduct of Malaysia's palm oil industry that has become synonymous with the destruction of large tracts of rainforest.

""When I sold the company one of the strategic imperatives for me was to get out of Malaysia,"" said EarthCycle founder Shannon Boase, now the director of new market development at CKF.

""There was an issue with our supply chain and an increasing issue with palm; it has become very controversial,"" she said, adding all manufacturing was now done in North America.

The wood fibers used come from a local pulp mill in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and new packaging products on offer cater to both sustainability and aesthetic trends at retail.

""This is thermaform fiber. You can see that it’s got a very smooth finish to it and that it’s got a very sharp edge. That is new and there are not that many companies internationally that are doing this,"" Boase said, showing Fresh Fruit Portal a new pack on offer during Fruit Logistica.

""Because it has a smooth finish and we could do a very uniform flange, it allows for it to be heat-sealed...it doesn’t take any adhesive,"" she said.

""This [the seal] is just a PET (Polyethylene terephthalate) film which melts and bonds with the fiber.""

So some packaging solutions are more sustainable than others?

""We do have a solution for that. There is a company that is offering a compostable film and it's commercial,"" Boase replied.

And what percentage of packs have the compostable film?

""We’re showing it for the first time now. However in North America many of our customers that are using this peel and re-seal, or topseal, they market it as 90% less plastic than a clamshell and that resonates with the consumer,"" she said.

""We’re the only molded fiber company that has this internationally – you can peel it back and then reseal it.

Boase clarified the adhesives used in the peel and reseal pack meant the film couldn't be recycled, however the regular easy peel film could be.

""Sadly the film goes into the garbage, but the pack can be thrown in your background compost if you do compost. I personally use it to collect business cards or hold pens and paper. It’s such a beautiful package,"" she said.

Anderson added that in fruits and vegetables the thermoform packs were mostly being used for organic produce, which Boase attributed to a ""consistency of message"".

""The organic consumer is shown to be more sustainable and they will pay the extra because they understand right now you’ve got to vote with your dollars,"" she said.

""We have a fabulous opportunity. We have been doing some shelf testing and in-store trials with mushrooms in the U.K. We are so happy with the retailer [Tesco] behind that.

""For them to take that stand and invest in this, it's a fundamental change in the packing of mushrooms. The packaging of mushrooms hasn’t changed in 30-40 years – it’s always been in a PE (Polyethylene) plastic container, but our partner G’s has shown that using a molded pulp punnet with a topseal extends the shelf life from one to three days.""

She said the package was made so that it gave mushrooms the right balance of moisture.

""Tesco saw this right away – not only is this a sustainability message, it’s a food waste issue. They can get more out of their produce,"" she said.

Boase added the EarthCycle compostable packaging had U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, European BFR food grade certification and European certifications for compostability.

But with the higher cost involved, how likely is it that thermoform packs will take off?

""You have to realize plastic has been around since the 50s. Plastic has been around for so long and the economies of scale of plastic are significant. This [thermoform] is a new material,"" she said.

A plastic packaging industry perspective

With a market capitalization of €680 million, Groupe Guillin certainly has the economies of scale to deliver plastic packaging solutions, not just in the EU but also to produce operations abroad that export to the European market.

The berry market in particular is booming, and while the European Commission puts forth its strategy for reducing plastics and establishing a circular economy for the material, the team at Guillin are skeptical based on past experience.

""First of all we are open to any innovation coming in this direction so we are ready to develop and switch our production to some real environmentally-friendly product,"" said Massimo Belotti, international sales manager at the company's produce division.

""Second, PLA (polylactide, a plant-based plastic) is not biodegradable – first you have to split it in the garbage which nobody is doing so it’s not really serious, and third you have to biodegrade this only in special conditions which are almost done by nobody today. No country is really recuperating the PLA,""

The produce division's export manager Mateo Diaz said the group tried switching all its systems from PET to PLA 10 years ago.

""We failed totally in supplying the market because of the shelf life of the product, the incapacity of the product to travel into containers because of the temperature inside of the containers, and the market wasn’t ready to pay the premium for the PLA,"" Diaz said.

The executive team was then forced to ask the pressing question: What is the real environmental footprint of using plant-based plastic?

""We saw that it was so little compared to all the solutions,"" Diaz said.

""Now our group has decided to stop PLA and we have gone to rPET which is recycled PET. Our punnets are composed of up to 80% recycled PET and 20% virgin PET,"" he said.

""We could go 100% recycled PET but then we’d have to compromise the transparency of the product.""

Bellotti said the most pragmatic way the company could be sustainable was to ""not use new petrol"", harnessing as much material as possible that has already been produced.

Diaz said half of the recycled PET was post-industrial while the other half was post-consumer, such as recycled water bottles.

""The bottles of water are already coming back and being recycled. Also with this and the new systems like the topseal, we reduce the weight of the punnet and reduce the amount of plastic used,"" Bellotti clarified.

""The consumer needs to be educated to not throw something that can be recycled in the garden or in the ocean or on the ground.""

Diaz said the private and public sectors needed to work together to find solutions to the problem.

""On this Groupe Guillin participates in a company in France called Valorplast, which is a company in charge of collecting the plastic waste in all the cities - this links both of them with a solution because politics alone cannot do the job if you don’t have an incentive for the industry to use this plastic,"" he said.

Sustainable packaging in practice - a matter of execution and willpower

As part of Bellotti's pragmatic approach to finding practical, sustainable solutions for reducing plastic waste, there was one important sticking point.

""Don't say ‘we use biodegradable plastic’ because it doesn’t exist. It's only compostable and that's different,"" he said.

Shaun Hersman of Netherlands-based packaging company Modiform disagreed with Bellotti's claim, although the difficulties of recycling plastic have led his company to move into pulp material with a similar product to that offered by CKF.

""Everything is biodegradable with time. I think it depends on how thin it is,"" he said, pointing to a heat-sealed plastic film on a perforated pulp pack - a technology he claimed took two years to develop and will be ideal for soft fruit and mushrooms.

""If this PLA was like a punnet it would take maybe five years to biodegrade but because what you see here is microns thick, it will take a few months to degrade.

""You put it in your green waste bin and it gets industrially treated. It’s heated at about 60°C and then it disappears much quicker.""

But how effective are the recycling systems already in place? The team at Groupe Guillin sees that they needs improvement and this is the view as well for many fresh produce marketers, themselves also keenly watching developments in the sector and trying to find solutions that are economically viable.

""We produce packaging that is made from renewable materials that come from corn starch or sugarcane, but the thing is some of the communities are not prepared for that yet,"" said Christiane Bell, global produce general manager at German group BayWa, which also owns New Zealand-based T&G Global.

""When the customer throws it away in the biodegradables, when it is being picked up the people from the mill leave the container there thinking it’s plastic,"" she said.

""It’s a matter of training. You need to secure the entire chain.""

Thies Claussen of Germany-headquartered importer Global Fruit Point said his company was offering industry stakeholders the option of incorporating biodegradable packaging material into their programs.

""This is a way out of this dilemma but we are also taking into account that biodegradable things are more expensive,"" he said.

""Honestly I believe the power of the decision finally lies on the consumer side – the individual consumer is going to decide whether he is going to go the extra mile and pay that extra cent, creating that extra demand so that the supply can take place.

""We don’t want to 'die in beauty', you could say. We put the options on the table and our clients are going to decide whether they go on with the old way or the new way.""

Claussen said biodegradable packaging tended to cost about 30% more than the standard plastic alternative, but the actual effect of that on the consumer price was minimal.

""Let’s be careful with percentages. For the end consumer sales price in the shop, I wouldn’t say it’s nothing but it’s 1-5%,"" he said.

Ireland-based Total Produce is one of the world's leading fruit and vegetable traders, and the multinational will be the largest if its proposed acquisition of Dole Food Company goes ahead. CEO Rory Byrne told Fresh Fruit Portal he saw a greater awareness of environmental interaction from all produce sector participants.

""We have to work with the industry, consumers and customers to find a sensible balanced evolutionary process to get an answer that’s economically and environmentally sensible,"" Byrne said.

Will this mean a greater focus on recycling or biodegradability?

""I think it can be a combination. Historically I suppose cost has just been such a big factor in these things – recyclable plastic and trying to find the right cycle to return them, reuse them and the transport costs associated with that,"" he said.

""We’ve got to find the balance between having appropriate recognition of any environmental damage that some of those products do, and finding a suitable solution which can be a combination of biodegradables, recyclable plastics or a range of other options; even new solutions that are yet to be invented.""

Graham Young of U.K.-based avocado importer Greencell, a subsidiary of Westfalia Fruit International, expects a two-step solution will be found to the plastic waste dilemma.

""The first will be biodegradable packaging which is getting better with the print quality, the clarity, the opaqueness – it’s all achieving what consumers want,"" he said.

""But biodegradable packaging is quite often still synthetic and it’s not natural. Although it degrades it doesn’t degrade in the optimal manner.

""The second and final stage will be bio-packaging which is where you move away from synthetics that involve biodegradable packaging and you concentrate on the production of natural starches that will fully degrade quickly.

""It’s one of the big pressures of our time and we’re all involved. We don’t want to leave the world like we’ve seen on TV. For our kids and for our future, the development of these technologies is absolutely essential.""

Food waste versus plastic waste

The repulsion many consumers feel towards fruit or vegetables wrapped in plastic is understandable, particularly when the produce items - bananas or avocados for example - come in their own natural casings anyway.

But it would behove those same people to then ask themselves the following questions:

How much fruit & veg do I throw out each month?

How often do I reject fruit with blemishes or that's very ripe in favor of a better-looking product? For the majority of consumers the answer is probably most of the time.

If my local supermarket or a produce item they stock were caught up in a food safety scare, would I shop there or buy that product again?

Would I feel better about produce wrapped in plastic if I could easily take that plastic waste back to the supermarket or an appropriate facility for recycling?

According to Coveris R&D director Will Mercer, in the U.K. alone the level of food waste accounts for 10 billion metric tons (MT). Before we point the finger at plastics, it is worth considering the water and carbon footprints associated with producing that much food.

""That's a value of over £17 billion a year and is associated with around 20 million MT of greenhouse gas, and as much as 47% of household food waste is produce,"" Mercer said during the Fruit Logistica talk ""Plastics Packaging: Maximising benefit whilst minimising impact"".

""What we need to do is extend shelf life, maximize that resource and have the minimal impact on the environment.

""It’s [packaging] not just there to take it to the shelf. It’s actually there to keep it clean, to keep it in good form through the distribution chain so that when you get it, it isn’t contaminated.""

He said Coveris' motto for packaging solutions was ""reduce, sustain, recycle"". In terms of 'reduce', he highlighted how the use of films had reduced the amount of plastic used, and for the 'recycle' element he said the company had put a major focus on using mono-materials and mono-composite materials over the last two years.

""So instead of having too many different formats, it’s looking to bring down to one or two different types of polymer so we can make that recycle side often easier,"" he said.

""Also we can control the portion sizes as well so people have the right amount of fruit and they’re not taking some and saying I only needed half of that for lunch today.

""If you are going to use packaging, use it for a positive reason.""

And it is on the 'sustain' side that Coveris' expertise comes to the fore, especially with its 'Freshlife' modified moisture packaging. Using what it calls 'MAP' technology, the group's packaging is able to balance the respiration rate of fruits and veggies with the permeability of the film.

Eric Duncan, head of Coveris' U.K. food science division, cited numerous examples where this type of packaging and others can play their part in reducing food waste.

""Packaging can have a major impact on maintaining that quality in preventing undesirable changes in the potato such as greening, sprouting, conversion of starches to sugars, darkening problems,"" he said.

""To me it’s a staggering statistic that nearly half of the potatoes purchased in U.K. households end up being thrown away.

""Using a gram or two of packaging on a cucumber can actually extend the shelf life up to 14 days, and sure, the food waste is kept to a minimum and the product is actually used rather than being thrown away.""

Duncan added the company was also working on improved packaging solutions for asparagus and pears.

""We’ve been looking at actually taking asparagus from unwrapped bundles to our MAP - our scanning laser technology...in doing so we’re removing some attacks the product goes through in the environment – things that attack the quality of the product, where we had a rapid dehydration of the product and microbial contamination,"" he said.

""Pears undergo a lot of changes. It’s an ethylene-sensitive product...if you have ready-to-eat pears, the pears continue to darken, they soften, they continue to lose quality, and also it’s hard to get a uniform ripeness so people might throw them away.

""By looking at some technologies to manage the headspace gas atmosphere or to manage the ripening rates or the ethylene or the effects of the ethylene produced by the pears, actually that packaging is very functional in making sure the pears get from the grower to the consumer and they’re consumed in somebody’s lunch or salad or dessert, rather than just going to the bin and going to landfill in the end.""

From time to time supermarkets have been mocked on social media when they've used the 'reducing food waste' argument to explain the use of plastic wrapping for fruits and vegetables.

This is likely because consumers intuitively realize that while high-tech plastics may extend shelf life, it doesn't change the fact the goods inside them are still perishable and there will be waste all the same. Real food waste impacts will come down to inventory management, how well supermarkets can predict stock rotation and the extent of food waste disincentives.

As Duncan said, the amount of potatoes that go to waste in the U.K. each year is staggering, and it's the same for a wide range of fruits and vegetables in different markets. Only once we see those numbers come down will we be able to definitively attribute part of the success to the use of modified atmosphere packaging. Here's hoping that will eventually be the case.

And if this outcome could be combined with an appropriate recycling system, that would be even better.

Other initiatives that target food waste include restaurant concepts like InStock in the Netherlands which harness food surplus to bring added value, as well as the well-known 'ugly fruit' movement that also uses terms like 'wonky' or 'imperfect.

Could grass paper solutions be the next frontier?

Some of the most notable sustainable packaging solutions on show in Berlin last month involved the use of thermoform made of pulp, but what happens in a world where pulp is hard to come by?

This is the dilemma Scheufelen GmbH of southern Germany has sought to address through its grass fiber packaging 'grass paper - greenliner', which earned it the bronze by popular vote in this year's Fruit Logistica Innovation Award (FLIA).

""We see that pulp is becoming much shorter in the future and pulp prices are going up more and more, because packaging and tissue paper are consuming a lot of pulp with growing rates"" said Scheufelen's director of sales Horst Lamparter.

""So we see that just using fiber material as pulp will not be enough in the future, and therefore a company which we are working together with - Creapapier - did some research to find alternative fibers to pulp.

""They did some tests with grass material that can be used for paper making.""

Lamparter clarified that this was not your standard green grass but rather sun-dried grass that was not cut so frequently.

""At Scheufelen, since we have very high know-how for coating and printability we could make it printable, and this was a big step ahead of course,"" he said.

""We are looking not for the green fresh grass that you give normally to the cows. We are looking for grass that’s growing for a longer time, that you’d cut normally two or three times a year. That grass material also contains some small wooden fibers.

""Normally they just cut this material and let it stay on the ground, or they feed it to the horses. They like this kind of grass, but there are not enough horses for all this grass.""

He added that the longer you let this type of grass grow, the more you contribute to biodiversity as well.

But it is a different environmental factor when compared to using pulp that really makes Schuefelen's grass paper products stand out.

""When you produce pulp you need wood from the forest of course, and the wood contains lignin. To get this lignin out of the wood of the trees you need a lot of water and a lot of chemicals,"" Lamparter said.

""There is a chemical treatment and then at the end you get a white pulp, and with this pulp you make paper.

""To produce one ton of pulp, like in the modern pulp mills you find in Scandinavia and Brazil, they need around 30,000 liters of water. Of course a big part of that water stays in the process but still they would lose 6,000 liters of water even if they recycle it.""

In comparison, Lamparter claimed making grass paper only required one or two liters to keep the production flow.

""I can compare one ton of grass material to one ton of pulp and we save around 6,000 liters of water,"" he said.

""Our interest is not only that this grass paper is produced at Scheufelen. We would be very happy if other paper mills also jump on this idea and use it in the future so that it becomes a trend with greater demand in the market.""

In terms of the produce industry specifically, Lamparter said so far the packaging solution had only been used for 'drier' items like potatoes, apples and tomatoes.

""For example Rewe or Penny, the retailers in Germany, they are interested for the apples. They put four or six apples in a tray and put foil around it, and use this grass material.

""We are talking to people like SanLucar to have 2x2 or 4x2 packs of apples.""

As much as Lampartar champions the use of this new material, he said it would be difficult to displace plastic use at this stage.

""I think for some packages it can be alternative but of course you need to see what usage you need for plastic packaging.

""If you need protection against moisture it might be a bit more difficult because of course plastic gives you better protection than paper or board, but more and more people try to avoid plastic.

""There is a big discussion going on in Germany and other countries to avoid plastic, to go into the field of paper and board. We have to see the future and what further applications we can get with this material.""

Credit: © 2018 Zanoletti, Vassura, Venturini, Monai, Montini, Federici, Zacco, Treccani and Bontempi. Front. Chem. | doi: 10.3389/fchem.2018.00060

A new class of low-cost and sustainable hybrid materials could possibly displace activated carbon as the preferred choice for reducing wastewater and air pollution. The material, described in Frontiers in Chemistry, is synthesized inexpensively from solid wastes and a naturally abundant polymer—and can cut down pollutants in air and wastewater with more success than activated carbon, the current gold standard adsorbent.

""This paper shows the simple synthesis of a new porous hybrid material, obtained by using low cost and by-product materials,"" says the lead author, Dr. Elza Bontempi from the University of Brescia, Italy. ""The material was designed on the basis of The European Commission's request to develop an affordable, sustainable and innovative design-driven material solution that can reduce the concentration of particulate matter in urban areas.""

Particulate matter—solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air and emitted from power plants, industry, automobiles and fires—is ubiquitous in cities and even the countryside. Moreover, millions of tons of industrial effluents are released into the world's waters every year. Both particulate matter and organic dyes are highly toxic to ecosystems and to humanity.

Activated carbon is the most common adsorbent used to reduce both atmospheric and wastewater pollution—but is expensive to produce and regenerate. The challenge has been to find an economical alternative.

In the new study, researchers combined a naturally abundant raw material, sodium alginate (a polysaccharide that can be extracted from seaweed and algae) with a high-volume industrial by-product, silica fume (a by-product of ferrosilicon or silicon metal alloy processing) to produce a ""green"" adsorbent that is better than activated carbon.

""The article reports preliminary results about the new material's capability to capture particulate matter,"" says Dr. Bontempi. ""It can also be used for wastewater remediation. In particular, its ability to replace activated carbon is demonstrated.""

The synthesis method is simple and easy to scale up. Taking advantage of the gelling properties of alginate, the researchers combined it with the decomposition of food-grade sodium-bicarbonate (baking soda) to consolidate the material. Testing of wastewater pollution was performed using methylene blue dye as a model pollutant. The hybrid material adsorbed and removed the dye, even at high concentrations, with 94% efficiency.

Analyses revealed that, compared with activated carbon, production of the hybrid material consumed less energy (""embodied energy"") while leaving a much lower carbon footprint. The material also demonstrated encouraging capabilities for trapping diesel exhaust fume particulate matter.

The material can be applied as a coating, used for spraying or brushing, and used for 3D-printing. This means it could be used to cover external building surfaces to remove particular matter, as well as to design water filtration units.

This versatility is an exciting new addition to humanity's toolkit for reducing air and water pollution.

At its core is an approach to development that looks to balance different, and often competing, needs against an awareness of the environmental, social and economic limitations we face as a society.

Sustainable development, simply means, development that meets the needs of the present, without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Living within our environmental limits is one of the central principles of sustainable development. One implication of not doing so is climate change.

In The Gambia, a country reeling from the damages caused by irresponsible leadership resulting in major damages to the body politic’, toxic environment pollution and crisis within banking, a bottom-up approach to development is the surest way to remedial solutions.

Let it be known the focus of sustainable development is far broader than just the environment. It’s also about ensuring a strong, healthy and just society. This means meeting the diverse needs of all people in existing and future communities, promoting personal wellbeing, social cohesion and inclusion, and creating equal opportunity. That calls for courage and vison, and the reason why one calls on parliament to scrutinise and debate the National Development Plan (NDP) identify gaps, where so.

A sustainable development approach can bring many benefits for The Gambia, saving the tax payer millions each year. It is a case of implementing smart policies and finding better ways of doing things, both for the future and the present. I call on the authorities to regulate tree cutting causing damage to the rain forest. The Gambia, alone, cannot satisfy the world with its demand for logs. The forest must be allowed to grow green and breathe.

Sustainable development approach makes for better decisions on the issues that affect all of our lives. We should all realise the way we approach development affects everyone. The impacts of government decisions and that of our own individually have very real consequences. Take the most populous city, Serekunda, for example, poor city planning and lack of investment in local communities has led to a reduction in the quality of life for residents

By designing smart cities with desirable leisure parks, high streets, brand new roads + pavement, LED solar street lights, with free wifi internet access for schools and colleges, whilst incorporating primary health plans for local communities, we can enhance the quality of life of all Gambians.

Today, poor town and city planning continues to add significant stress to land allocation for residential, commercial and farming purposes. The country needs to redesign and rebuild it cities, Serekunda, Brikama, Gunjur, Basse, especially Banjul. A potential for desirable sprawling cities to house the population on a par with Kigali, Dakar, Nairobi or ‘Dar es Salaam’ – and to designate the countryside an agricultural zone.

Government has to prioritise agriculture, foremost, and to ensure a sustainable food supply chain ensuring The Gambia produces enough rice and vegetables all year round. Please, let Gambia be that farmland to supply and feed Africa and Europe with its fruits and sunny delights.

To be fair, every Gambian has a part to play in sustainable development, it requires each one of us. Small actions, taken collectively, can add up to real change. However, government role to achieve sustainability in The Gambia. If one may appeal to the administration to look through the UN Sustainable development Goals, and to its own development blueprint, and deliver big on promises.

A few – To do-list

The weekly press briefs from the presidency was received to widespread acclaim; so was the announcement to Cabinet meetings.

But, please, what is happening within agriculture? Why the great silence? Will someone explain what good, if any, is in motion towards mechanised agriculture, land reforms, rice cultivation, peanut farming, horticulture and such irrigation best practices? Tell us more!

On the issue of ‘National Security’, not impressed, by CDS, asking for more money on camera. On what? Weapons? The Gambia should return to the basics – reorganise, restructure & retrain its military, which must not exceed two-thousand personnel. Let police reform be the focus strategize a new path to reclaim & restore Gambia’s streets to safety. It requires stricter gun laws. And who is the interior minister? With the country’s fishery products subject to daily theft costing injury in lost tax revenue, the navy must upend and mobilise defend Gambian waters. But they need training first, and smart weaponized boats to be effective; collaborating with regional maritime posts. Can the army come off barracks, start working on bridges, road construction, help clear parks and forests and some other damn fine jobs that secure and strengthen the nation in various sustainable turns sic.

The new constitution under draft – ready yet? Will it be put through a referendum on the day as nationwide local government elections? Helps save time and money to the tax payer. Let parliament stay up all night debate points if needs be. Work THRU a weekend too where needed to meet this time frame. Since everyone in government is talking about national interest, show your sincerity!

President Barrow & his Cabinet should look to replace the ‘Dalasi’ bank notes for quality polymer technology that cannot be counterfeit. The Gambian currency needs to reclaim its value & status.

On a lighter note – Parliament should install a gym; so is the presidency. Simply because despite politicking, we care for our leaders wishing them to succeed & live long. A little run & sweat helps for a healthy living. Hence, true democracy come in the form of a ‘Social Contract’, we, the tax paying public, are happy to fork out that maintenance, as long as the actions of politicians reflect that of the ‘National Interest’.

Their goal: To deploy a 3D-printer capable of manufacturing an 800-square-foot house in under 24 hours for less than $5,000.

It’s an ambitious project but one that has a headstart; Icon also brought to SXSW a fully functional 3D-printed model that demonstrates how the company can in produce a low-cost, livable home designed to function with zero waste and work under constraints such as limited water, power, or labor. For its efforts, Icon won this year’s SXSW Accelerator “Pitch Event,” receiving $4,000 and vital exposure to potential investors and constituents in the housing market.

New Story is an ideal test platform for the new 3D-printing technology as it’s a non-profit that already has deep roots in communities in Mexico, Haiti, El Salvador, and Bolivia. In three years, the nonprofit has funded more than 1,300 homes for families in need at a cost of about $6,500. New Story, supported by Y Combinator and other backers, works on a model that guarantees all funds collected goes to build homes.

Following the conference, Icon intends to use the model as an office in its own backyard so it can experience what it’s like to spend long amounts of time in the space and tweak the design accordingly. Each house can be assembled by just two to four workers. New Story also insists on manufacturers using a concept known as “participatory design,” meaning that their “customers” have an active role in sharing their needs before a build, so everyone involved can solve real problems. New Story also uses a streamlined, non-invasive approach to evaluating each project so that each new community they raise is better than the last one.

Using advanced robotics, cutting-edge materials and a proprietary software, Icon enables families to have options for different designs based on factors like terrain, climate, and family size. The actual “printer,” demonstrated at SXSW, is called the Vulcan and is built out of lightweight aluminum with a built-in backup generator.

Another challenge was developing a proprietary building mix using concrete that could be managed by the Vulcan but also suit New Story’s requirements, which include no exotic materials that might have to be imported. The mortar, which must be sourced from local materials, had to be thin enough to flow through the 3D printer but thick enough to support the building structure. The mix has to cure relatively quickly but if it cured too fast, the walls won’t fuse together properly. Heavy rain and challenges in cleaning slowed the company during its research and development phase.

Icon’s future goals are equally lofty. The manufacturer would like to develop robots capable of installing different assets like doors or windows, as well as drones that could spray-paint the exterior walls. It is also testing the Vulcan and other equipment to investigate the potential to print roofs as well. Eventually, Icon would also like to construct homes to alleviate the housing crisis in the United States.

The report notes a limited participation of local and regional governments and their partners in the global SDG thematic reviews at the UN High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), which could be attributed to a lack of awareness of the relevance of the HLPF and/or to a lack of resources to engage.

The report titled, ‘Local and Regional Governments in the Follow-up and Review of Global Sustainability Agendas,’ is published by Cities Alliance and adelphi, and co-authored by the African Centre for Cities (ACC), the German Development Institute, and the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. It was launched on 12 February 2018, during the ninth session of the World Urban Forum (WUF 9) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

The report notes that while the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement and the New Urban Agenda acknowledge the central role of national governments in follow-up and review, sustainable urban development is not yet the global priority that it should be. It also indicates that involvement of local and regional governments in UN processes related to sustainable development is made through the same modalities as those aimed at NGOs. However, it adds, unlike other major groups or constituencies, local and regional governments do not usually represent the interests of a particular group or electoral constituency, but advocate for the interests of all citizens in their jurisdiction.

On data and accountability, the report notes that existing initiatives to increase urban data availability and quality are highly fragmented and geographically uneven, which leads to a lack of consistent data “on how (and how much)” the local level is contributing to meeting national and international targets. It adds that multiple reports and other inputs feed into the follow-up and review of each agenda, which “raises questions regarding the best strategies for streamlining, compiling, structuring and including local and urban perspectives and data.” The authors recommend to support and scale up efforts to harmonize the indicators and methodologies used to collect data on the activities of local and regional governments and their partners. They also highlight the need to embed data collection efforts and reports in processes of collective evaluation and opportunities for peer learning, using fora such as regional follow-up and review processes supported by the UN regional commissions.

On implementation capacities, the report calls on national governments to understand how national legal, institutional and financial frameworks influence action by local and regional governments. It recommends institutionalizing engagement of local and regional governments and relevant local actors as key players in national processes to revise national sustainability strategies, urban policies and climate change policies.

On partnerships, the report points to the importance of multi-stakeholder partnerships to foster inclusiveness, mobilize and share knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources. It proposes launching an urban data partnership under the umbrella of existing initiatives, such as the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD), to identify data gaps at the local and regional levels and ways to address them. It also recommends evaluation of activities of partnerships and other initiatives that self-register in existing global registries and platforms.

On strengthening synergies in follow-up and review across the three agendas, the report proposes to: address synergies across all three agendas in the quadrennial New Urban Agenda implementation report; emphasize local synergies and interlinkages across the SDGs and the other global agendas during the HLPF thematic reviews, including identifying specific ways in which the agendas reinforce or undermine each other; and encourage national governments to explicitly address urban sustainability issues and synergies between the three agendas in all relevant national reports and inputs for global follow-up and review processes.

Across the world, developed and developing countries alike are advancing their commitments toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. From health, education, and women’s empowerment to no poverty, life on land, life below water, and sustainable consumption, the ambitious agenda of the SDGs is creating opportunities for all countries and all people.

But there is one action within the SDG framework that has been underestimated: That action is trade.

Trade keeps goods, services, and capital flowing. Whether it be ending hunger and poverty, providing decent work and economic growth, industry, innovation and infrastructure, and sustainable cities and communities, trade is a common thread woven throughout the goals’ targets — not just in SDG 17 where it is mentioned briefly. That’s because trade can be counted on to do a number of things:

1. Encourage cooperation.

By its very nature, successful trade requires its participants to reach across sectors, regions, and boundaries, and to engage in the kind of collaborative, multistakeholder partnerships that are encouraged under SDG 17.

2. Circulate knowledge.

Trade does more than move goods. It also serves as a conduit through which we can distribute, share, and exchange knowledge, ideas, innovations, and technologies that have the power to transform lives in underdeveloped regions. It can then be mobilized by partnerships generated through trade and that knowledge acquisition has the potential to fuel progress across a broad range of SDGs.

3. Provide access to new opportunities.

Trade furnishes people across the world with critical connections to markets, better technologies, financing, and investment — and provides them with the tools to increase incomes, improve quality of life, boost purchasing power, and gain the food security and zero hunger sought under SDG 2, which looks to end hunger in all its forms by 2030 and to achieve food security.

4. Generate shared benefits.

Trade benefits are bidirectional because sellers and buyers have a mutual incentive to exchange goods and services. Both parties acquire access to markets that otherwise would not be available. People in developing regions, for example, can generate new income for purchase of consumer goods. Those in developed nations may benefit from greater selection and availability of goods for consumers — and the opportunity to sell into growing markets. When channels are open, both parties come out ahead.

As such, trade — whether local, regional, or international — plays an indispensable role in improving livelihoods in every part of the world and should be among the factors considered when designing sustainable development solutions.

Trade as an enabler for SDG success

Through my role as a board member for Cultivating New Frontiers in Agriculture — a nonprofit that creates and implements agricultural development programs — I have witnessed the ways in which private sector initiatives — underpinned by trade — can help smallholder farmers gain access to markets, investment, opportunities, and to food security and improved livelihoods.

CNFA has developed a model for private sector farm service centers, which provide farm resources and services to underdeveloped rural communities where smallholder farmers lack the technology, resources, and expertise to increase production, reach markets, and assure economic and food security.

“Trade — whether local, regional, or international — plays an indispensable role in improving livelihoods in every part of the world and should be among the factors considered when designing sustainable development solutions.” — Devry Boughner Vorwerk, corporate vice president of corporate affairs, Cargill

In addition to providing fertilizers, seeds, and veterinary services, these small and medium-sized businesses also offer farmers access to training and information, financing, credit, and assistance in marketing their output.

Another example is the Mexican Foundation for Rural Development, which partnered with Cargill to support Yucatan’s smallholder farmers with training in agronomic best practices and technology use. Agronomists, educators, and field managers worked with farmers over a five-year period and visited farm communities at 15-day intervals to provide real time advice. The initiative produced dramatic increases in yields and income, and farmers used their new business skills to organize, increase access to local and regional markets, negotiate better prices for their crops, and reduce costs. The farmers are now self-sufficient and have modest reserves for health care, education, and other necessities.

As these examples illustrate, the benefits of sustainable development solutions supported by trade have the potential to lift people — especially those in agricultural societies — out of poverty, hunger, and mere subsistence. The examples also embody why solutions supported by trade are at the core of a company like Cargill.

While the company operates in 70 countries, and supplies food and agricultural, financial, and industrial products to customers across the globe, Cargill at the most basic level is in the business of ensuring that people around the world have access to a dependable, affordable, and nutritious supply of food.

Together, the development community needs to leverage the connections created by trade to help us achieve our targets across all of the SDGs. Trade builds peaceful and constructive relations among governments and people. When we understand and advocate for the role of trade in our sustainable development efforts, we enhance our ability to spread prosperity and peace to communities around the world.

In 2016, the average UN staff member produced 554 kilograms of waste.

The campaign promotes the “three Rs” approach to waste management: reduce, reuse, recycle. It suggests behaviors that UN staff can adopt to affect the amount of waste produced and support the SDGs. The website provides logos and posters that can be adapted for each location, as well as fact sheets and a guidance manual for staff with responsibility for facilities and environmental management.

In another initiative involving UN staff, the UN Food Gardens (UNFG) have been established at UN Headquarters in New York, US, upon a voluntary staff initiative. The Gardens promote environmental responsibility, food security, small-scale urban agriculture and community building, while also showcasing how to grow food in an urban landscape.

UNFG is engaged in various partnerships and initiatives to achieve these aims. It exchanges its produce for coffee grounds from the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Cafeteria, to use as compost, and in the last half of 2017 the efforts brought composting capacities to 400 kg. With UN-Habitat, UNFG hosted ‘Feed Your City,’ which showcased small-scale urban agriculture initiatives in the Americas. The project aims to motivate policy actions related to SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being, SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 15 (life on land), as well as to the New Urban Agenda (NUA).

Recycle and compost more. Eat locally (and go vegetarian or vegan). If we’re lucky, we might even hear about some of the work our state and local governments are doing to help the environment: We’re switching to carbon-free electricity. We’re building high-speed rail. We’re driving the transition to electric vehicles. But very rarely do we hear the No. 1 thing that all of these efforts hinge upon, the action that will make or break the planet: building more housing.

Specifically, building more housing in walkable communities, close to jobs and schools and transit and amenities — in other words, cities.

Why is building housing in cities so important? Consider everything we’re advocating for and working toward in order to be more sustainable: biking to work, recycling and composting, taking transit, buying an electric vehicle, using clean power. Every single one of those actions depends upon being in a location where those things are possible.

Right now, a sizable majority of Americans are denied access to these sustainable practices because of a shortage of housing in the handful of cities that are leading the way on sustainability. Forget about composting — nearly a quarter of all Americans lack curbside recycling or access to bins. Roughly 85 million Americans live in states that get less than 5 percent of their electricity from renewable sources — and if you exclude large hydropower, that number skyrockets to 167 million. High-frequency transit exists almost exclusively in the urban cores of America’s largest cities, and many Americans live in suburban and rural areas poorly served by transit, where biking and walking are practically out of the question.

Meanwhile, in San Francisco, many trips are taken by sustainable modes (walking, biking and transit); residents can get 100 percent carbon-free electricity, and recycling and composting are mandatory. We live in a completely different world than the vast majority of Americans, and it’s an injustice that more people don’t have the opportunity to live in a city like this.

The reason more people don’t have the opportunity to live like this is clear: We don’t have enough housing.

Of course there is still room for improvement in cities such as Berkeley and San Francisco. Too many of our existing residents are still dependent upon private automobiles to get around because their neighborhoods — mostly low-rise, single-family neighborhoods — don’t have adequate transit service. However, it’s a chicken and an egg problem: Neighbors oppose more housing because there isn’t adequate transit, while transit agencies can’t justify increasing service to these (frequently wealthier, whiter) neighborhoods without more riders living there.

BART can’t justify an expansion without knowing that new service will get proportionately high ridership. As a result, BART has historically expanded into fast-growing suburbs, while transit service in the urban cores deteriorates.

It wouldn’t take much — cities around the world arguably may be able to support extensive subway networks with just six-to-eight story apartments, such as those we see in Downtown Berkeley and Southside. Building housing like that throughout our neighborhoods would mean we’d have the money we needed to improve transit and help even more residents — new and existing alike — get out of their cars.

Unfortunately, building apartments in those neighborhoods is illegal.

The single-family residential zoning so prevalent in Berkeley and San Francisco was written to explicitly exclude low-income people and people of color by banning the housing they lived in. Single-family zoning was invented by developers to reinforce their property values and those of their white homebuyers. And though the explicit racial prejudices have since been removed, the effect remains largely the same: These restrictions drive up housing prices and rents, enriching established homeowners and landlords while exacerbating inequality and raising barriers to upward economic mobility.

Sustainability is about addressing environmental, social and economic issues simultaneously. Cities are where that happens, and building housing in those cities is how. Without building housing in urban centers, we can’t get people out of cars, we can’t undo the lasting impacts of segregation, and we can’t increase access to jobs while redistributing wealth. The sustainability battle of our time is the building of new homes in cities.

So when it comes to Earth Day, don’t limit yourself to your own lifestyle — consider how else you can help your community be more sustainable and improve the lives of others. Join your local housing advocacy groups so people currently living in far-flung suburbs can have homes near BART. Speak to your elected officials about pro-housing legislation such as state Sen. Nancy Skinner’s bill to create more low- and middle-income student housing, SB 1227. Volunteer on political campaigns for pro-housing candidates, join clubs supporting those candidates or even run for office on a pro-housing platform yourself.

Ultimately, sustainability efforts will be won in city halls and capitol buildings across the country (and around the world). While the individual actions one can take are certainly nice, the scale of change we need to solve these problems requires the full support of our governments — so let’s get to work bringing our governments on board.

The Policy includes the creation of artistic platforms for interaction between different groups of the population and individual citizens such as: representatives of ethnic groups and different religions of Lutsk, internally displaced persons (IDPs) from the East of Ukraine and Lutsk citizens, children, youth and elderly people. The Policy encourages cooperation between NGOs and local authorities, social integration of children and youth with disabilities, international cooperation and cultural exchanges.

Lutsk citywide cultural and artistic events became the platforms for interaction and inclusive participation of Lutsk residents. These events include: ""Christmas in Lutsk"" and ""Easter in Lutsk"" Ethno-Festivals, art projects ""Christmas workshop"" and ""Easter workshop"", ""CULTUREfest"" Youth Festival and the Youth Day with the participation of foreign students, ""Hostyny na Veresnevomu"" Festival with the participation of Roma community members, Europe Days in Lutsk, days of local cultures etc. The city authorities hold regular thematic meetings and round tables with the participation of representatives of the local national-cultural associations, IDPs and NGOs. The Department for Culture, which is directly responsible for the implementation of this Policy, initiates free handmade master classes, exhibitions and fairs of folk crafts products, provides administrative, consulting and organizational support to cultural projects of IDPs, national minorities and NGOs.

The most striking outcome of the Policy is “Palette of Cultures” Intercultural Festival. The representatives of all nationalities living in Lutsk, children, young people and older generation, as well as IDPs became participants of this festival. The participants present their national identity and cultural heritage including traditional songs, dances, musical instruments, clothes, household items, craft products, and dishes of their national cuisines.

All citywide events include the participation of Volyn Council of Churches. It is the religious organization of representatives of all Christian confessions in Volyn region. It organizes joint religious and cultural events, such as the ""500 Years of Reformation"", ""God is rich in mercy"" Charity Concert, an interconfessional feast of the Bible.

The older generation also becomes the active part of the community through participation in the city cultural life. 4 choral groups of veterans are created and perform in Lutsk. There are universities of the Third Age and a club of veterans of war and labor ""Restless hearts"". Also the project ""Accessible cinema for pensioners"" is launched.

Children and youth with disabilities are encouraged to participate in cultural life through the implementation of social projects such as ""Children of the Sun. One day at work"" which provides young people with Down syndrome with an internship in different institutions, including cultural ones; children festival ""Special Baby has Special Talent""; film festival ""ChildrenKinofest"" etc.

Anti-cafe ""Innerspace"", created by the family of settlers from the East, became an area for inclusive participation and cultural expression for all Lutsk residents and city guests, without exception. ""Innerspace"" is a place where many socially useful activities take place, such as: exhibitions, concerts, parties, master classes for adults and children, art therapy.

The city authorities are interested in expanding the international participation of Lutsk through cultural diplomacy. The best platforms for the experience exchange and the search for partners in various fields of culture were: the festival ""Polissia Summer with Folklore"", theatre festival ""Mandrivnyi Vishak"", the poetry festival ""MERIDIANLUTSK"", pianists competition ""Chopin Spring"", ""Art Jazz Cooperation"", the festival ""Stravinsky and Ukraine"", the art project ""Music Beyond the Borders"", intercultural art-show ""Night at Lutsk Castle"", and many others. In turn, local creative groups successfully present Ukrainian culture abroad.

Follow-ups for further Policy implementation are: improvement of existing platforms for inclusive participation, creation of Intercultural Center that would bring together representatives of all Lutsk cultures, improvement of conditions for intercultural mixing by modernizing cultural institutions and public spaces, and further expanding the international partner network of Lutsk.

The indicators related to the positive impact of the Policy implementation are the following:

the level of positive acceptation of the Roma community representatives is increasing;

the number of conflicts between representatives of different ethnic groups, religions and races is reducing;

the majority of Lutsk inhabitants has overcome stereotypes about residents from the East Ukraine;

the pace of integration of internally displaced people into the Lutsk community is accelerating;

the number of people interested in the cultural life of the city is increasing;

every activity increases the number of Lutsk international partners and the international visibility of the city;

the number of joint cultural projects organized by Lutsk NGOs and national minorities with the support of city authorities is increasing.

The Policy is implemented by Lutsk cultural institutions and other public organizations. Besides the Department for Culture, the main activities and projects within this Policy are carried out by the following executive bodies of Lutsk City Council: the Department of Social Services for Families, Children and Youth, the Department for Family, Youth and Sports, the Department for Education, the Department for Tourism and City Promotion. The organizers of different projects within the policy are often the Volyn Regional Scientific Library named by Olena Pchilka, Lutsk City Employment Center, national cultural societies, NGOs such as: ""Stendal"", ""Garmyder"", ""Settlers from Crimea and Donbas"", anti-cafe ""Innerspace"", Lesya Ukrainka Eastern European National University, Volyn Youth Center, Center for Children and Youth Creativity ""Dyvo"". Local entrepreneurs often are sponsors of the events.","The Policy encourages cooperation between NGOs and local authorities, social integration of children and youth with disabilities, international cooperation and cultural exchanges.

Sustainability for Camden means generating economic development, improving the lives and health of residents, and cultivating a healthier way of life. The Camden SMART (Stormwater Management and Resource Training) Initiative is accomplishing this through stormwater management, policy development, and green infrastructure training programs.

The Camden SMART Initiative imagines a future where neighborhood flooding and sewer overflows are eliminated by the year 2020 — where green jobs support the local economy and environmental policy, and increased property values protect land, improve recreational amenities, and open spaces to make neighborhoods beautiful.

SMART results

Here in Camden, the push for environmental sustainability has already begun. In just a few years, the Camden SMART Initiative is producing results with impressive momentum and equipping city residents to continue these initiatives well into the future.

Since 2011, the initiative has activated more than 45 partners, invested over $25 million in the City of Camden, created 50 infrastructure projects, planted more than 1,500 trees, and captured more than 62 million gallons of stormwater annually.

These efforts have earned Camden its most recent accomplishment as a Spotlight Award winner as part of the Healthiest Cities & Counties Challenge, a partnership with the Aetna Foundation, American Public Health Association, and the National Association of Counties. The challenge helps communities become healthier places to live, work, learn, and play, and recognizes the cities and counties that achieve a measurable impact in their communities.

Community involvement and benefits

More than 4,000 Camden City residents are already engaged in these programs. Here’s how you can too:

Participate in the Rain Barrel Program hosted by the SMART Initiative. These free, hour-long workshops educate residents on the problems concerning combined-sewer overflow and how to manage these issues at their own homes. Those who participate receive a free rain barrel and free installation on their property. Rain barrels save money on water bills, reduce flooding, and recycle excess water.

74,https://www.consultancy.uk/news/16521/just-40-of-global-companies-reporting-on-un-sustainable-development-goals,"Wed, 04 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Consultancy.uk,Just 40% of global companies reporting on UN Sustainable Development Goals,"As the world attempts to adapt a seemingly contradictory growth-based economy to sustainability measures, aligning business practice with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals remains a thorny issue for those in direct violation of the outcomes, while businesses in general continue to underreport their efforts. According to a new report, just 40% of the world’s businesses are reporting according to the goals, with the UK higher than average at 60%, and the US well below that at 31%.

The US’ decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement spurred global reinvestment in highly polluting forms of energy, which, given the likely long-term outcome of such investments, and the continued support of the accord from all other signatories, place shareholders at risk in multiple senses. Meanwhile, wider concerns across value chains, from labour violations to corruption, continue to drive efforts to improve supply chain transparency.

One effort to transform the footprint of companies is the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These goals are often interdependent, and target, among others, the reduction of various negative social and environmental outcomes, including the impact of business practices – particularly externalities that are cost posts – as well as spurring businesses to support regional efforts that create mutual benefits; or through philanthropy and high impact projects.

A new report from KPMG aims to uncover in how far companies are reporting on their business’ alignment with the SDGs. Companies have an interest in such efforts as part of their wider corporate responsibility efforts. The report is based on data from reporting by the top 250 global companies.

When it comes to reporting on SDGs the survey found that European companies in the top 250 globally are considerably more likely to have the SDGs as part of their wider corporate reporting. Globally the average is 40%, while in Germany, 83% of companies report on SDGs, compared to 63% in France. US-based multinationals are the least likely to report among the top five, at 31% of those surveyed. The UK saw its results place it firmly in the mid-range of SDG reporters, at 60%.

The groups least likely to report on SDG are also those that have sometimes disproportionate effect on a particular goal. Oil & gas companies are the least likely industry sector to report, at 28%, followed by the industrial sector, manufacturing & metals, at 30%. Financial services firms, which tend to have large investment or financial interests in the former two industries, come in third to last at 37% of respondents. Utilities and automotive are the top of the rung, at 58% apiece.

However, the research also sought to identify how companies are performing when it comes to their reporting – when they do report. The analysis ranks three indicators each in three categories between D and A on their respective overall performance*.

In terms of understanding the SDGs, companies tend to underperform with a D ranking, in making a business case (where there is one) for SDG actions. Discussing the SDGs in leadership messages from CEO/Chair’s message was ranked a C, and is considered relatively low-hanging fruit in terms of improvement effort required. Companies collectively were ranked A- in terms of assessing the business’s impacts on the SDGs, largely because only positive outcomes are reported, while areas of negative impact garner less (or even no) mention in the report.

In terms of prioritising the SDG, companies are effectively prioritising the SDGs most relevant to their respective business, allowing for stronger responses to higher impact areas. The firm notes that, given the 17 total goals, specific focus on areas where the business makes the most impact is more effective. Few companies however, say how they are prioritising the SDGs that they do support, with a B score noted as leaving room for improvement. Few companies are going above and beyond the call of the targets – with considerable opportunity to create positive social and environmental outcomes above the current SDGs.

Companies are increasingly focused on key areas – which tend to have global impacts – such as climate action, reported by 64% of respondents, and decent work and economic growth, reported by 59% of respondents. Other issues with relatively high profiles include good health and wellbeing, at 55%, responsible consumption and production, at 54%, and gender equality, at 52%.

Improvement to global energy infrastructure focused on sustainability was noted as important by 48% of respondents, in line with industry, innovation and infrastructure development. Sustainable cities and communities was reported on by 46% of respondents.

This article was exclusively written for the Sting by Ms Kim van Daalen, a Dutch Public Health MPhil student at the University of Cambridge. She is affiliated to the International Federation of Medical Students Associations (IFMSA). However, the opinions expressed in this piece belong strictly to the writer and do not necessarily reflect IFMSA’s view on the topic, nor The European Sting’s one.

The Sustainable Development Goals; 17 goals, 169 targets, an ambitious, hopeful and unifying agenda agreed on by 193 countries over the world to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for everyone worldwide. An agenda with so much to gain for a better world and nothing to lose.

Lately, I have been asked, remarkably often, the question ‘’ So, what is your favourite SDG? ‘’ – this might have something to do with the SDGs being the background of my phone, and up on my room wall, but never mind -. And as a student with a passion for Global Health people expect me to answer with something like ‘’ Goal 3: Good Health & Wellbeing, of course! ‘’. But does it make sense to stamp a goal as your favourite just because it is called ‘’ Good Health ‘’?

Global Health cannot be concerned in isolation as the determinants of health cross disciplinary and national boundaries. Hence, health involves social arrangements, justice, health economics, poverty, hunger, planetary health and so on. After one look at the sustainable development agenda one can only conclude that health is both an essential outcome as a key enabler of sustainable development, being a building block in a framework of interaction with other SDGs.

This can be illustrated by goal 2 ‘’Zero Hunger’’. Good health cannot be achieved without the access to sufficient nutrition while on the other hand not properly managed agriculture can damage health severely. Another example would be goal 13 ‘’ Climate Action’’ . The effects of extreme weather events (storms, heat, floods), the effects on our natural systems (availability fresh water, crop survival, pollen in the air, spread of disease vectors) and effects on our economic and social systems (scare resources, violent conflict) as a result of climate change make achieving goal 3 impossible with global action. As a last illustration; goal 11 ‘’ Sustainable cities and communities ‘’ plays a critical role for our mental and physical health providing affordable housing and health care services, while urbanisation also poses pressure on determinants of health as the water supplies, sewage etc.

Strong synergies with health can be described for almost all the 13 other SDGs, leading to the conclusion that the 17 SDGs are ‘’indivisible’’ in an integrated web of challenges. Health is a crucial human right and contributes to society through reduced expenditure, productive employment, gender equality and social cohesion. This leads to the conclusion that favouritism of goal 3, in the light of Global Health improvement, would not do right to both Global Health or to the SDG agenda. We need to promote partnerships and synergies aligning actions across goals for better health.

Saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, advancing economic growth… these are one and the same fight. We must connect the dots between climate change, water scarcity, energy shortages, global health, food security and women’s empowerment. Solutions to one problem must be solutions for all.- Ban Ki-moon

A new geography of power is emerging, made up of global city networks. All in all, the attractiveness of cities is based on the hope of higher purchasing power through greater opportunities, for a better quality of life. Megacities have the potential to effectively fight against poverty and enhance living conditions for a large proportion of the population – if they are managed correctly and make the most of their advantages. Nonetheless, there is a drastic need for new urban models to tackle the associated social, economic, and environmental pressures in a sustainable way.

Cities are the new engines of growth in the global economy, responsible for 80% of global GDP. It is no longer just countries that compete, but cities as well. Like there is great power competition, so will the world’s great cities increasingly compete. Every city will have to gain a competitive edge to differentiate itself from the rest. Flexible and agile cities that can diversify their resources and offer economic, social, and cultural opportunities to their citizens will not only survive but thrive. The cities that are best equipped to produce innovative, inclusive, and ethical solutions in the face of multiplying risks and threats will emerge as leaders. A clear picture emerges: cities will compete and collaborate globally as interdependent entities and will drive the future.

Speaking about megacities, let’s look for example at Mumbai, which is the financial capital of India and the second-most populated city in the world. It is not only the subcontinent’s city with the highest GDP but also ranks among the world’s top ten trade centers. The city contributes 25% of industrial output and 70% of capital transactions to India’s economy. Important financial organizations such as the Reserve Bank of India and the National Stock Exchange of India are in Mumbai. It houses the headquarters of various multinational companies and has thus become an influential commercial and entertainment center of India. It would be foolish to ignore such cities in tomorrow’s global economy.

City diplomacy could be considered a form of decentralization of international relations management, choosing cities as the key actors. In many cases, the representatives of cities involved in city diplomacy will be the mayors, given that they are often responsible for the international relations of their communities. On behalf of their cities, these key actors can engage in relations with other actors on the international stage through two-sided or multiple-sided interactions. There is a lot of room for city diplomacy to grow. It can be driven by image or investment interests, development and strategic communications complete each other.

A city relationship is formally created when the mayors or highest elected or designated leaders from two communities sign a memorandum of understanding establishing the partnership. Nevertheless, this is usually the result of a long process that involves the local city organizations along with the municipalities and other local institutions. It takes a lot of work to get to this stage, so, as in many other cases, sustained effort and clear vision pay off. So, time to shape up the in house mayoral or county staff and consolidate a stellar local talent team of global reach.

Competition matters but so does cooperation. Collaborating with neighboring or nearby cities enables cities to plan and implement actions to address emissions from energy infrastructure, public transport, food systems, waste management, and other services that often operate across municipal borders and to address cross-border climate risks. It also helps cities overcome regional or national climate-policy barriers, share the cost of staff and equipment, and secure better access to data, funding, and technical assistance – all of which can motivate other cities in the area to participate as well.

Image and Investment demand a third I in the 2020s: Innovation. The fastest way to connect cities and counties is using technology. The technological progress of recent decades has had not only a powerful but also a transformative influence on urban life. As technology progresses and becomes more affordable, the functionality and sustainability of urban practices undergo significant advancements as well. At the same time, increased access to information consolidates the role of knowledge as a powerful engine of economic growth. This enables the development of knowledge-based and connected societies. Under these continuously evolving conditions, many concepts about the organization and management of the new technological capabilities have become popular, including the smart city.

To establish an approach for the ideal future of an urban settlement that harnesses technology should be part of the integrated processes that connect cities at a regional level. In the best-case scenario, a city that aspires to become „smart‟ has an integrated, forward-looking plan that includes a vision and a methodology focused on benefiting from digital technologies to improve urban functions and develop knowledge ecosystems. Like any strategy, the plans for smart cities must be adapted to the needs, priorities, and constraints of their circumstances.

Funding for smart city projects is still carved out of overall city or department budgets, either through existing spending (e.g., IT, lighting contracts) or designated ‘smart city’ spending, which is typically relatively small. It is therefore difficult to identify the exact amount local authorities allocate to such projects. Even though a lot of the investment for smart city projects comes from the general city budget, cities have found it most beneficial to have earmarked funds for innovation initiatives. At the moment, what is clear is that the funding and budgeting has to match the ambitions of big cities and transform the smart city objective into reality.

National governments are also encouraging cities to increase funding by boosting the participation of the private sector in delivering smart city projects. Businesses’ experience with participating in the delivery of smart city projects has been dominated by pilot projects often utilizing public sector grant funding. There is room for much more. Local authorities need to make more strides towards scaling pilot projects and procuring large-scale solutions. The city must be able to articulate clearly the challenges it faces and develop a more open way for the market to respond. The sky is the limit, if the game is played well. An innovative image and investment diplomacy operation is an important way forward.","A new geography of power is emerging, made up of global city networks.

Can a place where water is hard to come by and heat is hard to escape sustain a growing population?

Some say it can't, insisting that cities have no place in the desert. Given carefully considered and collaboratively conceived water management, urban planning and architecture, University of Arizona experts Sharon Megdal, Ladd Keith and Christopher Domin say otherwise.

Unlike the future of desert dwelling, the challenges of it are uncomplicated and uncontroversial. They are, chiefly, water scarcity and heat.

Humans aren't intrinsically well-prepared to handle either one, and yet civilizations have made homes of inhospitable deserts for centuries. In southern Arizona, long before celebrated architect Judith Chafee built her famed 1975 Ramada House and taught at the UA, the Hohokam inhabited the landscape, drawing from the Salt and Gila rivers to sustain themselves.

But the new, unmissable challenge for central and southern Arizona—home to 531,000 people in Tucson and 1.62 million in Phoenix—is that the state's population growth ranked fifth highest in the U.S. last year. The number of Arizonans in need of water and respite from scorching heat is large and growing.

It's a challenge that calls for optimism and ingenuity.

On the occasion of Earth Day (April 22), Megdal explains how Arizona's desert cities are finding ways to conserve and reuse their scant water supply, Keith shows how newly developed heat maps are enabling prudent planning decisions, and Domin talks about strategic, sustainable architecture.

From the Ground Up: Arizona's Water Systems

Ingenuity and optimism come easily to Sharon Megdal, an expert in water management. She is the director of the UA's Water Resources Research Center, or WRRC, and an endowed professor of soil, water and environmental science.

""Arizona is moving in the direction of making better use of the water resources we have,"" she says. ""Because when you have a growing population in the desert and you want a vibrant economy and more growth, you have to be smart about water use.""

To understand Arizona's water future, Megdal says we first must understand its past.

In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt established the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. Its first major water project was creating today's Salt River Project, including the construction of a series of dams that would draw water from the Salt and Verde River watersheds and deliver it to Phoenix. The most visible and costly of these was Roosevelt Dam in Globe, completed in 1911.

""The idea was to harness water from the watershed and bring it down to this fertile area for farming,"" Megdal says.

Unlike Yuma, situated right along the Colorado River, Phoenix—which was just becoming an agricultural hub in the early 1900s—needed a water system built from the ground up.

Thanks to the advent and popularization of air conditioning and large-scale wells to pump groundwater, the desert had become a much more livable place by the 1950s. And with troops coming home from World War II and looking to settle down with their families, Americans moved to Arizona in droves.

As the state's population grew, landowners began to pump fossil water from underground with nearly no regulation. In fact, Tucson had become the nation's largest metropolitan area dependent solely on groundwater.

Arizona was depleting its aquifers at an alarming rate.

In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson approved construction of a 336-mile canal to carry Colorado River water to the central and southern parts of the state. It would be called the Central Arizona Project, or CAP.

When the federal government insisted that Arizona address overuse of its fossil water before providing funding for the new canal, the Groundwater Management Act of 1980 was born. The act designated Phoenix, Tucson, Pinal County and Prescott as ""Active Management Areas,"" mandating conservation by agricultural, industrial and municipal users in these areas. The new law helped rein in overuse of groundwater across the state.

Thirteen years and $4 billion later, the CAP was complete; today, it delivers just over 20 percent of the state's water.

Responsibility and Resilience

Creating infrastructure and policy that support sustainable water use in the desert takes time, money and expertise. And, as history illustrates, it comes with a steep learning curve.

According to Megdal, while there is always room from improvement, both Tucson and Phoenix are rising to the challenge now more than ever. In both cities, per-capita use of water is decreasing. In Tucson, the total use of water is the same today as it was 30 years ago, when the city's population was closer to 420,000.

""We're becoming more efficient in our water use,"" Megdal says.

One of the reasons for this, she says, is water recycling and reuse. Pima County has a wastewater treatment plant capable of treating water so that it meets standards not only of irrigation, but human use. The state also makes smart use of its aquifers via recharge and recovery.

""Tucson has long been known for its ethic of water conservation,"" Megdal says. ""With increased dialogue among architects, water planners and land-use planners, Tucson will continue to stack up very well against other desert cities in the Southwest.""

Mapping Heat in the Urban Desert

Ladd Keith, an expert in urban planning, agrees. Keith is a planning lecturer and chair of the Sustainable Built Environments program at the UA's College of Architecture, Planning and Landscape Architecture.

Apart from water scarcity, Keith says, desert cities such as Tucson have to reckon with something called the urban heat island effect. Concrete, asphalt and buildings retain heat, and at night they give off the heat they stored during the day to the surrounding air, keeping temperatures high even overnight.

Keith leads a research project to figure out how four cities in the Southwest—Phoenix, Tucson, Albuquerque and Las Cruces—are using temperature data, visualized with red (hot) and green (cooler) color-coded heat maps to inform planning and policy-making decisions.

The two-year project began in fall 2017, and Keith says the team—which also includes UA Institute of the Environment assistant research scientist Ben McMahan and landscape architecture graduate student Tess Wagner—already has some useful findings.

Roosevelt Dam, in Globe, was completed in 1911. It was the first of a series of projects that eventually would store some 5 million acre-feet of surface water in reservoirs within the state. Credit: University of Arizona

For one thing, he says, in 2008, Tucson became the first of the four cities to create its heat map, which is managed by the Pima Association of Governments and available online. Both Albuquerque and Las Cruces created maps in late 2017. While Phoenix has made maps for several initiatives, it is the only one of the four cities that does not have a citywide map publicly available.

""Some may find it surprising, but Tucson is really a leader in its use of the heat map and has been transparent from early on,"" Keith says.

Through research, Keith and his team have found that Tucsonans are actively using the heat map to make decisions.

When Tucson Mayor Jonathan Rothschild launched his 10,000 Trees initiative, his office consulted the heat map to decide where to plant. Areas facing a more severe heat island effect would have more trees to counteract the higher temperatures. Tucson has used the map to evaluate rezoning permits for proposed developments and determine landscaping requirements. The Conserve2Enhance program, created by Megdal's team at the WRRC, doesn't award grants to local environmental enhancement projects before first consulting—you guessed it—the heat map.

""Not that we don't have more work to do, but Tucson is setting an example for where a lot of other cities would like to go,"" Keith says.

Under the umbrella of ""more work to do"" is that Tucson's heat map is based only on one thermal satellite image and is not ground verified, meaning it's hard to say how it compares to average climate conditions.

Pockets of Respite

If desert cities are to be truly sustainable oases, it's not going to be by ""blanketing the whole city and making it cooler all at once,"" Keith says. To do so would be impossible.

""It's going to be about creating comfortable microclimates at buildings and sites where people work and play and go to school, and then making sure that we have cool corridor connections so that people can comfortably walk to where they're going,"" he says.

That's where targeted use of a heat map and thoughtfully designed architecture come in handy.

Designing for the Desert

Heat mapping can tell you where you need to create more coolness and comfort, but it can't tell you how. Keith's colleague, Christopher Domin, can. Domin is an associate professor of architecture at the UA and the author of a forthcoming book about the life and work of Judith Chafee. He specializes in regional technology.

""As an architect and an educator, I'm thrilled by the lesson the desert provides,"" Domin says. ""If you look at how plants and animals survive in this climate, they can teach humans quite a bit about how to adapt to this ecosystem and transfer those ideas into built environments.""

Can an office building, restaurant, school or home not only survive the harshness of the desert, but be sustainable and comfortable for those who inhabit it? Says Domin: Yes, with the right design strategy.

Throughout time, the right design has taken many forms.

Domin points out that, because wood always has been scarce in the desert, people historically have built using earth. The two primary techniques are rammed earth construction—layering mixtures of silt, gravel and a bit of clay—and adobe block construction, in which bricks are made of clay and straw.

Buildings retain heat, and at night they give off the heat they stored during the day to the surrounding air, keeping temperatures high overnight. This is called the urban heat island effect, and it's something desert cities battle as their populations grow and development expands. Credit: University of Arizona

""Those materials along with traditional building elements can help us live graciously in this climate,"" Domin says. ""Aside from being abundantly available, these materials allow inhabitants to leverage our high diurnal temperature shift to cool spaces during the day and warm them at night.""

Domin notes that while earth-based construction became much less common in the age of air conditioning, these traditional materials are making a comeback as desert cities reimagine and retool themselves for a future where sustainability is a means for survival.

In 2012, Tucson added amendments to its residential code, deeming uninsulated adobe and rammed earth walls in compliance.

In the 1920s and '30s, people living in Tucson and Phoenix built sleeping porches to stay cool through the night. In the evening, they would migrate to these sleeping porches and hang sheets soaked in water along the sides of the porch.

""This allowed evaporative cooling before the advent of air conditioning,"" Domin says. ""People found ways to live in homes that met the needs of the desert climate.""

Even UA dormitories such as Maricopa Hall had built-in sleeping porches at one time.

Advances in air conditioning, along with concrete and other new building materials, allowed desert dwellers to be less deliberate about their habits and routines. Domin says that as we try to return to a more gracious kind of existence, even as the population grows, good design will be considerate of the heat island effect.

It's a kind of calculus, he says: ""Create more shade and remove concrete.""

Credit: University of Arizona

Tucson architecture often features distinctly large overhangs (example: Old Main) for the purpose of creating shade, but Domin says well-placed landscaping can create shade, too. Tucson has desert landscaping ordinances for both public and residential projects. The ordinances ensure responsible practices such as efficient irrigation, water harvesting and preservation of native plants.

While architects in the Southwest still rely heavily on materials such as concrete block, Domin talks about options: ""Quite often architects design with tough materials to meet the toughness of the Sonoran Desert.""

Zinc, he says, is one such example. Zinc roofing and wall cladding is durable, long-lasting and has non-toxic runoff, meaning its effect on the landscape and aquifers is benign.

Architects also can design spaces that keep people cool by considering ventilation and solar angles. A narrower building (say, one room deep) will encourage a breeze to flow throughout, rather than being cut off by interior corridors. Also, placing buildings along the east-west axis, with the longest side of the building facing south, and minimizing western-facing windows, keeps more heat out.

Easy? No. Achievable? Yes.

What Megdal, Keith and Domin make clear is that desert dwelling requires a will to make it work and an ethos to do so without depleting the environment. It's a precarious balance, one that researchers are increasingly aware of—and Arizonans are increasingly attempting to make good on.

Is it easy? All three say no. But is desert dwelling rewarding and achievable in a sustainable way? Yes, so long as growing populations stay innovative, adaptive and willing to conserve.

The desert is a unique landscape that comes with unique challenges. But for those who continue to move here, it's worth it. ""The desert is a welcoming, beautiful place to live, isn't it?"" Megdal says, smiling.

Her question, of course, is rhetorical.

According to the World Travel & Tourism Council, the travel industry is one of the world’s most powerful—it supplies 10 percent of the world’s jobs, at 313 million worldwide. But there are negative side effects, too, like visitors putting a strain on cities, the lack of tourism dollars benefitting local communities, and the use of fossil fuels by major airlines.

Luckily, with tips from travel experts, there are plenty of simple ways to offset your environmental impact without totally overhauling your trip.

1. Choose a destination that values sustainability

According to the 2018 Environmental Performance Index, European nations Switzerland, France, and Denmark take the top slots as the world’s most sustainable nations, and despite rapid economic growth and tourism spikes, Albania moved from ranking 61st in 2016 to 40th in 2018 when it prioritized the protection of wild areas like its first and only national marine park, Karaburun-Sazan Marine Park, backed by theUnited Nations Development Programme and Global Environment Facility. Namibia became the first African nation to write protection of the environment into its constitution, and with the assistance of the World Wildlife Fund, communities are empowered to conserve, manage, and benefit from the wildlife on their lands. According to WWF’s vice president of travel, tourism, and conservation Jim Sano, choosing to travel to a conservation-minded destination is one of the most important things travelers can do. “Destinations that value their natural and cultural heritage elevate the quality of a traveler’s experience and support the livelihoods of those that work in the travel industry.”

2. Consider how you get there

With air quality as the leading environmental threat to public health as listed by the 2018 Environmental Performance Index, it’s time to reconsider how we fly. Plane travel is often the only viable way to reach some of the world’s great destinations, but one of the easiest ways travelers can offset their carbon footprint is by selecting an eco-friendly airline. Look for a carrier that uses sustainable aviation biofuel—like United, Qantas, and KLM—and fly direct when possible. Better yet, the International Transport Forum reports that traveling by train generates up to 10 times fewer carbon emissions than an airplane. And high-speed trains like carbon-neutral Eurostar are three times more energy efficient as compared to regional trains. (Want train travel inspiration? Try one across the Australian outback, or take the Orient Express.) If you’re looking to book a cruise, consider economically efficient small ships instead. Alaskan Dream Cruises’ 10-passenger charters work to protect the wild fjords of Alaska while Aqua Expeditions funds paramedic care to the communities they visit and works to protects the fragile, and increasingly endangered, environments of the Peruvian Amazon and Mekong River.","From increasing cultural understanding to aiding in the conservation of wildlife, there’s no denying the positive impact travel can have on the world.
According to the World Travel & Tourism Council, the travel industry is one of the world’s most powerful—it supplies 10 percent of the world’s jobs, at 313 million worldwide.
Luckily, with tips from travel experts, there are plenty of simple ways to offset your environmental impact without totally overhauling your trip.

“Managing decent water quality for drinking cannot be separated from managing decent water quality for all other uses,” said Eric Viala, the Director and Chief of Party of Winrock International’s Sustainable Water Partnership, which is co-sponsoring a four-part series on water; previous events examined “The Problem of Too Much Water” and “The Challenge of Too Little Water.”

“Water isn’t just something we drink; it impacts everything,” said Koo-Oshima.

Waste Not, Want Not

Given the scarcity of water in many parts of the world, we must use wastewater to meet the needs of millions of people. “Treated wastewater is a safe and reliable source of water that can be used to offset water scarcity and energy consumption,” said Koo-Oshima.

But even when wastewater has been treated and is entirely safe, many consumers remain skeptical. “Reuse schemes can still fail without public acceptance and awareness, so it is very important for planners to adequately account for the dynamics of social acceptance, awareness-raising, and education tailored to the consumers and the general public with different cultural/religious backgrounds,” said Koo-Oshima.

In Singapore, which imports over half of its water from neighboring Malaysia, water security is a top priority. Singapore has built desalination plants, rainwater collection plants, and, most importantly, membrane-based technology to treat sewage water and purify it for reuse, making it one of the first countries to do so on a significant scale. This technology, named NEWater, already meets 30 percent of Singapore’s water needs.

To ensure that everyone is on board, Singapore has incorporated the importance of reuse and conservation of water into its public education programs in schools. “They have a huge and very effective public relations campaign around it,” said Jon Freedman, Global Government Affairs Leader at SUEZ. “NEWater is treated wastewater in a bottle, and they have government officials who will publicly drink it,” he said, to prove to the public that the water is completely safe and healthy.

Women and Water

Water scarcity has a disproportionate impact on women and girls in developing countries, where they are mainly responsible for collecting water for their households. Women “generally have to walk miles to find a drinking water source,” said Robyn Fischer, Senior Policy and Advocacy Officer at WaterAid America. In sub-Saharan Africa, women collectively spend “16 million hours collecting water each day, which is almost 25 percent of their time,” she said, which severely impacts their ability to receive a quality education, increases their exposure to violence, and leads them to miss other opportunities for advancement.

The long, arduous treks can have lasting effects. “When women and girls are no longer in school, there is a heightened risk of early marriage and early pregnancy, low lifetime earning potential, low decision-making power and political participation, all of which perpetuate the cycle of poverty,” said Fischer. Women also need clean water to meet their hygiene needs during menstruation and pregnancy.

“Women must be directly involved in all aspects of the water value chain,” said Fischer, including processes such as constructing wells, participation, design, implementation, and monitoring of wastewater facilities. “Integrated approaches that also address gender-based discrimination are key for women to truly benefit,” she said.

Controlling Agricultural Pollution

“Agriculture, here in the U.S. and in many parts of the world, is the leading cause of water quality degradation,” said Jon Winsten, an agricultural economist working in the Ecosystem Services Unit at Winrock International.

“What we really need are flexible and efficient solutions that help farmers to mitigate nutrient and sediment loss from their fields without being too disruptive to productivity,” said Winsten. Performance-based incentives can serve as a price for pollution control, thereby allowing environmental performance to be incorporated into farm business planning.

“Information is essential if we really want to be smart about agricultural pollution control,” said Winsten, who, along with other economists and engineers at the Sustainable Water Partnership, aim to integrate advanced data into their decisions. “There’s a lot of low-hanging fruit that remains, meaning there are cost-effective changes that can be made.”

The Future of Water

The rapid rate of population growth makes the challenges of water and wastewater even more pressing —and potentially even greater threats to peace and security. As the world grows to nine billion people, most of them living in cities, “the global water challenges are enormous, and water depletion and degradation are recognized as a potential destabilizing factor,” said Koo-Oshima. And climate change threatens to exacerbate these problems, especially in fragile states: “If climate change is the shark, then water is its teeth,” she said.

Instead of saving “the same lives over and over again,” which is like “pouring water in a leaky bucket,” we should look carefully at improving overall livelihoods, and have a “more integrated approach to water management,” said Viala.","“Globally, nearly one billion people still lack access to safe water,” said Sasha Koo-Oshima, Senior International Water Advisor for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, at a recent Wilson Center event on the potential challenges and opportunities of wastewater treatment.

This article was exclusively written for the Sting by Ms Ooko Lornah Akello, a final year medical student at University of Nairobi, Kenya. Ms Akello is affiliated to the International Federation of Medical Students Association (IFMSA). The opinion expressed in this piece belongs to the writer and does not necessarily reflect IFMSA’s view on the topic, nor The European Sting’s one.

Don’t we all dream and live to see the world become a better (ideally humanly perfect) place like is depicted and graphically created in the Sci-Fi movies we so love to indulge, right? So I believe that this was the very reason behind the Standard Development Goals (SDGs) and also their mother, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

SDGs are a collection of interrelated 17 global goals set by the United Nations and ratified by member states. With each having its own targets (which sum up to a total of 169) to be achieved, ideally by 2030. How far 2030 seemed then. Time’s catching up and lapsing on those targets and it’s no longer funny.

Of the 17, number 3 which is “ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”, is the one directed towards health and geared towards achieving universal health coverage (UHC), a dream come true for me as an aspiring medic. But if we are to look closely and analyse the SDGs, you’ll be amazed at how they interplay and intermarry. All the SDGs have a synergistic relation to each other and so it goes without saying that SDG 3 is not the only one that affects health and the health sector.

If hunger is eradicated, achieving SDG 2, then malnutrition is curbed and under five mortality and morbidity reduces, lessening the health burden associated it. Provision of clean water and maintenance of constant supply and proper sanitation achieved (goal 6), results in reduction and possible eradication of diarrhoeal diseases which, especially in developing countries like my dear country Kenya, is a major health and economic burden. Reducing inequality, goal 10.

Doesn’t this just sit right at the core of achieving universal health coverage? If Goal 9 were achieved it would be marvellous. Imagine better roads and state of the art health facilities accessible to all. How efficient would emergency services be? By how much would mortality rate reduce? Wouldn’t it also be nice to have pharmaceuticals producing legitimate and quality drugs and maybe the discovery of the cure for cancer or maybe HIV if we invested in medical innovation?

One can only dream and wish. I recently learned of a colleague who is working on 3D virtual anatomical reconstruction. I was mind blown and just wondered what more is yet to be tapped. There’s a lot of potential out there.

I could ramble on and on and on. Such topics hold a special place in my heart and being a medical student that fire keeps burning more and more as I advance in this career path. But I hope this inspires someone or starts a ripple effect on just how, important it is to work on these SDGs together and how health and the SDGs are connected.

It is the fifth edition of the Recycled Playground Challenge, which aims to teach school students, teachers and communities about preserving healthy smiles and a healthy environment.

Schools can earn points towards winning the grand prize playground by sending oral care waste, such as empty toothpaste tubes and floss containers, to TerraCycle for recycling and encouraging their community to vote online. One (1) ‘Playground Credit’ will be awarded for each 0.2lb ‘unit’ of used, post-consumer oral care products and packaging. Community members may vote once per day for a school of their choice, with each vote counting as an additional Playground Credit.

The materials are collected through TerraCycle’s Colgate® Oral Care Recycling Program, a free national program hosted by the two companies. The program is an ongoing activity open to any individual, family, school or community group. For each piece of waste sent in using a pre-paid shipping label, participants can earn money toward donations to the school or charity of their choice.

“With the recycling program, Colgate enables their consumers to divert waste from landfills, engage their communities and be rewarded for their effort,” said Tom Szaky, Founder and CEO of TerraCycle. “The growth of the Recycled Playground Challenge to include new prizing further promotes the program and creates awareness, allowing us to reach even more people and make a greater difference in the environment.”

This Recycled Playground Challenge is open to schools located throughout New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Connecticut and Maryland. Materials are being accepted from March 11 through June 30. The schools with the most Playground Credits will be named the winners by July 30, 2018 and the playgrounds – which will have approximate retail values of $50,000 and $40,000 – will be installed this fall. The second runner-up school and six honorable mention participants will be awarded various prizes and ShopRite gift cards.

“ShopRite is excited to once again bring this great program to schools in the communities where our ShopRite stores operate. The Recycled Playground Challenge motivates students to recycle and teaches them innovative ways to help the environment,” said Christine Magyarits, ShopRite Community Relations Manager.

In the coming weeks, TerraCycle and Colgate will be announcing a similar program in partnership with Meijer that will target Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky and Wisconsin.","In their biggest contest yet, TerraCycle, Colgate and ShopRite’s annual partnership is offering students across the eastern US the chance to win a playground for their school made entirely of recycled materials.

The head of the group that focuses on small, incremental investments to spur big changes toured three of the city’s neighborhoods and spoke with the people trying to recover and build on those neighborhood’s strengths.

A few hours before he spoke to a crowd at Akron’s Civic Theatre downtown, Chuck Marohn listened in a back room of Compass Coffee – the emerging hub of Middlebury, one of Akron’s oldest and poorest neighborhoods. He’s heard conversations from the Pacific Northwest to Boston around one big theme: Cities are ready to reclaim themselves.

“Cities are ready to make investments that build their strength and resiliency, make them financially more productive and prosperous and make them better places to live,” Marohn says.

“Modest Little Changes”

Marohn says the efforts aren’t only in older cities, but they have been most prominent.

“I just think that old cities are probably more conducive to our approach than newer cities,” Marohn says. “They’re very open to the small modest little changes that it would take to make their neighborhoods more successful. And when you can make those tweaks in a city like Akron, what you see is that you can invest a lot less money and get a lot higher return, in actual dollars – and make people’s lives better in the process.”

Marohn says it not a competition for investment between downtowns and neighborhoods. Historic development patterns, he said, include both, with neighborhoods having their own small ecosystems complementing downtowns, and vice versa.

The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation put up $120,000 for the year-long partnership between Akron and Strong Towns. Marohn says the effort includes his group learning more about Akron and Akron learning more about efforts elsewhere.

“And then the final phase,” he says, “what are the things that we can do on the ground here as a community to actually start to make things a little bit better?”

Marohn was a civil engineer before he became an urban planner and saw problems with sprawl and other issues from both angles.

Credit M.L. Schultze / WKSU / WKSU Tina Boyes, head of Kenmore's community development effort, was one of those meeting with Strong Towns Chuck Marohn Tuesday.

“I really thought for a long time that it was because as engineers we were asked to fix things that planners should have thought of ahead of time,” Marohn says. “What I found out is that planners are really smart people, they know a lot of things. We’re just working on a bad system.”

Unsustainable Suburban Scrawl

Other cities that have experience population loss, such as Youngstown and Detroit, embarked in the last decade on efforts to shrink their physical footprint. Marohn says he doesn’t think it will stop there.

“I think that even cities that are not losing population … will be faced with that,” he says. “When we look two decades into the future of our communities, the math indicates it is very clear it at we will have fewer roads, fewer pipes and fewer sidewalks.”

“Every city in North America is going to shrink in geographic size,” Marohn continues. “All of those subdivisions that we’ve created out on the edge, all of the interchanges and frontage roads and new developments – all that stuff is insolvent. None of it pays for itself; there isn’t the money to maintain it, there isn’t the money to replace it and put it back and fix it – and so it’s going to go away.”

He points to the decaying shell of what was Rolling Acres Mall as an example.

“I think people are shocked by that; they look at that as an affront because people in this community remember that mall as a great place,” he says. “Yet if you look back, that is what our ancestors though when they looked at that had become of the downtown. Downtown Akron was a beautiful, gorgeous place filled with arts and culture an all kinds of great things. And we basically walked away from it because we thought it was a bad investment. We found out now that stuff out on the edge is a bad investment.""

The program, Cocoa for Good, will have Hershey investing in collaborative programs and partnerships with stakeholders to encourage “agroforestry,” with agricultural methods that include growing cocoa in more productive shaded areas.

Past collaborative initiatives have proven that such agroforestry methods work: the company offered training and support to cocoa farmers in Ghana, for example, and saw increasing yields of cocoa year after year, according to the company.

The program will focus on West Africa where about 70% of the world’s cocoa is grown, Hershey says. In addition to addressing deforestation and agroforestry, Hershey will focus investments on other pressing issues facing cocoa-growing communities in the area: boosting household incomes in cocoa growing communities, increasing family access to good nutrition, elimination of child labor, and increasing youth access to education opportunities. This focus will have a ripple effect on the cocoa supply chain by enabling children to reach their potential in school and become adults who thrive in their jobs, the company says.

Once Again: Partnerships

Companies engaged in environmental responsibility cite partnerships over and over again as a necessity to affecting change. Hershey is no different, stating that A multi-stakeholder, collaborative approach is needed to find solutions to the environmental, economic and social challenges facing cocoa-growing communities. “The Hershey Company has been partnering with key stakeholders in the cocoa sector for more than 100 years,” says Susanna Zhu, Hershey chief procurement officer. “Under Cocoa For Good, we continue to work toward a future where there’s a long-term, sustainable cocoa supply, the natural environment is protected, and we are creating better lives for everyone. It’s good for the cocoa farmers, families, communities, chocolate consumers and the success of our business.”

The Vice President of the Republic of Côte D’Ivoire, Daniel Kablan Duncan, agrees, saying “…public-private partnerships are critical to improving the lives of people living in cocoa communities and protecting our precious natural resources.”

Sustainable Supply Chain Critical to Business, Says Hershey

There’s a strong business case for Hershey, as a snacking company, to invest in the sustainability of its cocoa supply, says Jeff King, senior director of sustainability, CSR and social innovation. “The return on that investment is not only ensuring that a core ingredient of our snacks is sustainably grown and abundant for generations, but we are also able to deliver on one of our founding principles as a company: to bring about positive societal change and make life better for the communities where we operate,” he told Environmental Leader. “That’s what Cocoa for Good is all about. It’s doing what makes sense for our business, and what is needed to help safeguard the health, well-being and success of people in cocoa-growing communities.”","Hershey Company is investing more than $500 million on a new cocoa sustainability strategy that the company says will ensure that its supply of cocoa will be plentiful for generations to come.

Ontario, Canada’s Blue Box program made its official debut in the City of Kitchener in 1981 and became a blueprint for recycling programs in more than 150 countries around the world. Many Canadians don’t realize recycling “started” here in the Great White North, and unfortunately, many also don’t know what can go in their blue boxes these days.

Put simply, we are recycling wrong and it’s costing our municipalities millions. And now that China has restricted its intake of foreign waste, our municipalities are also struggling to find markets for our recyclables.

Non-recyclable content that makes its way to recycling centers is called contamination, and as more packaging and products are made with mixed materials, confusion among consumers and costs for municipalities are growing. What can be processed by recycling facilities also varies by municipality. Black plastic, for example, cannot be properly identified and sorted at many local plants.

“[A black plastic coffee cup lid] looks like recycling, feels like recycling, it’s actually marked as recycling,” Jim McKay, general manager of waste management services for the City of Toronto, told CBC News. “[In Toronto,] It’s not.”

As a result, contamination rates vary widely across the country. The eastern-most provincial capital of St. John’s, NL has an admirably low rate of 3%, in part aided by its relatively small population (just over 200,000 people live in its greater metropolitan area). St. John’s does not accept common contaminants such as glass, Styrofoam, and plastic bags, and requires its residents to separate paper, cardboard and containers in their curbside recycling. While these restrictions contribute to its low contamination rate, they also mean that only about 60 percent of households participate, apartment dwellers must request to participate, and about a third of households still put out five bags of garbage every week.

On the opposite coast, Vancouver, BC, where Sustainable Brands will host a conference in June, also boasts a low contamination rate of 4.6%. As in St. John’s, residents must sort paper, cardboard, and containers in their curbside bins, but Vancouver also accepts glass if in its own bin, and plastic bags and Styrofoam if they are returned to a depot for recycling.

Unfortunately, other large cities are performing much more poorly. Toronto, ON and Edmonton, AB, the country’s 1st and 5th most populous cities respectively, have contamination rates around 25%. These cities – and many others across the country – collect all recyclables together in the same bin or bag. Such “single-stream” programs amplify the problem by allowing contaminants to damage other materials as they move through the system. The nation’s capital of Ottawa, ON is an exception, where despite a single-stream program, its contamination rate is only 5%.

Lower contamination rates help keep costs down and allow municipalities to sell their recyclables for higher prices. Some municipalities also have to pay additional fees under their contracts with waste management companies if their contamination rates get too high. Under Toronto’s contract with Canada Fibers, for example, the city will need to pay an extra $5 million charge if its average contamination rate reaches 27%. McKay estimated that each percentage point decrease in contamination could lower recycling costs in Toronto by $600,000 to $1 million per year.

Some North American material is still being sent to emerging markets in Asia, but the prices are lower than they were with Chinese facilities.

Other municipalities are struggling to find markets at all. Tonnes of plastics have been accumulating in stockpiles across the country since Chinese companies stopped accepting foreign recycling materials last year. In some cases, material has degraded and has had to be sent to landfills since it could no longer be recycled. In the province of Nova Scotia, where it is illegal to dump plastics in a landfill, counties must obtain special permits for this, or ship them to landfills elsewhere. Cities which have secured deals with processing facilities are keeping their markets a secret for fear that they will be outbid and once again stuck with recyclables that cannot be processed in most facilities in Canada, such as film plastics.

Municipalities are anticipating investments in recycling infrastructure to increase their own capacity for processing materials, in addition to consumer education campaigns. Many already have online resources that allow residents to look up how to dispose of specific materials at the local level. Various levels of government are also working with companies and NGOs to reduce waste through initiatives such as the Circular Economy Innovation Lab (CEIL) and National Zero Waste Council (NZWC).

Canadians are invited to join the conversation through the CBC’s Reduce, Reuse and Rethink Facebook group.","And now that China has restricted its intake of foreign waste, our municipalities are also struggling to find markets for our recyclables.
On the opposite coast, Vancouver, BC, where Sustainable Brands will host a conference in June, also boasts a low contamination rate of 4.6%.
The nation’s capital of Ottawa, ON is an exception, where despite a single-stream program, its contamination rate is only 5%.

Sustainable and eco-friendly homes are becoming increasingly desirable to homebuyers. In a recent survey from the National Association of Realtors’ Sustainability Program, Realtor respondents reported that the majority of homebuyers — 61 percent — are interested in green living. Additionally, 71 percent say that having energy-efficient amenities in a listing increases the home’s value on the market.

Several environmentally friendly features were included in the top neighborhood features clients want, such as 38 percent of clients who are looking for access to local food, 7 percent who want recycling and 6 percent who want a community garden.

Transportation-wise, 51 percent of respondents reported walkability as either very or somewhat important to them, and 32 percent said being near public transportation was very or somewhat important to them. The survey also found that 39 percent said that their community having bike lanes or paths was either very or somewhat important to them.

With the increasing interest in green homes from homebuyers, agents need to become more aware of eco-friendly features available in homes as well as highlighting those features when listing. Of the 40 percent of Realtors who reported that their MLS has green data fields, 37 percent use the data fields to promote green features, 27 percent use them to promote information about energy, and 16 percent use them to promote certifications for being eco-friendly.

Some of the specific green features analyzed include:

Solar panels

80 percent of Realtors report that properties with solar panels are available in their market.

39 percent report that solar panels increase a property’s perceived value.

43 percent said homes with solar panels spend neither more or less time on the market than average, while 33 percent said the effect solar panels had on a home’s market time was unclear.

Wind farms

76 percent of Realtors said wind farms were not available in their market, compared to 13 percent who said they were available (11 percent were unsure)

32 percent said wind farms had a negative effect on perceived property value, compared to 9 percent who claimed a positive effect, and 34 percent who said no effect

Tiny homes (under 600 square feet)

23 percent of Realtors said they were available in the market, while 61 percent said they were not.

16 percent of Realtors were unsure whether tiny homes were available in their market.

The level of comfortability realtors had answering questions about a home’s performance and efficiency was mixed, with 39 percent reporting being either comfortable or extremely comfortable, compared to 26 percent being either uncomfortable or extremely uncomfortable.

In the Midwest, 8 percent of clients were considered very interested in sustainability topics, compared to 52 percent who were considered somewhat interested. The majority of the region’s clients also considered promoting energy efficiency in listings either very valuable (24 percent) or somewhat valuable (48 percent).

The regional breakdown of interest in sustainability topics can be seen in the chart below.

Northeast Midwest South West Very interested 11% 8% 8% 11% Somewhat interested 51% 52% 49% 54% Neither interested or uninterested 27% 24% 28% 23% Somewhat uninterested 9% 12% 11% 8% Very uninterested 3% 4% 5% 3%

“Consumers continue to make it clear that environmentally friendly features and neighborhoods are an important factor in deciding where and what home to buy,” said NAR President Elizabeth Mendenhall. “Realtors are leaders in the conversation about real estate sustainability, energy conservation and resource efficiency and will continue to promote environmentally conscious strategies and best practices that benefit not just our clients, but also our communities.”","In a recent survey from the National Association of Realtors’ Sustainability Program, Realtor respondents reported that the majority of homebuyers — 61 percent — are interested in green living.

90,https://www.eco-business.com/opinion/sustainable-shopping-save-the-world-one-chocolate-at-a-time/,"Mon, 02 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",eco-business.com,"Sustainable shopping: save the world, one chocolate at a time","Cocoa is probably the most sustainable of all internationally traded commodities, so there are several “feel-good” reasons for eating the chocolate made from it this Easter—at least when the cocoa is grown by smallholder producers and traded by processors that are committed to equitable sharing of profits.

Here are some ways to tell if you are onto a good thing.

Environmental impact

As a wild species, cocoa (Theobroma cacao) originates from the rainforest of the Amazon basin and the foothills of the Andes. In nature, it grows as an “understorey” species, shaded by the rainforest canopy. Much of the world’s cocoa crop is similarly grown in the shade of taller trees in mixed plantings.

Unlike many plantation crops, like rubber and oil palm, cocoa can be grown with a diverse mixture of other plants. Of course, not all growers produce this way, so if preserving biodiversity is a priority for you, look for Rainforest Alliance certification.

Cocoa needs a lot of water to survive, so large irrigated plantations have a high water footprint. On the other hand, almost all smallholder cocoa is grown without irrigation in high-rainfall areas, so the water used in production of the cocoa is close to zero (apart from a small amount of water used in processing).

Another environmental aspect is the use of fertilisers and pesticides. When cocoa pods are harvested they take a lot of nutrients with them, out of the ecosystem. On average, a kilogram of dry cocoa contains 36 grams of nitrogen, 6g of phosphorus, 72g of potassium, 7g of calcium, and 6g of magnesium.

This means maintaining soil condition is critical. This can be achieved with careful application of fertiliser, though this rarely occurs and soil depletion has become a major problem prompting aid groups to encourage more fertiliser use!.

However, research in Sulawesi, supported by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research and chocolate giant Mars Inc, has shown that using a judicious combination of nitrogen-fixing shade trees and compost (ideally produced with the help of goats) can maintain soil fertility—and even reclaim depleted speargrass savanna—for cocoa production.

Finding good chocolate

The good news is that there are plenty of chocolate producers who avoid all of these problems. There are two ways to find it: look for certifications, or seek out small operations in our region.

Fairtrade certification means that smallholder producers in developing countries are getting a fair share of the price you pay.

Rainforest Alliance certification, meanwhile, ensures that rainforest hasn’t been cleared to make way for unsustainable plantations.

If you’re concerned about fertiliser and pesticide use, UTZ (who have recently merged with the Rainforest Alliance) has built sustainable productivity into their certification systems.

All of these certification schemes are largely available to multinational companies. Some of the biggest chocolate companies in the world, including Mars, Ferrero, Hershey and Nestlé, have committed to sourcing 100 per cent certified cocoa, so it’s possible to buy sustainable cocoa without even realising it.

On the other end of the scale are smallholdings, which are likely to lack these kinds of certifications. That doesn’t always mean they are bad for the environment, or that the growers aren’t getting a fair price. It may simply be that the expense of formal certification is not worth it for many small operations.

Much of this chocolate is organic more or less by default, as many smallholders, especially in the Pacific region, simply do not use agrochemicals. It’s also more likely to be grown in heavily rainforested areas, with almost zero water footprint.

“ With a bit of attention to the back story, you can enjoy a whole range of delicious new chocolate experiences this Easter—and feel that you are contributing at the same time to the equitable and sustainable development of the planet.

In their search for high quality and unique flavours, several Australian boutique chocolate makers have started to source their beans directly from cacao growers.

For instance, Bahen & Co. in Margaret River, Western Australia, purchases beans directly from communities on Vanuatu’s Malekula island, while Jasper & Myrtle in Canberra buys beans from growers on PNG’s previously troubled island of Bougainville.

These programs mean that these growers have been able to taste chocolate from their own beans for the first time, and thus understand how their own processing of the beans—through fermentation and drying—affects the quality of the final product.

Even more value can remain with the local growers and their communities if the chocolate itself is manufactured in-country. Visitors passing through duty free shops as they leave PNG may have picked up Queen Emma chocolate, made by Paradise Foods in Port Moresby, while those leaving Nadi may have bought Fijiana chocolate made by local company Adi’s Chocolate.

Australian shoppers will soon be able to buy Aelan chocolate – single-origin bars from four different islands of Vanuatu, made in Port Vila by ACTIV, a Victorian NGO founded and operated on fair-trade principles.

At the furthest end of the fine-flavour chocolate trend are chocolate bars with no artificial additives of any kind. A favourite recipe among discerning chocolate-tasters is simply to mix 80 per cent cocoa “nibs” (coarsely ground beans) with 20 per cent sugar and “conch” it gently until smooth and delicious.

What about food miles and the carbon footprint?

The typical cocoa bean from the Asia-Pacific region is bought by the local representative of a global commodity trader. It is shipped to Singapore, or directly to Indonesia, which has the capacity to grind some 600,000 tonnes of cocoa each year. The ground or whole beans then travel onward to Europe.

Belgium has a well-established reputation as the world’s preferred provider of “cocoa liquor”, and some of this is shipped back to Australia as the raw material for local chocolate manufacture – now with a sizeable carbon footprint.

Other beans will be shipped to France, Italy, Switzerland (or will remain in Belgium) for manufacture into delicious chocolates, and some of these too will be shipped back to our region for retail sale. If fossil fuels and global warming are among your concerns, consider seeking a chocolate product that was grown and processed nearby.

In sum, with a bit of attention to the back story, you can enjoy a whole range of delicious new chocolate experiences this Easter—and feel that you are contributing at the same time to the equitable and sustainable development of the planet.

Globally, food and agriculture is a $7.8 trillion industry. Its also growing (pun intended): global investments in the food and agriculture sector have grown three-fold since 2004 and, according to McKinsey, on average have demonstrated higher returns to shareholders than other sectors. In the US, agriculture, food and related industries generated 5.5% of the country’s GDP at $992 billion, $137 billion of that coming directly from US farms.

Despite this activity, there are several unmet challenges facing stakeholders across the supply chain in food & agriculture – including threats posed by climate change. And startups hungry to solve problems and make money doing it are stepping up.

In Israel’s hive of entrepreneurial activity, for example, startups are focusing on a range of issues such as reducing contamination in foods, lab-grown meat and packaging that is better for the environment.

The founders of Inspecto began developing a “nanoscale portable device for early detection of food contaminants in the field” after watching an exposé on the news revealing significant levels of contaminants in foods in Israeli supermarkets. (According to the USDA, as much as 85% of the food supply in the US carries pesticide residues.) Such contaminants can lead to pesticides to accumulate in the human body.

Inspecto is starting with a device that detects a contaminant in coffee called acrylamide, which can also be found in potatoes, chocolate, bread and other food items. A number of companies have signed up to pilot the product in its first deployment, including Israel’s Strauss Coffee and Chinese coffee manufacturer Shinho.

“The problem with identifying contaminants in food is they’re in extremely low levels of concentration, in parts per million, in some cases, parts per billion,” CEO Avner Avidan told NoCamels. “What we’re doing is using a combination of optical sensors that allow us to isolate the contaminant we’re looking for and amplify its signal a million times over. The idea is to have this technology implemented in various points in the supply chain, so if we’re talking about coffee, it’s going to be used in coffee roasters, manufacturers, at the point of sale of coffee beans.”

Others are more focused on growing food in a lab. Tel Aviv-based SuperMeat is the latest company to develop meat made by growing animal cells rather than by raising animals, sometimes called “clean meat.” The approach avoids the large environmental toll of raising animals and the ethical struggle of being responsible for the death of the animal in order to eat it. SuperMeat raised $3 million in seed funding in January and expects their first product – a lab-grown chicken meat – to enter sales within the next two years.

The environmental impact of plastic is a major issue for all sectors, but especially the food industry due to its ubiquitous use for packaging and transportation. TIPA (“drop” in Hebrew) has created a fully compostable bio-plastic packaging.

Founder and CEO Daphna Nissenbaum aimed to create a sustainable alternative to plastic, but realized its degradability was only half the battle; decomposed plastic may still leave behind micro-particles that contaminate the environment. Thus, Nissenbaum and her team developed flexible packaging that can become compost within 180 days. Their material is being used in both the food and fashion industries, including Dutch retailer Ekoplaza, Dutch coffee producer Peeze and by fashion designers such as Stella McCartney, Mara Hoffman and Gabriela Hearst.

Meanwhile in the UAE, a new app is allowing restaurants to sell off their excess food at discounted prices. BonApp launched in January and has 85 eateries in Dubai on board. Excess mounds of food in the city’s signature brunches and loaded buffets get tossed away, much to the frustration of Erika Daintry, Malin Raman Delin and Alice Kaboli, the Nordic all-female trio behind the startup and app.

Restaurants with excess pre-packaged foods, unsold meals and freshly-baked products can list their spare produce on BonApp. Users receive notifications when a nearby establishment has fresh inventory for sale, which they can purchase through the app for discounts of up to 60 per cent on the usual retail price and go to collect it in person. BonApp makes money by taking a cut of the transaction.

The idea behind the app is not new; many startups are helping retailers donate food to charity or sell it via an app, such as Flashfood, Food Cowboy and Food Shift in the US, Neighbourly, FareShare and FoodCloud in the UK, FoodLoop in Germany, Zéro-Gâchis in France, Froodly in Finland, Canada-based Ubifood, and Too Good To Go in the US, UK and several European countries.

Today, yet another app that helps businesses manage unsold inventory to reduce food waste announced impressive waste reduction results. Since it began in July 2017, Spoiler Alert’s ongoing partnership with leading meal kit company HelloFresh has enabled HelloFresh to:

Decrease its landfill-bound organic waste by 65%;

Reduce waste hauling pickups by 44%;

Nearly double the percentage of unsold inventory donated to charities, from 33% to 61% of total volume; and

Donate more than one million meals comprised of fresh ingredients to its local communities, based on USDA’s calculation of 1.2 pounds per meal.

“At Spoiler Alert, we recognize the massive problem that food waste poses to businesses and our planet. We’re using our unique platform and data analysis to change the status quo. With HelloFresh, the food recovery numbers speak for themselves,” said Emily Malina, Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer at Spoiler Alert. “HelloFresh has been a leader in their space in many areas, but this is one where they have really stepped up and are at the forefront of the industry. We have all been incredibly impressed with their team.”

The longest-running program for ventures tackling challenges in the food and agriculture sector is also based in the US. Food and Agriculture: US 2018 is being run by Village Capital in partnership with The Campbell Soup Company, and will train 12 recently-selected startups through workshops, one-on-one sessions with investors and more.

There are some easy questions to answer when ordering a meal at a Friday night fish fry. “Fried or baked?” “All-you-can-eat?” “Baked potato or fries?”

But some fish-fry lovers in Madison are starting to ask a few questions of their own. Like, “Where did this fish come from?” “When was it caught?” “Is it sustainable?”

That last question is a big one, and likely the most difficult to understand. It affects much more than the Friday tradition. It’s a question that should be asked about the fillets we buy, the seafood dishes we’re served and the sushi rolls we enjoy at restaurants.

“It’s such a complex issue,” says Matt Robertson, the Midwest restaurant representative for Sea to Table, a purveyor of wild, domestic and sustainable seafood. While many restaurants educate their customers, he says, “I think that the tendency at your average restaurant is just to gloss over the complexity of the seafood system and some of the more broken aspects of it, just to not overwhelm the customer.”

The issues with the global seafood industry are as deep and ominous as the waters into which fishermen around the world cast their nets. Blatant disregard for legal and ethical guidelines involving commercial fishing have resulted in rampant depletion of fish species and irreversible effects on oceanic and freshwater ecosystems. The abuse of enslaved workers in Southeast Asia’s fishing industry was revealed in a 2016 Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation by The Associated Press. Yet the demand for fish has increased overall in the past few decades. While annual per capita consumption of commercial fish and shellfish decreased slightly in 2016 from 2015 (14.9 pounds compared to 2015’s 15.5 pounds), Americans took the biggest leap in seafood consumption in 20 years in 2015, according to an annual report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. There are competing ideologies and concerns about PCBs (or polychlorinated biphenyls, which are manmade chemicals that pollute the water) and mercury levels in fish still considered safe to consume. Yet fish is known to be a good source of lean protein, omega-3 fatty acids, rich vitamins and minerals.

As people eat more fish, more questions are being raised regarding overfishing, safe handling, fair working conditions and exactly which waters their fish came from.

“Two-thirds of the globe’s fisheries aren’t managed and aren’t regulated and aren’t even understood at all because there’s no science behind them,” says Nic Mink, founder and co-owner of Sitka Salmon Shares, which is a community-supported fishery bringing wild-caught salmon from southeast Alaska to Midwestern cities including Madison. And even the fisheries that are understood and have regulations in place are still being overfished, Mink continues. There are also larger-scale vessels that follow the rules, but their operations still aren’t as sustainable as they could be. “Even though it’s not overfishing, it’s still really not embodying a lot of the values of the food movement,” Mink says.

Madison is home to some of the most conscientious food consumers in the Midwest, but it’s also a place that doesn’t have great access to seafood. That’s one of the reasons Mink, who lives in Madison and earned his undergrad and Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, decided to deliver to the Madison community when he first started his salmon business in 2012. One of his missions was to help bring seafood into the local conversation about sustainable food sourcing.

It starts with educating chefs, grocery shoppers and restaurant goers, says Mink. “Consumers are educating themselves about why it’s important to know where the fish comes from, and they’re educating themselves about the questions they need to ask about a fish,” says Mink, who is among the people we asked to help explain how Madisonians can make more sustainable seafood choices.

What does sustainability mean?

Mink is a knowledgeable person to ask what sustainability means when applied to commercial fishing, as Sitka Salmon Shares came out of a salmon habitat conservation and outreach program he conducted as a researcher and visiting professor in Sitka, Alaska. Before that, Mink earned his Ph.D. in history and environmental studies from the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at UW-Madison. “So I kind of have this dual environmental approach to history, but also I did a lot of sustainable food systems stuff and social dimensions of natural resource use,” Mink says.

With some of his students who traveled to Sitka, Mink started thinking about better labeling for fish from southeast Alaska fishermen who apply sustainability and social justice practices. What resulted was Sitka Salmon Shares, which began offering shares in community-supported fisheries (similar to community-supported agriculture shares in which consumers sign up to receive boxes of seasonal produce) the Midwest.

In Mink’s work, sustainability doesn’t just mean operating in a way that allows for continued growth of the company. Sustainability is achieved through thoughtful consideration of environmental issues, safe and desired handling and education and transparency about good practices, which inevitably leads to added value to both the fishermen and the consumer.

None of that is possible without necessary and responsible regulation of fisheries. Varying statistics and analyses show that about 90 percent of the world’s fish stocks are fully fished or overfished, and many fish species have been depleted to near extinction. And it’s likely to get worse. The Guardian, citing the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, or FAO, reports that a 17 percent increase in global fish production is estimated by 2025.

Alaska, which accounts for about 60 percent of U.S. landings (the amount of fish harvested from the sea and brought to the land), is a leader in domestic fisheries policy, Mink says. “There are really important policies in place in Alaska to ensure that the nature of the fleet doesn’t ever really industrialize to a way in which the rest of the globe’s fisheries are,” he says.

Sitka is a fishing community of about 500 permit holders, Mink says, who primarily practice a small-scale hook-and-line method of catching fish, which limits bycatch (which is a fish that was incidentally captured in the process of catching a different species) and doesn’t damage seafloor habitats. Sitka Salmon Shares works with 20 small-scale fishermen (including Drew Terhaar pictured on the cover), who are all co-owners of the business, and whose fishing practices have the least environmental impact. The fishermen are required to make shorter trips and adhere to meticulous icing and bleeding practices that some of the bigger commodity processors don’t or aren’t able to do. After Sitka Salmon Shares’ fish is frozen, it’s processed in Sitka and a couple of weeks later, it’s on the doorsteps of its members.

As the company grows (it’s gone from a fleet of three to a fleet of 20, with about 5,000 CSF members – 1,000 in Madison this year), Sitka Salmon Shares continues to focus on education and outreach, which is another element of creating a sustainable seafood movement.

Mink was involved in Madison’s Sustainable Seafood Week organized by chef Tory Miller, and Mink helps host dinners and events in the Madison area to talk about sustainable seafood.

“We’re really this doggedly idealistic and this traceable community-based system that really is there to benefit fishermen and benefit consumers,” Mink says.

Where does my seafood come from?

Traceability is the keyword today for fish purveyors. With Bering Bounty – a Verona-based company offering frozen-once Alaskan salmon, cod and halibut – people know exactly where the wild-caught Alaskan salmon comes from. It comes from Mark McKeown, who is in charge of the business and is also the fisherman. He’s been fishing western Alaska’s Bering Sea for 14 years, and he can relay how terribly hard cod fishing is on a fisherman’s body, and how captaining for salmon means he’s out on the water for six-week periods. It’s a tough job, but McKeown makes sure he’s doing it right. Fish are bled immediately, all six gill rakers (the bony or cartilaginous projections from a fish’s gill arches) are cut on a salmon, and salmon goes directly into ice within minutes, sometimes seconds, McKeown says. He delivers salmon and cod to a tender vessel to transport the fish for processing, which happens within 24 hours of capture.

Concerned with his carbon footprint, McKeown uses the slowest method of getting the frozen fish from western Alaska to Wisconsin, going from vessel to sea freighter until it gets to the West Coast, where it’s then picked up via truck from a Wisconsin-based trucking company. Keeping Bering Bounty local is important to McKeown.

“You can’t have the best fish on the planet unless it is Alaskan, but we are a local Wisconsin company,” he says. “I fish Alaska because first and foremost I am a commercial fisherman – not a middleman. We are still the only Alaskan seafood company in the state of Wisconsin run by a commercial fisherman.”

It’s not good enough that it says “Alaskan-caught” on the packaging, McKeown warns. Some fish is caught in Alaska and frozen before it’s sent to another country outside of the U.S. to be processed. Maybe it’s shipped to Asia, where it’s thawed and cut into smaller portions. Then it’s shipped back to the U.S. and thawed again, and it might already be nearing or beyond its shelf life, and mushy at that point. “The fact that it’s thawed three times causes a lot of degradation in quality,” he says.

There’s also misinformation about fish, McKeown continues. “The idea of fresh salmon here in Wisconsin is completely untrue,” he says. “[It’s] misleading for folks. You get fresher fish with frozen fish in the Midwest. Until we get the teleporter complete, that’s how it’s going to be.”

What should I know about farmed fish?

Some consumers and retailers have turned to farm-raised fish for many reasons. This type of fish is part of the aquaculture industry in which fish, shellfish, plants, algae and other organisms are bred, reared and harvested often in ponds, manmade structures or the ocean.

The FAO estimates that nearly half of world seafood consumption comes from aquaculture, and that this percentage is likely to increase in the future.

China has played a major role in this growth as it represents more than 60 percent of world aquaculture production, and some area restaurants seek out high quality aquaculture options abroad. Both Bonfyre American Grille and Miko Poke serve farmed salmon from the Faroe Islands between Iceland and Norway in the north Atlantic Ocean. “The Wisconsin Food Code states that restaurants are not allowed to serve wild-caught raw salmon that has not been deep-frozen first,” says Caitlin Suemnicht, chief creative officer for Food Fight Restaurant Group, which operates Miko Poke. “Because we liked the texture and flavor of fresh raw salmon for our poke, we search for the highest-quality aquacultured salmon on the market.”

The aquaponics industry has taken hold in the U.S., too, Wisconsin included. There are at least 16 fish farms in Wisconsin that produce fish for eating, says Kathy Kline, education outreach specialist at UW-Madison Sea Grant, who helped develop the Eat Wisconsin Fish program, which educates Wisconsinites about aquaculture and Great Lakes fish. There are other fish farms that produce sport fish for stocking Wisconsin waters.

“There’s some big things happening with aquaculture in Wisconsin and they’ve been on the horizon for a while,” Kline says. A large operation is set to start harvesting Atlantic salmon soon at Superior Fresh near Eau Claire, and it will be the largest aquaponics facility in the world, according to Superior Fresh, and the first indoor recirculating aquaculture system in Wisconsin raising Atlantic salmon. “There’s nothing else like that in the country,” Kline says.

While the aquaculture industry continues to grow, farmed fish still carries a stigma of being dirty and unnatural. “But with the aquaculture that we do in this country, the discharges have to be regulated by the EPA [U.S. Environmental Protective Agency] and by our state DNR [Department of Natural Resources],” says Kline. “And a lot of the newer startups are these aquaponic systems where that water is being recirculated, filtered, cleaned and reused. So it’s actually a very clean system.”

Yet safe practices come at a cost. “It’s very expensive,” Kline says, “to a point where fish farmers often have a hard time negotiating all the regulations.”

When Peter Fritsch started working on a Palmyra, Wisconsin, fish farm in 1997, he was fresh out of college and given the opportunity to experiment with chemical-free fish farming. Co-workers referred to him as “the college kid” because he was so eager to move in a direction that was ahead of the curve. After only a year of Fritsch’s experimentation, the farm experienced an increase in fish and improved water quality. So, starting in 1999, Rushing Waters Fisheries became an all-natural fish farm.

That one year of experience turned into 20 and counting for Fritsch, who is now the president of Rushing Waters. Spanning 80 acres, Rushing Waters is the largest trout farm in the state and operates year-round. The farm raises one-pound rainbow trout from egg to harvest over the course of 18 months. By keeping the fish in very cold spring water, the farm actually encourages a slow and healthy growth cycle. Starting as fertilized eggs, the fish begin life on the farm in a hatchery. It typically takes about two weeks for the eggs to hatch, and then the fish are moved to a tank where they stay until they are big enough to move to one of the farm’s 56 ponds. Throughout the entire process, the fish are being sorted based on size to ensure proper development.

“We don’t use any shortcuts,” Fritsch says.

Because his company also doesn’t use chemicals, Rushing Waters actually finds that its water quality improves every year. While this improvement is a major success for the fish and the environment, it was the reason the farm had to abandon aquaponics efforts a couple of years ago. Hoping to expand its business, Rushing Waters tried growing lettuce and basil through an aquaponics system, but discovered the fish were monopolizing the nutrients in the water. The trial proved the impressive water quality but pushed Rushing Waters to explore other business ventures.

Rushing Waters opened The Trout House, an on-site restaurant, in 2013 to create a farm-to-table experience for visitors. “You hook it, we cook it” is the tagline for the restaurant’s Wednesday to Sunday lunch promotion that gives customers the opportunity to fish on the property without a fishing license and enjoy their catch in the restaurant that afternoon. For the price of the caught fish plus $11 for preparation, you can enjoy some of the freshest trout possible in Wisconsin.

“We want you to play with your food,” Fritsch says.

The restaurant draws ingredients and inspiration from its fishery, smokehouse and other local farms to produce a diverse menu that draws visitors from across the state. This past summer, Rushing Waters opened another Trout House in Delavan, Wisconsin.

Fritsch noted that Wisconsin needs to take care of the natural resources that make it stand out. While Rushing Waters is not officially organic certified yet, its successful chemical-free approach to fish farming is proof that the process can be done safely with sustainable and tasty results.

What should I know about Great Lakes fish?

Farm-raised fish offer the opportunity to eat hyperlocally, but there are also species from the Great Lakes on restaurant menus in Madison.

Kline and the UW-Madison Sea Grant saw the local food movement expanding, but noticed that local fish wasn’t included. The Eat Local Fish program was created with a focus on educating Wisconsinites about local fish and aquaculture. They started by conducting surveys at grocery stores, including Metcalfe’s Market in Madison. “And that really confirmed what we already thought – that people were already confused,” Kline says, “or weren’t really aware that we still have commercial fishermen going out from Wisconsin ports and you can buy the fish here in local grocery stores.”

Part of the outreach Kline does involves getting information to people about some of the primary concerns about Great Lakes fish: PCBs, mercury and sustainability. Eating fish from the Great Lakes became a concern in the ’70s, Kline says, when researchers found out about the industrial contamination of waterways from pollutants. PCBs accumulate in fish and the people who eat the fish, and, unlike mercury (which is in every piece of fish you eat), PCBs never leave the body. Many people stopped eating Great Lakes fish altogether, Kline says, PCBs being one of several factors among others, including invasive species, cheap imported seafood entering the U.S. and a tainted impression of Great Lakes fish as “polluted.”

“Our DNR started testing fish regularly, so we know what the contaminant levels are. And they are going down,” she says. “But they’re still there, and people need to know about them.” Especially women of childbearing years and kids, Kline says. Eat Wisconsin Fish’s website lists the species of Great Lakes fish with descriptions and offers advice on how to prepare and how often people should eat the fish.

Contaminant concerns aside, there are also bottlenecks in the distribution chain of getting Great Lakes fish onto local plates, Kline says. There are fewer commercial fishing operations and processors on the Great Lakes (Kline says several decades ago there were certain buyouts by the DNR), and many commercial fishermen find higher profits in sending fish to alternative markets. “With little demand in Wisconsin, it’s easier for them to dress the fish and send it out on a big truck to the east coast,” Kline says. While some fishermen are still happy to work with Wisconsin restaurants, it’s not as efficient to take small orders, and some don’t have the means to fill an order for less than 50 pounds, for example.

But measuring by management standards and proximity, it’s more sustainable to choose Great Lakes fish, Kline says. “Our fisheries specialists would say the Great Lakes are managed very well.”

Suzie Q Fishing Co. is one Wisconsin-based operation offering Lake Michigan catches, including the popular and sustainable choice of whitefish. Along with other Madison chefs, Jonny Hunter, the James Beard-nominated founder of the Underground Food Collective and Madison Magazine’s 2015 Chef of the Year, often sources from Suzie Q Fishing Co. for his restaurant, Forequarter.

Robertson of Sea to Table recalls the 2016 outing in which Sea to Table brought chefs Adam Struebing from Madison Club, Patrick McCormick at the time from Oliver’s Public House and Derek Lee from Pizza Brutta to Two Rivers to fish. They brought the catch back to Madison and used it for events during Sustainable Seafood Week (which will be held again this year in June), presented by the Madison Area Chefs Network in partnership with a few seafood purveyors. “When chefs are concerned about the food they’re sourcing and interested in the quality of their ingredients and supporting local communities, they get pretty psyched to go on a trip like that and meet the fishermen who are catching their fish,” says Robertson, who also went on the trip with the chefs. “To actually see and understand the process and what goes into catching this fish that they’re serving at their restaurant, it really gives an eye-opening experience.”

What questions should be asked?

Even if you’ve done your research on sustainable fish, you still might not know what questions to ask your fishmonger or waiter.

Chef Tory Miller encourages asking questions, even if it makes you sound like the annoying characters in the “Portlandia” episode in which two restaurant-goers grill their waitress to get detailed information about the chicken served. “Even the fact that someone would think to ask, ‘Is this sustainable fish?’ is a step in the right direction,” Miller says.

Miller, the James Beard-winning (and recent “Iron Chef Showdown” victor) of L’Etoile, Graze, Sujeo and Estrellón, has been a passionate advocate for sustainable seafood within MACN, a collective for Madison chefs. He encourages chefs to use resources like The James Beard Foundation’s Smart Catch app that helps chefs gauge how sustainable their seafood is by inserting answers to questions, including “Where was this caught?” and “How was it stored?” “How big was the vessel?”

But still, Miller recognizes that sourcing sustainable seafood is difficult in Madison. Distribution, budgets, staff education and lack of customer interest in fish dishes are all barriers, he says. A few years ago, he considered not selling anything that wasn’t a freshwater fish or something he could get from a Wisconsin farmer. After re-evaluation, Miller puts it bluntly – Costco is still going to sell a billion pounds of shrimp. And Americans are still going to buy a billion pounds of shrimp. “So [you’re] saying, ‘I’m not buying anything from Asia’ is not helping the problem,” he says. “What would help is you saying, ‘I demand a better product, a safer product,’ ” Miller says. “You can still make a difference as a chef and as a customer if I demand to know where my stuff is coming from,” he says.

Labeling and awareness are getting much better, though, which makes it easier for consumers to feel good about buying and consuming fish, he says.

Metcalfe’s Market in Madison was ranked No. 1 in Wisconsin and in the top 10 in the nation for sustainable seafood by Greenpeace. Seafood offered at Metcalfe’s is labeled according to Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch sustainability criteria. “They were really out in front on that,” Kline says about Metcalfe’s commitment to being transparent and responsible about sourcing fish.

Festival Foods also adheres to Seafood Watch’s ratings, and in April 2016 began offering only sustainable seafood. “Our decision to transition to 100 percent sustainable seafood was easy to make,” said Mike Zimmerman, senior director of the meat and seafood department at Festival Foods, in a statement released in February. “As a responsible retailer, we consider it our duty to sell only sustainable seafood and educate our guests about its importance. We need to be part of the solution so there will be an abundance of marine life for future generations.”

According to Whole Foods’ website, the national grocery store in 1999 became the first U.S. retailer to work with the Marine Stewardship Council, the world’s leading certification program for sustainable wild-caught seafood. Whole Foods sells only wild-caught seafood from fisheries certified sustainable by the MSC or rated “green” or “yellow” by Monterey Bay Aquarium and The Safina Center.

The Seafood Center on South Whitney Way, which also operates out of the Willy Street Co-ops on Williamson Street and University Avenue, labels its fish with the country of origin, whether it’s wild or farmed and whether it’s defrosted. Susan Shebilske, who has been with The Seafood Center for 32 years and is the non-frozen-fish buyer, says she doesn’t get a lot of questions from customers about sustainability, and The Seafood Center doesn’t often have certified sustainability labels visible to customers. But if someone asks about it, Shebilske says, she has that information behind the counter and will share it with them, and it is sometimes displayed on signs. Shebilske says she doesn’t usually ask specific questions of the places from which she buys fish about length of boat trips or how the fish is stored, but she says she trusts her long-time sources. She said she would ask those kind of questions of a new supplier, though. “We know which fish are being overfished and we kind of leave those alone,” says Shebilske, who also says they try to avoid buying fish caught illegally.

Sea to Table operates with a transparent mission of allowing customers to know details as specific as the names of the fishermen themselves whenever possible. Sea to Table works with 38 independent fishermen and commercial docks around the country and ships to more than 1,000 chefs, restaurants and institutions in the U.S. The New York-based company also started offering home delivery of fish portions in February 2017. A year later, Robertson says his business receives more orders from Wisconsin than from any other state in the Midwest. Part of Sea to Table’s mission is the focus on the symbiotic relationship between fishermen and consumer, he says.

“As there’s more awareness of issues with importing fish and fish fraud and the lack of transparency in international fishing, people will just want to start learning more about U.S. fish,” Robertson speculates.

What kind of fish should I eat?

Consumers’ tastes influence what types of fish are harvested, for better or worse.

“The next step is eliminating those danger fish,” Miller says. The danger fish he’s referring to are the overfished and/or endangered fish that still show up on menus and at fish counters. “I always fantasize about what would happen if you just decided no more bigeye [ahi tuna]. No more tuna,” Miller says. “I get that there’s always fear of ‘Well, the next guy is going to have it. Why should I be the one who doesn’t have it?’ ”

Miller says the participation of Jack Yip of RED and Shinji Muramoto of Muramoto (downtown and Hilldale) – two of Madison’s most notable sushi chefs and restaurants – in Sustainable Seafood Week last year sent a huge message. “It’s such a statement if you get involved with this,” Miller says. It helps educate customers about the true cost of a sushi roll featuring a fish that might be on the endangered or watch lists, he says.

But Miller is optimistic that people will choose to eat more sustainably. “I think at the end of the day, it’s very difficult for people to look beyond what the possible repercussions would be,” he says. “It’s a hard fight to fight. I think now more than ever, people are more open to challenging their sourcing.”

And chefs and consumers are becoming more open to other abundant, sustainable fish options. John Gadau and Phillip Hurley experiment with the seafood options they serve at Sardine and Gates & Brovi. “We have a certain price point that fits our model,” Hurley says. “So it does limit things, but it forces us to get a little more creative.”

Daniel Bonanno offers an occasional fish fry at his restaurant, A Pig in a Fur Coat. He serves ling cod–a sustainable bycatch.

Robertson has a whole list of what Sea to Table refers to as “underloved” species, including dogfish, Acadian redfish and porgy, which he describes as an easy-to-cook fish kind of like a poor man’s snapper. “They’re abundant, affordable,” Robertson says. “It’s just about gradually shifting awareness toward these underutilized fish.”

As for new and lesser-known farmed fish, Kline calls out Arctic char raised in an aquaponics facility called Aqua Terra Farms in Bristol. She also mentions saugeye, which is a cross between a walleye and a sauger. It’s not on the market yet, but will be in the near future. “And they grow faster, which is always good for a fish farm,” she says.

Mink of Sitka Salmon Shares has a few fish he wishes were more popular: keeta salmon, dusty rockfish and black bass (which is another type of rockfish), to name a few.

“You have to educate about cooking, and you have to educate about why this is a great fish ecologically for a fisherman,” Mink says.

Mink knows his customers are still going to want pristine, delicious fish like king salmon, though. “King salmon is a mind-blowingly good fish,” Mink says. “But do you value the social dynamics of that fishery? Do you value the sustainability of it?”

Even the Wisconsin fish fry has changed over the years as fish populations evolve. “The fish fry, this emblematic piece of food culture, has an entirely different undergirding than it did when people were eating it 30 years ago, or people 60 years ago who were eating it when that undergirding was Wisconsin fish,” Mink says. “That’s a really fascinating thing – that this very important food culturally to people in Wisconsin has just gone through incredible evolution from local fish to an Atlantic fish to a Pacific fish with different species along the way.”

People likely won’t stop eating at Friday night fish fries or enjoying familiar seafood dishes – but they might change how and when they eat it, all while the fishing industry continues to change.

“You’re always going to be battling industrial fisheries [as] fisheries continue to consolidate. Fisheries continue to industrialize, and that’s unfortunate,” Mink says. “But we’re building this very adaptable model that hopefully can change as our oceans change and our populations of fish and composition of the fish change.”

There might not be king salmon in 10 years that is available at a commercially viable level, he says, and it may not be something that an ecologically responsible company would catch.

“Fisheries are so rapidly changing and management is so ambiguous,” Mink says. “Consumers have to be adaptable and systems have to be resilient, so that the new fish that are going to be caught, that are going to fill ecological niches (that we may or may not know even exist right now) can be brought into the system, and people can feel good about eating that fish and understanding that fish.”

Shoving the neon green or purple packets of pads to the bottom of our shopping carts is a ritual many women standing in line at the grocery store or the pharmacy endure. While that’s not necessarily an issue for all of us, homegrown luxury brand Carmesi is looking out for the girls who are looking for something a little different.

26 year-old Tanvi Johri and her team debuted as start-up Elize, which relied on seed funding from angel investors to come to life. A recent rebranding to Carmesi — which is ‘crimson’ in Spanish — saw a considerable response from online platforms such as Purplle, Nykaa, Amazon and Flipkart, and buyers.

Naturally, being a premium brand, Carmesi isn’t inexpensive but not bank-breaking either; a three-month subscription costs ₹999 with 30 pads ranging across absorbencies, while a 12-month subscription costs ₹2999 with 120 pads spread across 4 shipments.

The company is currently working with about 5,000 active consumers, half of which are in Southern cities like Hyderabad, Chennai, Bangalore and parts of Kerala, according to co-founder Rikshav Borah. Tanvi adds that 70% of their market are working women aged 24 to 36, who were actively looking around them for better products already. The awareness around the structure of mainstream sanitary napkins is prevalent but the alternatives weren’t.

Importantly, the all-natural pads are biodegradable, a challenge to manufacturers that contribute to the 113,000 tonnes of menstrual waste India alone observes.

What’s in it?

The pads themselves are made of bamboo fibre which absorbs the period and a top sheet made of cornstarch, which ensures a no leakage experience, which we’d all appreciate. Feedback for Carmesi has included how soft and light the pads are while not at all being irritating to the skin.

The sourcing of every ingredient is also integral to the team for the sake of the environment, hygiene and comfort in the long run. “We have a contract manufacturer based out of China,” adds Rikshav, “and, for the packaging, we do it all locally.” The designs are done in-house, according to Tanvi.

“Pads are in contact with the most sensitive areas of the body; and not all the ingredients of the totally synthetic plastic-based pads out there are disclosed so women with allergies and irritation tend to experience a lot of rashes and chafing. Considering we are in summer now and a lot of India has tropical climate, that makes it worse.” Tanvi explains, “so we’ve done extensive research on the way in which we can improve such a situation.”

Customising the Carmesi experience became an important USP for the company and consumers alike. “We make it a point to tailor the delivery of our pads for each consumer; we discuss their cycle needs so that, when they sign up for the subscription, they’re supplied with pads before their cycle starts. We don’t have to hear of women running out and buying pads at the last minute.”

A new look

“When people see the name, they can evaluate it’s a creative brand, but also one regarding periods,” Tanvi points out, “We’ve used the colour red in our marketing which is important, because the more mainstream brands still use the colour blue in the place of menstruation. We see so much blood in our day-to-day lives whether when we hurt ourselves or watch movies, why can’t period blood be treated without hushed tones?” Their tagline, ‘it matters, period,’ invokes inspiration in women to own their cycles and to take care of themselves as they deserve.

Plus, the stylish marbling look of the packaging is always a plus — so pretty it’s worth an Instagram post. “Women often feel the need to hide their pads packets when they’re in line at the grocery store, so through a prettier packaging, we’re empowering them,” Tanvi comments, “Every element of the design was planned carefully to make women feel good about their periods. We’ve also looked at the disposal means so that women don’t need to carry bags around with them and in public washrooms, those facilities aren’t available so throwing pads away without covering it properly is sometimes a forced and unhygenic solution.”

Looking up to the likes of Molly Hayward of tampon subscription service Cora and Shradha Shreejaya of Sustainable Menstruation Kerala Collective, Tanvi is excited for the continual evolution of the period discourse and more to come.","While that’s not necessarily an issue for all of us, homegrown luxury brand Carmesi is looking out for the girls who are looking for something a little different.

An EU project developed innovative nanocatalysts to create an integrated modular and highly efficient process for producing fuels from renewable energy sources.

Climate change and a growing population necessitate the use of more sustainable energy sources. While this problem represents a significant societal demand, it is only one of many the petrochemical industry faces. Increased competition and dependency from external sources, rising costs, and the pressure to reduce the environmental impact of the processes employed are some other challenges that this industry currently has to overcome.

To satisfy its environmental, economic and societal responsibilities, the industry needs to develop sustainable fuel production methods. Fifteen partners across eight countries joined efforts in the EU-funded project BIOGO-FOR-PRODUCTION to radically transform production processes and realise these essential improvements.

Turning biogas into gasoline

The project focused on developing an integrated, coherent and holistic approach for transforming biofuel production from sustainable sources. Project partners utilised novel technology to prepare nanoscale catalysts with reduced dependence on precious metals and rare earth materials as well as innovative industrial methods for every production step.

""In BIOGO-FOR-PRODUCTION, we have devised a process for converting renewable bio-oils and biogas to synthesis gas, which is then catalytically transformed to biofuels and chemical platform products. This sustainable process is independent of fossil fuels,"" says project coordinator Gunther Kolb. Researchers used a hydrogen-enriched biogas that was readily converted into synthesis gas via autothermal or combined exothermic and endothermic routes. The excess hydrogen and heat were used to transform pyrolysis oil into additional synthesis gas to ultimately yield a composition suitable for methanol synthesis. Through suitable catalysts, methanol was then converted into a liquid fuel—synthetic gasoline.

Producing synthetic fuels from renewable sources will make an extremely valuable contribution to sustainably meeting energy demands. ""Unlike the conventional Fischer-Tropsch process currently in use for producing synthetic hydrocarbon fuels, BIOGO-FOR-PRODUCTION's process chain promises higher carbon efficiency, energy efficiency, security of supply as well as cost benefits,"" adds Gunther.

Nanotechnology for biofuels

Project partners worked on improving the available catalysts for each of the four key steps of the production process. Innovative techniques were applied to improve overall performance such as cluster beam sputtering. This technique involves ejecting small clusters of atoms on to the surface of a carrier material with a high surface area. The newly developed stable catalysts limited the formation of light hydrocarbons, especially methane.

The team also developed a new system that boasts a much higher deposition rate of nano-clusters, about two to three orders of magnitude higher than a typical research-grade system that can be currently found in university laboratories. This makes it much more suitable for use in the industry.

BIOGO-FOR-PRODUCTION demonstrated its process chain still on a small scale. The miniplant operates in a container environment suited for chemicals production and can serve as a future host for modular fuel production plants. Researchers have also run a pilot-scale catalyst production and demonstrated its manufacturing potential for fast industrialisation.

This was one of the main conclusions of the annual Asia-Pacific Business Forum (APBF), which was held in Hong Kong this week.

Organized by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and Cyberport, with support from the Innovation and Technology Bureau of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and in cooperation with the ESCAP Sustainable Business Network (ESBN), the Forum brought together senior policymakers and private sector representatives to discuss how innovation, technology and financing can help solve environmental and social problems in the region while also supporting equitable growth.

Innovations discussed included green financing, impact investment, FinTech, and artificial intelligence and their potential to lower costs, increase efficiency and help Asia and the Pacific leapfrog to the new economy. The region offers many examples of new technologies improving access to healthcare and education, supporting more efficient manufacturing and enabling more sustainable cities. Participants also discussed sustainable business practices linked to smart energy solutions, risk management systems for disaster risk reduction, and ways to advance impact entrepreneurship.

While the enormous opportunities presented by such innovations are clear, speakers also noted the accompanying challenges, such as ensuring the right governance structures, access to infrastructure and cybersecurity, and financial literacy.

Speaking at the opening of the two-day event, United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of the ESCAP, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar said, “Technology and innovation coupled with modern financial services, including green financing and new financial technologies, will be critical to close key development gaps in the Asia-Pacific region.” She emphasised that by strengthening and deepening partnerships between the public and private sectors the region will be better positioned to leverage the rich potential of these emerging technologies.

Throughout the sessions, speakers and participants also noted the critical importance for governments, the private sector and other actors to work together to put in place the right policy frameworks and enabling environment, including financing structures and education systems, to enable the rapid scaling-up of innovative technologies and solutions that can advance sustainable and inclusive development in the Asia-Pacific region.

Dr. Victor K. Fung, Group Chairman of the Fung Group noted, “Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 will require massive efforts and huge investments in everything from infrastructure and renewable energy to social safety nets and environmentally friendly production processes. This will require strong collaboration between public and private sectors, to ensure the right policies and incentives are in place. As a financial and innovation hub, Hong Kong can play a vital role in creating new partnership models between public and private sectors.”

Mr. Paul Chan Mo-po, Financial Secretary, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China added that innovation and technology was the most powerful driver of the global economy in an increasingly globalised, technology-transforming world. He further underscored Hong Kong plans to establish two research clusters – one for healthcare technology, the other for artificial intelligence and robotics technologies. In closing the Forum, Mr. Lee George Lam, Chairman, Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company and incoming President of the ESCAP Sustainable Business Network Executive Council, stated the “organization of the Forum in Hong Kong this year achieved its objective to rally business support for improving access to two important means of implementation of the SDGs concentrated in Hong Kong, finance and technology”

As the main ESCAP forum discussing the role of business in sustainable development, the conclusions from the APBF will be shared with policymakers attending the 74th Commission session of ESCAP in Bangkok from 11 to 16 May 2018.

“This is the future, this is the way forward,” said Valerie Goode.

The London-based designer is talking ahead of her pop-up on the Isle Of Dogs, which is set to run at 39 Pepper Street from April 23-May 6 and is aimed at celebrating ethical and sustainable fashion.

The 39-year-old set up her womenswear label Kitty Ferreira four years ago, after becoming disillusioned with the world of fast fashion while working for an evening wear company in China.

The levels of pollution she witnessed in the country - which she said stung her eyes and gave the sky a yellow tinge - made her vow to never work in that part of the industry again.

“We live in a very capitalist system where it encourages you to forget where that garment has come from or what animal that piece of meat is,” said the Lewisham resident.

“People are saying children don’t know what an actual cow looks like anymore – it’s very scary and demonstrates the way we live is abnormal.

“Being ethical and sustainable is a more normal and natural way to live and without it necessarily encroaching on your lifestyle is perfectly possible.

“This store needs to show people this.

“You can find some really nice, high-end made garments as well as affordable garments, and have a mixture of occasion wear and casual wear and everything in between, from homeware to skincare.”

Alongside Kitty Ferreira, which uses cruelty-free silk and toxin-free dyes, the pop-up is set to showcase over 20 UK-based fashion and lifestyle brands, all with a clean, green leaning.

Exhibitors include Bourgeoise Boheme, vegan footwear harnessing fabrics derived from pineapple skin; Lucia Loves, an organic hair and skincare brand spearheaded by a 15-year-old entrepreneur; An Original Leroy, which utilises waste fabrics from previous cuts and Quemamu Mosaic offering upcycled ceramic artwork.

An in-house seamstress will be offering a repair, mend and alterations service throughout the fortnight.

The pop-up will also play host to a number of talks and events, including a question and answer panel and clothes swapping event on Tuesday, April 24, the five year anniversary of the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh where more than 1,000 workers died.

“There’s a well known quote that fashion is the second most polluting industry behind oil and gas,” said Valerie.

“It’s a globalised industry, garments pass through so many hands across the world.

As well as promoting environmental and social change, Valerie hopes her work will dispel the myths that surround responsible fashion.

She said: “Especially in the 1960s and 1970s when ethical became quite prominent, there was this vision of what it meant which was tree hugging, not buying anything and just living in fields and huts.

“Being realistic, people do live in a city, I love living in a city, but I’m also very mindful and appreciative of the conveniences that I have on my doorstep and the effects of them.

“The younger generation especially don’t want to have this idea that being conscious of other people’s welfare across the world means that you have to have ugly looking clothing and you can’t use makeup, for example.

“There’s the need to look fashionable but to also know that the brand is being mindful of the environment and human impact.”

The report titled, ‘The Weight of Cities: Resource Requirements of Future Urbanization,’ encourages cities to optimally use their resources to avoid risks associated with overburdening the agriculture, energy, industry and transport sectors. It calls for a new strategy to address 21st century urbanization, contends that transitioning towards low-carbon, resource-efficient and socially just cities is critical for advancing the SDGs and the New Urban Agenda (NUA), and outlines recommendations to this end. Noting that most consumption and production is already happening in cities, the report highlights its contribution to SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), among others.

Over the next 30 years, 2.4 billion people are likely to move to urban areas, and, by 2050, 66% of the global population will live in cities.

The publication notes that, over the next 30 years, 2.4 billion people are likely to move to urban areas, and, by 2050, 66% of the global population will live in cities. The report cautions that urban areas will use approximately 90 billion tonnes of natural resources annually by 2050 if cities are not built and designed differently.

Pointing to future challenges, including the expansion of existing cities and construction of new ones, the report finds that: resources should be a central policy concern; long-term historic urban sprawl threatens to increase urban land use, putting agricultural land and food supplies at risk; and increased resource efficiency in cities could significantly reduce energy use, emissions, and metals, land and water use by 36 to 54%.

The report introduces the concept of “urban metabolism” or flow of resources through a city. It suggests: adopting a circular rather than linear approach in managing natural resource movement in and out of cities; designing cities for people rather than cars; enabling the poor to access the opportunities in cities; and preventing uncontrolled urban sprawl. The report further recommends establishing innovative governance models that encourage creativity, such as “entrepreneurial urban governance,” where both the State and broader coalitions of urban stakeholders play a role, and “living labs.” Other recommendations include: planning cities to ensure compact growth, better connectivity, and livable, mixed-use and socially mixed neighborhoods; designing cities to include resource-efficient urban components, such as car sharing, electric vehicle charging point networks and cycle paths; and developing infrastructure that enables cross-sector efficiency, such as using waste heat from industry in district energy systems.

The report was released during the 9th Global Forum on Urban Resilience and Adaptation, which met from 26-28 April 2018, in Bonn, Germany. A summary for policymakers was released in February during the 9th session the World Urban Forum (WUF).

Launched by UN Environment in 2007, the International Resource Panel aims to build and share the necessary knowledge to improve resource use, and move away from overconsumption, waste and ecological harm towards a more sustainable future.

100,https://ssir.org/articles/entry/delivering_sustainable_urban_logistics,"Wed, 23 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Stanford Social Innovation Review,Delivering Sustainable Urban Logistics,"The growth of e-commerce and the expectation of immediate delivery is transforming how we buy everyday goods. We have become accustomed to getting what we want, when and where we want it. Thus, the logistics of moving goods around—namely warehousing, transportation, and delivery—are becoming some of the most critical development challenges for rapidly growing cities around the world.

And cities are only getting more crowded: The United Nations estimates that two-thirds of the world’s population will live in urban areas by 2050. Congestion, smog, and noise are getting worse. To help mitigate these problems, some cities are introducing regulations that require new models of transport, such as pedestrian-only or reduced-emissions zones, which can create implications for how people get around and how goods are delivered.

Why Purpose? Why Now? When companies take the lead in driving social and environmental change, they position themselves to build deeper bonds, expand their consumer base, and enlist others to amplify their brand message. FOLLOW THIS SERIES SIGN UP You'll get email alerts when there is new content in this series.

For example, London is working on goals to reduce congestion and pollution in its urban center, including instituting ultra-low emissions zones for all vehicles by 2019 and zero-emissions zones by 2025. These congestion-pricing programs charge a fee to the most-polluting vehicles when they enter the city during commuting and business hours. In New York City, where trucks and commercial vehicles account for the vast majority of freight movement into and within the city’s five boroughs, the city has trialed the concept of off-hours delivery, in which goods are delivered in the evening or early morning hours rather than during the business day, in an effort to reduce daytime congestion and decrease emissions associated with excessive idling.

Such programs require careful forethought and implementation. Mexico City introduced “hoy no circula” (no drive days), whereby the last digit of a license plate determined which day a vehicle could be operated in the city. People began buying additional vehicles to increase their transportation options, which over time resulted in a 13 percent rise in carbon monoxide levels, while having little impact on alleviating congestion, according to a Cal State University, Los Angeles, study.

But while many cities have focused on personal transportation and mass transit solutions in order to move people more efficiently and safely around an urban grid, much less attention has been paid to the role of logistics in supporting a better quality of life in urban areas.

The road to sustainable urban logistics

In 2017, UPS and GreenBiz conducted research to better understand the perceptions and challenges related to city logistics, and to uncover solutions and strategies that can contribute to a more environmentally sustainable urban center. Nearly two-thirds of research respondents felt there was insufficient collaboration across sectors, and 72 percent noted that businesses should work closely with city officials to identify and address urban environmental and social challenges.

I couldn’t agree more. The economies of scale that UPS brings to the table can accelerate the development and adoption of new approaches, but only if we work with a wide range of stakeholders. Here are a few examples of how we are partnering with city officials, vehicle manufacturers, and research institutions to ignite a new conversation about urban mobility and create innovative logistics solutions.

Partnerships with purpose

In 2012, we collaborated with the city of Hamburg to rethink package delivery in the city’s urban center. Hamburg’s city center is lined with narrow streets, which hampers modern delivery demands. Working with the city and local retailer association, we developed an innovative solution that replaced our large delivery vehicles with a smaller city-friendly fleet. Packages for the day’s deliveries are loaded into a storage container, which is delivered to the city center early in the morning. UPS drivers deliver packages from the container throughout the city center and in pedestrian-only zones by foot or by using electrically assisted tricycles designed to navigate narrow streets. What started as a pilot project is now scaling across other cities in Europe, most recently in Dublin and Munich. We are testing similar last-mile solutions in US cities as well, such as eBikes in Pittsburgh and Fort Lauderdale.

UPS loads the day’s packages in a centrally located container, then delivers them around Hamburg by foot or electrically assisted bicycle.

UPS has a long history with electric vehicles, having introduced them into our fleet in the 1930s. Electric vehicle technology plays an important role in our urban logistics efforts, as it provides a solution with zero tailpipe emissions. We’re collaborating with our supplier, Workhorse Group, to deploy electric delivery vehicles that are comparable in acquisition cost to conventional gasoline- or diesel-powered trucks—an industry first that removes a barrier to large-scale adoption. These new vehicles will need recharging, so in 2017 we joined a consortium in the United Kingdom to develop smart-grid technology that enables simultaneous recharging of an entire fleet of electric vehicles. If feasible, this technology will eliminate the need for expensive upgrades to the power grid.

We are also working with academic partners to research and engineer last-mile and “final 50 feet” solutions that allow us to test new technologies and help city officials inform municipal policies. Our partnership with the University of Washington’s Urban Freight Lab has led to a new understanding of delivery barriers and the impact of the built environment on city congestion. Similarly, a UPS-led summer studio class with Georgetown University and the Washington DC Department of Transportation utilized a collaborative approach to data sharing and applied research.

Collaborating on a path forward

An important lesson I’ve learned along the way is that developing new solutions to urban congestion, noise, and pollution is as much about partnership as it is about innovation. While there is no silver-bullet solution that will work in every city scenario, we’ve uncovered useful takeaways that can be applied to new projects in other cities.

Often, the early solution to solving congestion issues is to drive less. But city-dwellers want reliable access to goods, which reinforces the importance of e-commerce delivery into their neighborhoods. Instead, let’s shift the conversation to how we can drive smarter, using alternative vehicles and convenient package pick-up locations.

A blend of innovative technology and policy is essential. Big data applications, Internet of Things, and emerging technology advances can enable better urban mobility, but political action by local officials is equally important.

As with any city planning effort, developing mutually beneficial and sustainable e-commerce solutions requires engagement from all stakeholders. At UPS, we’ll continue to work with city officials, suppliers, academic institutions, and nonprofit partners to test new solutions, scale what works, and learn from what doesn’t.","The road to sustainable urban logisticsIn 2017, UPS and GreenBiz conducted research to better understand the perceptions and challenges related to city logistics, and to uncover solutions and strategies that can contribute to a more environmentally sustainable urban center.

Local involvement, perceived fairness and information sharing, according to new research from Lund University in Sweden.

The researchers studied two cases, one in Samsø (Denmark) and one in Feldheim (Germany) of successful implementation of low-carbon energy systems. Samsø is the world's first 100% renewable energy-powered island, and has been labelled as one of the most inspiring examples of a sustainable energy community. Feldheim was the first energy self-sufficient settlement in Germany, with community-owned electricity and heating grids that are wholly supplied by local renewable energy. The village is portrayed as an energy transition model for small communities, and an example of the successful integration of a community energy system.

The implementation of low-carbon energy systems is crucial for the transition to sustainable cities and communities. In spite of that, there is often opposition from the public when it comes to planning and implementation.

In a new study recently published in the Journal of Applied Energy, researchers from Lund University studied which factors play a role in the transition to low-carbon energy systems and how communities and decision makers deal with conflicts during the transition.

The researchers found that the key to achieving these two successful transitions was the involvement of the local population, and the opportunity to be involved in the decision-making process. The researchers also found indications that a fair, transparent and open process might be more important than the distribution of project benefits.

""We found that intensive information and consultation processes were critical to overcome social, technical and economic barriers to implementation. We also found it was important for the communities to find fair solutions for those who were burdened with either negative or positive effects,"" says Henner Busch, researcher at The Department of Human Geography and one of the authors of the study.

The study highlights what policy makers, project developers and practitioners need to take into account during the planning and implementation phases. This specifically provides valuable insights into how low-carbon energy transitions can be effectively managed, and how communities can respond to the challenge of energy transitions.

""Perceived fairness by those affected by the change is pivotal to increasing the perceived legitimacy of transition outcomes. If this is done correctly, even contested projects can be realised. This includes that stakeholders find the space to discuss and disagree. Communication channels and information sharing are therefore of prime importance,"" concludes another author, Professor Luis Mundaca, from the International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics.","What makes for a successful transition to a low-carbon energy system?

Thirty-three-year old Mark Zuckerberg, the owner of Facebook has more than double the wealth of Nepal, a country of 29 million people! Shocked? Zuckerburg’s wealth was US $73 billion in 2017 as against Nepal’s GDP of US $29 billion (estimation) the same year. His current wealth stands at US $64 billion and he is the fifth-richest person in the world. This is the unequal world we live in today. In this context, what does sustainable development mean?

The fifth Asia Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development (APFSD), a regional preparatory event organized by UNESCAP (United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific) for the HLPF (High Level Political Forum) was held from March 28–30 in Bangkok, attended by representatives from about 47 governments in the region, UN agencies, the private sector, civil society and other institutions to discuss the regional perspective of the implementation of Agenda 2030 (Sustainable Development Goals) and review the performance of the cluster of goals.

The countries from the region who will present their Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) of Agenda 2030 this year in the HLPF to be held in New York City from July 9–18 are Bhutan, Lao PDR, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Australia and Kiribati. The theme of this year’s APFSD and HLPF is “Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies” and the goals under review are 6 (water and sanitation), 7 (energy), 11 (sustainable cities), 12 (sustainable production and consumption), 15 (life on land) and 17 (means of implementation).

The Forum appreciated the adoption of policies on energy efficiency and renewable energy towards fighting climate change. The civil society highlighted the rising violations of human rights across the region, particularly that of the poor and marginalised groups and the fast depletion of forests. For example, in the Philippines, the current President Rodrigo Duterte has begun an onslaught on the poor urban dwellers and children under the garb of a “War on Drugs”. This has claimed an estimated 12,000 lives, claims non-profit rights organisation, Human Rights Watch.

As for forest depletion, South East and South Asian countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and China are witnessing a massive depletion of forests. The Asia-Pacific region is the least-forested region if per capita availability of forest is considered which stands at about 0.2-hectare per-capita. Of late though, countries like China, India, Thailand and Vietnam are taking reforestation measures and increasing their forest cover.

The Forum raised concerns over the social and environmental fallout of the rising inequality and destructive industrial practices, which may retard the regional progress in achieving the goals. Various stakeholders emphasised the need to strengthen social infrastructure like social enterprises to address poverty and build resilience. Special attention is needed to be given “to the grass-roots and marginalised constituencies including populations living in urban slums and unliveable areas.”

The region faces serious water scarcity with the lowest per capita availability of water in the world. Therefore, incentivising water management, harvesting various sources such as rainwater and policies towards eliminating water pollution have been stressed upon.

The proceedings at APFSD seemed fairly inclusive, with enough space for discussion and inputs from civil society. There was emerging regional solidarity for the Asia-Pacific region from the Forum meeting. However, the national governments apparently have developed a sense of complacency. They presented a picture of “all is well” and that they are doing great! Realities, however, contrast their claims. The recently-released Asia-Pacific SDG Progress Report 2017 prepared by UNESCAP brings out the fact that the region is moving backward on reducing inequalities, on promoting peaceful societies and accessing justice.

There is no effective mechanism within the APFSD or even in the HLPF for cross-verification of the claims made by the governments. For example, Rajiv Kumar, the vice-chairman of NITI Aayog from India narrated the efficacy of the Aadhaar initiative in successful delivery of welfare schemes and minimising leakage. However, in reality, the failure of the biometric-linked UID system has reportedly led to the occurrence of hunger-related deaths in states like Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka.

It is necessary to link the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism with the VNR to integrate human rights into the review of Agenda 2030. Mindless mining and displacement of poor communities should be drastically reduced. There is need to take special measures to reverse wealth accumulation at the top. As many participating members rightly stressed, “Responsible consumption and production policies should be integrated into core economic agendas and sectorial plans”.

Set on the banks of River Krishna, the new city of Amaravati will cover 217 square kilometres and is set to be one of the most sustainable cities in the world, according to Norman Foster's architecture firm.

""The design brings together our decades-long research into sustainable cities, incorporating the latest technologies that are currently being developed in India,"" said Norman Foster in a statement.

A governmental complex will run through the centre of the city, stretching 5.5 kilometeres long and 1 kilometre wide, with ribbon-like lakes weaving around tree-lined boulevards. The urban grid and central expanse of greenery are nods to both New York's Central Park and Edwin Lutyen's designs for Delhi.

Over 60 per cent of this core area will be occupied by greenery or water, with cycle paths, water taxis and routes for electric cars providing green transport options. Shaded streets and squares have been designed to encourage people to walk.

In this mixed-use quarter, 13 plazas will represent the 13 state districts. Amaravati itself was created when the state boundaries between Andhra Pradesh and the newly formed Telangana state were redrawn.

Surrounded by a freshwater lake at the centre of this ""green spine"", the legislative assembly building will be crowned by 250-metre-high conical roof, above a rippling overhanging canopy that will provide shade and allow cool breezes to move through the building.

Square in plan, the public entry will be to the south and the ministerial entrance to the west. The assembly chamber for ministerial debates will be place on the southwest corner, which is considered the most auspicious according to Vaastu principles.

An assembly chamber will be on the southwest corner and a council hall on the northeast. At the centre will sit a courtyard-like void accessible to the public for most of the year, with a spiralling ramp leading to a cultural and a viewing gallery over the debate chamber.

Located off the central axis, the high court complex will have a stepped roof reminiscent of ancient Indian stupas. Overhanging roofs will provide shade and natural ventilation.

The plan of the building will alternate concentric layers of rooms and circulation spaces, like the layout of a traditional temple.

More publicly accessible parts, such as the administrative office and lower courts are arranged on the outer edges, with more private spaces including the Chief Justice's court to be found at the centre. A courtyard and roof garden will bring greenery to this inner sanctum.

104,https://qrius.com/why-ceos-need-to-become-sustainable-development-activists/,"Wed, 02 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Qrius,Why CEOs need to become sustainable development activists,"By Clarissa Watson Clarissa Watson is Head of Marketing, Alto Analytics. As the world becomes increasingly politically polarized and some governments abandon sustainable initiatives, like US President Donald Trump’s announcementto pull out of the Paris Agreement in 2017, consumers are now looking towards CEOs and their companies to spearhead sustainability.

During the last quarter of 2017, our company, Alto Data Analytics, which specializes in public opinion analysis using big data and AI, conducted an analysis of digital opinions to understand what sustainability means to the American public. The analysis focused on the main challenges consumers expect CEOs to confront, as well which companies are currently setting the bar in sustainable practices. Alto Data Analytics collected 72 million data points from 3.2 million comments and 1.7 million interactions created by 1.3 million authorsacross Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, forums, blogs, news and other digital sources in English and Spanish.

Authors focus attention on 5 key themes

We identified emerging narratives by connecting the topics authors discussed simultaneously and with a high frequency, as part of their spontaneous digital conversations. We spotted five key emerging narratives and themes of public interest: climate change, renewable energies, zero waste, environmental impact by consumption and UN sustainable development goals. Climate Change is top of mind, capturing 39% of the conversation, along with another 33 adjacent themes.

The interconnection of the key themes revealed adjacent narratives such as gender, hunger, sustainable cities, the circular economy and how blockchain technology is impacting the environment. As the data visualization shows, zero waste is closely connected with the discussion around sustainable cities, the circular economy, sustainable investing and how blockchain is related to renewable energies in the context of technological impact.

Tech companies are shaping conversations around sustainability

By analysing the digital footprint of authors, visual representations show how their voices cluster in distinct communities and which authors have more influence. Authors are represented as nodes (i.e. profiles) of consumers, political organizations and brands.

The network visualization below connects the 758,040 most active authors through their 1,663,078 interactions in the form of re-tweets and replies within the public debate on sustainability. Our data shows that the conversation on sustainability is highly polarized. The blue community shows a tendency of nodes to cluster around politicized themes, driven by politicians and celebrity campaigning. This community represents 60.3% of all authors, mostly focused on Trump, Bernie Sanders and the Flint, Michigan, clean water crisis. The second community, shown in yellow and smaller in size, represents 19.9% of authors who focus on a non-political debate, including those from the private sector, around the key 5 themes previously identified.

The analysis shows how some of the most influential nodes in the non-politicized community are consumer brands, with tech companies leading the way. By analysing which brands and initiatives are most mentioned in relation to sustainable practices, we discovered six key areas of consumer interest: Renewable Energies, Zero Waste, Sustainable Production, Save the Ocean, Protect the Forest and Clean the Rivers.

Consumers’ minds are being shaped primarily by tech companies investing in renewable energies directly connected to their businesses and the idea of the circular economy. Tesla, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, General Electric, Apple, Intel and Sony are among the top-mentioned brands related to sustainable practices.

Qualitative research also uncovered that consumers highly value CEOs who publicly endorse their company’s sustainability plans and actively join the digital debate. Initiatives that received high visibility in our analysis were Tesla’s use of solar panels and batteries to restore electricity at San Juan’s children’s hospital after Hurricane Maria and Pepsi’s zero-waste strategy with programs to educate and encourage students to recycle. Consumers are turning to CEOs in search of leaders that not only provide long-term commitments, but leaders who push their brands to catalyse consumers and other brands in new and collaborative ways. The top example from our research was Coca-Cola’s “Clean Coast Week” in Ireland, which had a strong digital echo in the US. Coca-Cola raised awareness of the importance of protecting our coastlines, encouraged more coastal clean-ups around the country and facilitated, through digital media, the recruitment of volunteers to clean their local beaches.

What makes an activist CEO?

Our research shows that companies in the tech sector are already leading sustainability – through renewable energies and zero-waste models of production – and are shaping consumers’ minds on how technology companies approach sustainability. Forty-two percent of the 80 most influential company profiles were from the tech sector and three out of the five top companies ranked by public opinion to be contributing the most to sustainability were tech companies: Amazon, Microsoft and Google.

Consumers expect companies to publicly lead the debate with both short-term and present strategies that deliver with long-term commitment. As demonstrated in the case of Starbucks, consumers pay attention to follow-through and highly value tangible initiatives catalysing consumer and other brands’ actions.

CEOs must actively join the public discussion. Consumers expect CEOs to prioritize sustainability in operating their businesses, as our analysis shows. Consumers need role models and leaders especially when public opinion expresses disappointment that some governments are not prepared to make tangible commitments. There is a clear opportunity for CEOs to take responsibility by joining and leading the public debate on sustainability. This article has been previously published on World Economic Forum.

Asia's Buddhists Should Step Forward to Pave the Way to Sustainable Development

Viewpoint by Kalinga Seneviratne*

SINGAPORE (IDN) – Buddhists across Asia are going to temples, bathing the baby Buddha, giving food to monks, lighting lamps and offering incense sticks accompanied by chanting paying homage to the Buddha on Vesak day, May 29 this year. While keeping with these traditions is important, Asia's Buddhists are letting go a great opportunity to shape the global development path in an ecologically friendly, compassionate and a sustainable manner.

As the centre of gravity of the world’s economy shifts to Asia, Buddhism – which has shaped Asian civilizations for over 2000 years – has much to offer in guiding Asia's development path. Buddhist philosophy has a rich reservoir of ideas on living sufficiently and comfortably without exploiting nature and people, ideas that anyone can adopt irrespective of your religious affiliations, as the mindfulness fad in the West shows. Mindfulness itself is rooted in the age-old Buddhist meditation practice of 'Vipassana Bhavana'.

Often, I find it sad, when I hear young Asians – whose ancestors for generations have been Buddhist – saying proudly ""we are free thinkers"", and refuse to identify as Buddhists. I have often explained to them that Buddhists indeed are “free thinkers” – as reflected in Buddha’s sermon to Kalama on free inquiry – and they are essentially atheists – as Buddhists don’t accept a dependency on a creator God. This makes it possible to adopt Buddhist ideas without converting to a religion.

However, this liberalism has also created problems, such as in the Mindfulness craze in the West, where in order to “secularize” mindfulness, westerners have taken out the spiritual aspects of the teaching such as the development of compassion and loving kindness.

Thai Buddhist social critic Sulak Sivaraksa is critical of the way the West has appropriated a Buddhist practice. “It will be a wonderful thing to practice; for some, it will bring wonderful benefits (but) to seek mindfulness exclusively has the potential to evolve into something unwholesome, something negative,” argues Sivaraksa in a recently published book on mindful communication for sustainable development.

Pointing out that CEOs of many big global corporations have been sent for mindfulness training, he warns: “When building up empires, taking up this meditation practice without the ethics (wisdom) will not see his mind changing for the better (of humankind) or becoming benevolent, more compassionate, more wise.”

The foundation of Buddhist ethics is in what is called the three poisons – greed, hatred and delusion. To eliminate suffering in the world, Sivaraksa says we need to understand these poisons and mindfulness training needs to guide you to this – to eliminate what he calls the “structural violence” of our economic systems. These include the exploitation of the poor and the environment; issues of climatic change and environmental sustainability.

If we look at the results of the ‘Arab Spring’, it is a good example of how the three poisons have taken the better of humanity. A greed for resources (oil and gas) has led to a widespread manifestation of hatred from all sides, who were initially fed a delusion of freedom and democracy, by parties, that were merely interested in grabbing the resources of the region for themselves. This also reflects the structural violence of the global economic system that is creating conflict rather than cooperation.

In the past two years, I was involved with a project at Chulalongkorn University in Thailand, which was originally funded by UNESCO, to development of curriculum to introduce mindful communication methodology into journalism training programs in Asia. We have developed curriculum where we promote a concept called “human-centric journalism” and in the economic and development reporting we introduce ‘sufficiency economics’ principles.

In economic reporting curriculum, we have used the concepts enshrined in the Buddhist ‘Four Noble Truths’, on understanding suffering (dissatisfaction), its causes and manifestations, cessation or extinction of suffering, and the path leading to the cessation of suffering.

This is a path of investigative journalism we promote, where the journalist is not just a watchdog, but an advocate or facilitator for finding solutions – to map a sustainable development path sans the structural violence of the current economic system. This also leads us to ‘sufficiency economics’, a concept the late Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej promoted at the height of the Thai economic meltdown in 1997 and has been recently revived by the military led government. The concept emphasizes community development that strengthens the community to the self-supporting level.

This concept has been adopted by Bhutan, where they have rejected the GDP-based method of measuring progress, and they have adopted the ‘Gross National Happiness’ (GNH) concept based on the ‘sufficiency economics’ principles. In 2015, at the Climate Change Conference, the UN adopted Bhutan’s call for a holistic approach to development, a move endorsed by 68 countries. Now, a UN panel is looking at ways how this model can be replicated across the globe.

The current methods of journalism we teach – borrowed from the West - are too adversarial and promote conflict rather than cooperation and wellbeing of humanity. We may need to call the new mindful journalist a communicator – rather than a journalist – one, who could use a variety of digital communication tools to analyse, report and advocate for sustainable development.

If Asia is to give leadership to such a sustainable development movement and shape the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, funds need to be mobilized, especially from within the Buddhist communities. This is where rich Buddhist temples, individuals and foundations could help. Rather than spend millions on building huge Buddha statues and grand temples – there are enough of them across Asia – Buddhists need to fund media networks and training programs that promote these Buddhist concepts.

106,https://sustainablebrands.com/read/marketing-and-comms/why-should-anyone-trust-your-brand,"Thu, 03 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Sustainable Brands,Why Should Anyone Trust Your Brand?,"Which brands do you really care about? Is there one you simply couldn’t do without? It’s a question that we rarely ask — so prevalent and dominant are companies and brands in our everyday lives. But while we’re dependent on the products and services that enable our modern existence, do we really care who makes them?

The history of consumer culture is littered with once-dominant consumer brands that were replaced by newer, more relevant offerings. Today, in the Internet age, the shelf life of major brands is shorter than ever before. Consider powerful brands such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram: None of these existed 15 years ago. Would you like to bet they will be around 10 years from now?

Why should anyone have faith in your brand? That’s a question every company should be asking itself right now. That’s because, on top of the competitive pressures all companies are feeling in this digital age, they increasingly find themselves affected by the crisis of trust that is impacting and undermining every part of global society.

Social media sits at the heart of this erosion in confidence. Time and time again over the last 15 or so years, social media-connected communities and platforms have called out companies and brands about faulty products, rotten or cynical customer services and arrogant governance. Yet, even as social media has helped give people a clearer, more informed view of the world around them, it has also been manipulated to confuse and distort people’s sense of reality.

How then can companies win back the trust of the public and society so they can ensure they don’t disappear like so many brands in the past?

That is the subject of my new book, Trust Inc: How Business Gains Respect in a Social Media Age. It draws on 15 years’ experience writing and consulting about the growth of social media and the development of sustainability in business. My conclusion is that the only possible way companies can stay relevant is by demonstrating to consumers and the general public that they can help meet and solve the social and environmental challenges of our age.

Climate change. Resource scarcity. Racial and gender inequality. The rush to the cities. Mindboggling technological change. Companies find themselves on the front line facing these mega challenges, and they already know that how they respond to them will directly affect how they flourish or perish in the near future.

Here’s the good news for those companies committed to sustainability: Consumers care just as much about these issues as you do. Indeed, the actions of concerned (and social media-connected) consumers already are having an impact. They are prompting fast-food companies to change their menus. They are pushing household and personal goods manufacturers to use non-toxic components in cleaning products. And they are holding apparel makers to account over working conditions in their factories and those of their suppliers.

All of these issues sit at the heart of sustainability in business and influence people’s buying decisions. It’s just when real people talk about them, they don’t use the language of corporate sustainability.

At the heart of any company’s attempt to win society’s trust is transparent sustainability communication. As I document in the book through more than 100 brand examples and interviews with major figures in corporate sustainability and communication, companies will win back that trust by embracing the following practices:

Collaboration with communities

Radical transparency about sourcing, working practices and supply chain

Empowerment and education both inside and outside the organization

Real leadership that places long-term value over short-term returns

Inspiring behavior change to build a sustainable consumer market

By committing to tackling the world’s greatest challenges, and by demonstrating the work they are doing through authentic communication and marketing, companies can prove their value to society, rebuild the trust in business that has been lost and ensure they are building a brand that people will care about. Those that don’t will not only fail society — they will fail as a business.","Social media sits at the heart of this erosion in confidence.

107,https://ssir.org/articles/entry/teaming_with_suppliers_for_sustainable_food,"Tue, 08 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Stanford Social Innovation Review,Teaming with Suppliers for Sustainable Food,"(Photo courtesy of iStock)

For decades, consumers, investors, government bodies, and others have voiced growing concerns about energy, waste, water, deforestation, and a host of social issues related to food production and distribution—across issue areas as wide-ranging as child labor and farm practices. Many companies involved in food production and selling have responded to the call. Seven of the 10 largest global consumer goods companies have set carbon emissions reduction goals that include reductions in other parts of their supply chains, and eight have ambitious sustainability targets that require engaging significantly with upstream suppliers.

But achieving those high sustainability targets is proving much harder than anticipated. Many of these companies now face a barrier. Retailers and consumer goods companies may have adapted their own production and logistics to lower-resource requirements, for example, and they want to do more. Yet they have discovered they cannot reach higher sustainability objectives without deep collaboration with their agricultural suppliers, who often set less-aggressive goals (see chart below). The primary reason: Suppliers fully understand the on-the-ground challenges. They are much closer to where system-wide operating practice changes must actually happen.

As a result, consumer goods companies and retailers that have worked solely within their own four walls, with only their immediate suppliers (or those that have just flatly asked suppliers to assure them their products and practices are sustainable), now realize they need to get deeper into the details of how those products are produced (see chart below).

Indeed, true progress is hard to achieve. Only two of the seven consumer goods companies with “scope 3” emissions targets (a category of indirect emissions that include both upstream and downstream emissions) reported reductions from purchased goods and services in 2016, with an average reduction of just 1 percent, according to the global environmental platform CDP. Furthermore, even as they tackle climate-related concerns, companies still face other issues. For example, even those with reputations for leading progress on sustainability may still struggle with child- and forced-labor issues.

The situation is highly complex, raising tough economic and regulatory concerns with no easy answers. For example, there is no “most sustainable beef,” as interventions for one given benefit may worsen other issues. Grazing and grass feeding may seem the more natural and sustainable way to feed cattle. But when cows digest grass, they let out more methane, a harmful greenhouse gas many times worse than carbon dioxide, than when they eat grain-based feed in a pen. Getting to the heart of such issues requires that we go beyond making boardroom decisions, and zero in on the numerous micro-decisions and trade-offs people make on farms and throughout the value chain.

Expectations by consumers, investors, NGOs, and other stakeholders are steadily rising. So is the burden of proof. Companies now need third-party auditing in supply chains and detailed transparent reporting on progress, as well as the barriers within large global food systems. Companies may feel that the path to sustainability has become more frustrating and unattainable. Yet, despite these obstacles, there is a promising way forward. Some companies are managing to make real strides in improving upstream agricultural sustainability. These companies’ leaders have learned they cannot simply push the sustainability imperative onto their suppliers and raw material producers. Instead, they take a wider view, engaging a broad set of stakeholders in their efforts, and embracing the complexity and collaboration required.

While this research has focused on consumer goods and retail companies with upstream agricultural supply chains, the lessons we’ve gleaned apply across industries, including apparel, mining, and forestry. Organizations that take a three-step approach can make a meaningful difference in their upstream supply chain:

Step 1: Map out sustainability challenges throughout the supply chain and identify who should address them.

Companies may struggle to take the first step in the long journey toward sustainability, worrying about the prospects of bearing additional costs. While they generally understand the magnitude of the social and environmental challenges, many business leaders don’t actually understand those issues with enough nuance or clarity in terms of what it will actually take to achieve their sustainability goals. Those furthest ahead on the sustainability journey invest in mapping and quantifying issues throughout the value chain. For example, a mapping and quantifying analysis would help retailers understand that while pole-and-line-fished tuna addresses some sustainability concerns when compared with methods such as purse seine (net caught), the required human and capital resources prevent it from scaling.

Companies also may think they are moving in the right direction by responding to sustainability demands raised by NGOs or other groups, but without examining the impact and feasibility of those demands on the entire system, they risk spinning their wheels on actions that are ineffective or have unintended consequences. Mapping and quantifying requires that companies analyze a range of issues and decisions to determine their impact and magnitude, and then evaluate how those issues and decisions relate to one another.

Before taking any actions, companies should develop a deep understanding of the industry structure, economics, and drivers of profits, as well as the broad incentives that promote sustainability and those that could be deterrents. New insights that emerge through this process will enable companies to identify leverage points, have the necessary conversations with suppliers, undertake only the most effective interventions, and chart out the next steps needed to change the system, rather than just take initiatives within their own value chain. They can work with regulators on regulations or with competitors to create new standards, for example.

In the animal protein industry, our mapping and quantifying process revealed that producing and transporting feed accounts for 60 to 80 percent of the emissions in pork and poultry. Feed inputs like corn and rice tend to have a higher carbon footprint than other options like soybeans. This basic knowledge enables producers to make different choices about feed composition to improve sustainability. For example, it led Cargill Meats Europe to focus on improving the sustainability of feed in its supply chain, working with and building on tools such as FeedPrint, which calculates the carbon footprint of feed blends and helps the company incorporate sustainability trade-offs into decision-making.

It is important to remember that while initiatives that emerge from a supply chain analysis are often a sustainability win, the path to success is rarely quick and easy. The process of mapping the value chain of each commodity takes significant time and resources, but ultimately, this kind of long-term investment can help companies ensure their sustainability initiatives pay off.

Step 2: Develop a portfolio of actions with systemic reach

Mapping and analyzing supply chain complexities helps clarify the nature and magnitude of the actions required to reach a sustainability goal. Doing so also generally shows that individual actions are not sufficient. Instead, the most successful companies create a portfolio of actions that creates a virtuous cycle and motivates diverse stakeholders to change the system. They acknowledge that transforming their upstream value chain requires that they put their own house in order to build the credibility they need to ask for industry changes.

That said, companies do not need to wait until their supply chain is 100 percent sustainable before offering sustainable products. Introducing a sustainable variation of a product can help a company determine which sustainability characteristics to highlight and how to present those claims, as well as what price is optimal. It can also create incentives to pay current suppliers more if they deploy sustainable practices, or enable a company to form relationships with, and learn from, new suppliers—all while developing a portfolio of actions for a broader range of products. There are also financial benefits. A single sustainable variation of a product could provide proof points to persuade the business to do more. Indeed, ethical and sustainable food segments are growing much faster than the overall market. In the United Kingdom, sales of ethical food and beverages grew by 9.7 percent in 2015 compared with 2.1 percent for the rest of the market. This is true within individual corporations as well. For example, Unilever’s “Sustainable Living” brands are growing 50 percent faster than the rest of the company’s portfolio.

The experience of agribusiness company Olam’s line of spices illustrates the multiple benefits companies can achieve by working directly with upstream suppliers on targeted sustainability programs. Olam acquired a spice processing facility in Cochin, India, and in August 2011 received a $120 million loan to enhance employee safety, quality control, food safety, and capacity. A large part of its efforts focused not only on the 400 workers employed in the processing facility, but also on the 900 small-scale farmers supplying the factory. Olam deployed a 52-member team to train farmers in areas including labor practices, land use, pesticide and fertilizer requirements, and crop-drying techniques. Two and a half years after the acquisition, farmers had cut costs by 15 percent, reduced pesticide use by 30 percent, and increased outputs by 10 percent.

Companies should also collaborate with other participants in the value chain, including competitors, processors, producers, and NGOs. Joining forces goes a long way toward ensuring that pursuing sustainability puts no company at a competitive advantage. In addition, working with a variety of stakeholders can enable the development of new solutions. Precompetitive collaborations that work on knowledge or standards development, with outputs far from commercialization, can create more power to influence suppliers. It also eliminates the situation in which a company has no incentive to cooperate and where a company that moves first bears more cost than those that follow. The nature and scale of the most-effective collaborative approach depends on the outcome of the mapping efforts in step one.

Trustea, a sustainable tea program in India, was formed to foster collaboration among the country’s largest tea producers and retail brands, including Hindustan Unilever and Tata Global Beverages, which together have a 57 percent market share. It launched a certification program to improve the social and economic conditions of the tea industry while protecting the environment. The initiative led to sustainability gains for companies like Unilever, a founding member, which now acquires 75 percent of its tea from sustainable sources—up from 36 percent in 2013.

In many situations, philanthropy and advocacy help increase the effectiveness of a portfolio of actions. Working with NGOs or government regulators is a way to align incentives to address more-challenging parts of the system, and create effective partnerships that will help push for and implement change. The Walmart Foundation, for example, has awarded grants related to supply chain sustainability, funding areas such as the development of a comprehensive set of data-and-analytics tools for assessing the nature and prevalence of forced labor and trafficking in the Thai seafood sector. The foundation’s grant to Issara Institute is helping elevate workers’ voices though education and access to hotlines. These types of innovations benefit not only workers but also retailers and consumers, who can feel more confident in the integrity of the workforce. Such advances address a part of the system where it is hard to make change happen.

Step 3: Build on successes—and repeat.

The first wave of actions always looks hard, but companies are learning that when it comes to sustainability efforts, success breeds success. The best companies rely on quick wins to create momentum for further change, establishing systems for celebrating those achievements and building on them. They transfer what they learn, improving one supply chain to inform changes to other supply chains, markets, and business units. For example, Olam found that the tools and frameworks it developed to track, monitor, and communicate sustainability attributes of spice products are applicable across its diversified portfolio of commodities.

The German-based retailer Metro started a consultancy called Star Farm to help Chinese producers fulfill international quality standards and implement traceability in the food supply chain. The success of this initiative solidified Metro’s reputation for food safety in China. Based on that, the wholesaler has adapted the program for Pakistan, where it likewise met with great success.

Once companies get started, they generally see a positive shift in the relationship with their customers and consumers, who value purchasing from companies they trust. The momentum also helps boost employee engagement and facilitates buy-in from internal stakeholders such as the C-suite and board.

It isn’t easy to make major gains in pursuit of supply-chain sustainability. If companies have learned anything from their efforts, it is that it takes a systematic approach and a host of engaged participants, all aligned and working together toward the same end goal of positive system changes. No single company can get there alone.","For example, there is no “most sustainable beef,” as interventions for one given benefit may worsen other issues.

As the industry is disrupted by more privatized options such as AirBnb and VRBO, Bloomberg reports that technology has become “top of mind for hotels,” as they seek to compete by providing amenities and new services for luxury vacationers and business travelers. Many hotels are adopting technology that enables more engaging, customized and immersive guest experience; these systems have become a Trojan Horse for the hotel industry to embrace higher-tech sustainability practices.

Conservation is being increasingly embraced in hospitality, and it’s proving to be important to guests; a survey by Bouteco shows that “the youngest and oldest among us care most about sustainability when choosing a hotel.”

At the lowest level, eco-friendly practices in hotels show up as placards in the rooms asking guests to shower quickly and reuse their towels. But for years, few other resource-saving practices were visible to guests and often only implemented by hotels doing so for economic or brand mission reasons. New technology is constantly enabling hotels to further reduce and manage their consumption while also engaging guests to be active participants. Previously, hotels would have to choose between sustainability or guest amenity initiatives with regards to technology, because the systems had separate function, cost, implementation and ROI.

SB'18 Vancouver!But this is changing. As technologies such as voice assistants and streaming music services become ubiquitous in the home, hotels are responding by embracing voice control, mobile entry, entertainment access and more. Now, hospitality technology is more sophisticated, where one platform can house all of the benefits that the hotel seeks, including energy management. Many of these features can be added without hugely impacting design and implementation costs as it had in previous years, and these combined costs and different layers of ROI from one system to the next, provide more initiatives for hotels to add smart lighting and HVAC systems to their technological upgrades.

These systems combine through a building-wide automation system tailored for each hotel to make each light, TV, HVAC system and more in the rooms and public spaces manageable from a single interface. The systems are becoming increasingly popular, and they can be found in the world’s top hotels, such as 1 Hotel, Kimpton Seafire, and Baccarat — with many more are being added to the list each year.

Automation systems reduce energy usage in hotels through building-wide device coordination, using the aggregated information to throttle back central systems while turning off devices in unoccupied rooms. Automation facilitates efficiency more so than a simple programmable thermostat by providing centralized control for the staff to manage the temperature in all of the rooms and other common areas in the building, while also using occupancy patterns to preheat and precool various spaces.

Energy usage can also be mitigated through automated correspondence with the hotel’s PMS and locking systems system. Upon check-in, the in-room lighting, temperature and TV will turn on to a “Welcome” scene when guests arrive at their room. After checkout, lights turn off, drapes close, and the HVAC system goes to a minimal operating level without any staff action.

Sensors can also be used to refine this process by triggering automated device activation based on guest occupancy or other room conditions. A motion detector placed next to the door will turn on the lights and air conditioning only when a guest enters the room. More advanced systems shut the air when a sensor detects an open window or lanai door. Sensors can also be used to provide data that can be used for room service, housekeeping and maintenance — ex: tracking humidity levels in more tropical locations. The ability to perform proactive maintenance ensures that all room technology is functioning properly, providing assurance a guest will not have to change rooms after check-in.

These systems are tailored to each building and hotel brand, and they can be leveraged to achieve better building energy usage over time. A backend system can even show hotel operators the energy usage of each device in each room — to analyze the way the hotel operates to find new ways to mitigate energy usage from devices — while continuing to provide the other benefits sought by the hotel, such as technology for guest satisfaction and/or operational efficiency.

An example of this is the 1 Hotel brand, which touts itself as “an eco-friendly hotel” and “a natural oasis.” Two of its New York locations feature building-wide automation systems that provide device-level data for guestroom energy usage, so it can be tracked and reduced over time. Inside the rooms, the guests benefit from an automated experience: One button press will activate multiple features with lighting set to different levels, all curated by a lighting designer. Lighting control adds a better level of convenience for the guest as they don’t have to become familiar with fixtures and interfaces during a short stay. From an energy perspective, a “Master*-*off” helps to ensure that no lights are left on when a guest leaves the room for the day. This is quickly becoming energy code in cities such as New York and Los Angeles.

Improved energy management in hotels will continue to grow as technologies continue to converge and as greater adoption is supported by other features that hotels are using to attract guests.","Many hotels are adopting technology that enables more engaging, customized and immersive guest experience; these systems have become a Trojan Horse for the hotel industry to embrace higher-tech sustainability practices.
Now, hospitality technology is more sophisticated, where one platform can house all of the benefits that the hotel seeks, including energy management.
Energy usage can also be mitigated through automated correspondence with the hotel’s PMS and locking systems system.
The ability to perform proactive maintenance ensures that all room technology is functioning properly, providing assurance a guest will not have to change rooms after check-in.
These systems are tailored to each building and hotel brand, and they can be leveraged to achieve better building energy usage over time."

But, as a recent sustainable tourism roundtable demonstrated, it’s still a major challenge, especially in the hotel space.

New consumer research from Hilton, however, may further the industry’s efforts to promote more sustainable tourism.

Earlier this month, the global hospitality company surveyed 71,937 guests who stayed at Hilton properties around the world to ask them for their thoughts on the impact of social, environmental, and ethical issues on their buying and booking behavior.

The survey found that the majority of respondents (62 percent) would switch to a different brand if a brand they typically bought from was in the news for unethical purposes — even if it were more expensive.

A majority of consumers (56 percent) will also intentionally buy a product that’s fair trade, organic, local, or has not been tested on animals.

While the majority (67 percent) of respondents do not seek out information on a hotel brand’s environmental and social efforts before booking, 20 percent said that they do and 13 percent said they would actively seek out this information, but only if it is easily accessible.

The results didn’t surprise sustainable tourism and development scholars Megan Epler Wood, director of Harvard’s International Sustainable Tourism Initiative, or John Spengler, professor of environmental health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

“This information is in keeping with other corporate studies,” Epler Wood noted. And while the data is encouraging, she noted that there’s a big difference between intent and action.

“New data … shows that travelers are showing increasing interest in sustainability, especially with the younger generations,” she added. “But interest and action are frequently not easily compared via surveys on consumers.”

And that, in turn, is impacting travel brands, many of which are finding that sustainability is “not in the top five selection criteria for travel to date.”

Even if travelers do care about sustainability, it’s often challenging for them to know how to measure or identify it when they are deciding to book their ravel. She noted, for example, that “aviation is a primary emitter of greenhouse gas emissions” and that the importance of sewage treatment and solid waste management in cities and hotels is crucial for sustainability.

However, as Spengler pointed out, this data from Hilton — along with the company’s new 2030 sustainability goals — does signify “a shift in the conversation about sustainability.”

“It’s not only right to change, but important to change,” Spengler said. “They see a market advantage to that. This is going to make a difference.”

Hilton’s New Goals

In addition to publishing this survey data, Hilton is also committing itself to a stringent corporate responsibility strategy, called Travel With Purpose, that aligns with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals and established carbon emission targets that have been approved by Science Based Targets Initiative.

“The truth is we did this survey to support our underlying beliefs,” Hilton CEO Christopher Nassetta told Skift. “I spend a lot of time with customers of all sorts — leisure and business travelers, group customers — and certainly, every one of those conversations suggests that, increasingly, this is a part of the filtration system that customers have when they decide who they want to stay with.”

Nassetta, who has for many years spoken out about a talent crisis in hospitality, was recently named chairman of the World Travel & Tourism Council in April.

By 2030, Hilton hopes to cut its environmental footprint by half and double its social impact. Some of the ways in which the company hopes to be more sustainable include reducing carbon emissions by 61 percent; reducing water usage by 50 percent; reducing energy usage, the use of plastic straws and water bottles; recycling soap; and sustainably sourcing meat, produce, seafood, and cotton.

Nassetta said that cutting Hilton’s environmental impact by half isn’t just about saving money for the company, but that any money saved will go back into making its hotels even better.

And with regard to social impact, Hilton has plans to double the company’s investment in youth opportunity programs, and will partner with the International Youth Foundation on Passport to Success to attract young talent. The company is also doubling the money it spends with local, small, women, LGBTQ-, and minority-owned suppliers. It will also offer more sustainable event options for groups that hold their gatherings at Hilton properties.

“We are a global business built from 5,300 local businesses,” Nassetta said. “We know the impact we’re already having, and doubling it just means we will have that much more.” He said that working with more minority- and women-owned businesses “worthy for us to be involved in” and that it will yield “tremendously positive return on investment that’s well worth making on everybody’s behalf,” hotel owners included.

Spengler said that Hilton’s commitment to “travel with purpose” is “good for Hilton, but it is also good for people, places and planet.” He added, “Breaking from the shibboleths of conventional hoteliers, Hilton can become the standard barrier for progressive change.”

The Travel Industry Embraces an Evolving Understanding of Sustainability

Hilton’s new goals also reflect the industry’s broader understanding about what it really means to be sustainable, especially in an industry that, by some standards, has been slow to respond. Or in Spengler’s view, an industry that all too often equated “managing efficiencies with being sustainable.”

“Travel is an industry that’s the connective tissue — it’s what connects the world,” Susan McPherson, founder and CEO of McPherson Strategies, a corporate responsibility and social impact consultancy, said. McPherson said that, increasingly, the “private sector is now becoming the moral authority,” and in travel, a change is emerging.

“To me, the travel sector has been lacking in making big audacious goals front and center, equivalent to those of Unilver and other huge corporations. We haven’t seen them from big travel players, so I’m thrilled to see Hilton make a big statement about this and to back up that statement with a bunch of data.”

Hilton isn’t alone in exploring sustainability initiatives. Many other hospitality companies, including Marriott, Hyatt, AccorHotels, and IHG, have also implemented programs to be more sustainable, as well as to attract more young talent and offer more employment opportunities to locals who live in the communities where they have hotels.

And even prior to its new objectives, Hilton was taking steps to be more sustainable by reducing its carbon emissions and waste by 30 percent, and its water consumption by 20 percent since 2008, saving more than a $1 billion in the process.

But there are inherent challenges that many brands have yet to overcome, and the hotel industry is no different.

“The hotel industry is structured in such a way that makes it difficult to achieve what is required to achieve sustainability,” Epler Wood noted. She said it’s especially difficult for brands working with franchisees because “Franchising often leaves owners and hotel management companies without full responsibility for meeting sustainability requirements.”

Still, Hilton’s goals and its research point to “the beginning of a transformation in the hospitality industry,” said Spengler, and hopefully to the larger travel industry.

“Recognizing that hot polluted cities, flooded coastlines, outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases, depleted ecosystems, and a poor, sick underclass of people is not good for business in the 21st century, Hilton and others now must be ‘leaders with purpose,'” Spengler said.","New consumer research from Hilton, however, may further the industry’s efforts to promote more sustainable tourism.

Many of our most beloved fresh food crops – almonds, apples, avocados, mangoes, blueberries, and pumpkins, to name a few –depend on pollinators to bear fruit. In addition, pollinators contribute to crops used for livestock forage, biofuels, and fibers. Beyond agriculture, pollinators are essential to our natural ecosystems, responsible for the reproduction of over 85 percent of the world’s flowering plants. As such, pollination services are central to the conversation about global food production, nutritional security, and our overall wellbeing.

Yet, as vital as they are, pollinators like bees are under threat worldwide from habitat loss, pesticide use, and diseases. Without their vital pollination services, it is believed that ecosystem processes would suffer. It’s no wonder the decline of these tiny invertebrates has gained so much attention worldwide – as of 2017, they even have a day named after them: World Bee Day, which falls on May 20th. This Earth Day, we’d like to call attention to the very important issue of pollinator health in the context of sustainable agriculture, and highlight some of the organizations and companies working to protect these pollinators and our food supply.

What are pollinators? Technically speaking, pollinators refer not just to bees, but a variety of species– including beetles, butterflies, flies, moths, bats, and birds – that support the diversity of plant life by transfer of pollen from one plant to another. Native pollinators have a symbiotic relationship with flowering plants, and are essential for overall ecosystem health and biodiversity. These pollinator populations are vulnerable when the ecosystems within which they thrive are threatened.

In this article, we focus on bees – and in particular honey bees, Apis mellifera - because they are the world’s most important pollinator for commercial agriculture production. Their role is especially important for large-scale crops that rely on land devoted solely to one crop (i.e., monoculture systems). Bee populations, both wild and managed, are at risk due to a variety of factors.

What is going on? Land use change, pesticide use, large-scale monoculture and climate change are all threats to bee populations. As farm fields have become larger (and less diverse) and cities continue to grow, natural habitats and forage areas are shrinking, which pollinator populations need to survive. Additionally, the use of certain agricultural chemicals has increased since the 1990s, most notably neonicotinoids that have been shown to be toxic to beneficial insects. Following widespread use of neonicotinoids in agriculture, commercial beekeepers started reporting unusually high colony loss rates. This problem affected the number of hives available for crop pollination in the U.S., and prompted many supply chain actors and nonprofits to take a closer look at what was going on. A similar phenomenon was also happening in Europe.

Taking Action. Recognizing the multi-faceted issue, numerous organizations and companies have made the conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of pollinators a priority. It has become an important concern for international groups such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) through its Global Action on Pollination Services for Sustainable Agriculture, federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) (see their joint report here), and a growing number of state legislatures. These groups have mobilized resources and taken action around research, implementation of best practices, and enhancing awareness. This momentum led the FAO and some 52 countries to support the declaration of May 20th as the World Bee Day.

Non-profits like the U.S.-based Xerces Society and Pollinator Partnership have also played critical roles in publishing research, policy advocacy, and educating land managers to restore landscapes for the benefit of invertebrates. In addition, the private sector has taken a stance – for instance, by creating coalitions to work together, and developing voluntary standards (e.g., Bee Better Certified) and other tools to improve pollinator health. For example, the Kellogg Company serves on the Honey Bee Health Coalition and supports cost-share programs for farmers looking to implement conservation practices on their farms to facilitate healthy pollinator populations. Whole Foods Market donates to Xerces Society and has a pollinator friendly labeling program for almond products, which means that almonds are sourced from orchards that take extra measures to create biodiverse landscapes. As a third-party certifier and standards developer, SCS is also playing a role, described below.

What can land managers do? Much research has been conducted on the topic of protecting pollinators in agricultural landscapes. The good news is that such efforts are consistent with key sustainable agriculture tenets, offering an opportunity to not only benefit the environment, but to enhance crop yields, quality, and resilience of cropping systems. Management practices related to restoring and enhancing conservation areas to promote pollinator health have been identified and tested by agricultural producers. For example, increasing the amount of natural land cover in and surrounding fields – even small patches of natural habitat – can help to establish and maintain diverse pollinator communities. Other strategies include allowing some fields to go fallow, or reducing tillage so that flowers can reestablish. Reducing impacts of pesticides known to be toxic to invertebrates is paramount to pollinator protection. Best practices include avoiding application of pesticides toxic to pollinators during crop bloom, and mitigating pesticide drift. In addition, areas prone to contain pollinators and nesting sites should be identified and carefully protected from contamination.

The role of third-party certification. Third-party certification plays an important role in communicating producer efforts in environmental responsibility, including land conservation and pollinator protection. For example, SCS Global Services’ Sustainably Grown® certification for agricultural crops, and its Veriflora® certification for cut flowers and potted plants, address pollinator health through a holistic sustainable agriculture framework, validating best practices through annual audits, including mitigation of risks associated with pesticide drift and maintenance of suitable buffer areas to minimize impacts on pollinators and wildlife. Land managers must also demonstrate knowledge of endangered species and habitats in or surrounding farms, and consider the risks associated with pesticide use, including adherence to the program’s pesticide management requirements and prohibited pesticide lists.

Conclusion. Because of the essential role honey bees and other pollinators play in agriculture, and in the larger environment, protection of pollinators is a cause upon which stakeholders across the spectrum of opinion can agree. At a time when so many issues are divisive, it is reassuring to bear witness to this unity of purpose.

111,https://civileats.com/2018/05/07/i-am-the-daughter-of-a-conventional-farmer-and-a-sustainable-ag-advocate/,"Mon, 07 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Civil Eats,I am the Daughter of a Conventional Farmer—and a Sustainable Ag Advocate,"To most people, my dad is a headline, a stereotype. He’s a 62-year old conventional corn and soy farmer living in Iowa, a Trump supporter, and—some assume—a backward, ignorant white man. But to me, he’s a kind and reliable man trying to make the best decisions for his family and himself.

I grew up on a nine-mile stretch of road east of Des Moines, in a town called Mitchellville. My parents shuttled me back and forth on this road between our fourth-generation farm and my grandparents’ farm. Like most farms, we required off-farm income and my mom worked in Des Moines for DuPont Pioneer and later Wells Fargo for our health insurance.

I watched my parents’ ecstasy through high corn and soy markets and despair through low markets. My parents were married at the beginning of the 1980s farm crisis, and while I grew up during many of the “good years,” the fear of the next crisis still hovers over my family.

Over the years, my status as a Midwest farmer’s daughter has been met with a variety of reactions. In liberal, urban spaces, I am asked incessant questions about pesticides and meat consumption by the same people who are concerned about subsidies and how much money they think my father makes while “polluting the earth.” On the coasts, the most common reaction is, “I’m sorry.”

In rural and suburban Midwestern spaces folks are often curious about how many acres my father works. Does he have any livestock? “I don’t really know,” I was coached to respond. An exact number of acres might translate into an understanding of net worth, which my father told me was none of their business. And in his eyes, the less I understood about farming, the easier it would be for me to fit into the professional world.

My father encouraged me to pursue a stable career in corporate America. Instead, I started working for conservation and agriculture nonprofits. I wanted to understand the food system from as many perspectives as possible. At first, my views on the best ways to change the food system came directly from the coastal food movement: support local, organic farmers; transition conventional acres to organic; save the bees.

All good things, but when I tried to talk to my father about them I was always asked about the financial viability of these operations. As my work took me deeper into the food system and I worked with a wide range of farmers, I realized that many of the farmers doing the “better” farming were also struggling.

After seeing how broken the system is, I have been compelled to want to change it. Like many of the other farmer’s daughters I’ve met, my experiences drive me to want to create a new and better vision for the food system. But that doesn’t mean I think we should leave farmers like my father behind.

Those struggles include a high percentage of rural households reliant on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), lack of medical care and closing hospitals, and increasing rates of opioid addiction. All of these issues need to be addressed, and as a farmer’s daughter, I know that they are symptoms of a larger wound that stems from living at the mercy of a highly consolidated, volatile set of markets that prioritize profit over people.

As more farmland changes hands and family farmers are pushed off the land, farmer’s daughters could play a critical role in shaping our food system and shifting the larger narrative about what we should prioritize within that system. As we’ve watched our families and neighbors struggle and thrive, we’ve seen the holes in the food system and have the tools and transformational stories to bridge the divisive conversation happening today.

A Unique Role

The farmer’s daughters I’ve known were less likely to be encouraged to stay on the farm than their male counterparts. And for that reason, they’ve been more likely to pursue educational and career paths that bring them to urban communities. Once they are integrated into the urban or corporate world, they often find themselves trying to explain rural life to people who have never stepped foot on a farm. And many of them find themselves drawn to return.

“I was never asked to drive a tractor or help with the real farm chores. I was never taught about the business side of things, no one ever asked if I saw myself farming,” says Wendy Johnson, an Iowa organic farmer who returned to her family’s land after spending over a decade working as a photo stylist in Minnesota, California, Japan, and Brazil. Over the past 8 years, she has rented land from her family and has slowly worked toward her vision of farming with more sustainable practices, including more cover crops, continuous no-till, and small-scale livestock production.

“I saw the farm as fun and pretty,” says Johnson of her childhood. She has learned the business side as an adult, and has learned many of the hard realities of farming. But re-creating the beautiful life she caught a glimpse of as a child has always been part of what drives her.

For the first couple of years, Johnson shared stories about what she was doing with friends in California, friends who had never been on a farm. And she found herself trying to bridge two very different worlds.

And although she had a good relationship with her family, Johnson has also been met with the kind of hard realities other farmer’s daughters have faced. Most of today’s farm communities are aging and young people are often scarce. In many places, women who take up farming might not be treated with the respect as their male counterparts. And if their brothers or cousins have taken over the family farm, these women might be less likely to have access to land.

Some, like Lauren Rudersdorf from Brodhead, Wisconsin, have to strike out on their own. Like me, she watched her parents attach their personal wealth to market fluctuations on their diversified family farm. Her parents worked off-farm for the majority of their income and by the time they gave up the farm they resented the life they had built.","Over the years, my status as a Midwest farmer’s daughter has been met with a variety of reactions.

The following Q&A has been edited for clarity, flow, and length.

GREEN MATTERS: How would you describe sustainable tourism (and its importance) to a person you meet on the street?

ZURAB POLOLIKASHVILI: Sustainable tourism is the type of tourism that makes a low impact on the local environment and culture while contributing to generating income and employment for the local population.

GM: What is the role of the UNWTO in helping to advance the cause of sustainable tourism?

ZP: As the leading international organization in the field of tourism, the UNWTO promotes tourism as a driver of economic growth, inclusive development, and environmental sustainability, and offers leadership and support to the sector in advancing knowledge and tourism policies worldwide.

We promote sustainable and responsible policies and practices, which include sustainable consumption and production, effective resource management, biodiversity conservation, and environment protection. This involves working with governments to ensure that sustainability is the pillar of their policies, advancing the measurement of tourism’s impact with initiatives such as the UNWTO Network of Tourism Observatories, and engaging with the private sector to promote the benefits of sustainability in three areas – economic, social and environmental.

The UNWTO, together with its partners, also works to mainstream sustainable tourism in policy discussions and multinational development, and economic and peace agendas.

GM: Many tourism professionals see sustainable tourism as necessary for the survival of the planet. Can sustainable tourism really make a difference?

ZP: While tourism brings socioeconomic development and inclusive growth to millions of people worldwide, its mismanaged expansion can put fragile environments at risk, deplete natural resources, and disrupt the social structures and cultural values of host communities – the very elements that tourism greatly depends on.

Sustainability is therefore tourism's fundamental challenge and should be regarded as a comprehensive condition of the sector as a whole. This entails meeting the rising demands of today's tourists while safeguarding the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of destinations and communities worldwide.

Tourism's growth, on the one hand, and sustainability on the other are not at odds; the situation is far from a zero-sum game. With ethical management, proper organization, and the use of innovative technology, the growth of the sector can lead to better protection and redirect revenues into the preservation of the environment.

Community engagement, communication, congestion management, adequate planning, and product diversification are key aspects in dealing with so-called “over-tourism”.

In affected destinations we need to build awareness among communities of tourism’s benefits, improve use of big data to measure and manage the impact of tourists and tourist flows, and promote the development of tourism experiences that engage and benefit communities directly.

The challenge goes beyond tourism, considering fast-growing urbanization worldwide. Therefore, cities must rethink the governance of growing populations, including tourism planning and development, regulation, and management. We are no longer just visitors – in today's globalized world, we are all fellow stewards of this planet and its people.

GM: Last year was the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development. How do you think it helped advance the cause of sustainable tourism?

ZP: Throughout 2017, many campaigns, activities, and events were held all around the world in the framework of the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development with the aim to raise awareness of the positive impact of tourism and the ways in which responsible travel can contribute to sustainable development. These included advancing tools and mechanisms to monitor and measure tourism impacts, and the exchange of good practices to promote and maximize the contribution of the sector in sustainable development.

Sustainability is a long-term objective that needs to be built every day. The Year was a good opportunity to have tourism in the global agenda, but our work continues as we advance in making tourism a contributor to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.

GM: Tell us more about sustainable tourism and the SDGs.

ZP: The past decades have witnessed extraordinary growth for tourism. In spite of the multiple challenges – ranging from man-made crises to natural disasters and economic shocks – tourism, although vulnerable, has proven resilient and always bounced back. Tourism today represents 10 percent of the world’s GDP, 1 in 10 jobs, and 7 percent of global exports. Against this backdrop, tourism is ideally positioned to contribute to the SDGs.

The future brings enormous opportunities for tourism to take center stage in the political and economic agenda, seeking recognition for its contribution to economic growth and development. It also brings added challenges and responsibilities to take the lead in mitigating its potential negative impacts on host communities and the environment. To make this possible we need to make tourism a priority in national policy decisions, foster competitive and responsible business models and practices, and increase cooperation between the public and private sectors.

GM: How is technology, especially green technology, playing a positive role in fostering sustainable tourism?

ZP: Many advances are being made in green technology. The UNWTO has also been advancing in this area. One example is the neZEH (Nearly Zero-Energy Hotels) project, which assesses the energy performance of hotels and proposes measures to improve efficiency and increase the use of renewable energy sources toward nearly zero consumption.

This project is supported by the UNWTO and the European Commission in the framework of the Intelligent Energy Europe Programme and aims to support European hotels comply with nearly Zero-Energy Buildings (nZEB) regulations, which all EU Member States are required to meet by 2020. An nZEB-level building must demonstrate high levels of energy performance. The nearly zero, or very low, amount of energy required should be generated to a very significant extent by renewable energy sources, including those produced on site or nearby.

This is but one example of how green technology is making a relevant entry into the sector.

GM: How have changes in agriculture — such as the growing appreciation for organic/traditional farming, farm-to-table restaurants, heirloom ingredients and reduced food waste — been helping to further sustainable tourism?

ZP: Achieving sustainable economic growth and development requires urgent reduction of our ecological footprint by changing the way we produce and consume goods and resources, including food.

Agriculture is essential in the social value chain and hence in tourism. The efficient management of our shared natural resources and the way we dispose of toxic waste and pollutants are important targets in achieving responsible consumption and production.

Encouraging industries, businesses, and consumers to recycle and reduce waste is equally important, as is supporting developing countries to move toward more sustainable patterns of consumption by 2030.

GM: With specific regard to overtourism, the number of international tourist arrivals has been growing for years to more than 1.2 billion in 2016. Is this a good thing? Can the earth handle it?

ZP: It is essential to manage tourist destinations through synergistic and coordinated efforts by governments, at different levels and in different capacities; civil society living in the host tourism communities; and the business sector connected with the operation of the tourism system.

With 1.8 billion international tourists expected by 2030, the socio-economic impact needs to be translated into opportunities for inclusive economic growth, more and better jobs, wealth distribution, and overall opportunities to better know and respect each other.

This will only happen if we place sustainability at the core of tourism development.

GM: How can individuals (whether travelers or small-scale tourism entrepreneurs) also lend a hand?

ZP: The nature of tourism demand and supply is changing. We must meet the expectations of tourists looking simultaneously for new experiences and quality service. The technological revolution – its combination of interconnection and information – is putting consumers in the driver’s seat and imposing their criteria.

Each tourist can make a difference through their choices and behavior. Better-informed consumers have stopped adapting to existing offerings and instead are demanding products that meet their specific tastes and needs.

GM: What sustainable home practices do you think travelers should bring with them when they travel?

ZP: Sustainable consumer behavior starts at home. Our habits when we travel must be consistent with how we behave back home. We see an increasing reflection of these attitudes when people travel, as they are becoming increasingly demanding and aware of the problems tourism can sometimes entail, such as degradation of the environment, alteration of cultural identities, and traditional means of life.","On January 1, 2018, Mr. Zurab Pololikashvili took over as Secretary-General of the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), the United Nations agency responsible for promoting responsible, sustainable, and universally accessible tourism.

Our relationship with what we throw away is one of gluttony and neglect. According to the EPA, in 2014 the US generated 258 million tons of waste. This averages to almost one ton of waste produced per person every year, equivalent to each person throwing away close to the weight of one standard car of waste a year.

Although municipal services exist to process this waste – recycling, composting, combustion, and energy recovery – more than half of this waste ends up in landfills. We are producing almost three times more waste today than was produced in the US during the 1960s , and the volume of waste is only growing as the global population and resource consumption increases.

A common misconception about waste production is only considering what we can see, from coffee cups, food leftovers, to plastic bags. However there is significant unseen waste, from industrial to manufacturing processes, generated when products are created.

Pexel

Coffee, the second most popular drink in the world after water, generates just over half a million tons of coffee ground a year in the UK alone. Peer-reviewed research has estimated that 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic have been produced globally to date, more than a metric ton per person in the entire world. When you consider that it takes on average 22 gallons of water to produce one pound of plastic, the subsequent volume of water used and wastewater produced is hard to imagine. The waste problem in cities both seen and unseen is real.

Though where city governments are struggling to keep up with increasing rates of household and industrial waste, businesses and startups are beginning to identify opportunities to create economic value from repurposing this waste whilst doing good for the environment.

AEROPOWDER

AEROPOWDER is one of these startups based in London, cofounded in 2016 by millennial scientists, 2017 Forbes 30 under 30 social entrepreneurs, Dr. Ryan Robinson and Elena Dieckmann, who have developed an innovative way to convert feather waste from the poultry industry into valuable repurposed products.

In the EU alone, a shocking 3.1 million tons of feathers are produced each year. Disposing of this immense quantity of feathers remains problematic. Burning or burying them are not viable options, so instead they are taken by third-party organizations to be converted into a low-grade animal feed, which is costly and a poor use of waste resources.

After two years of prototyping a range of different potential products for waste feathers in their lab, AEROPOWDER has launched their first product line named ‘pluumo’, which is the first packaging material derived from surplus feathers. Designed to match the thermal performance of polystyrene, pluumo aims to enable more sustainable deliveries of food products.

AEROPOWDER

“We felt it best to work with what the feathers already were capable of and to keep ourselves from overly complicating things,” explains Dieckmann. “At first, we were looking at making lightweight composites materials, but soon realized that the natural insulating properties of feathers could have a number of useful applications.” The market has responded positively to this: The startup has already sold units to its first customers and continues to receive interest from a range of different industries.

AEROPOWDER’s core mission is much bigger than its own efforts. “It is not just feathers and packaging,” says Robinson. “It is amazing to see a look of honest surprise and curiosity when we explain what we do. We hope that AEROPOWDER, in turn, inspires others to think of the lesser known waste streams and strike up collaborations to see whether there are any unusual applications that can be found.”

This concept of finding ways to repurpose waste to lower demands on the natural environment is known as the ‘circular economy,’ and is already taking hold in public and private consciousness.

In the region where AEROPOWDER operates, the cost of waste for the food industry in the UK amounts to £5 billion every year. This is a market opportunity and incentivizes business and startups to create value from this waste. This is already starting to happen globally with 10% more companies invested in the circular economy from 2015 to 2017 because it is the right thing to do and generates financial payback.

So what?

Although there are circular economy solutions emerging, they are nascent and not able to completely deal with the increasing waste production problem. Efforts by individuals, communities, businesses and governments to reduce their waste production are needed more than ever to truly achieve a sustainable future. As individuals we can do our part – using less plastic bags, coffee cups, single-use utensils; buying only what we need; composting our food scraps; recycling and using water responsibility. Our individual actions in aggregate generate impact as a society.

We can use our awareness of the unseen waste problem to keep businesses and industries accountable for the waste they produce through our purchasing decisions, voices and dollars. Moreover, we can support businesses and startups, like AEROPOWDER, who are working on solutions to help us transition to a circular economy. With a collective effort, perhaps we can live in a zero-waste future where everything we produce has a purpose (or repurpose), and the next generation can live in a world better than how we leave it.","This averages to almost one ton of waste produced per person every year, equivalent to each person throwing away close to the weight of one standard car of waste a year.

Here, we catch up with Immotor.

Founded in 2016 by mophie CEO and co-founder Daniel Huang, Immotor is the manifestation of Huang’s dream “to redefine the intelligent personal vehicle space, while contributing to a more sustainable world for future generations.” The company seems poised to do just that, since the launch in late 2017 of the Immotor Go – a portable, foldable, high-performance light electric vehicle (LEV) fully integrated with users’ smartphones and powered by a patented “Super battery.”

While the Immotor Go itself is transforming personal transport, Immotor’s Battery-as-a-Service program for businesses could revolutionize delivery and public transit systems around the world. Immotor’s Chief Operating Officer Alex Nesic told us more.

Immotor began with electric scooters and bikes, so let's start there. What makes your LEVs such game-changing devices?

Alex Nesic: The Immotor GO was actually a proof of concept to show off our Super Battery technology, but the GO ended up being an innovative product in and of itself. The three main differentiators that set it apart are its 3-wheel stability; which allows for a much broader user base; the modular, TSA-compliant battery; and the IoT capabilities that provide a feature-rich experience. We saw a need for a device that served as a flexible tool to be used in a variety of circumstances, rather than a ‘cool tech’ gadget.

AN: First and foremost, the safety — it is housed in a hard aluminum alloy shell and passes the most rigorous safety standard tests, and is also rated IP65 from a weather-resistance standpoint. On the software side, it is our intelligent Battery Management System (BMS) that is also designed to provide a lot of safety and performance — things like an accelerometer to detect accidents, sensors to detect malfunctions and a variety of other data; the power interface being separate from the data interface, which enables us to require digital authentication between the battery and device before any power is given, and more.

What advantages do your LEVs have over more traditional forms of active transport?

AN: The most compelling advantage of LEVs in general is the enhanced user experience — LEVs essentially give users superpowers. The overall LEV experience makes active transport more appealing to users that might not consider non-electric versions because of geographic challenges, weather considerations or physical demands. Our LEVs in particular also offer the advantage of a smart, modular battery and our Batteries as a Service (BaaS) program, called eSwap.

Tell us a bit more about your Battery-as-a-Service program. Where is it currently available?

AN: eSwap is initially focused on enterprise customers — like shared mobility operators, delivery fleet, rental programs, and public transit programs. eSwap essentially eliminates all the hassles and potential liabilities of owning batteries for our B2B customers. They can subscribe to our eSwap program, which provides them with batteries; charging stations to recharge the batteries separately from the devices; and access to our backend cloud, which provides them with asset and customer metrics. Depending on project requirements, we can also deploy automated battery exchange stations, which operate like a vending machine for users to exchange their depleted batteries for new ones. We are currently live in six cities in China with our eSwap program, in support of food delivery services that use electric scooters. We are in negotiations with partners in the shared mobility and smart city space to deploy programs using our LEVs and eSwap system in the US, Europe and Middle East, as well.

Are there any other sustainable features of your LEVs and batteries (materials/construction/etc)? How do you handle the batteries at the end of their life?

AN: We are committed to using recyclable materials in the production of our LEVs and batteries. One of the main value propositions and sustainability benefits of our eSwap program is that we control the end of life of the batteries, removing that responsibility from our customers and also ensuring that they are properly managed at the end of life. Our batteries will actually benefit from an entire second life — once they reach their end of usable life for vehicles, they still retain approximately 80 percent of their capacity and can be used for power storage.

How do you see your LEVs and BaaS helping spur a modal shift?

AN: The electrification of micro mobility is well underway on both the enterprise and consumer sides. It is also clear that users truly enjoy the LEV experience. That being said, there are currently a lot of inefficiencies associated with LEV ownership and operation, most of them relating to batteries and charging. We see Immotor’s eSwap program as the catalyst for efficient adoption of multi-modal LEV adoption in cities. By tapping into existing user behavior that has grown accustomed to refueling their gas-powered vehicles in four minutes or less, we make the transition to LEVs much less painful.

What's next? Do you intend to expand to other products/services/forms of transport in the future?

AN: In the US, we are in discussions with a TNC to become their provider of LEVs and BaaS for their micro transit operations with an eye on pilot projects launching in late Q2 2018. We have also just signed an MOU with the Roads & Transportation Authority (RTA) of Dubai with the objective of solving their first-/last-mile issue within their public transit system — our GO Forza (the fleet version of the GO) will be used as an extension of the public transit system.

What can we expect to see from Immotor at SB’18 Vancouver?

AN: Reasonable shipping costs permitting, we hope to be able to bring a few of our LEVs and a battery-swapping exchange station to be able to showcase the ecosystem in person!","AN: The most compelling advantage of LEVs in general is the enhanced user experience — LEVs essentially give users superpowers.

In a night of glitz and glam, the 2018 Global Responsible Business Leadership Awards recognised leaders across the globe.

The Award were in conjunction with the 10th Asia Pacific CSR Forum, themed 'Unlocking the Business Potential in Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), organised by Asia Pacific CSR Council and Institute of Sustainability. The awards programme is supported by Office of The Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, Chamber of Socially Responsible Malaysia, Sino-European Industry Business Association and European Union Delegation to Malaysia. The awards programme strategic partners are Koperasi Usahawan Metropolitan Kuala Lumpur Berhad and MCM Max Capital Management Holding Ltd.

The aim of the awards is to promote the idea of Corporate Sustainability, and Corporate Responsibility as a Holistic approach for business development on a global scale, while at the same time, enhance the awareness for sustainable development within the business community and society.

The objective of the awards is to recognise leaders who had excelled in corporate sustainability, giving them a competitive leadership advantage.

Additionally, the awards recognise winners who serve to be benchmarks as exemplar of sustainable business practices to other organisations in accordance to SDGs.

Also, it creates a network of professionals and practitioners committed to furthering the sustainability agenda on a global scale.

There are a total 17 SDGs which in turn are built on the successes of the Millennium Development Goals while also including new areas such as climate change, economic inequality, innovation, sustainable consumption, and peace and justice, among others.

SDGs work in the spirit of partnership and pragmatism to make the right choices now to improve in a sustainable way for future generations. They provide clear guidelines and targets for all countries to adopt in accordance with their own priorities and the environmental challenges of the world at large.

There are total of five areas that the judges look at when it comes to determining the winner of the Awards.

The first materiality which determines if the applicant to the award has considered relevant sustainability factors. Next the panel of judges look at the stakeholder engagement which determines if the applicant has taken various stakeholder views and concerns into consideration.

Next, they will assess the economic performance of the company with regard to mitigating impacts as sustainability trends on a company's finance and contribution to local and national economy.

The last two items that fall under the purview of the panel is environmental and social. For the former, the judges look at the performance of the applicant with regard to resource use, while for the latter, they assess the performance with regard to labour management, human rights and impacts on society.

In a foreword message, Chris Daniel Wong, Co-Organising Chairman said: ""Our ambition is to grow our business while focusing on preserving the planet, progressing people and perpetuating participatory progress because we believe in better communities and a better future for everyone.""

Additionally, he adds that the organisers of the Award recognised that companies are at different stages in their sustainability journeys.

""Many already understand the importance of the SDGs and how their work relates to them. But others go further, by strategically aligning their sustainability work with the SDGs, thus addressing their own positive and negative impacts, while also promoting innovative thinking,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Roger Wong, the President of the Asia Pacific CSR Council said in a foreword that he believed that if all businesses were conducted in a globally responsible manner, a different could be made, thus creating a positive impact on the environment.

The event took place at the Sunway Pyramid Convention Centre, and was graced by His Royal Highness Tengku Idris Ibni Almarhum Sultan Abu Bakar, Price of Pahang, while the Head of Trade and Economic Relations from the European Union Delegation to Malaysia, Mr. Nicolas Dross was in attendance along with the others panel of judges, Tan Sri Dr. Hj. Mohd Shukor bin Hj. Mahfar, the former Director General of Inland Revenue of Malaysia and Matthias Gelber, the World Greenest Man.

Adding to the list of VIPs is Organising Chairman and Special Officer to Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia and the Home Minister of Malaysia, Rizmel Nazrin Dato' Abdul Malik.

In his foreword, Rizmel said that any kind of growth is meaningless without excellence and sustainability.

""The SDGs represent an internationally shared global agenda for sustainability looking forward to 2030. They address the most pressing challenges of our time, including climate change, resource depletion, poverty and social injustice.

""The SDGs call on everyone, including companies, to conduct self-examination and to take a proactive role through collaboration and innovation,"" he said.

He added that long-term business success also hinges on the realisation of the SDGs, we will need to transform the entire economic system, most notably cities, and mobility, energy and materials, food, land and water.

Designs that have the least frills are often the most efficient ones. Just ask Suraksha Acharya, founder of Midori Architects. The firm recently won two awards — Skyhive Skyscraper Challenge in Dubai and the Silver A Design Award in Italy — for its skyscraper design titled Aero Hive.

The design took three months to come to fruition. Besides the team of four from Midori, another Chennai-based firm and a Delhi-based firm also lent a hand. “The rendering was done by Vizis, Architectural Enhancer, Chennai and the parametric modelling by Rat[LAB] research in architecture and technology, New Delhi,” says Acharya.

The design is all about putting the immediate environment to good use, explains Acharya, “Aero Hive is a breathing entity. The breath of this building transpires through vertical diaphragms in the form of green sky atriums that behave as lungs, performing the intake of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide. This exchange is a way of natural ventilation and is the preferred option when attempting to deliver fresh air to any space due to its low energy requirements.”

She has plenty to say in support of her calling, “The expertise that architects bring to the table can have a significant impact on the financial bottom line of a project. For example, sustainable design features can significantly increase the value of a property. Another important driver of sustainability is resilience, referring to the ability of a building’s infrastructure to be self-sufficient enough to withstand storms and other violent natural occurrences. The new generation of skyscrapers are moving in a different and very green direction.”

Being energy-efficient is high priority. “By harnessing the local topography, climate, and vegetation, as well as cleverly manipulating a building’s orientation, we strive to create a comfortable indoor climate that reduces dependence on air-conditioning,” she says.

There are myriad ways of achieving this, says Acharya, adding that some of the best solutions can be found closer home. “Builders can realise zero costs from sustainable strategies. The evidence for this already exists in Asian markets. As we have demonstrated in our Aero hive project, tall buildings can employ natural ventilation as part of the design.”

A graduate of Anna University, and an alumnus of Sustainable Environmental Design programme at the Architectural Association, London, Acharya has always been driven towards sustainable architecture. “I have been fascinated with buildings ever since I started playing with my brother’s Lego sets as a child,” she says.","Just ask Suraksha Acharya, founder of Midori Architects.

JOINT NEWS RELEASE

Singapore’s Advanced Wastewater Treatment Technologies Wins Global Recognition

Novel treatment process a shining example for others, as it brings down energy use, saves land and reduces manpower reliance

2 May 2018 – PUB’s continuous R&D; and innovation efforts to improve the efficiency of its water treatment process and operations has earned itself a feather in its cap. Its wastewater treatment demonstration plant at Ulu Pandan, set up specially to test advanced used water treatment processes before full deployment in future, has captured global attention and won the Water/Wastewater Project of the Year Award at the 2018 Global Water Awards in Paris, France. This International Award recognises the most important achievements in the global water industry and acknowledges innovative technological advancements.

As Singapore reclaims, recycles and re-treats used water, PUB constantly seeks ways to maximise water efficiency and lower energy use in the whole process.

The Ulu Pandan wastewater treatment demonstration plant, which started operating in 2017, was jointly developed by PUB and the Black & Veatch + AECOM Joint Venture. The demonstration plant enables PUB to test and validate advanced wastewater treatment technologies, allowing it to mitigate any operating risks before incorporating the technologies at a larger scale, at the future Tuas WRP. The Tuas WRP is constructed as part of the Phase 2 Deep Tunnel Sewage System (DTSS) that will meet Singapore’s used water collection, treatment and disposal needs. When completed in 2025, Tuas WRP will be the largest membrane bioreactor (MBR) facility in the world, with a 30% more compact footprint compared to conventional plants.

Ulu Pandan Wastewater Treatment Demonstration Plant

The Ulu Pandan wastewater demonstration plant features a novel combination of treatment processes which include space-efficient inclined lamella[1] primary settling tanks and a membrane bioreactor (MBR)[2] system. These features shorten the process of wastewater treatment while also reducing energy usage and maximising biogas production (which can generate energy) as well as help reduce plant footprint. At the same time, the Ulu Pandan wastewater treatment demonstration plant also incorporates automation control to reduce manpower requirements. This 12,500m3/day (2.75 million imperial gallons per day) facility is currently housed at PUB’s Ulu Pandan Water Reclamation Plant.

These tested technologies will enable the future Tuas WRP to be more energy efficient – doubling the energy recovery while consuming lesser energy compared to conventional plants.

“R&D; is the key driver to Singapore achieving a robust management system across the entire water loop and PUB continues to innovate to increase the efficiency of water and wastewater treatment. The Ulu Pandan wastewater treatment demonstration plant has allowed us to validate and set new standards for wastewater treatment while fulfilling our need to bring down energy use, keep things compact in land-scarce Singapore and reduce reliance on manpower. The success of this demonstration plant will ensure that the future Tuas WRP and its integrated NEWater factory can contribute sustainably towards the goal of increasing Singapore’s overall water recycling rate,” said Harry Seah, Assistant Chief Executive (Future Systems and technology), PUB.

The Black & Veatch + AECOM Joint Venture serves as the program manager for Singapore’s Deep Tunnel Sewerage System Phase 2 project and the consultant for the Ulu Pandan wastewater demonstration plant.

“Singapore continues to be at the leading edge of innovation in the water industry. This award recognises the results of harnessing advances in digital water technology together with the latest advanced water treatment processes to realize operational, economic and environmental sustainability goals at the Ulu Pandan wastewater demonstration plant,” said Cindy Wallis-Lage, President of Black & Veatch’s Water Business.

“The BV-AECOM joint venture is proud to partner with PUB to continually set global standards in integrated water management that ensures sustainable high quality water for Singaporeans. This award is a milestone in our partnership with PUB, and we look forward to contribute further to new advances in Singapore’s water management efforts,” said Billy Wong, Regional Executive for Southeast Asia at AECOM.

Annex

About the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS)

A superhighway for used water management, the DTSS is a core water infrastructure which provides a cost-effective and sustainable solution to support Singapore’s continued growth and meet its long-term needs for used water collection, treatment, reclamation and disposal.

The DTSS uses deep tunnel sewers to convey used water entirely by gravity to centralised WRPs located at the coastal areas. The used water is then treated and further purified into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water called NEWater, with excess treated effluent discharged to the sea.

DTSS Phase 1, comprising the North and Spur Tunnels, the associated link sewers, the Changi WRP and outfall, was completed in 2008. A NEWater factory, located on the rooftop of the Changi WRP, was built in 2010 to facilitate large-scale water recycling.

The DTSS Phase 2 conveyance system comprises the South Tunnel which conveys domestic used water, the Industrial Tunnel for non-domestic used water and associated link sewers. Expected to complete by 2025, DTSS Phase 2 will extend the deep tunnel system to cover the western part of Singapore, including the downtown area and major upcoming developments such as Tengah Town and Jurong Lake District.

Under DTSS Phase 2, a NEWater factory to be integrated with the Tuas WRP will be built to facilitate water recycling, contributing to the goal of increasing NEWater supply from 40% to up to 55% of total water demand in the long term. Tuas WRP will also be co-located with NEA’s Integrated Waste Management Facility (IWMF), to harness potential synergies.

The completed DTSS will also streamline the used water network with three centralised collection and treatment points: Changi WRP in the east, Kranji WRP in the north and Tuas WRP in the west.

[1] Used in the initial stages of wastewater treatment, primary settling tanks separate the solids from liquid wastewater by allowing solids to settle to the bottom of these tanks. The settled solids, also known as sludge, will be removed for biogas generation while the liquid wastewater is then sent for secondary treatment. Lamella primary settling tanks uses inclined plates which increases the maximum efficient surface area for solids to settle on with the same tank space.

[2] MBR technology is used in the treatment of wastewater. A bioreactor houses naturally-occurring bacteria which break down waste products in wastewater, after which microfiltration/ ultrafiltration membranes – with fine pores invisible to the eye – filter the remaining impurities. MBR is a more efficient method as it optimises the wastewater treatment process, enabling wastewater to be treated using less steps and less space compared to conventional systems, and produces a higher quality treated effluent. The treated water is then used as feedwater for NEWater production or supplied to industries.","Ulu Pandan Wastewater Treatment Demonstration PlantThe Ulu Pandan wastewater demonstration plant features a novel combination of treatment processes which include space-efficient inclined lamella[1] primary settling tanks and a membrane bioreactor (MBR)[2] system.

The country’s Minister of Local Government and Rural Development, Kondwani Nankhumwa, made the call on Wednesday during the opening ceremony of a three-day international mayors’ meeting dubbed ‘Lilongwe International Mayors Forum’ which was held at Bingu Wa Mutharika International Convention Centre (BICC) in Lilongwe.

He said the urbanization rate across the world is increasing which is hindering sustainable development of the cities in many countries, hence the need for collaborative efforts among the mayors from across the world to also minimize the rate of urbanization.

According to Nankhumwa, urbanization rate in Malawi is at seven per cent per year which he said causes rapid movement of people from rural areas to urban places. He warned that if the rate of movement is not controlled now, it will not be controlled in future.

He further said during this year’s meeting, the mayors should focus on finding measures which would help to slow down the rate of urbanization in countries.

“During the forum, Mayors should at least address the issue of urbanization by coming up with strategies which can help to reduce the rate of people moving from rural settlements to urban settlements,” said Nankhumwa.

For Malawi, government is introducing rural growth centres across the country as a way to minimize migration of people from rural areas to towns.

The development of rural growth centres are aimed at making services which are usually found in towns, available at rural communities’ door step, hence the little need for them to move to towns in large numbers.

This year’s Mayors’ meeting is the second but the first of its kind to be convened in Africa. The first was held last year in Vientiane, Lao People’s Democratic Republic in Asia.

The meeting is being patronized by mayors from more than 50 countries including; Pakistan, Guyana, Syria, Marshall Island, Zambia, Jamaica, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Sierra Leone, Albania, Dominican Republic and Malawi.

During the meeting, mayors are expected to discuss how they can achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number 11 which stresses on inclusiveness, safety, resilience and sustainability of the world’s cities.

In her remarks, Resident Coordinator of the United Nations and Resident Representative of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)-Malawi, Maria Jose Torres Macho said the Mayors’ Forum is a dialogue stage for implementing sustainable developments across the world.

120,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/sdg-knowledge-weekly-measuring-progress-towards-sustainable-cities-and-communities/,"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: SDG Knowledge Weekly: Measuring Progress towards Sustainable Cities and Communities,"This week’s brief focuses on knowledge products around SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), which is one of six Goals being reviewed in depth at the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

At the city level, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) released its second annual report ranking the 100 largest (by population) metropolitan areas in the US by their progress on the SDGs. These cities are home to 66% of the country’s inhabitants, and in total, US urban areas hold over 85% of the domestic population. But they are also responsible for 80% of the country’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Jeffrey Sachs, SDSN Director, notes in the forward to the report that, despite federal politics being at a gridlock, progress can still be made at the local and state level. Titled, ‘Leave No US City Behind,’ the 2018 Cities SDG Index draws on a set of 44 indicators identified by SDSN.

The report finds that data constraints limit the breadth of the analysis, flagging maternal mortality as an example, where data on the issue were only available for seven of the top 100 metropolitan areas. The report also finds that even the best performing metropolitan area (San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, California) is only about two-thirds of the way to SDG achievement. Progress is particularly needed on SDG 10 (reduced inequality), as well as Goals 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero hunger), 3 (good health and well-being), 5 (gender equality), 7 (affordable and clean energy) and 13 (climate action). The authors note that, in addition to record rates of inequality, gun violence, substance addiction and student debt, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are “at unacceptable levels.” Not a single metropolitan area performs better than “poor” on SDG 13. An interview with SDSN’s Jessica Espey, who supported the analysis, is available on Fast Company.

The World Resources Institute (WRI) also takes on the issue of cities and climate change, in a blog outlining how national governments can help cities ramp up action. Like SDSN, the WRI authors flag limited urban data availability. The post highlights that one of the first steps to measuring cities’ GHGs is the establishment of an “emissions inventory” as part of a broader city climate action plan. However, the requisite financial and technical resources to set up and monitor such a plan are often too onerous for cities. The authors call on national governments to provide data to local officials and offer guidance on how to do so in a manner that is actionable at the city level. They cite examples from Denmark, Brazil and the US.

An example of such collaboration can be found in Winnipeg, Canada, where the ‘Peg’ community indicator system (CIS) was relaunched by the International Institute for Sustainable Development and United Way of Winnipeg, with its indicators of community well-being now linked with relevant SDGs. The CIS enables residents to assess the health of their community using data collected by a wide variety of stakeholders. Interlinked categories include basic needs (income, safety), economy (youth unemployment, educational attainment), and natural environment (air quality, water use), among others.

The Peg indicator platform helps users to identify – in many cases down to the neighborhood level – areas of progress as well as shortcomings.

Trends that can be identified in the data for 2017 are analyzed in a report titled, ‘Our City: A Peg Report on Sustainability.’ This fourth annual edition was released on 15 June 2018, and uses the Peg platform to demonstrate how Winnipeg measures up against the SDGs and targets. The report categorizes 66 indicators into environmental, social and economic pillars, then maps them to both the SDGs and the primary issue category to which they correspond (i.e. basic needs, natural environment). It notes whether there is a trend of improvement or worsening, delving into the measurements to identify specifically – in many cases down to the neighborhood level – where progress has been made and shortcomings can be improved.

International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Deputy Secretary-General Malcom Johnson writes in a guest article on the SDG Knowledge Hub that many cities are already using big data analytics to tackle development challenges and make progress towards SDG 11. He describes ITU’s role in building more sustainable cities, also outlining a partnership between ITU and the UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) called ‘United for Smart Sustainable Cities’ (U4SSC). Using key performance indicators (KPIs) developed by U4SSC (on physical infrastructure, equity and social inclusion, quality of life, and environmental sustainability), ITU helps cities use new technologies to shift towards resiliency and sustainability, including through the development of infrastructure that leverages new appliances’ ICT-based applications and services. A guest article by U4SSC Vice-Chair Paolo Gemma also outlines how ITU supports smart, sustainable cities.

Also addressing cities’ progress against international agreements, UN Habitat’s ‘Annual Progress Report 2017,’ released in May, outlines implementation of the New Urban Agenda and demonstrates how these efforts contribute to SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

On resiliency in the built environment, an article on the World Bank’s Sustainable Cities blog summarizes lessons from Japan. The piece reviews the efficacy of Japanese building regulations, noting that efforts to improve construction practices were spurred by the combination of unregulated urbanization and previous seismic activity, which led to heavy tolls following natural disasters. The post links to a report by the World Bank and Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) that focuses on building safety in Japan. The report looks at Japan’s approach, including the legal and institutional framework for building regulations, the enhancement of building standards, and ensuring quality in planning, design and construction. Separately on buildings’ sustainability, a blog by David Thorpe on The Fifth Estate describes a challenge issued by the World Green Building Council last week – for the building sector to eliminate carbon emissions from building use by 2030, as part of the Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment.

Continuing on infrastructure and linking to the community level, the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3IE) has published an issue brief addressing the question, “does community-driven development build social cohesion or infrastructure?” The findings show a heavy skew towards the latter. 3IE notes that, although community-driven development (CDD) programs lead to improved facilities for education, health, water and sanitation, they “have no impact on social cohesion or governance.” Further, women are half as likely as men to be aware of CDD meetings, let alone attend or speak at them. Oxfam’s Duncan Green writes that this gender imbalance may push needs assessments towards building infrastructure, rather than devoting resources to health or education themselves. A lively discussion on the 3IE paper and CDD programs more broadly may be found in the comments section of Duncan’s blog.

The below article by ITU Deputy Secretary-General Malcolm Johnson addresses the unique and valuable role of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) – the UN agency for information and communication technologies – in advancing SDG 11 by building smart, sustainable cities.

More than 50% of the world’s population lives in urban areas. By 2050, it will be nearly 70%. This raises huge challenges for municipalities and city planners. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) offer the solution to many of these challenges. At the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the UN specialized agency for ICTs, we are working to develop the tremendous potential ICTs have to help build smarter, more sustainable cities.

Indeed, many cities across the world are already utilizing Big Data analytics gathered from smart sensors and connected devices to manage traffic, reduce energy usage – and improve a wide range of urban operations and services.

If we want to reach the targets set out by the UN SDG 11, we need to work together to develop the tools that will help cities become truly smart and sustainable.

To succeed, international organizations, national governments, municipalities and local partners from civil society, academia and the private sector need to join forces.

Taking Action

Thankfully, there are encouraging signs of such collaboration.

ITU and the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) launched ‘United for Smart Sustainable Cities’ (U4SSC) in 2016. U4SSC is now supported by 16 UN bodies, and over 50 cities have now joined ITU’s pilot project.

U4SSC has facilitated the development of internationally recognized key performance indicators (KPIs) which allow cities to set goals and measure progress on becoming smarter and more sustainable. The indicators, developed by international experts in ITU and UN bodies, fall under five overarching categories: the use of ICTs; physical infrastructure; equity and social inclusion; quality of life; and environmental sustainability.

Recently, many cities including Dubai, Singapore, Montevideo, Maldonado, Moscow, Valencia, Pully and Rimini have asked ITU for assistance in the implementation of the U4SSC KPIs. In the past few months ITU has published case studies on the efforts of Dubai and Singapore to apply smart city innovations, providing a valuable reference point to other cities pursuing greater efficiency and sustainability.

The creation of smart cities requires a trusted infrastructure capable of supporting an enormous volume of ICT-based applications and services, which in turn requires coordinated adherence to common standards that ensure openness and interoperability. ITU develops international standards to enable the coordinated development of Internet of Things technologies and their application in smart cities. They also outlined how smart grids can help to build more controllable and efficient energy systems. Work on standards for smart 5G systems, which will help improve the feasibility of smart processes in large urban areas, is underway.

More Efficient Cities, By and For People

Standards can be powerful agents of change. Their application allows cities to reduce energy costs and emissions through more efficient buildings, electricity grids, street lights, transportation systems, and energy and water networks at a time when cities already account for 70% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

But smart, sustainable cities are about more than just reduced energy costs and emissions – they also aim for the realization of a better quality of urban life for all. New intelligent solutions, underpinned by smart sensors, can improve the safety and well-being of inhabitants.

Here are just a few examples. In Singapore, sensors and cameras build on an existing digital system to enable the government to send signals to drivers to improve traffic flow. In Kolkata, a social enterprise is using geographic information systems to map unplanned settlements, providing addresses and vital services for the inhabitants. In Quito, a mobile platform for women to report sexual harassment on the municipal public transport system is improving the way the city is policed. Digital technologies are also used to enhance citizen engagement and participation.

A Radical Shift for Resilient and Sustainable Societies

The transformation towards resilient and sustainable societies requires the redesign of our cities as well as a radical shift in our patterns of production, consumption, and waste.

Digital technologies give us an opportunity to develop more intelligent and inclusive urban systems where waste, costs, and ecological impacts are minimized, and where urban operations and processes, increasingly cognizant of the multiple stakeholders involved, can enhance quality of life for all. These technologies give us an opportunity to drive success not just on SDG 11, but on several other SDGs, demonstrating the significant impact that ICTs can have on the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

But the transition towards smart, sustainable cities requires collective intention and increased collaboration between citizens, businesses, and governments. Together, we can design more efficient, ecological and people-centered cities, which drive, rather than hinder, individual well-being and sustainable development.","The 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), meeting from 9-18 July 2018, in New York, US, will review in depth SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 15 (life on land).

New technologies, however, present us with new opportunities to meet these challenges.

The vast majority of city dwellers have mobile phones. Smart cities are a key application area for the Internet of Things (IoT). Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are everywhere, with the result that data is being generated everywhere.

Cities around the world have an unprecedented opportunity to gain new insight into the workings of city systems and the behavior of city inhabitants. Data-driven governance can lead to new and improved public services that are more attentive to citizens’ needs.

Citizens themselves will be a key origin of innovation. Smart city solutions will often emerge from the powerfully creative combination of connectivity, data and citizens’ intimate knowledge of the everyday challenges faced by their communities.

But no two cities are the same. There is no “blueprint” for a smart city.

Cities face different urban development challenges, with the result that the priorities of smart city strategies often differ significantly.

The Challenge of Delivering Common Platforms for Diverse Forms of Innovation

The international community aims to agree standards, norms and best practices applicable to all cities around the world.

Here lies a key challenge: these common platforms must provide a basis for differentiation, giving every city technical foundations able to support unique blends of smart city solutions. These platforms must be globally applicable and at the same time enable cities to amplify what makes them unique, preserving and expanding their cultural heritage.

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the UN specialized agency for ICT.

The ITU standardization expert group for ‘IoT and Smart Cities,’ ITU-T Study Group 20, develops international standards supporting the interconnection and interoperability of cities’ IoT systems. Data processing and management is emerging as a key component of this work.

These standards offer essential technical foundations for smart city innovation, helping cities to innovate efficiently and at scale. They provide a basis for cities to deploy reliable standards-based technologies, build integrated IoT ecosystems and capitalize on the resulting data.

However, the implementation of standards alone will not be enough to effect the transition to smart cities.

There is no substitute for learning by experience. Cities pursuing smart city strategies are recognizing the need to share the results of their smart city projects – empirical knowledge of great value to other cities around the world.

The Value of Key Performance Indicators as a Common Reporting Framework

This exchange of knowledge and experience is supported by the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) for Smart Sustainable Cities developed by ITU within the United for Smart Sustainable Cities (U4SSC) initiative.

These indicators offer cities a tool for self-assessment. They enable cities to assess the degree to which their smart city strategies are achieving their objectives. They provide a common format to report the progress of strategies that may differ significantly.

Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Singapore led the way in implementing the indicators and over 50 cities have since followed suit, joining a global project to implement these indicators and report their experience.

U4SSC is a UN initiative coordinated by ITU and the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), and supported by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), ITU, the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), UNECE, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment), UNEP Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI), UNFCCC, the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), UN University Operating Unit on Policy-Driven Electronic Governance (UNU-EGOV), UN Women and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to achieve SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

The initiative’s primary aim is to advocate for public policy to ensure that ICTs – and ICT standards in particular – play a definitive role in the transition to smart sustainable cities.

Bring Your Unique Perspective to the Discussion

U4SSC is highly targeted towards learning from experience. It encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing, helping us to build smart cities safe in the knowledge that we are building these cities with internationally agreed technical tools such as those developed by ITU-T Study Group 20.

U4SSC has built relationships with a diverse selection of cities, all with different priorities atop their smart city agenda, and we are supported by a diverse set of expertise drawn from the different mandates and specializations of the 16 UN bodies backing U4SSC.

Our KPI project includes cities such as Dubai and Singapore, Switzerland’s Pully, Colombia’s Manizales, Italy’s Rimini, China’s Foshan, Uruguay’s Montevideo and Tunisia’s Kairouan and Bizerte. Participating cities represent the full spectrum of levels of infrastructure development.

In addition to the coordination of the KPI project, U4SSC issues expert guidance on the transition to more efficient, sustainable urban environments.

U4SSC has issued three reports providing case studies of smart city projects relevant to the UN SDGs, outlining e-governance initiatives, sustainability projects and smart-city financing models, and highlighting the impact of innovative public policy on urban planning. A fourth report guides the collection of core data and information necessary to cities’ use of the U4SSC KPI.

U4SSC is in the process of developing a range of new reports to provide guidelines on: blockchain applications relevant to smart cities; resource-efficient “circular economy”; financing of smart city projects; the value of artificial intelligence (AI) to the smart city vision; the impact of AI and cognitive computing in cities; the impact of data processing and computation in cities; and the impact of sensing technologies and IoT in cities.

We invite you to join our work.

U4SSC is open to all interested stakeholders promoting the transition to smart cities. It is important that we ensure that all views are represented in this multifaceted discussion.","Cities face different urban development challenges, with the result that the priorities of smart city strategies often differ significantly.

123,https://www.fastcompany.com/40582463/american-cities-are-failing-on-sustainable-development,"Fri, 08 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Fast Company,American cities are failing on sustainable development,"For clues about how America’s future is shaping up, look to its metro areas: They’re where 85% of the U.S. population lives, and where the bulk of the country’s economic and cultural activity unfurls.

But the picture they’re painting right now about where the country’s headed is pretty grim. In the second-annual analysis of how the 100 most populous U.S. cities and metro areas are faring in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals set out by the United Nations in 2015, the majority are lagging far behind. As many as 62 cities are less than half of the way toward making good on the 15 of the 17 SDGs that apply to urban areas. The best performing metro area, San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara (which also topped this list last year) is only 68% of the way toward meeting the SDGs for urban areas.

It’s important to note, says Jessica Espey, senior adviser for the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, which compiled the analysis, that this year’s analysis is not directly comparable to last years’. “We did change quite a few indicators either due to data quality concerns, or because we found better data,” says Espey, who coauthored the report. In that sense, the U.S. Cities Sustainable Development Goals Index should be viewed as an evolving reference document for cities that aggregates the most up-to-date data around the SDGs. “To the extent that we can, we will use replicable data every year so that we can look at comparisons over time,” Espey says, “but we know that the state of data available for many of these issues in America right now is pretty poor.” The report is designed to motivate cities to revamp their data collection efforts around the SDG categories, and also to work harder to meet the goals mandated by the UN.

As spotty as some of the data may be, though, some clear trends emerge in the second report. The main barriers to achieving the SDGs should be familiar to anyone who has spent time in an American city: poverty, racial inequity, climate inaction, and failure to provide healthy food to all residents. While these issues are not unique to cities in the U.S., there are certain aspects of American politics and culture that render them especially difficult to overcome, Espey says.

In terms of reducing inequality, for instance, none of the 100 U.S. metro areas in the report merited a “good performance” measure (each cities’ respective performance on the 15 measured SDGs is rated on a color-coded scale of four categories ranging from poor to good, with two moderate rankings in between). “Racial inequity is something we identified as a theme in every American city,” Espey says. When looking at differences between white and nonwhite groups in cities across America, “there’s acute differences in many outcomes–from poverty to health outcomes,” she adds. This is especially visible when looking at children’s outcomes. In all but one of the surveyed metro areas, child poverty rates were overall greater than poverty rates for the entire area, and in nine cities, they were 50% higher than overall poverty rates. Because child poverty rates tend to track with poor nutrition and health and economic difficulties later in life, it’s a foreboding statistic.

These inequities also suggest a failing on the part of many cities to make up for lagging state and federal policies around ending hunger and providing affordable housing and healthcare for all residents. “If you look at the correlation analysis we did, everything we did suggests that targeted supplemental support, particularly to the most vulnerable populations–children, the elderly, and marginalized racial and ethic groups–would be hugely beneficial, but it’s not something the federal government is doing at nearly a wide enough scale,” Espey says.","In the second-annual analysis of how the 100 most populous U.S. cities and metro areas are faring in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals set out by the United Nations in 2015, the majority are lagging far behind.

While many challenges remain, there are optimistic signs of progress.

Markets and communities are increasingly embracing low-carbon and sustainability actions. On the front lines of climate policy, global investors are looking more at renewable energy investments, and less at conventional, fossil fuel investments. In 2017, almost $280 billion was invested in renewable energy, according to a recent report by Bloomberg.

Apple recently announced a new partnership, moving beyond making its supply chains 100 per cent reliant on renewable energy to finding new ways of sourcing aluminum in zero-carbon ways. And this push to link sustainability with innovation isn’t just happening with high-technology actors. Key resource players are adopting more stringent sustainability standards covering a wide range of commodities, from forestry and coffee to garments and tea.

One driver that is increasingly pushing this transition to sustainability is the Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs. These 17 goals apply to all countries, and require all of society to play their part.

Accordingly, a growing number of companies are adopting efforts to reach the SDGs. So too are cities: New York City will become the first city to report on how it is advancing the SDGs, at a high-level meeting of countries in July. In Germany, the Chancellor’s office is tracking the update of different SDGs across their federal and provincial levels of government. In Finland, the Prime Minister chairs a special commission to track implementation of the goals by companies, volunteer groups and governments. Kenya has taken steps to incorporate the SDGs into national policies and has developed a road map for implementation. Sweden has pursued measures to integrate equitable and sustainable development into all dimensions of its work. Guatemala, Jordan and Malaysia have launched a variety of efforts to build national ownership over the SDG framework.

Against this momentum, Canada is largely stalling. Last year, the Brookings Institute concluded that Canada lagged behind other countries in implementing the SDGs. Last month, Canada’s Commissioner on the Environment and Sustainable Development issued an audit report on Canada’s preparedness to implement the SDGs. Her report concluded that the government was far from ready to implement the SDGs or to provide leadership in helping other countries to make progress.

In her report, the Commissioner determined that the Government of Canada has, as yet, no governance structure for SDG implementation; no system to measure, monitor and report on national progress; and only limited national consultation and engagement. While Canada has developed a data framework to measure results on the 232 global SDG indicators, the data have not yet been compiled.

As both of these reports acknowledged, even countries with a very high standard of living for most of its population, such as Canada, face unacceptably high rates of poverty, health issues and environmental challenges. Canada’s indigenous communities are disproportionately affected by poor housing, schooling, drinking water advisories and a long list of other pressing matters. The recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission require urgent action, and overlap with the spirit of ‘leaving no one behind’ – one of the elements central to the SDGs.

There is no doubt Canada has a long way to go. Even with plans, action is hard to take. The SDGs challenge us to break out of our silos, to coordinate and connect across different government departments and different levels of government – and to find the spaces in between where issues intersect and collaboration is essential for success. It requires political will to be successful.

To its credit, the Canadian government is beginning to recognize its shortfalls. In Budget 2018, as the Commissioner was finalizing her report for publication, the government announced new funding to support whole-of-government coordination, monitoring and reporting of the SDGs. And just one week before the Commissioner’s highly critical report was issued, the government put out a press release signalling that plans are finally underway to develop a strategy to implement the SDGs.

In July, the world’s leaders will convene for the UN’s High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. In preparing for the session, Canada has an opportunity to further redress its lack of performance thus far. In fact, when Canada rises alongside 46 other countries to present its ‘voluntary national review’ – its own account of how it is implementing the SDGs nationally and internationally – the government still has an opportunity to distinguish itself.

Instead of using the platform to exaggerate successes and ignore shortcomings, as many member states have done in previous years, the government should show that it can learn from recent publications such as last month’s auditor’s report. Realistically, little progress can be achieved before the UN meeting, but the government can at least signal it has a solid grasp of the challenges it has faced and is facing, the gaps that remain, and the directions it is planning to take – including how it will engage more Canadians in realizing the task of ‘transforming our world’ by 2030.

This would prove true what the Prime Minister’s told the UN General Assembly in a speech last year:

“Canada remains a work in progress. … The good news is that Canadians get it. They see the inequities. They’re fed up with the excuses. And that impatience gives us a rare and precious opportunity to act.”

Taking action to achieve the SDGs is part of that opportunity. While all governments are struggling with the challenging global agenda framed by the SDGs, few are acknowledging and undertaking the truly transformative changes required to realize its full ambition. By being honest, modest and candid about the work ahead, by recognizing the political will and direction it will require to be successful, Canada may not yet be ready, but it can demonstrate its genuine commitment to the SDGs, and do its part to ensure that no one is left behind – in Canada or around the world.

The theme of the contest was ‘humanizing data’. This refers to the use of data for people-oriented service development.

Espoo’s strength in the competition lay in its client-oriented way of sustainably developing a smart city – in other words, Espoo wants to involve its residents.

The contest was organised by the Intelligent Community Forum (ICF), a global network of cities and regions.

People, communities and companies are Espoo’s greatest resources

The City of Espoo is developing its services and the vitality and competitiveness of the capital region – and the entire Finland – in cooperation with residents, companies, educational institutions, universities, communities and other cities.

Espoo Innovation Garden is the largest innovation community in the Nordic countries. Internationally, it is a highly competitive platform. Espoo is the home of Aalto University, universities of applied sciences, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and other research institutions, and companies such as Nokia, Kone, Tieto, Neste and Fortum. Hundreds of startups are founded in Espoo every year. Companies such as Supercell and Rovio, known for Angry Birds series, hail from Espoo Innovation Garden.

According to an international survey, Espoo is the most sustainable city in Europe. The survey revealed that the growing Espoo has succeeded in developing in a way that is economically, socially, culturally and ecologically sustainable.

“We want to remain the most sustainable city in Europe also in the future. By cooperating with our innovation networks, we will ensure high-quality services for our residents and guarantee that our growth is economically, ecologically, socially and culturally sustainable also in the future,” says Jukka Mäkelä, Mayor of Espoo.

Community creates welfare, vitality and sustainability

Success in the Intelligent Community Awards helped Espoo-based cooperation and success gain visibility, while providing the city with networks for sharing knowledge and making new contacts. The networks will help everyone in Espoo to implement the city’s strategy, known as the Espoo Story, solve the challenges of a sustainable future, and create new smart services and jobs.

Espoo is for example developing:

Digital applications that encourage the residents to adopt greener modes of transport, for example by switching from private car use to public transport, carpooling or cycling.

The use of artificial intelligence in customer service, targeting proactive support measures at residents who belong to risk groups, or any other routine work.

Public service centres: a model of placing various public services under one roof next to commercial services, easily accessible by public transport. Customer surveys suggest that the Iso Omena Service Centre has found its role: making residents’ everyday life smoother. The Service Centre is also an innovation platform, a place of collaborative development where companies, communities and residents can all participate.

All practical experiments using smart solutions, no matter how small, are connected to the overall objectives of the Espoo Story: healthiness, sustainability, participation and being dynamic.

126,https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/why-a-sustainable-city-is-closer-than-we-think/,"Wed, 06 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Knowledge@Wharton,Sustainable Cities Are Closer Than We Think,"A quick scan of the headlines paints a bleak picture of the environment. Oceans are filling with plastic, aging cities are grappling with failing infrastructure, and air pollution is blackening the skies. But there is hope. Steven Cohen, public affairs professor at Columbia University and senior adviser at the school’s Earth Institute, believes big cities are leading the way to a more sustainable planet by making innovative changes. His book, The Sustainable City, takes a public policy perspective on fixing the planet. He spoke on the Knowledge@Wharton show, which airs on SiriusXM channel 111, about how to make sustainability a reality. (Listen to the podcast at the top of this page.)

An edited transcript of the conversation follows.

Knowledge@Wharton: Why is this change happening in big cities more than in rural areas?

Steven Cohen: Because of their density, cities provide the opportunity to have cost-effective delivery of services such as water, energy, waste management and transportation. As the population of the planet has grown — it’s now at 7.5 billion and will probably peak to 9 billion – the best way for us to live the way we live today is to concentrate population and use that concentration to apply technology to reduce our impact on the biosphere.

Knowledge@Wharton: Are cities aware of this and making plans?

Cohen: Yes, but they’re not necessarily doing it for the reason I’ve outlined. They’re doing it because cities are now part of a global competition for business and people. If you get off the plane in Beijing and the air is orange, you’re not going to bring your business there. I think [former Mayor] Mike Bloomberg recognized that in New York City. He was no famous environmentalist, but when his deputy mayor said, “We’re going to increase by 1 million people in the next 20 or 30 years,” the mayor started thinking about the energy, the water, the traffic, the housing, the parks and other quality-of-life elements.

That’s really a part of what’s driving this, and you see signs of it in the transportability of business. Amazon can conceive of taking 50,000 people for its second headquarters and locating it anyplace in the United States. That’s not something you saw back in the Industrial Age.

Knowledge@Wharton: How is New York doing right now?

Cohen: New York is doing well. We didn’t realize it, but we almost went broke moving from being a manufacturing city to being a post-industrial city. At the end of World War II, almost half of the gross domestic product in New York City was in making clothing. Last year, it was less than 2%. We don’t make cars, we don’t make clothing in New York. We make ideas. We make public relations. We do finance. We do all sorts of technology-oriented functions, health care. But we don’t make things here anymore because that’s not the high-value-added part of the economy.

“If you get off the plane in Beijing and the air is orange, you’re not going to bring your business there.”

We inadvertently moved in the right direction. We almost went bankrupt in the process, but losing all of these businesses was actually a good thing because it freed up the space for what they’re doing now. The cover from my book is from the new park called the High Line. The High Line was a freight train from the West Side docks to the factories we used to have on the West Side of Manhattan. The docks are all gone because containerized shipping made New York’s port no longer viable. We were too small.

The factories are gone, and now you’ve got high-end boutiques, art galleries, great restaurants. New York has 50 million tourists and a very different kind of economy than we used to have. Frankly, this is the way the economy has moved. In the U.S., 80% of the economy is in the service sector now, so the part of the economy you want to be in is the part that New York has found itself in. Part of what attracts people into this kind of post-industrial city is the sustainability factors, like air you can breathe, water you can ride your bicycle next to, good park access and all the other things I talk about in the book.

Knowledge@Wharton: But those changes have an impact on the cost of housing. We see that here in Philadelphia, where certain areas have been revitalized and now it costs $400,000 for a townhouse.

Cohen: The issue that we’re facing is a public policy issue, not that different than after World War II. Because of federal housing policies, like guaranteed mortgages and deductions on taxes and interest, we went from being a nation of renters to owners. Now the issue is the poorer people, working people who service this economy, are going to have to live so far away that their quality of life will deteriorate. What has to accompany this gentrification is an effort to have some kind of public investment, either through tax expenditures or just through real money, to create housing so that workers can live a little bit closer to where they’re going to work.

Knowledge@Wharton: How will mass transit develop in the coming years?

Cohen: With density, mass transit becomes easier to do and more cost-effective. But one of the things about American cities is that we’re never going to be as densely settled as, say, European cities because of the development of our suburbs and the interstate highway system. We’re going to always have personal transportation in bigger numbers here than some other parts of the world, so that means that we have to move off the internal combustion engine to the electric vehicle. I think that process is well underway. Eventually, that electric vehicle will be lower cost than the internal combustion engine vehicle because it has fewer moving parts and is cheaper to run. Where we have density, then the use of buses and rail and light rail as a way of moving more people into densely settled areas is very important.

Knowledge@Wharton: What about the development of public spaces and parks?

Cohen: In some older cities, you have abandoned places that were industrial sites and have become toxic. You can do things to remedy those toxins enough and contain them enough that you can use that space for park land. There are some examples of that in the book. Also, re-purposing old industrial spaces. Again, the High Line in New York is a great example of that, but there are examples all over the world. One of the problems of living in the city is that you spend most of your time indoors. We need to get people outside into public spaces. They may not be pristine public spaces, but they’ll still be well-designed and places where people can hang out outside.

“The good news is more and more of America’s garbage is either recycled or treated.”

Knowledge@Wharton: But that goes against the development principle of high density in order to maximize profit and use of space.

Cohen: Right. But when you build a park, the surrounding places become even more valuable because they have visual amenities. Central Park is probably the greatest example of that. That was also one of things that had happened with the High Line. This converted freight train, which is a tiny little sliver of a park, is still very, very valuable and has done enormous things for the surrounding real estate. Parks and pretty much any amenity that gives you air, light and access to water can do quite a bit to generate increased real estate value.

There’s a general move toward wellness. Once you get food, clothing, and shelter taken care of, now you’re thinking about your health, your children’s health, your physical fitness — and a whole range of issues become more important. Again, it’s in sync with sustainability. Clean air, clean water, a toxic-free environment, food that is healthful — people who advocate sustainability are in favor of these things, and so are suburban moms who want their kids to be healthy. I think that’s a part of why this move towards sustainability has broad, general support.

Knowledge@Wharton: What is the smart grid and how that can play a role?

Cohen: Our electric grid was built a block at a time, and it’s over 100 years old now. We waste a lot of energy moving it back and forth. It doesn’t allow for distributed generation of energy or generation from renewable sources within the household. To the extent that we can move to create a system of micro-grids that eventually get connected into a smart grid, we will have a much more durable and resilient energy system, especially if we couple that with more household generation of energy.

Knowledge@Wharton: Doesn’t that go back to policy decisions like, say, not putting tariffs on solar panels coming into the country?

Cohen: Yes. I think we also have to be spending more money on the research and development that will create the next generation of solar cells, particularly of battery technology. When I was in graduate school, the computer I used was the size of my bedroom and had less computing power than my iPhone. They shrunk those computers because the federal government spent a lot of money shrinking computers, essentially for missile guidance systems. We need to get back in the business of doing basic science for research and development because the commercialization of these technologies is what transformed our lives. Imagine the disruptive technology if that solar cell was the size of a window and the battery was the size of your laptop.

Knowledge@Wharton: In the book, you mention the importance of waste management, not just in the United States but globally. Can you talk about that?

Cohen: In Barcelona, they have a waste facility called Ecoparc. The garbage comes in. They sort the wet and dry. They have an anaerobic digester which takes the food and turns it into fertilizer. They have a waste-to-energy plant that burns what’s left over and gets electricity out of it. The ash is used to pave roads. The good news is more and more of America’s garbage is either recycled or treated, and we are producing a little bit less per capita than we were 20 years ago.

“This idea that environmentalists sometimes portray, that you’ve got to do without and sacrifice in order to keep the world clean, is just simply not true.”

So, I think we’re gradually heading in the right direction. In part, it’s economics. Garbage costs money now. It used to be a lot cheaper to get rid of your garbage. It used to be a lot cheaper to get your water brought to your home. All these things are becoming cost factors for families and for businesses, which is a result of us being on a more crowded planet. But that opens up the possibility of revenue streams that can amortize the capital expenditures for facilities that apply technology to keeping our environment clean.

Knowledge@Wharton: You expect innovation will continue?

Cohen: One of the themes of my book is that this idea that environmentalists sometimes portray, that you’ve got to do without, sacrifice, in order to keep the world clean, is just simply not true. The U.S. economy has been growing pretty steadily since the 1980s, with a few exceptions. And the absolute level of pollution has gone down since the 1980s. It’s not that we’re sending all the dirty stuff to Mexico. Most of our air pollution comes from power plants and motor vehicles, and we have a lot more of them now than we used to. But we built the catalytic converter. We built scrubbers. We do the things we need to do because we know if you don’t keep the place clean, you’re going to pay for it later on.

Knowledge@Wharton: Do you feel confident that some traditional automakers are investing in electric vehicles and partnering with entrepreneurs and innovators in this sector to get ready for that next step?

Cohen: Yes, because we’re in a global economy. Even if the American political process is stuck in the mud, you’ve got Europe and China and huge markets that American companies want to play in. The political calculus may not make sense here, but when you think about your future as a company and look globally, you start thinking that’s what’s going to happen. In India and China, there’s such a hunger for mobility and motor vehicles and mass transit. If you’re in that business, you want to think about the technology of 10 or 20 years from now, not the stuff from 10 or 20 years ago.","Oceans are filling with plastic, aging cities are grappling with failing infrastructure, and air pollution is blackening the skies.

The publication aims to increase awareness of tourism’s role in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and of the need to integrate sustainability into tourism policies, business practices and tourist behavior. Describing tourism as a driver of sustainable development, the report explains that tourism benefits economic growth, quality of life, environmental protection, diverse cultural heritage and world peace.

An output of the International Year of Tourism 2017 (IY2017), the publication is structured around IY2017’s five pillars: sustainable economic growth; social inclusiveness, employment and poverty reduction; resource efficiency, environmental protection and climate change; cultural values, diversity and heritage; and mutual understanding, peace and security.

The first volume demonstrates the ways in which tourism can contribute to these areas, identifies each pillar’s links with the SDGs, highlights action areas, and makes recommendations for governments, businesses and individuals. A cross-cutting section addresses governance, policy frameworks and instruments for sustainable tourism. The second volume includes descriptions of 23 case studies, and highlights tourism’s contribution to the SDGs.

The report elaborates on tourism’s opportunities for development, including: prospects for women and youth, developing countries, rural areas and indigenous communities; its potential to help conserve resources and cultural assets; and its capacity to inspire interaction and understanding. It explains that tourism can act as a catalyst for environmental and cultural protection, and strengthen peace and reconciliation. The report also identifies challenges, such as: tourism’s sensitivity to market influences; poor working conditions; emissions and pollution; potential adverse effects on biodiversity, heritage and communities; and lack of comprehensive data on tourism’s impacts on sustainability.

Tourism can act as catalyst for environmental and cultural protection, and strengthen peace and reconciliation.

The report recommends that, inter alia: governments establish and enforce inclusive and integrated policy frameworks for sustainable tourism development; businesses demonstrate their commitment to sustainability in core business models and value chains with enhanced action; and individuals and civil society advocate for and adopt consciously sustainable practices and behaviors.

Tourism Links with the SDGs

The report highlights three SDG targets, in particular, that mention sustainable tourism, namely: SDG target 8.9 on devising and implementing sustainable tourism policies that create jobs and promote local culture and products; SDG target 12.b on developing and implementing tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism; and SDG target 14.7 on increasing the economic benefits to small island developing States (SIDS) and the least developed countries (LDCs) from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism.

The report also spells out tourism’s links to each of the 17 SDGs:

SDG 1 (no poverty): tourism can be linked to national poverty reduction strategies and entrepreneurship through low skills requirements and local recruitment;

SDG 2 (zero hunger): tourism can spur sustainable agriculture by promoting production, supplies to hotels, and sales of local products to tourists;

SDG 3 (good health and well-being): tax income generated from tourism and visitors fees collected in protected areas can be reinvested in health care and services;

SDG 4 (quality education): capacity and skills need to be built to ensure the tourism sector can prosper and provide job opportunities for youth, women and those with special needs;

SDG 5 (gender equality): tourism can empower women, particularly through the provision of direct jobs and income generation in tourism and hospitality-related enterprises;

SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation): tourism investment requirement for providing utilities can play a critical role in achieving water access and security, hygiene and sanitation;

SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy): tourism can help reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs), mitigate climate change and contribute to energy access by promoting clean energy investments;

SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth): decent work opportunities in tourism, particularly for youth and women, and policies that favor better diversification through tourism value chains can enhance tourism’s positive socioeconomic impacts;

SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure): tourism can influence public policies aimed at upgrading and retrofitting infrastructure to make it more sustainable, innovative and efficient;

SDG 10 (reduced inequalities): sustainable tourism can engage local populations and all stakeholders in tourism development, and contribute to urban renewal and rural development;

SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities): tourism can, inter alia, promote urban regeneration, and preserve cultural and natural heritage;

SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production): adopting sustainable consumption and production (SCP) models can help monitor sustainable development impacts for tourism, including for energy, water, waste, biodiversity and job creation;

SDG 13 (climate action): tourism stakeholders can play a critical leading role in fighting climate change by reducing their carbon footprints;

SDG 14 (life below water): tourism development can help preserve marine ecosystems and promote a blue economy and the sustainable use of marine resources;

SDG 15 (life on land): sustainable tourism can help conserve and preserve biodiversity, and generate revenue as an alternative livelihood for local communities;

SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions): tourism can help foster multicultural and interfaith tolerance and understanding, and peace in post-conflict societies; and

SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals): tourism can strengthen public-private partnerships (PPPs) and engage all stakeholders to work together to achieve the SDGs.

Tourism and SDG Links with IY2017 Five Pillars

Regarding sustainable economic growth (pillar 1), the report highlights links with, inter alia, SDG target 8.9, target 9.1 on infrastructure development in transborder contexts and target 17.3 on support for promoting investments.

On social inclusiveness, employment and poverty reduction (pillar 2), the report points to: SDG target 1.4 on ensuring rights to economic resources for the poor and vulnerable; SDG 3, which is linked to enabling individuals to benefit from tourism as a “life-enhancing” activity; SDG targets 4.3-4.5 on access to vocational education and skills training; targets related to SDGs 5 and 10 on social inclusiveness of sustainable tourism development; and SDG target 8.9.

Regarding resource efficiency, environmental protection and climate change (pillar 3), the report notes interlinkages with, inter alia, SDG target 8.4 on resource efficiency in consumption and production; SDG target 12.b; SDG target 12.1 on implementation of 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (10YFP), including the Sustainable Tourism Programme; SDG targets 12.3 and 12.6 on food waste and sustainability reporting by companies; and target 14.7.

On cultural values, diversity and heritage (pillar 4), the report describes links with SDG target 11.4 on strengthened efforts to protect and safeguard cultural and natural heritage; and aspects of SDGs 8 and 12 that mention culture in relation to tourism.

Regarding mutual understanding, peace and security (pillar 5), the report references SDG 17, which discusses issues relevant for sustainable tourism development, such as means of implementation (MOI), policy and institutional coherence, multi-stakeholder partnerships, data, monitoring and accountability.

The report recommends funding for sustainable tourism development towards SDG-related projects, such as: national tourism strategies to achieve sustainable development; strategic infrastructure projects; and scalable and innovative sustainable tourism projects.

The case studies contained in Volume II address, inter alia: green supply chains in Slovenia; a world heritage site in Egypt; women entrepreneurs in Mali; a responsible tourism initiative in Kerala, India; a coral island park in Tanzania; wildlife conservation in Kenya; climate change vulnerability in Mexico; enhancing the climate resilience of tourism-reliant communities in Samoa; hostels in the US; sustainable tourism governance in Bohol province, the Philippines; a sustainable tourism initiative in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE); and the Youth Career Initiative, which helps the hotel sector address SDG 8 by supporting disadvantaged youth, including human trafficking survivors, through skills and employability training.

The report was released on 6 June 2018 in Brussels, Belgium, during European Development Days (EDD).

This picture-postcard environment is not the year-round reality. At certain times of year, intense heat, humidity and the wet season affect liveability, making outdoor activity unattractive and thereby reducing social cohesion.

Urban living can already be pretty insular these days. People move from temperature-controlled houses to temperature-controlled cars to temperature-controlled offices, and vice versa. There’s no need to talk to anyone really. And exercise? It’s something you try to fit in if you can – but you probably don’t.

An ideal city life might be one in which you walk or cycle to work easily, say hi to a neighbour, and pick up some fresh produce for lunch along the way. While it is nice to expect that people will do this for a healthier self and planet, the truth is that daily life choices depend on convenience.

Furthermore, the planning and design (or haphazard evolution) of urban spaces largely dictate the way we live. This in turn affects our health in many ways. It can, for instance, encourage or discourage active lifestyles, social cohesion and access to healthy food choices.

This is where the New Urban Agenda comes into play.

The New Urban Agenda and why it matters

The New Urban Agenda, drafted by UN-Habitat and endorsed in late 2016 by the United Nations General Assembly, aims to help everyone to benefit from urbanisation.

Through Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), the agenda provides a guide for developing safe, inclusive, resilient and sustainable new cities that promote social integration and equity. It can also provide the impetus for conversations about the growth, redesign and redevelopment of existing urban spaces.

Read more: What can the New Urban Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals do for cities?

Making the New Urban Agenda work locally depends on more than overall regulations, or “importing” southern Australian solutions to the tropics. Even within the Australian tropical region, the climate varies. Cairns experiences a tropical monsoon climate (wet tropics), while Townsville is exposed to a tropical savannah climate (dry tropics).

The way public spaces should be designed must, therefore, also vary within the tropical climate zone. We need to listen to locals, understand their behaviour and preferences, then promote these preferred public space qualities through urban planning and design.

Good design can improve the choices we make. But what is good design? And how do we adapt general guidelines to specific places and cultures?

Urban diaries to understand each city

Urban diaries are premised on the importance of local history, values and knowledge. This approach aims to “distinguish underlying organic relationships between people and cities from indiscriminate prescription imposed upon place”. Urban diaries are a powerful tool for personal observation, raising awareness and creating positive urban change.

In our investigation, participants are invited to shoot and caption photographs of their surroundings, noting what makes their lives healthier, happier and stronger, and what does not. These images will be shared through social media and used to capture ideas and start conversations.

These urban diaries will help clarify how Cairns and Townsville function as tropical cities. At the same time this approach will help bring to light ways of improving local lifestyles by implementing the New Urban Agenda principles in this local context.

Place-based urban planning and design

Climate-responsive planning and design are important to make sure people can incorporate incidental exercise into their everyday routine. People will use public spaces if these are designed in a way that mediates the negative impacts of tropical climates.

What type of spaces and features will encourage people to walk even if the temperature outside is 40℃? We are particularly interested in three overarching questions. These concern how existing urban infrastructure and amenities promote or restrict:

active lifestyles social inclusion healthy eating.

These questions will be explored through public participation in the upcoming UN-Habitat World Urban Campaign Urban Thinkers Campus events in Cairns on June 8 and Townsville on June 15. Drawing on urban diaries, these events will provide the fundamental basis for understanding these places through a local lens.

This is the second article in a two-part series reviewing the book ‘Social Sustainability, Climate Resilience and Community-Based Urban Development: What About the People?‘ by Cathy Baldwin (University of Oxford) and Robin King (World Resources Institute), and how it informs thinking about Rio’s favelas. Read part 1 here.

What About the People? The Socially Sustainable, Resilient Community and Urban Development leaves it clear that the built environment has great impact on the social sustainability* of a community, as discussed in the first article in this series. This article focuses specifically on the tools presented by the authors that could be useful for leaders in Rio de Janeiro’s favelas looking to make interventions in their built and social environment.

Drawing on research in North and South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia, Cathy Baldwin and Robin King outline four stages of socially-aware planning practices for urban development: 1) scheme conception, 2) research and community participation, 3) design decisions and implementation, and 4) monitoring and evaluation. The authors describe these stages as they would apply in a formal process of development, started by outside planners, which is often not how development unfolds in favelas where residents take a leading role. However, the principles of the four stages remain relevant for local leaders as they seek broader engagement from their communities in their projects.

Stage 1: Scheme conception

Plans based on expert-driven and technological approaches rather than the ideas of the people they aim to serve often ignore local social and cultural contexts and fail as a result. These approaches also often fall into the trap of overlooking community assets, which then fall victim as projects are implemented without considering or building on those assets. The authors thus argue that social dimensions must be incorporated from the conception stage, exploring specific local social resources, capacities, and organizational conditions. This is essential to comprehend how to overcome local challenges, to set clear social objectives, and to avoid unintended negative impacts on people’s lives. Wrong decisions can negatively impact existing community networks, affecting local social organization and engagement.

Stage 2: Research and community participation

For the work of outside planners, community participation is crucial because residents offer local knowledge that is critical for developing plans. At minimum, planners should be prepared to seek out and incorporate input from the community and to promote civic activities to strengthen a community’s sense of ownership. A democratic and participatory development process built on trust, transparency, and communication is important to ensure popular engagement.

Beyond just a superficial knowledge of local context, it is also necessary to develop a project that respects symbolic dimensions—local cultural and social meanings. Thus, planners should act together with social researchers to use an appropriate method for planning. And in the case of Rio, one would argue that favela-based researchers and residents are the most appropriate partners in this process.

Although social diversity can represent a challenge for planning, it can also offer a diverse range of social resources to support communities through crisis situations and local issues. It is important to embrace all kinds of diversity, thinking about spatial conditions that improve access and safety for everyone, especially minorities, in order to achieve urban equality. Demographic research combined with community participation can, for example, provide knowledge of the population characteristics and the existing state of social cohesion in a community in order to think of ways to build social capital* and cohesion* to create or strengthen community spirit.

One of the tools presented for the research and community participation stage is the mapping of cultural meanings of the urban space. Previously done in Belfast, Northern Ireland, a city notably divided by many years of conflict between Protestants and Catholics, the mapping of cultural and social meanings of the landscape and the memories it evokes allows community members to understand their histories and development better. The process of engaging residents to think about the past and how it has contributed to the present can bring a better understanding of the community itself and help residents think about what can be done in the present to create a better future.

The same mapping exercise also allows for identifying community assets, social resources, needs, or weaknesses. One approach to this exercise is through a participatory workshop. Residents are asked to identify and write down on sticky notes the positive and negative aspects of their community, what works well and what could be better. The workshop organizer pins the sticky notes on a board, either on a map or organized by subject. Later the organizer promotes a discussion about everything that was written, prompting residents to talk about the reasons why they wrote each point down and how each aspect can be improved. This process helps residents learn more about their communities and think about what they want for the future.

Community leaders may take advantage of the process and the discussions to start a co-design project. In co-design projects, neighborhood leaders and residents, designers, and government officials work together to identify and meet the needs of a community. Residents can participate in the design and construction processes to build social capital, strengthen collective capacity, and develop pride and ownership. Residents can vote on design decisions for buildings or public places, like placement, layout, and form. Any resident can help with construction through tasks that do not require specific training or ability, although with many favela residents having built their own homes, construction expertise is not in short supply. These methodologies contribute to creating a sense of pride and belonging to the neighborhood.

Stage 3: Design decisions and implementation

Design decisions have to be adapted to the local social and cultural environment rather than simply to financial requirements. When thinking of design solutions planners should keep in mind that a mixed neighborhood and mixed land use are most likely to create an environmentally and socially sustainable* community.

One important design goal is to incorporate open public spaces where all social groups can interact and create a positive community spirit. Social spaces are fundamental to the development of social capital and cohesion because they can promote inclusion and a feeling of trust and safety.

These spaces can be proposed in all types of projects. For example, urgent crisis housing in cases of natural disasters can provide a spatial solution that keeps communities together in new settlements, maintaining their self-organization and social relations. But, it is important to highlight that relocation should be minimized as much as possible and only proposed in extreme and urgent situations, such as natural disasters. Another good example is transport stations. Although usually thought of as primarily serving a utilitarian function, transport hubs can also offer spaces for social interaction as large numbers of people pass through them each day.

Another important measure to guarantee diversity and equity is the provision of affordable housing in city centers. As we can see in Rio and so many other cities around the world, there is a growing trend for low-income people to be pushed out to peripheral regions, making their access to infrastructure and opportunities more difficult and hindering opportunities for democratic engagement.

Stage 4: Monitoring and evaluation

Finally, after designing and implementing a development plan in partnership with a community, it is necessary to have a regular method of monitoring and evaluating its impacts to ensure social and urban sustainability. The community is a fundamental element in the continuity of development processes. When people have a sense of responsibility over their place, as so many of Rio’s favela residents do, they will monitor and evaluate the results of development projects themselves, constantly proposing and initiating new ideas and improvements, regardless of whether institutional support exists or not.

Conclusion

Community participation in local projects helps create bonds and attachment among neighbors, increasing collective capacity. Incorporating these tools and methodologies into the work done by community organizations in favelas, or consolidating them in cases where they already exist, has the potential to increase residents’ agency over their environment, community, and future.

The report provides an overview of campaigns and events that took place during 2017, with a focus on sustainable tourism and the SDGs.

The report highlights three SDG targets that mention sustainable tourism, namely: target 8.9, on devising and implementing, by 2030, policies to promote sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products; target 12.b, on developing and implementing tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism; and target 14.7, on increasing the economic benefits of small island developing States (SIDS) and least developed countries (LDCs) from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism.

Among the numerous SDGs-related events highlighted in the publication is the 22nd UNWTO General Assembly, which convened in September 2017 in Chengdu, China. The meeting focused on tourism’s contribution to the SDGs, and adopted the Chengdu Declaration on Tourism and the SDGs. The Declaration states that tourism is vital for achieving the SDGs as it can, inter alia, stimulate economic growth, create jobs, combat poverty, enhance livelihoods, empower women and youth, and preserve terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The Declaration proposes that countries: undertake national assessments on tourism’s contribution and commitment to the SDGs; ensure tourism is included in inter-ministerial SDG commissions and/or working groups; and establish frameworks and mechanisms that enable participation of all stakeholders to enhance the contribution of tourism to national SDG strategies.

The second UNWTO/UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Conference on Tourism and Culture, which convened in December 2017 in Muscat, Oman, focused on fostering sustainable development. The conference adopted the Muscat Declaration, which calls for, inter alia: advancing the contribution of cultural tourism to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs; encouraging an innovative approach for sustainable urban development through cultural tourism; and exploring links between culture and nature in sustainable tourism.

UNWTO’s ‘Travel.Enjoy.Respect.’ campaign aims to increase awareness of the role of travelers in harnessing tourism’s contribution to sustainable development.

The sixth Global Summit on Urban Tourism, themed ‘Sustainable and Competitive Tourism on the New Urban Agenda (NUA),’ convened in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in December 2017. It aimed to advance sustainable and competitive urban tourism, which contributes to the SDGs and the NUA.

A conference on ‘Tourism, a Tool for Inclusive Growth and Community Engagement in Africa,’ met in Lusaka, Zambia, in November 2017. The conference raised awareness regarding tourism’s contribution to poverty alleviation and the ways in which it can help achieve the SDGs and generate benefits for African societies. The Lusaka Declaration, inter alia, calls on African governments to develop and implement tourism policies that contribute to the SDGs; and urges donors, investors and financial institutions to increase investment in sustainable tourism development in Africa.

The Global Conference on Jobs and Inclusive Growth convened in Montego Bay, Jamaica, in November 2017 under the theme ‘Partnerships for Sustainable Tourism.’ The conference called on donors to recognize tourism impacts on sustainable development and mobilize resources for tourism development through existing financing mechanisms and new SDG-related facilities, including the UNWTO Tourism for Development Facility.

The fourth World Forum on Intercultural Dialogue gathered under the theme ‘Advancing Intercultural Dialogue: New Avenues for Human Security, Peace and Sustainable Development,’ in Baku, Azerbaijan, in May 2017. Participants discussed, inter alia, the conditions under which sustainable tourism can promote cross-cultural understanding and peace in the context of the 2030 Agenda.

The third UNWTO World Forum on Gastronomy Tourism in San Sebastián, Spain, in May 2017, concluded, inter alia, that public and private entities must work together to harness the power of gastronomy tourism to contribute to the SDGs through conserving biodiversity and empowering local communities.

In addition, the report provides an update on the UNWTO/Chimelong Programme on Wildlife and Tourism, which, among others, focuses on advancing the SDGs through sustainable tourism, particularly as it relates to wildlife conservation. It also reviews progress made on the Sustainable Tourism Programme of the ten-year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production (10YFP), which, inter alia, continues to accelerate the shift to sustainable consumption and production (SCP) in tourism as an implementation mechanism for SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), with the potential to advance other SDGs.

Furthermore, the report notes that 2017 was the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development (IY2017). As part of IY2017, the UNWTO supported a consumer-oriented campaign, ‘Travel.Enjoy.Respect,’ which will continue through 2018. Among other issues, the campaign aims to increase awareness of the role of travelers in harnessing tourism’s contribution to sustainable development. As part of the campaign, an exhibition at the UN Office in Geneva links each SDG to one of 17 stories of individuals working in tourism around the world.

UNWTO and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) published a report titled, ‘Tourism and the Sustainable Development Goals – Journey to 2030,’ which aims to help the tourism sector contribute to implementation of the SDGs. The report’s findings will be included in the ‘Tourism for SDGs’ interactive web platform, a data center and educational resource to be launched in July 2018.

131,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/south-sudan-first-state-of-environment-report-emphasizes-sustainable-resource-management-for-peace/,"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,South Sudan First State of Environment Report Emphasizes Sustainable Resource Management for Peace,"7 June 2018: The UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) and South Sudan’s Ministry of Environment and Forestry issued the first-ever report on the state of the environment in South Sudan. Titled ‘South Sudan: First State of Environment and Outlook Report,’ the publication highlights that droughts, floods, pollution, deforestation and conflicts could worsen South Sudan’s humanitarian crisis and threaten the livelihoods of ten million of the country’s 12 million people.

The report acknowledges that ongoing conflict hinders the country’s ability to sustainably manage and develop its natural resources, and states that competition over access to resources could exacerbate conflicts and forced migration. It concludes that sustainable and equitable management of resources, such as forests, oil, water and minerals, will contribute to peace and economic prosperity. The report’s recommendations aim to help South Sudan: protect its ecosystems and generate income by promoting agriculture, fishery and industrial development; establish mechanisms for protecting and sustainably using natural resources; and develop climate resilient communities.

The report reviews the historical and geographical context and the socioeconomic and natural drivers of environmental change; provides recommendations for addressing climate change impacts and natural hazards; and analyzes pressures and responses related to agriculture, forestry, biological diversity, water resources, the urban environment, energy and petroleum, and mining and industry.

For example, the report recommends harnessing the country’s natural resources to create jobs, generate revenue to fund basic services and improve its standing in the Human Development Index (HDI), which could improve the country’s prospects for peace and stability. More specifically, it recommends improving: resource governance and sustainability; accountability; community participation; mechanisms for dispute resolution, reduced competition for resources and improved transboundary resource management; land tenure issues and land management; and wealth-sharing arrangements among conflicting parties to build peace.

Sustainable and equitable management of resources, such as forests, oil, water and minerals, will contribute to peace and economic prosperity.

Regarding SDG implementation, the report states that South Sudan’s main challenges relate to, inter alia: institutional arrangements; adequacy of financing and means of implementation; and partnerships with stakeholders and the private sector. It explains that adapting and implementing the SDGs will require relevant ministries to review targets and indicators, and prioritize and incorporate them into national policy documents to help sectoral planning.

The report provides recommendations for achieving the SDGs, peacebuilding through natural resources, and using the environment as an investment platform in South Sudan. The study makes recommendation of particular relevance to, among others, SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 15 (life on land), SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) and SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

For example, the report recommends that South Sudan, inter alia: manage internal migration; develop the agriculture and fisheries sectors; develop an industrial base to create income-generating activities and employment; attract investments for infrastructure financing and tourism; develop policy and legislative frameworks and strengthen institutional capacity for natural resource development, management and conservation; establish enforcement mechanisms for protecting wetlands, forests and wildlife; and increase climate resilience.

The report further recommends that the government: determine how best to remedy the land tenure issue, and propose and implement the necessary legislation; develop wildlife tourism by implementing sustainable tourism strategies and policies; take steps towards meeting its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), including by seeking donor support; link energy development plans to climate vulnerability; include adaptation targets in its revised NDC; and prevent and resolve transboundary disputes over water resources, so water acts as a “catalyst for cooperation” among Nile Basin countries.

The report also calls for, inter alia: building national capacity to collect, manage and share environmental data and information to track environmental change and assess implementation of programmatic goals; addressing access to natural resources; an investment platform that considers the growing role for environment and natural resources; and a portfolio of opportunities to attract investment.

The report was launched on World Environment Day on 5 June 2018.

In response to meeting the expected demand of the future populous – and the standards for sustainable urbanisation set out in the United Nations’ New Urban Agenda, Habitat III – The African Union (AU) developed Agenda 2063. But, how will we get from the current state to that envisioned in the Agenda 2063 – for a united and prosperous Africa?

To address this question, experts from WSP in Africa have shared their insights on leveraging the transformative power of urbanisation to seize opportunities and build an impactful legacy for the future of Africa’s cities.

Integration at the core of long-term planning

Alison Groves, regional director, WSP, Building Services, Africa, says: “Smart cities are generally thought of as technology marvels that are totally connected and integrated. We are seeing growth in the direction towards technologically ‘smart cities’, where a lot of metropoles are focusing on introducing smart technology into their city scape, but there is a lot of room for improvement in Africa. Also, I believe that in the African context, and knowing the challenges faced in African cities with infrastructure deficit to support the population growth we are seeing, we need to take a different approach.”

A World Bank report1 highlighted that there are three key and reoccurring challenges with Africa’s rapid urbanisation; the cities are too crowded, not integrated, and it is expensive to live in African cities. To meet the standards set in the New Urban Agenda, cities in Africa must become far more reasonable for people to thrive and environmentally friendly.

“In Africa and if we are going to achieve the aspirations laid out in the Agenda 2063, there needs to be more focus on infrastructure development that will support sustainable cities that are totally integrated – and cities that are ‘people’ focused. This will mean reviewing all current infrastructure plans and projects to understand what is the socioeconomic and environmental impact of these,” adds Groves.

Herbert Phahlane, Director: Traffic and transportation, WSP, Commercial Civils, Africa, resonates this sentiment. “If we consider the current state of prioritisation of infrastructure projects by African nations, in many respects, this needs to be readjusted. The Agenda 2063 provides a long-term vision and set of seven aspirations. What we need now is an integrated actionable plan that takes into consideration the development priorities of each region and provides a step-by-step implementable roadmap that also encapsulates how people will live, work and play – towards and well beyond 2063.”

Phahlane recognises there are infrastructure projects and plans being implemented, or are in the pipeline, however believes that the effective implementation of infrastructure projects should be considered in earnest – of what will benefit people, communities, trade and industry.

“We should be undertaking an economic impact assessment process to understand the ‘real potential’ socio and economic impact and, if based on this, the projects currently being fast-tracked are in fact the right projects – that will add to the long-term resilience and sustainable inclusive economic growth for future societies. This will better enable us to design projects based on what the future demand on infrastructure networks will be – to allow us to potentially leapfrog current implementation constraints and get ahead of the demand curve that will support sustainable development and growth going forward,” says Phahlane.

Connecting communities to seize opportunities

“Part of the integration challenge is that the cities and urban nodes are spread out across far reaching spaces and are fragmented. This also adds to the expense for people who live outside of cities, but need to travel into the cities to pursue valuable employment opportunities,” says Phahlane.

“To rectify this, focus needs to be placed on infrastructure projects that will interlink these nodes, open opportunities for people to move within and between nodes with much greater ease – and in so doing, support growth in the second economy and encourage more inclusive participation in the mainstream economy.”

The New Urban Agenda has placed significant focus on how people will move within and between cities. Futureproof planning therefore means that the bigger picture must involve the integration of major transportation infrastructure projects with provincial and municipal development. It must also consider planning for and the development of the critical mass of support infrastructure that feeds into and from the primary infrastructure.

“Public transport infrastructure therefore still has a crucial role to play in the future of African cities. It’s not surprising that plans to expand all modes of public transport is on the development agenda for most African states. However, these expansion plans will only be affective and successful as they are integrated into the larger regional and cross-regional transport networks. Changing how we think about, plan, design and build integrated public transport networks will bode increased confidence by people – and towards effecting positive change in mindsets about the reliability, safety and comfort of public transport solutions,” adds Phahlane.

Technology as an integrator and enabler

Groves says: “Part of focusing on people is also looking at how technology can be introduced and used to improve access to services and the quality of life city dwellers. Technology must be considered a social and growth enabler, but in context of the bigger vision.”

Citing Kigali as a keen example, Groves says: “Rwanda has come out of a very war-torn situation from the early nineties and today Kigali is one of the flourishing cities in Africa – largely because of the opportunities offered by a strong technology-based backbone.”

“We cannot escape that we are living in a world that is increasingly being transformed and driven by advances in technology. To ensure we are not left behind in the latest revolution, we must embrace technology and ensure that our cities are technologically enabled and powered. This will drive immense opportunities for people living in our cities to have access to services, but also information. More connected and informed city dwellers will make help make our cities smarter,” says Phahlane.

Digitalisation presents incredible opportunities for African nations to leapfrog some of the traditional development trajectories. While in its infancy in Africa, improving cost effective Internet access and adopting digital technology could drive radical changes that can boost access to social infrastructure in the short- to medium-term, such as e-Learning and e-Health services, for example. Furthermore, in the long-term, embracing disruptive innovation as part of the process to deliver complex and sustainable projects presents opportunities to implement changes now that will transform how we view and use infrastructure, ensuring that it is enriched and future proofed.

Future proof approach to sustainability

Climate change and changes in and extreme weather events present inevitable risks that African nations will be faced with.

“Given the scarcity of access to resources, many current basic services infrastructure plans are reliant on one solution. For example, one water solution, or one energy solution. However, this poses eventual risks to a city’s supply services,” says Groves.

Groves explains that the City of Cape Town is a prime recent example. The city has always been very reliant on the Twee Water dam. In responding to the water crisis, the city had to look at alternative sources and solutions for water supply in the region. “If the City of Cape Town had had more diverse water supply from the onset, the region would have been more resilient through the drought.”

“We need to understand that without intervention the urban form of the city will not rapidly and materially transform itself towards being more efficient and sustainable. Going forward and as we look to adapt our cities to be more low carbon cities, we need to look at diverse solutions – things that network with each other, but can operate independently – and that promote resilience, particularly considering climate change to come,” adds Groves.

WSP believes that to develop a sustainable city, the barriers of isolation must be broken down and a holistic and integrated design must be considered upfront; including transport, future energy, climate change strategy, water, waste management and socio-ecological systems, housing, etc. as well as intelligent systems powered by telecommunications and technology adoption.

“Building a smart, sustainable city is a complex undertaking for any economy. On a microeconomic scale, a town or city has layers of impact that extend far beyond the boundaries of individual building projects, including on the atmosphere, built environment, urban infrastructure, natural attributes, and social impacts, etc. It is only when we design and plan for the homogenous growth of all these layers together that we will achieve future cities that are ergonomic, more sustainable and innovatively smart for a future where society can really thrive,” concludes Groves.

In a series of 4 episodes, Alison Groves (Regional Director, Sustainability Consulting) and Herbert Phahlane (Director, Traffic & Transportation) explore the idea of a smart African city and its opportunities.

In recent weeks, for example, New York City declared it will be the first major city to report directly to the United Nations on its progress toward the relevant economic, social, and environment targets for 2030. This came shortly after an array of Canadian federal ministers emphasized the goals’ importance both domestically and internationally. Meanwhile, in the big leagues of business, many of the world’s foremost institutional investors have indicated (e.g., here, here, and here) they are considering integrating the SDGs into their investment processes. Even Kanye West, the celebrity artist, posted the 17 goals for his 28 million Twitter followers, to many people’s surprise.

Will the momentum continue to build? The SDGs still have a long road to travel if they want to penetrate broader public consciousness, at least as measured by traditional media coverage. This assertion is based on findings from our recent article published in Global Policy, which tracks the evolution of predecessor Millennium Development Goal (MDG) and SDG mentions in a cross-section of 16 major print media outlets and 13 academic journals from 2000 to 2016, updating results from a working paper first published in 2015. It is undeniable that the nature of public discourse has evolved rapidly over the past decade, especially in the context of digital technologies—two-thirds of Americans now report getting their news on social media sites—but newspaper content provides a consistent analytical benchmark that can be tracked all the way back to 2000.

Our paper found that, in advanced economy media markets, coverage of global goals jumps in U.N. summit years but tends to lag in off-summit years. To illustrate, Figure 1 indicates the annual frequency of MDG and SDG mentions in three major newspapers: The Guardian, the Financial Times, and The New York Times. In these outlets, there was a gradual buildup of MDG coverage during the early 2000s, followed by pronounced spikes linked to major U.N. summits in 2005, 2008, and 2010. Each newspaper then had a relative lull in coverage before another upward tick in 2015, the year of the major SDG adoption summit. In both The Guardian and The New York Times, MDG-SDG coverage was greater in 2015 than in any of the previous 15 years, while the upswing was more modest in the Financial Times. But in 2016, coverage across all three papers dropped to numbers typical of a pre-2015 non-summit year. At least up to the end of 2016, it was not clear if these news outlets were paying substantively different attention to the SDGs than they had been to the MDGs.

Figure 1. MDG and SDG coverage across select advanced economy newspapers, 2000-2016

Figure 2 shows fairly different dynamics for a selection of newspapers from emerging economies: The Times of India, The Star (of South Africa), and the Vanguard (of Nigeria). Although these papers don’t have searchable data all the way back to the early 2000s, the first thing that jumps out in the figure is the somewhat higher number of MDG-SDG mentions compared to the publications from advanced economies in Figure 1. However, the three papers saw only a small jump in coverage in 2015. Then The Star and the Vanguard saw a typical post-summit year drop in mentions in 2016. The Times of India was a notable exception: It was one of only two papers in our sample that had its highest number of MDG-SDG mentions in 2016, relative to the preceding years. (The other was USA Today, which had only two relevant articles in 2016, compared to one in each of a handful of earlier years.) It would be unwise to draw too many conclusions from these simple article counts, but they do suggest that the SDGs might have already become a significantly more common reference point in India than the MDGs were during the full period up to 2015.

ACADEMIC PAPERS

Our Global Policy article also considers the extent to which the MDGs were referenced across a range of prominent relevant academic outlets through the end of 2015. (Given the longer gestation periods for many academic papers, we thought it too early to examine SDG mentions at the time of submission.) When our working paper found that the global health journal The Lancet had the highest number of MDG references among 12 academic journals we examined, we originally wrote, “… it is probably not a coincidence that global health saw the most significant MDG breakthroughs.” Our new version adds The BMJ (formerly British Medical Journal) to the sample, lending further support to this hypothesis. The prevalence of MDG references in The Lancet and The BMJ suggest that at least some portion of the health research community considered itself as MDG protagonist—an outlook seemingly not shared across all academic disciplines. The leading economics journals, for instance, rank among the lowest in terms of MDG references. Nonetheless, World Development, the prominent cross-disciplinary social science journal, did register the largest share of articles mentioning the MDGs, at 8.6 percent.

In our original working paper, we also found that the World Bank and regional development banks’ research papers paid only modest specific attention to the MDGs. A more up-to-date look at the numbers tells a similar story: In 2015, only 6.6 percent of World Bank policy research working papers made mention of the MDGs. As for the SDGs, according to a quick search earlier this month of the World Bank’s working papers site, only nine World Bank policy research working papers published since 2015 mention the term “sustainable development goals.” The SDGs don’t yet appear to set an important guide star for the organization’s policy research machinery.

WHAT NEXT?

Next month the U.N. will convene its annual “high-level political forum” on the SDGs. This is where different countries take turns each year to describe their own progress toward the goals and map out next steps. Amid all the likely discussions on indicators, policies, and processes, one of the most important things for delegates to discuss is how to engage people far away from the U.N. spotlight—citizens, businesses, researchers, journalists, and social media users alike—to make them feel included in the SDG debates. Achieving the goals will require thoughtful ongoing conversations in communities around the globe. The increasingly decentralized and digitized nature of public discourse will require new approaches to promoting SDG-relevant debates. Each constituency needs to figure out its own path. Sustained spotlights from public and private leaders could help provide a crucial first step.

To solve the problem of increasingly erratic water, “business as usual is really not acceptable anymore,” said Will Sarni, founder of WetDATA.org, who called for new, innovative ideas: “Hope is not a strategy.”

Food and Floods: Challenges

“Agriculture currently uses about 70 percent of the world’s freshwater resources, with only about 10 percent going to cities and residents, and 20 percent going to industry,” said Kate Tully, Assistant Professor of Agroecology at the University of Maryland. Water is “embedded in the foods that we eat,” she said; the most “water hungry” foods—like beef and pork—represent much more water use than poultry and legumes.

Through agricultural products, virtual water moves around the world. “The globalization of trade has decoupled the environmental effects that are a result of our agricultural production from the places that are consuming those products,” said Tully. “We now are relying very heavily on a few water-rich regions to provide most of our food.”

But environmental changes, including climate change, may threaten this reliance. For example, at the current rate of sea-level rise, a good portion of habitable and agricultural land space in Bangladesh will be underwater. In Africa and Asia, eight major crops may be lost by 2050, warned Tully.

Droughts and floods in the United States also threaten trade. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which manages navigable rivers, channels, and dams, can recover from floods relatively quickly, said Kathleen White, the lead of the Corps’ Climate Preparedness and Resilience Community of Practice. But droughts can present significant challenges: If “you can’t get any barges down the river, then there’s a real problem.” Improving the United States’ hydroclimatic forecasts will help improve dam management, she said.

“Hope Is Not a Strategy”: Solutions

To solve these problems, we must “think about 21st century infrastructure, beyond just centralized systems,” said Sarni. The private sector is moving from supply-side concepts like managing water risk to a more proactive approach to water stewardship. But for Sarni, companies should move even further—towards water innovation—by focusing on the opportunities for business growth and value creation.

“Digital water is the game changer in the world of water: applying information and communication technologies to a sector that desperately needs it, so we know how much water we’re using and how we’re using it,” said Sarni. He called for a shift away from “using water once and throwing it away” towards the circular economy concept of “one water,” which involves diversifying sources and “reusing water over and over again” to maximize efficiency.

California’s West Basin Municipal Water District has adopted technological solutions to diversify water sources and ensure a “balanced approach to water reliability,” said Scott Houston, member of the district’s board of directors. The water recycling plant in El Segundo, California, generates water suitable for industrial and agricultural uses and replenishes seawater barriers that prevent saltwater from getting into freshwater aquifers. The district has also launched an ambitious program to test large-scale desalination to increase future supplies.

Smaller-scale solutions can also help mitigate the risks of erratic water. Distributed, off-stream storage—instead of large storage dams—could increase the flexibility to deal with erratic water supplies, said White. Farmers can improve water efficiency by building micro-dams for irrigation or by keeping agricultural land moist through mulching or intercropping, said Tully.

However, any technological solution brought into the developing world should consider the local context. While living in Kenya and Tanzania, Tully saw some projects fail due to lack of local capacity, such as solar-powered micro-irrigation systems scavenged for parts within a year. “You couldn’t even buy the right-size PVC pipe, because they don’t make it in Africa,” she said. In some regions, White pointed out, wells might not be a good solution if the water’s contact with the soil can cause health issues, such as arsenic poisoning.

Overall, we need to embrace holistic solutions that avoid silos and consider perspectives from the economic, policy, technology and business sectors, said Wilson Center Global Fellow Ladeene Freimuth. “These types of solutions—the innovation, the creativity–will be part of creating a more sustainable, resilient, and secure water future for us all.”","Water is “embedded in the foods that we eat,” she said; the most “water hungry” foods—like beef and pork—represent much more water use than poultry and legumes.

A commitment to send zero soap to landfills. A pledge to double local sourcing of food and other resort supplies. Those are just three of the dozens of individual efforts that will be undertaken in hotel giant Hilton’s journey to cut its environmental footprint in half by 2030.

Hilton is no stranger to energy efficiency, waste reduction and water conservation. The company already has saved an estimated $1 billion, for instance, from investment in its LightStay measurement platform. But Hilton’s recent decision to embrace science-based targets for shrinking its footprint represents a new level of urgency in addressing the problem, according to Daniella Foster, senior director of global corporate responsibility at Hilton.

""The entire travel and tourism industry is going to rely on being sustainable,"" Foster said during a plenary conversation at VERGE Hawaii. ""Being sustainable economically, ensuring that local communities benefit and being sustainable environmentally.""

Many elements of the massive travel and tourism sector are indeed traveling down the path toward a more sustainable business model — one that prioritizes deeper attention to environmental impacts and a higher sensitivity to social and cultural issues, while still allowing for economic growth.

This week, for example, United Airlines announced its intention to methodically review and address the impact of operations for its network of airport lounges in collaboration with Audobon International. The airline already boasts the industry’s most aggressive commitment to commercial-scale aviation biofuels.

But Foster and her fellow panelists also recognize that much of the work happening behind the scenes isn’t necessarily translated to guests or members of the communities in which hotels or airlines operate.

""I think that measurement needs to start to come out front so the community, our guests and the people that work in the hotel understand that this is their responsibility,"" said Ernie Nishizaki, principal and managing member of Acumen Advisor, a consulting firm in Honolulu.

I think that measurement needs to start to come out front so the community, our guests and the people that work in the hotel understand that this is their responsibility.

The Hawaii Tourism Authority (HTA) already publishes monthly figures about occupancy, visits to parks and attractions, and other metrics. Nishizaki asked: Why not start sharing data about the carbon footprint, water usage, energy efficiency or local procurement strategies of hotels, resorts and rental car companies? Hotel property managers and local residents should be far more aware of these figures, he argued. This could be accomplished by displaying metrics on signage in hotel lobbies or at public attractions, for example.

'The X factor'

The concept of ""sustainable tourism"" is one component of a dashboard developed for the Aloha+ Challenge, or Hawaii’s statewide commitment to uphold principles of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. Right now, the tool specifically tracks businesses that are certified in ecotourism. The organization behind the dashboard, Hawaii Green Growth, actively seeks to include other metrics.

""The X factor in this conversation that really hasn’t been brought up is the guest engagement and consumer engagement,"" agreed Hilton’s Foster, pointing to her company’s recent 72,00-person guest survey suggesting that at least one-third of potential travelers — especially those younger than 25 — are actively research the environmental policies of a hotel company before booking a stay.

That’s one reason that Hilton is planning to add information generated in its LightStay management platforms, such as the energy efficiency of a property or even an individual guest’s contributions, into the mobile app for its frequent guests, she said.

Tourism is Hawaii’s biggest industry: more than 9.4 million people visited the islands in 2017, generating $16.8 billion in spending, according to HTA data. ""The economy of this place is completely dependent on being a place that is welcoming and in demand by tourists,"" observed Hawaiian Airlines CEO Peter Ingram.

Like other carriers, Hawaiian focuses considerable attention on reducing fuel consumption — by lightweighting cargo of all sorts, catering carts, even what’s placed in seatback pockets. It will be some time before battery technology is capable of keeping hundreds of ""souls"" aloft in a commercial airplane, Ingram said. For now, his team is prioritizing investments in technology and biofuels.

But Hawaiian Airlines is unique because of its focus on serving the 50th state. ""We’re not in the business of flying people from Point A to Point B; we’re in the business of flying people from Point A to Hawaii,"" Ingram said.

That implies a special responsibility to ensure that the airline’s ground operations are on a path to increase local sourcing. The official beer on board all its domestic and international routes, for example, comes from craft brewer Maui Brewing, billed as the ""largest authentic Hawaiian brewery""

And in April, Hawaiian Airlines began a collaboration with Raw Elements, which makes sunscreen specially formulated to not damage coral reefs. The chemicals oxybenzone and octinoxate, which show up in most of the world’s leading sun protection products, are toxic to many corals. Hawaii has banned those ingredients starting in 2021, and Hawaiian Airlines is showing in-flight educational videos meant to highlight this issue with would-be snorkelers, swimmers and scuba divers.","""The entire travel and tourism industry is going to rely on being sustainable,"" Foster said during a plenary conversation at VERGE Hawaii.

Agus Suryono was a struggling oil palm farmer in his Indonesian village where the economy was dependent on palm plantations. He earned $150-200 a month (converted from Indonesian rupiah).

Five years ago, he joined a locally operated social economy program to educate farmers on best practices for community agriculture and forestry. He learned environmentally friendly methods to improve fertilizer, grow seeds and use equipment.

Since his time in the program, Suryono switched from farming oil palm to vegetables and livestock. Today, he’s grown his chili pepper farm to earn $3,000 a month and employs 15 fellow villagers. He even speaks internationally, including at United Nations events, about supporting local farmers in taking up eco-friendly, forest-based livelihoods.

This is just one of many stories about how supporting local farmers can lead to lasting change for both the individual and the environment as a whole.

The program Suryono participated in was Asia Pulp and Paper’s Integrated Forestry and Farming System (IFFS) Program. You might ask, ""Why is a forestry company teaching farmers to grow vegetables?""

Smallholders are the base of the pyramid of agricultural producers and companies with a major stake in the world’s ecosystem should care. Subsistence farming is important to us in the business of growing trees for pulp and paper. Conversion of crop land to pasture, while separate from pulp and paper production, is the single largest direct cause of tropical deforestation. Agriculture drives 80 percent of tropical deforestation and generates as much as 25 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. As neighbors, it is vital to establish shared sustainability values.

Smallholders are the base of the pyramid of agricultural producers and companies with a major stake in the world’s ecosystem should care, even if it seems outside of the commodity of their supply chain.

Revolutionizing sustainable farming

We need a new ""green"" revolution in agriculture that does not pit forests against crops or people against plants. We can take the following steps to build community engagement programs that address social issues impacting deforestation:

Self-reflect. The first step is always self-refection. APP continually reviews its operations to assess how to achieve a deforestation-free supply chain. With significant risks related to land conflict, forest encroachment and fires for agricultural land clearing, we see the need to work with each village impacted to build more forest-friendly livelihoods so communities can thrive.

Consider diversity among communities. Companies may operate across vast areas of land — APP’s concessions spread across five provinces on two islands and cover over 6.42 acres — so it’s important to recognize each village’s diverse cultural and geographic characteristics when building community engagement programs. Each community has different priorities and ways of affecting the environment.

Build community ownership. Each village must help build a flexible program so the community will own it and sustain it over time. The IFFS program provides funding to each village to start the initial project of their choice and then participants expand the program by paying it forward, such as giving a cow to a neighbor to begin a livestock farm.

Measure impact. Quantifying the reach and impact along the way is necessary to see if the program is beneficial to community farmers and the larger ecosystem. Since implementing the IFFS program, APP has reached 189 villages and more than 13,800 households with the goal to reach 500 villages by 2020. We are also working with the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) and the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) to measure the environmental and social impact of IFFS program. The program has taken us outside of our comfort zone and measuring our results has taught us we need to hone the program, and sometimes seek external expertise, as we help support small-scale farming.

It will take time to achieve the next green revolution where forests, businesses and agriculture work together to mitigate deforestation. Along the way, corporations must think beyond their own supply chains to address risks across the landscape.","Five years ago, he joined a locally operated social economy program to educate farmers on best practices for community agriculture and forestry.

Now developers are rising to the challenge with inherently sustainable and higher quality residential building designs and materials.

Despite being a nation that historically embraced technological innovation with passion across both society and industry, Australian building has for the main been a traditionalist sector.

For at least the last 50 years, so much of Australia’s urban development and our housing affordability debate have been characterised by a rush to quickly release dwellings with a focus on lowering building costs – too often sacrificing quality, long-term liveability and environmental sustainability in the process.

Today, the results of lower quality builds in the harsh Australian environment are all too evident, far from what we hoped for in terms of endurance and amenity.

Large tracts of initially ‘affordable’ or social housing on shrinking suburban fringes are now well beyond their useable lifespan. As they deteriorate, the houses which from the start required high levels of energy consumption to remain comfortable, now carry rising long term costs for occupants or owners.

So the question is where to next? And how do we evolve, improve and create an affordable and sustainable model of housing that creates engaged and inclusive communities?

﻿

Innovation makes a welcome return

The good news is things are changing, and for the better.

As Australia’s cities and regions grow and renew, we’re becoming more aware and astute in our home ownership and investment aspirations.

We now demand excellence in design and build quality based on environmental sensitivity that genuinely works for people living in thoughtfully planned communities – not just vast suburban tracts built for a swift sale.

Thoughtful, well-designed communities where the interplay between space, homes and amenities enhances the experience for those living there.

Importantly, a significant enhancement to the quality of new Australian builds is being spearheaded by international developer Sekisui House, which is creating master planned communities in New South Wales and Queensland.

These homes not only utilise world-leading architectural excellence and thoughtful design, but also the highest quality materials and building principles which elegantly optimise space and comfort.

Recent Australian developments by Sekisui House, like Sydney’s iconic Central Park, have already garnered top architecture awards for multi-dwelling excellence, innovation and sustainability.

What’s perhaps less known is the quiet revolution in house building materials, methods and technology the Japanese-founded company is pioneering in Australia’s suburbs that extends well beyond the limitations of bricks.

[foogallery id=”94865″]

SHAWOOD: creating a system of lasting and sustainable building excellence

If the notion of high vaulted ceilings and exposed timber beams that elegantly accentuate the natural beauty of organic design seem only within reach of those whose houses appear on the hit TV show Grand Designs, think again.

For more than 50 years, Sekisui House has relentlessly focussed on delivering excellence to residential building not just through design, but the development of high performance structural systems and proprietary materials that raise the quality of houses.

At Gledswood Hills, in Sydney’s south west, this approach has resulted in houses built on the SHAWOOD system, which uses laminated timber posts, beams and cladding to create a far greater range of housing options and designs than otherwise possible using traditional methods.

Sekisui House’s SHAWOOD product development and manufacturing manager, Makoto Ochiai, is adamant houses built on the highly refined and tested system are not only there for the long-haul – but are also designed to integrate with the landscape.

“Our design focuses on connecting, or even incorporating, landscape elements within the house. Timeless design allows residents to be able to live in their homes and love their homes longer, independently of trends,” Ochiai says.

﻿

The quiet achiever

Just as importantly, the precision engineering and computer aided manufacturing of SHAWOOD materials allow for better insulated and energy efficient homes. This, and thoughtful design, ensures they’re naturally acoustically quieter as well.

“Internal thermal comfort is heavily impacted by insulation but also how air tight and precise the buildings are constructed. SHAWOOD was developed in Japan, where the temperature and humidity changes dramatically between four distinct seasons. It was developed to have a minimal impact of the outdoor climate conditions by providing high insulation and air tight performances,” Ochiai says.

Those performance characteristics are clearly well suited to Australia’s climatic demands, where summer temperatures in and around cities soar beyond 40 degrees Celsius during summer days and nudge zero in winter.

Ochiai notes the heavily tested and proven precision of SHAWOOD is where the optimised passive building performance and its environmental payoffs come into play.

“Our recent research shows that the SHAWOOD homes have 65 per cent less air leakage area compared to conventionally built homes. This would not only provide greater comfort but also have a significant impact to ongoing electricity costs,” Ochiai says.

“On average a SHAWOOD home achieves more than six stars under the NSW energy rating tool known as BASIX, saving literally thousands of dollars from day one without the need for augmenting expensive upfront tech or bespoke energy reducing specifications.”

[foogallery id=”94858″]

Systems for sustainability: why precision pays

Sustainability has always been a core philosophy of Sekisui House, not just in Australia and Japan, but globally.

While the environmental credentials of SHAWOOD material and products might start from the sourcing of eco-certified timbers from sustainably managed forests in Northern Europe, it’s really only the beginning in the holistic execution of Sekisui House’s building and wider corporate ethos.

The high degree of precision manufacturing and quality control extend throughout SHAWOOD by using prefabricated material components that dramatically reduce on-site wastage and ensure a cost efficient construction.

With Australia now experiencing substantial growth in building starts, waste elimination isn’t just about the financial bottom line, it’s imperative to the elimination of landfill inputs.

The use of renewable materials, as opposed to conventional ‘brick veneer’, also reduces the carbon footprint, especially when coupled with passive and energy efficient designs.

Clever comfort

When it comes to the livability and layout of SHAWOOD homes, Sekisui House’s Australian Sales, Marketing and Customer Relations Manager Craig Barnes says distinctly organic design principles offer seamless flow and effortless connection between indoor and outdoor areas.

Careful consideration of solar orientation, depth of eaves and window placement,in conjunction with. SHAWOOD’s advanced exterior cavity wall system, allows the home to breathe, promoting air flow and managing moisture levels. Most importantly these features enhance comfort while reducing energy consumption, with less reliance upon air conditioning.

Resilience inside and out

If Australia’s often harsh environment has thrown up one major challenge for builders and owners alike, it’s creating a resilient exterior that actively aids the inside of a dwelling while still protecting it from the environment.

Bricks can trap ambient heat or cold as well as absorbing moisture from both the ground and atmosphere. In environments where dust and other particles are often present, maintenance and cleaning can become a recurring overhead.

Where SHAWOOD differs in this respect is that the main exterior walls includes a Nano-Hydrophilic coating offering extreme durability and low maintenance.

A unique exterior wall ventilation system allows the escape of condensation, reducing the long-term risk of frame damage, whilst providing stable thermal and acoustic comfort.

“The main exterior of a SHAWOOD home sheds dust and grime and repels heat, says Barnes.

“The nano-hydrophilic coating makes it possible for built-up dirt and pollution to be cleaned by a light shower. Furthermore, unique multiple waterproofing layers safeguard the structural integrity of the home, allowing the building to breathe, reducing the risk of moisture.”

[foogallery id=”94851″]

Lasting communities: timeless design goes the distance

As Australia’s communities continue to grow across both metropolitan and regional areas, the opportunity to consciously embrace a future built on functional, inclusive healthy and sustainable communities has never been more important.

Now, more than ever before, government, citizens and industry alike must rise to the challenge of creating lasting change for the better, built on the lessons of the past – whether it’s embracing proven design principles or changing the way we think about and use innovative building techniques, materials and technology.

Sekisui House was founded on the belief that that an enduring and sustainable society is one that is based on a balanced, global eco-system, where all people can live in comfort. Today, it remains committed to maintaining the four core values of sustainable urban development – social, environmental, economic and residential value.

That may well be a change from the conventional discourse and delivery of housing in Australia, but it’s change for the better.","Large tracts of initially ‘affordable’ or social housing on shrinking suburban fringes are now well beyond their useable lifespan.

“Textile waste is a global issue, and we should all do our part to reduce our collective clothing footprint,” said Tony Shumpert, VP of Reuse and Recycling at Savers. “It’s promising to see more consumers thinking twice before they throw their reusable goods in the trash, but that’s only part of the equation. In order to bring the cycle of reuse full circle, we need to inspire consumers to incorporate reuse into their day-to-day lives and purchasing decisions.”

The state of consumption

North Americans are buying and throwing away more textiles than ever. Each year, the world consumes 80 billion new pieces of clothing, and 26 billion pounds of clothing and textiles go into landfills — 95 percent of which could be reused or recycled.

Reuse as the solution

Although the State of Reuse Report shows that more people are finding ways to responsibly get rid of their used goods, rather than throw them away, that is only half of the problem. 60 percent of North Americans are still not shopping for reused items.

Why is this problematic? It takes 700 gallons of water for every t-shirt and 1,800 gallons of water for every pair of jeans to be produced. Each time consumers buy new, they’re exhausting the environment of those resources. Every time those items go to the landfill, so do the resources that went into creating them. The cost of our clothing is more than what’s on the price tag.

“Solving the global issue of clothing and textile waste is more than a matter of diverting items from landfills – the way clothing is produced is just as important,” Shumpert said. “New items must be produced with the intention that they will eventually be incorporated back into the reuse stream.”

Embracing the full circle of reuse

To change habits for the better, consumers must first better understand the impact of their actions. While a majority of people do say they recycle or donate their unwanted clothing and household goods, there is still progress to be made as nearly one in five still throw their reusable goods in the trash.

With nearly half (49 percent) of respondents reporting they were unaware that extending the life of a garment lowers its environmental footprint, informing the public of the power of reuse is key to changing this understanding and inspiring action. That’s why research and educational efforts are crucial to driving the revolution the clothing and textile industry needs.

Looking ahead to charter change

What will it take to drive more consumers to consider purchasing pre-owned goods? Of those who shop secondhand, Savers® found that saving money is the primary reason for 57 percent to do so. Shoppers are also in it for the thrill, with 69 percent saying that buying pre-owned goods feels like finding hidden treasure and 77 percent have been surprised by the great pre-owned items they’ve found. There are many benefits to shopping secondhand — it’s just a matter of communicating them more broadly.

“What our data shows is that if people better understood how their actions hurt or helped the planet, they would be more likely to make environmentally conscious decisions,” Shumpert said. “This makes us hopeful as we continue on our journey to educate and inspire more reuse-ful world. Reuse is the solution — it’s just up to us to embrace it.”","“Textile waste is a global issue, and we should all do our part to reduce our collective clothing footprint,” said Tony Shumpert, VP of Reuse and Recycling at Savers.

As the city’s population continues to grow at speed, it’s essential that we shift the transport balance – single occupancy car use simply cannot dominate the way we travel any more.

Cllr Lesley Macinnes

Establishing an integrated, sustainable transport system is at the heart of our local transport strategy, which envisions a green, healthy, accessible and connected city of the future.

Public transport is crucial to achieving this. In addition to the many external bus operators serving Edinburgh, including Stagecoach, Borders Buses and First, we have the award-winning Lothian Bus company. It is the largest publicly-owned bus service in the UK and is something that we’re immensely proud of.

That patronage continues to rise year-on-year, and customer satisfaction remains consistently high, is testament to its value to the city. As well as providing a reliable alternative to the car, catering to users of all abilities, the company clearly demonstrates green credentials, introducing its first all-electric vehicles last September as part of the ongoing upgrade of its fleet to electric, hybrid and lower-emission buses.

An efficient, integrated transport system is essential to any plan to create a truly green, sustainable city. Since being introduced in 2014, the successfully operating Edinburgh Tram has worked in tandem with Lothian Buses to provide excellent transport links and an effective, low emission option for those wishing to travel from Edinburgh Airport and through the city centre.

We recently completed six weeks of consultation on major infrastructure proposals for extending the tram line to Newhaven in the north of the city. This is by no means a done deal – there is still a degree of public engagement and detailed planning to be carried out before any final decision is made. But we can’t ignore the fact that Edinburgh is growing faster than any other city in Scotland. A modern, sustainable public transport system is critical to ensuring quality of life for residents and visitors alike.

Encouraging people to walk and cycle is key to this ambition too. Active travel is central to our commitment to improve air quality, along with the multitude of health and social benefits that journeys by foot or by bike can bring.

But these benefits will not be felt unless we back commitments up by creating a safe, welcoming environment for pedestrians and cyclists. This year we’ve again allocated 10% of our transport budget to cycling provision - the highest proportion of any Scottish council - meaning we can make real progress in this area.

We’re beginning to feel the effects too, with more and more people taking to two wheels – over 11,700 bike journeys were made daily last year, according to Sustrans’ latest Bike Life report.

Ongoing projects like the City Centre West to East Cycle Link, the West Edinburgh Active Travel Network and the Meadows to George Street route, which will each create safer and mostly segregated cycleways through Edinburgh, alongside significant pedestrian and public realm improvements, are part of our aspiration to make cycling a more attractive option for those who may be less confident.

One exciting development, which is certain to increase cycling further in the capital, is the introduction of a bike hire scheme by Transport for Edinburgh later this summer, bringing us in line with many major cities around the world and allowing a whole new group of people the opportunity to explore Edinburgh on bike or e-bike.

The pioneering roll-out of 20mph limits across Edinburgh – making us the first 20mph city in Scotland – was completed earlier this year, and this is bringing a more relaxed atmosphere to the streets and communities of Edinburgh and helping more people to cycle or stroll.

However, it’s essential that our efforts are not piecemeal, and Central Edinburgh Transformation will address this by pulling together the variety of projects taking place across the centre of Edinburgh, creating an ambitious action plan for a sustainable, healthy and safe future.

Our ambitions lie in tackling congestion and vehicle-dominated spaces, which will deliver a range of benefits, encouraging healthy and active travel, enhancing the environment and, importantly, reducing harmful and polluting emissions.

Still in its early stages, our plans for a Low Emission Zone (LEZ), funded and encouraged by the Scottish Government, will be pivotal to improving air quality for city-dwellers and visitors. Once in place, this will prove a significant tool to reduce harmful emissions.

We’re also focusing on improving the efficiency of motor travel for those who need to use a car. Our Enterprise Car Club lets motorists hire cars and vans as and when they need, in turn driving down car ownership. For those who do own a car, our parking permit scheme encourages less polluting engines, with lower charges for efficient vehicles and a forthcoming diesel surcharge, designed to discourage the use of diesel cars, which are known to produce higher emissions.

Perhaps most significantly, our Electric Vehicle Action Plan sets out an ambitious vision to expand eletric vehicle infrastructure across the city through the development of strategic charging zones linking with other future transport infrastructure. Getting the infrastructure in the right place to service a variety of needs in the city will be the key first step.

It is fundamental that our vision prioritises pedestrians, cyclists and public transport. Like so many other successful, forward-thinking European cities, we can and will create a city centre that is truly enjoyable to wander around, in which it’s easy to walk or cycle from A to B and that boasts a world-class, integrated public transport system.

We need to get things right so that future generations of residents and visitors can enjoy the excellent quality of life the capital has now become so synonymous with. While there is work to be done, we know that we are moving in the right direction and hope, in time, other cities will be able to look to us as an example of an effective, efficient sustainable transport hub.","City of Edinburgh Council’s transport and environment convener, Cllr Lesley Macinnes, discusses how its transport plans will help create a thriving, successful and sustainable capital of Scotland.

The Burwood Brickworks shopping centre, targeting Living Building Challenge certification, will be built by Melbourne-based builder Hacer Group, and is part of a $500 million masterplanned estate that will include 700 homes, community facilities, and 2.5 hectares of open space and parkland.

See our previous articles:

Frasers’ general manager – residential Victoria Sarah Bloom said getting DA approval had taken a long time due to the complexity of the undertaking.

“This community will set a new benchmark for what’s possible in sustainable urban design,” Ms Bloom said.

“This project exemplifies everything we stand for: building sustainable, liveable communities that promote the long-term health and wellbeing of our residents and, especially in the case of Burwood Brickworks, for visitors too.”

The 12,700-square-metre Burwood Brickworks shopping centre is aiming to become the world’s first Living Building Challenge retail project, which compels developments to be carbon, energy and water positive, amongst other demanding requirements.

The project will feature onsite solar PV as well as procure offsite renewable energy, which, together with battery storage, will generate 105 per cent of energy needs.

Other sustainability features include:

high-efficiency glazing

a central HVAC system that reuses waste heat

a greywater and blackwater recycling plant, resulting in net positive water use

reuse of 99 per cent of construction waste

use of local, salvaged and sustainable materials, including bricks and timbers

biophilic design including greenery, natural daylight and fresh air

an embedded energy network offering tenants cheap renewable and thermal energy

a rooftop urban farm and local produce cafe

It will also be targeting a 6 Star Green Star & As Built rating.

The design by NH Architecture is using “the concept of a ‘re-purposed’ factory shed as the foundation element in form and spirit”, according to managing director Roger Nelson.

“To us, this project meant an opportunity to be part of the solutions, to be a catalyst for changing behaviour,” he said. “So in a way, it is attempting to look at what the future has to hold for projects in our built environment with regards to materials, energy, water and waste.”

Net zero is commercially viable – and preferable

According to Frasers’ executive general manager – retail Peri Macdonald, the cost of the sustainability initiatives amounts to about $14 million, however he expects commercial returns to “more than justify” the investment.

“We will demonstrate that developing a net positive sustainable shopping centre – one that gives more than it takes from its environment – is not only commercially viable, but preferable,” Mr Macdonald said.

“The aim is to create a more comfortable centre to visit, designed to encourage people to stay, and it follows that with increased dwell times comes greater expenditure.”

The promise of higher turnover and lower tenant outgoings on energy means specialty rents can be set at about $1000 a sq m.

The project will be anchored by Woolworths, which has committed to a 4200 sq m lease, and a call has been put out to specialty retailers for tenancies ranging from 25-300 sq m. Frasers is targeting “progressive” food and beverage operators, but says it is “taking an open-minded approach” to the retail mix.

Woolworths senior property manager Brad Karge said the supermarket would also be implementing sustainability initiatives in store.

“The new Burwood Brickworks Woolworths store will draw power from the solar panels installed in the centre and be fitted out with LED lights to reduce power usage,” Mr Karge said.

“The store’s refrigeration and air-conditioning will generate a reduced carbon footprint and use natural refrigerants, and we will also have an area in-store where customers can bring in their soft plastics to be recycled.”

The development’s 700 homes – a mixture of freestanding homes and semi-detached terrace housing and apartments – is set to be on the market this Spring with completion scheduled for late 2020. Already 5000 expressions of interest have been received.

Expression of interest have also been coming in for the opportunity to run the centre’s rooftop urban farm, with more than 50 received so far. Negotiations have begun with shortlisted entries, with the successful candidate to be chosen mid-year.

All-in-all, the development is expected to create 3000 new jobs, including more than 700 ongoing jobs in the shopping centre.

Gurugram has emerged as a leading industrial and financial hub with the third highest per capita income in the country. However, rapid urbanization, burgeoning population, emerging employment opportunities and growing economy has placed tremendous stress on the infrastructure of the region. Despite witnessing phenomenal growth in the past few decades, a reliable, safe and sustainable transport system still eludes the city. A November 2017 report by Gurugram Metropolitan City Bus Limited has identified that majority of the population relies on Intermediate Public Transport which causes problems such as congestion, pollution, safety issues and poor quality of service. Further, the dilapidated condition of roads, traffic snarls, waterlogging, lack of road safety measures are among the host of issues that continue to plague the transport system of the city. Also, traffic in Gurugram has grown at an unsustainable pace and around 1 lakh vehicles being registered in the city every year.

In the present scenario Rapid Metro is one of the efficient modes of mass transit system. The city bus system which has the potential to reduce traffic congestion and enhance connectivity continues to be in a deplorable state. The survey—Implementation of City Bus Service Project in Gurugram–Bus Route Planning and Rationalization commissioned in May 2017 by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) found that 27% respondents cited ‘no route’ and 18% pointing out ‘crowding’ as the reasons for not preferring buses as the mode of transport.

The way forward for an efficient and reliable public transport in Gurugram is a three-pronged approach namely ‘Avoid, ‘Shift’ and ‘Improve’. “Avoid” policies strategizes focus on aspects of urban planning and land use regulations, which calls for compact & green cities thus, reducing the distance between workplaces, homes, shopping and leisure activity. “Shift” is more towards reducing vehicular use and optimization through carpooling, public transportation, vehicle sharing, “Improve” strategy encompasses improving and optimizing the vehicle use by making technological improvement in terms of renewable energy, vehicle design for space and safety.

The need of the hour is for an umbrella body on the lines of Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA) to integrate public transport system and provide a single window ticketing mechanism for commuters. Also, sufficient thrust should be laid on the public-private partnerships in areas such as investment and road safety and on encouraging cycling which entails a shift to ‘greener and healthier mode of transport. Road safety is another quintessential issue to make Gurugram a sustainable city. Greater efforts have to be made to explain policy changes to public through innovative communication campaigns which will go a long way in eliciting public support and awareness for a safe, reliable and efficient transport system in the city.","The need of the hour is for an umbrella body on the lines of Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA) to integrate public transport system and provide a single window ticketing mechanism for commuters.

144,https://www.conservationfinancenetwork.org/2018/06/20/investing-in-sustainable-fisheries,"Wed, 20 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Conservation Finance Network,Investing in Sustainable Fisheries,"A total of 31.4 percent of global fisheries are being fished at biologically unsustainable levels, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. However, a 2016 study by Costello and others said the application of sound management reforms to global fisheries will increase biomass by 619 million metric tons relative to a business-as-usual scenario.

One way to enable sustainable fisheries management is to target the activities of small-scale coastal fishing businesses. Given their socioeconomic status, coastal fishing enterprises typically lack the economic independence to be able to completely disengage from unsustainable practices that are in favor of lucrative catch. They also represent 90 percent of the total 30 million fishing businesses globally, according to the FAO. This shows their vital role in the transition toward sustainable fisheries.

It is critical for funding to be channelled into fishing businesses as a way to incentivize a behavioral shift toward sustainable practices. With government resources becoming increasingly constrained as some nations address multiple challenges, there is a greater need to leverage private capital. Despite this need, there is a scarcity of platforms and financial instruments available to channel resources toward fisheries.

Two organizations working to bridge this gap are Meloy Fund and Catch Together.

Meloy Fund is an impact investment fund that makes debt and equity investments in fishing-related enterprises that support the recovery of coastal fisheries in Indonesia and the Philippines. The fund is a subsidiary of Rare, a global conservation organization.

Catch Together partners with fishing communities in the United States and Canada to structure and finance impact investments. It also provides support services such as help for fishing communities in acquiring quotas.

Risky Business

Smallholder agriculture and small-scale fisheries have similar business models. But impact investments in the latter are trailing behind.

Dale Galvin, managing partner at Meloy Fund, said the unpredictability of fisheries is the reason for this. Kelly Wachowicz, cofounder, managing partner, and CFO at Catch Together, said that the “ocean environment is much more dynamic than terrestrial environments.” Therefore, “management systems and investment strategies need to be able to be adaptive to accommodate changes over time” that need to be successfully implemented in fisheries.

An additional reason for risk in fisheries is the difference in property rights. Unlike with agriculture, where land tenure is very clear, in fishing “you don’t have the right to generally manage your fishery,” Galvin said. As a result, “investments are much harder to organize” and “monitoring fisheries management strategies in the water is difficult,” Wachowicz said.

Investment Results

Building a track record of successful fisheries investments is key to creating established credibility and curtailing perceived risk. Meloy Fund and Catch Together do exactly that.

Meloy Fund looks at growth-oriented enterprises that have a direct connection to coastal fisheries. Galvin said not only are coastal fisheries an under-invested sector, they also “achieve most of the social and environmental objectives.” These include impacting the state of coral reefs, generating livelihoods for small-scale fishing enterprises, and benefiting the broader economy. Along with making its investments, the fund works to improve the management of coastal ecosystems.

Catch Together focuses at the harvest level. Its staff work with fishing communities to finance the purchase of quota rights. “It is these investments that are most aligned with long-term fishery health,” Wachowicz said. Investing downstream in the value chain often places added pressure on the fishery. In such cases, it is important to pair investments with a management strategy that accounts for the standards upstream.

Another dimension of Catch Together’s strategy is the cultivation of community leadership. According to Wachowicz, “Our thesis is that by working with communities to own quota, we create a long term economic interest for the community and fishermen that’s tied to the health of the fishery.”

In effect, there is inherent value being created in the fishery that is constantly adapting to changing fishing conditions.

Investor Uptake

While there is a strong impact case that can be made for fisheries, it is up to players like Meloy Fund and Catch Together to build a strong investment case.

As a first-time fund in a new sector, Meloy Fund is seeing encouraging interest from investors. Galvin said the partnership with Rare is critical to the fund’s value proposition.

“Rare is scaling coastal fisheries management in the countries Meloy is operating in. So you have this great opportunity to marry governance and management with investment,” Galvin said.

However, there is some difficulty in building investment traction. This is because the investor mentality is typically that “no one wants to be first,” Galvin said. “The downsides of being in a new sector [include] that it is not easy to make a decision because there are not a lot of data.”

Wachowicz said flexible investment terms are key in this sector. For instance, foundations can often provide program related investments (PRIs) at 1-3 percent interest with 3-5-year terms. In contrast, fisheries investments may require longer amortization terms. Equity transactions can offer as low as 5-6 percent annual cash yields and up to 12-15 percent in total return. These types of strategies would require a 5-10-year investment horizon.

Apart from foundations, it is predominantly family offices that are active investors, Wachowicz said. While there is a lot of appetite from institutions, the challenge of scale limits their participation. “We work with investments that are as small as $100,000 USD as the first step – and this might lead to a $2-3 million USD portfolio.”

This tends to be too small for institutional investors who manage billion-dollar USD portfolios, seeking minimum investment commitments of $25 million-$50 million in size. At this early stage of market development, there are not yet opportunities to make commitments at that scale.

Higher Impact

Both Wachowicz and Galvin said there is a potential for larger-scale investment vehicles like blue bonds to attract private capital into fisheries. For instance, Rare is looking at bonds as a way for governments to “finance dramatic increases in the amount they allocate to coastal fisheries management,” Galvin said.

However, for private capital to be properly absorbed in this sector, fisheries need to be managed well.

“So where is the government going to get money to increase fisheries management?” Galvin asked. “If they do go out to the market, invest in a blue bond, and then raise that money and deploy it correctly – [and see] the benefits of spending that money on fisheries management in terms of fish, jobs, food security, and climate change - all of these benefits can be measured and more than pay back the cost of the bond.”

While blue bonds would deliver the scale that institutional investors look for, there are added complexities when adapting them to fisheries. Wachowicz said that while it may be challenging to create a larger scale of public-private partnerships and use creative financial structuring to develop blue bonds, they represent a promising direction for sustainable fisheries financing.

Future Investments

Along with wild-catch fisheries, investments in aquaculture also offer huge opportunity. According to Galvin, there is a strong sustainability angle for investing in aquaculture because it reduces pressure on wild-caught fisheries and also provides stable incomes to fishing enterprises. Similarly, Wachowicz said that the technical innovation allowed by aquaculture creates room for building companies to scale.

In the end, investment return in fisheries is less of an issue for investors than the complexity and risk of the transaction structures. Wachowicz said the long investment time periods required as well as the lack of initial project-development capital are barriers to private-sector investment. “Efforts to support the creation of fisheries investment blueprints and projects can facilitate capital flow to the sector and also serve to help investors become more comfortable with the transaction complexities.”

Investor participation to date has been encouraged by risk-mitigating instruments like guarantees.

Galvin said the presence of guarantees “changes the risk profile significantly” and motivates investors sitting on the fence to “pull the trigger.” Wachowicz said that “at this point, almost every fishery-management investment has been accompanied by some kind of subsidy, suggesting that blended finance strategies may be more successful in the short run than purely privately funded investments.”

While large-scale investments are indeed the goal, at present it appears that direct investments are the way to go. So are sector-focused funds. Proof of concept is the main driver in order to build investor confidence regarding the potential of this sector. As such, coupling investment strategies with technical assistance is necessary, as is evident in the approach of both Meloy Fund and Catch Together.

As investors start to channel funds into fishery-related enterprises that integrate sustainability, the case for strong impact and financial performance going hand in hand becomes even stronger. Thus, developing success stories may be the first step towards generating a larger market buy-in.

Here, SportsPro assesses the merits of a new kind of host offer.

Sitting in the ornate dining room at the Hotel Selman in Marrakech, former World Cup winner Lillian Thuram offered a profound assessment of the differences between the two countries bidding to host the 2026 Fifa World Cup.

On the topic of Donald Trump’s recent input in the bidding process, Thuram described the US president disparagingly as an “image of the society we live in”, espousing the view that it is the responsibility of everyone to go back to defending more noble values or risk teaching our children that the rich and the powerful are always right.

Without saying so explicitly, Thuram - not an official ambassador for Morocco 2026 - clearly believes there is a moral superior of the two bids, and Team Trump is not it.

Historically, romantic notions and morals have not been high on Fifa’s list of priorities when awarding its showpiece tournament. However, to dismiss the Moroccan bid as purely idealistic would be to do it a huge disservice. As a bid it accepts its limitations in comparison to the big money offerings on the other side of the Atlantic, but instead it presents an alternative take on the potential of an international sporting event to aid a country’s development. Instead of sending the World Cup to a country currently run by a climate change doubter, Morocco genuinely believes it can provide a tournament which offers environmental sustainability.

In 2011, Morocco altered its constitution to include sustainable development, stopped subsidising fossil fuels to make renewables more competitive, and started welcoming private investments in the clean energy sector. By 2030 it expects to be well ahead of the Paris Accord targets for generating renewable energy and is on course to hit the 40 per cent target by 2020. Trump withdrew the US from the Paris Accord in June last year. This is your narrative.

The Moroccan bid is precipitated on offering a shot in the arm to the country’s ongoing drive for sustainable infrastructure, accelerating strategic transport projects such as the Marrakesh-Ouarzazate tunnel and the high-speed rail development on a new Marrakesh-Agadir line. Those are two of nine substantial developments going ahead regardless of what decision Fifa makes about 2026, but also indicators of the Moroccan ambition to be a leader in the sector.

By way of example, in their bid book the Morocco team boast that the World Economic Forum ranks the country as the continental leader in rail infrastructure and later this year Africa’s first high-speed line will open on a 200km track between Tangier and Kenitra - the first phase of a wider 1,500km project. All in all, pretty impressive.

Under construction

That said, the key element of any World Cup is the stadia and here there is quite literally a lot of work to do. All 14 potential World Cup venues require differing levels of development. The five existing ones will be upgraded, while nine need to be built. Three of those are already in progress with the other six legacy modular stadia (LMS) planned with the idea of providing sustainability post-tournament.

All of that on a construction budget of US$3 billion seems optimistic, especially considering that figure is part of that ambitious US$12.6 billion public investment package that also includes transport projects and hospital building. In response to those doubts the Morocco bid team point to low construction costs; pre-signed stadium agreements for publicly-owned land; government guarantees on financing; with the security of a stable currency; and economic forecasts of long-term controlled inflation around two per cent.

Even if Morocco has its numbers right, the United Bid can fall back on a plethora of shiny ultra-modern stadia that already exist, as well as a well-established infrastructure. But then Fifa’s selection process - however flawed that may be - has never shied away from rewarding bids using the World Cup to grow the game in its country.

What Morocco can also offer is a new vision for a developing nation bidding for a major tournament, one that does not require spending beyond its means and fulfilling promises that serve as a detriment to the winning host in the long-term.

Central to this offer are the six 46,000-seater LMS stadiums in Casablanca, Marrakech, Meknes, Nador, El Jadida and Ouarzazate. They have been designed especially for the tournament and then to be part-dismantled in order to leave a suitable venue in its place. The ‘white elephants’ that scatter Greece, Brazil and even Beijing are not welcome in Morocco’s plans for sustainability. The bid team even promise that the stands not needed post-World Cup will be distributed in their own country and across other African nations.

Developed with consideration of their environmental impact, and meeting BREEAM and HQE certification, the LMS all share identical floor plans across all sites, with a fixed concrete base composed of a large forecourt extending to the lower (and only non-removable) stand, which together house the changing rooms and technical areas. On top of that are the various temporary stands, which can be dismantled post-tournament to fulfil each venue’s needs. On each corner are buildings accommodating the various spaces required for the event, such as hospitality boxes, the media centre, volunteer centre, staff restaurant and Fifa office spaces. To provide variety, the facade and roof can be fully customised from one city to the next - akin to customising your smartphone with a pretty cover.

The concept for the Legacy Modular Stadia being proposed as part of the Morocco 2026 bid

More eye-catching is the promise that these LMS will be “100 per cent environmentally responsible”. They have been designed to feature photovoltaic cells generating up to 224 MWh of electricity per year for the local area; as well as a number of other green features such as rainwater recovery; solar water heaters; waterless urinals and on-site waste management.

Although flexible, these are not just temporary structures. The stadium in Casablanca would retain its full capacity post-World Cup but they can all be downsized to the minimum 20,000 seats, as in Nador, or other possible capacities in between with the option to increase again should there be sufficient demand.

Local clubs will serve as anchor tenants, in charge of identifying their capacity requirements and other needs. The bid team envision the walkways in the reduced LMS being used as sports areas - not just confined to soccer.

The LMS in Marrakesh, Morocco’s number one tourism destination, has been earmarked for transformation into a multi-purpose 25,000-seat indoor arena for sport, entertainment and conventions, fulfilling a need for a country currently without such a facility.

“The idea of the legacy of the modular stadium came about for two reasons,” Hicham El Amrani, Morocco's bid chief, tells SportsPro. “First, because Morocco has been engaged nationally on a policy of sustainability and protection of the environment being convinced that if we do not take action now in the very long to protect the next generation and protecting Earth it will be a major issue.

“In addition to this the target is to get 52 per cent of the energy mix coming from renewable energy by 2030.

“When it comes to the World Cup, therefore, on top of the policy of Morocco, is the need to make sure we have environmentally friendly buildings, sporting infrastructure-wise, and also that those are in line with how the community can use them in the long-run.

“We have seen the actual experience, and not always good experience, of ending up with ‘white elephants’ that communities and cities cannot manage anymore because it will cost them too much money, it’s too big a capacity and not the ability to play something else other than football in it.

“We came up with the concept right in the brainstorming before even coming a candidate. You cannot become a candidate and then start thinking ‘Well, what do I do now?’

“There were financial and environmental studies undertaken before Morocco decided to move ahead and become a candidate that started more than a year ago. We needed to be sure about the feasibility of those concepts, the technicalities of it, who is best at putting them in place, how we can use them afterwards, how we can redistribute the different seats.”

Environmentally speaking

El Amrani would not be drawn on the environmental merits of the Moroccan bid in comparison to its North American rival but it is all in the literature. As opposed to the sprawling and unavoidable car parks of the behemothic and largely out-of-town American stadia, the Moroccan bid promises that public transport will play a central role in delivering fans to games with roads assigned specific lanes for fan transportation shuttles and a “no spectator parking” policy in place.

In addition to the sustainable LMS, under construction already is a new stadium in Oujda, which is designed to be energy-positive thanks to its photovoltaic roof, producing more electricity than the venue requires to run.

In fairness to the United Bid, many of its stadia boast impressive environmental credentials too. However, the scale of the three joint-bidding countries means the travel required by teams, fans and officials over the course of the tournament would necessitate some serious number fiddling to get anywhere near the projected carbon footprint of a Moroccan World Cup.

Here the geographical location of Morocco provides a significant advantage, with the country’s proximity to Europe and its compact size meaning the tournament would produce far less than the projected 2.1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide expected to be pumped out at this summer’s tournament. Close to 75 per cent of those expected emissions will be from international flights to Russia as well as travel between vastly spread host cities, and there is no reason to believe that a North American tournament with a similarly wide geographical breadth would produce any less.

That geographical advantage is something that the Moroccan team was keen to stress but they did not hide away from the more challenging aspects of their bid either. In its recent pre-vote report Fifa inspectors labelled Morocco’s 2026 World Cup bid as ‘high risk’ due to a lack of infrastructure, but speaking long before that verdict was reached El Amrani insisted that the boost a Moroccan World Cup in 2026 would offer the country in terms of providing impetus for its development plans meant that was not an issue.

“The beauty of the Morocco bid is that it allows a fantastic boost and acceleration to those [national infrastructure] projects,” he explains.

“Getting the World Cup for us is a project that will last eight years and 32 days, not just 32 days. The whole objective is not just to organise a 32-day competition but also to carry on the projects that have been planned but can now go on a much, much faster pace with the securing of the guarantees and the funding that goes with it – with or without the World Cup.

“Also, the ability to have the spotlight of the world towards us for eight years will help us become even better at implementing those projects. That will allow us as well to transform any weaknesses we have into stronger legacies for the country and the exchanges we want to have on the African continent.”

“Getting the World Cup for us is a project that will last eight years and 32 days, not just 32 days

Money talks

Sadly, instead of the environmental merits of the Moroccan World Cup bid all the talk since the Fifa family descended on Russia this week has been of money. Questions have been raised by the Moroccans over the outlandish promises made by the United Bid over revenue projections of US$14.3 billion for Fifa if 2026 went its way.

""That doesn't correspond either to historical facts or future extrapolation, it's an exercise that goes beyond that,"" Morocco Football Federation president Fouzi Lekjaa told members of the press in Moscow on Monday, and not without good reason. The New York Times reported last week that a Fifa evaluation of the costs associated with hosting a 48-team tournament deem the United Bid's forecast overly optimistic. In key European and Asian markets many kick-off times for a World Cup in North America would be out of prime time, making the United Bid’s media revenue target harder to reach. The Fifa evaluation estimates broadcast rights for 2026 will be worth US$3.6 billion, far less than the US$5.5 billion the Americans are promising.

A study conducted by international consulting firm Roland Berger for the Moroccan bid estimated a profit for Fifa of US$5 billion, which is obviously a huge drop-off from its rivals but one the Africans feel is far more realistic.

A World Cup in Morocco could offer different commercial opportunities as a result of its green approach

An interesting commercial aspect of the upcoming World Cup in Russia has been the uptake from Chinese sponsors in filling gaps left by western companies unwilling to associate themselves with soccer’s scandal-ridden governing body and its controversial host. Whilst there can be little doubt that a tournament in North America would attract a raft of household names back into the fold, an environmentally friendly event would also open up new opportunities. Fifa handle the World Cup sponsorship but El Amrani is sure the Moroccan offer could entice an energy partner with a different profile to the likes of Gazprom.

“[Attracting different kinds of sponsors with an environmentally focused bid] is an opportunity of course. But all of the sponsors and key partners of Fifa are actually secured by Fifa,” he says.

“Companies are already extremely interested from all different business categories and it is something that will be looked at once the decision is taken. But of course green economy is booming as well, especially on the continent that has the opportunity to take that factor into account as early as possible before they fully mature. That is a wonderful opportunity we have and we want to be leaders on that front on the African continent.”

For all its flaws and question marks, of which there are no shortage, the Moroccans do at least offer something different to the major tournament bids that have dominated the international sporting landscape in recent years. This is not about bigger, better, faster, stronger. Instead, the merits of the offer from the African peninsula are sustainability, responsibility and reason.

We don’t need to have 100,000-seaters all across the country, we need to think about the use being made afterwards

In reality, Morocco is facing a daunting task in defeating a bid promising lavish riches and that is so heavily favoured by the president of the body awarding the event. To its credit the Moroccan bid has not tried to match its grandiose North American rival, instead opting to offer a contrast. Perhaps the award of the 2028 Olympics to Los Angeles’ ‘green bid’ can be a turning point for governing bodies in awarding its biggest events, if so then Morocco could provide the model for what a future World Cup bid should look like in a developing country.

El Amrani certainly thinks a win for his team would send a strong message out to those hoping of hosting the World Cup’s centenary edition in 2030.

He says: “It will be a benchmark to bring the World Cup back to a more humane, more human, more authentic experience. We don’t need to have 100,000-seaters all across the country, we need to think about the use being made afterwards, we need to be responsible in how much we spend – without touching the quality and requirements needed – just be more smart about how we spend the money, how we use it and how we generate return on investment earlier on. Use that opportunity to push for a shift of mindset into a more environmentally friendly attitude of our citizens as well, that is a great goal to have.”

Hard to argue with the sentiment.","In an attempt to avoid the pitfalls that have befallen previous major event hosts, Morocco has chosen to pursue a sustainable model for its 2026 World Cup bid.

The awards will be presented in London, the UK, on June 14.

The Chhattisgarh State Renewable Energy Development Agency (CREDA), which uses solar to change the way health centres in the state operate, has been selected for the International Ashden Award for Sustainable Energy and Health.

Ecozen Solutions, which specialises in portable solar cold rooms for farmers, has been selected for the International Ashden Award for Powering Business.

Shuttl, which is tackling pollution caused by traffic congestion in some of India’s busiest cities, has been selected for the Ashden Award for Sustainable Mobility.

Three organisations from India have been selected as sustainable energy heroes at the international Ashden awards. The Chhattisgarh State Renewable Energy Development Agency (CREDA) which uses solar to change the way health centres in the state operate, Ecozen Solutions which specialises in portable solar cold rooms for farmers and Shuttl which is tackling pollution caused by traffic congestion in some of India’s busiest cities, are among this year’s winners.

In all, 20 organisations working at the frontline of sustainable energy in the fields of health, cities and buildings, finance, energy access, mobility and powering business were shortlisted for the 2018 International Ashden Awards which recognises “pioneering sustainable energy solutions that transform livelihoods across three continents and address climate change from every angle”.

Powering health with solar

Sanjeev Jain, chief engineer for CREDA, one of the winning organisations, told Mongabay India that while relying on the grid for electricity, health care centres in rural Chhattisgarh used to suffer up to eight hours of power cuts every day. “This meant having to deliver babies without light and relying on noisy, polluting diesel generators for vital medical equipment,” he said.

CREDA has been working with the department of health and the department of energy to provide solar power to primary health care centres, district hospitals and accident and emergency hospitals. The aim is to electrify every health care centre in Chhattisgarh, as part of the union government’s mission to provide power to every village in India, he added.

Solar power has brought the benefits of electrification to villages in the state – health care centres now offer more reliable health services and patients do not have to travel long distances to larger hospitals, pharmacies can order medicines online, medical records can be digitised and vaccines can be kept for longer using solar-powered fridges and freezers.

CREDA’s initiative is a state government-funded programme supported by the departments of health, energy and education working together to prioritise funds for solar systems and other sustainable energy infrastructure. This instance can be emulated in other states as well, cite officials, by simply replicating the model.

In an official release, Ashden mentions that CREDA’s instance is a wonderful example of “how a state-run partnership can integrate renewables, deliver reliable healthcare and work towards creating a sustainable energy hub.” Under the programme, solar PV systems have been installed and maintained in almost 900 health centres in eastern India.

Responding to the win, Jain said, “We are delighted that CREDA’s work on solar energy in the health sector has been recognised by Ashden and selected for a prestigious award.”

“As an organisation, we are focussed on sustainable renewable energy solutions for the development of people in rural areas. We are now more energised to take on new and challenging projects which will benefit society and the environment,” he added.

Solar for fresh produce

The second winner, Ecozen Solutions, has been recognised for developing solar cold rooms aimed to enable farmers to store produce which in turn improves distribution. Farmers using the cold rooms usually break even after two years and have seen as much as a 40 percent increase in their profits.

On how the idea came about, Kishan Dhameliya, in-charge of Special Projects for Ecozen, told Mongabay-India, “The levels of food waste in India are shockingly high, up to 30 percent of perishable produce is wasted before it reaches customers. In India alone, 10 million tons of cold storage would be required to combat this problem and that’s where the idea for EcoFrost was born.”

The solar-powered micro cold storage unit is suitable for small farms. Previously, cold storage was only available to farmers with large farms, who would hoard when supplies peak, leading to price fluctuations. Now, farmers have more control of when they sell their products and can sell at higher prices.

Detailing how these cold rooms work, Dhameliya informed that a 4kW solar panel is used meet the energy requirement for each cold room. On a normal sunny day, 16 units of electricity is generated at each system. Thermal energy storage is also used to store energy and this is more efficient than normal batteries for cooling applications. Additionally, it can last for 10 years, unlike normal batteries which last only for five years. The system also uses an advanced motor control algorithm which helps vary the motor capacity from 60 percent to 180 percent, thereby tapping the maximum solar envelope to run the compressor.

EcoFrosts have a thermal back-up of up to 36 hours when there is no sun. Since there are no large batteries to maintain, the EcoFrost is also easily portable. Additionally, the temperature and humidity sensors can be controlled remotely and via Bluetooth from a mobile phone to change the settings via the app depending on what produce is being kept inside. The fact that the app can predict market prices also works to the advantage of the farmers.

On how things have changed for the farmers owing to the solar cold room, he states, “A rose farmer grows 0.7 million sticks of roses from 1 acre of land and spends $16,667 per annum on his operations. Previously, he used to get $1 per 20 sticks as an average selling price. Now, with the cold room, he gets $1.33 per 20 sticks as an average price as he is able to sell his produce at the right time. He can transport roses to markets that are further away at prices that are much more rewarding. As a result, his net profit has increased from $18,333 per annum to $30,000 per annum.”

Currently, farmers in Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh have been extremely receptive towards this innovative technology. Dhameliya feels that the Ashden Award is an important mark of recognition that will introduce Ecozen to others in the sector.

The road to tackling pollution

Undoubtedly, traffic pollution is the biggest bane of cities across India. As more cars come on the roads, residents are subject to the pollution every day, specially as they commute to work. One of the ways to tackle this issue is to reduce the number of vehicles on the road and opt for public transport instead — exactly what Shuttl, this year’s winner of the Ashden Award for Sustainable Mobility, has been pushing for.

“A broken transport infrastructure, rising car population, severe levels of congestion, pollution and women’s safety issues in India enabled the birth of Shuttl. Essentially, it is a tech-enabled, seat-based bus mobility solution offering safe, comfortable, reliable and affordable rides to people, thus

reducing pollution and benefiting the cities,” Vishwas Singh, vice-president, Shuttl, told Mongabay-India.

In Delhi for instance, the company has cut the 2.6 million car journeys (carried out every year) to 1.6 million, saving between 2,000 and 3,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually. In NCR and Kolkata, they have been able to provide clean, safe, air-conditioned buses that are reducing commuter car journeys, reducing pollution and delivering a service that can be booked using a mobile phone app. Owing to this app,

10,000 cars have been taken off the road each day, 57 percent users have switched from private vehicles and 66 million passenger miles have been served to date.

With 700 plus buses and 50,000 rides a day, Shuttl operates in Delhi-NCR, Kolkata, Pune, Jaipur and Bengaluru. Plans are on to ply in all the big cities of India, around 10 of them, in another six to nine months. “We are considering global opportunities as well,” Singh revealed.

On an average, a Shuttl ride costs around Rs. 100 ($1.50) for about a 32-kilometre (20-mile) journey. Reacting to the win, Singh explained, “It is extremely important for us and comes at the right time when policy makers and administrators in India are looking for partners to battle rising car population and the congestion in cities.

The award brings Shuttl at the center of sustainable mobility conversations in India and would open doors for collaborations and partnerships.”

The Ashden Awards are a globally recognised measure of excellence in the field of sustainable energy and winners receive tailored support to help scale up their work and a prize of up to £20,000 (around Rs. 1.8 million). This year, the awards will held on June 14 at the Royal Geographical Society in London.","Three organisations from India have been been selected as sustainable energy heroes at the International Ashden Awards.

In the late 1980s, revolution was afoot in the world of architecture. It started when a soft-spoken Kansas City architect named Bob Berkebile tried to convince the American Institute of Architects to do more to save the planet. In the spring of 1989, he petitioned the AIA to establish a committee to study and promote ways that the profession could become more eco-friendly.

""The board of directors turned me down,"" said Berkebile, now 81. In the Reagan era, the environmental movement had a Birkenstock-and-granola image that the men in charge at the AIA were apparently not prepared to adopt.

However, Berkebile was backed by up-and-coming architects from around the country. According to him, they basically took over the AIA convention in May of 1989: ""We overruled them."" The resolution the AIA board had declined to endorse, ""CPR: Critical Planet Rescue,"" passed unanimously.

The result was the AIA Committee on the Environment (or COTE). This new group, which Berkebile chaired, quickly became a force, collaborating with the United States Environmental Protection Agency on environmental research and producing new guidelines for architectural design. When President Bill Clinton, on his first Earth Day in office in April of 1993, announced that he wanted to retrofit the White House as a ""model for efficiency and waste reduction,"" Berkebile's committee got a call to help make it happen.

""Within a few days, the line of corporations wanting to help started in D.C. and stretched all the way to Philadelphia,"" said Berkebile, only half-joking. The dream of green buildings, which began with experimental passive-solar houses in the 1930s and hippie ""zome homes"" and ""earthships"" in the 1960s and '70s, suddenly seemed commercially viable.

As in any new industry, the companies involved wanted an organization to represent their interests. COTE already existed, and seemed like a natural fit. Its members included not just architects, but academics, environmental groups, real estate developers, financiers, and manufacturers of building materials. COTE was funded by a $1 million grant from the EPA.

That spring, a real estate developer named David Gottfried and an attorney named Mike Italiano approached Berkebile with an alternative fundraising idea. Why not solicit money directly from the chief executive officers who seemed so eager to get in on the movement? But Berkebile was resistant. ""I said, 'because we are publishing scientific reports that challenge the quality of their products, and I don't want to have a conflict of interest,'"" he said.

Shortly thereafter, Berkebile hosted a meeting in Washington to brainstorm a new organization that could accommodate the interests of the emerging industry while leaving COTE to focus on the science of sustainable architecture, unfettered by potential conflicts of interest. The 60-plus attendees included Gottfried and Italiano, along with Rick Fedrizzi, a marketing executive from Carrier, the air-conditioner company. The trio volunteered to lead this new initiative, which became known as the U.S. Green Building Council.

Taking Green Mainstream

Now celebrating its 25th anniversary, the USGBC has come to dominate the green building industry from its headquarters in Washington, D.C. The organization employs 250 people around the U.S. and another 50-plus overseas. Its annual convention, Greenbuild, has swelled to about 20,000 attendees in recent years, with speakers like Hillary Clinton and Neil deGrasse Tyson. This year alone, in addition to the main event in Chicago, there are spin-off conventions in Mexico, China, India, and Germany. The organization boasts a chapter in virtually every state of the U.S., and has inspired offshoots in more than 70 countries, from Argentina to Zambia.

In 1998, the group piloted LEED—shorthand for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, a rating system for environmentally sound buildings—and the movement went mainstream. There are now some 94,000 commercial buildings alone granted or awaiting LEED certification in 167 countries. (LEED has four levels of certification that step up in rigor: Certified, Silver, Gold, and Platinum.) Every day, another 2.2 million square feet of real estate is certified, roughly the size of a 65-story office tower.

LEED standards have essentially been written into building codes across the country in an effort to ensure that the next generation of homes, offices, warehouses, schools, and hospitals are more resource-conscious than the last. LEED certification is expected for today's high-end office buildings and corporate headquarters. But it is available for virtually any type of construction, including renovations, and even entire neighborhoods and cities.

A vast ecosystem of green commerce has grown in tandem with LEED, spurring sales in products ranging from solar panels to low-VOC paints and low-flow toilets. ""Green building is now a $1 trillion global industry,"" Mahesh Ramanujam, the USGBC's current chief executive officer, said in March.

Ramanujam, a computer engineer, is also the chief executive officer of Green Business Certification Inc., which has exclusive rights to administer the USGBC's certification programs, as well as its education program, which more than 200,000 people have enrolled in to earn the credentials of LEED Advanced Professional and LEED Green Associate.

The USGBC is organized as a 501 (c)(3) charitable non-profit, but GBCI is a 501(c)(6) non-profit entity, the Internal Revenue Service's designation for commercially oriented tax-exempt organizations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Football League. Building certification fees vary depending on the certification sought and the building's size, but at four or five figures, they are a relatively small price for a developer to pay for the prestige (especially given that certified properties command a market premium). GBCI brought in almost $55 million in fiscal year 2016.

Markets can be an expedient way to enact positive societal transformation. But as the the USGBC has grown, so have accusations of ""greenwashing."" National newspapers have reported on criticisms that LEED buildings do not save as much energy as predicted and that the LEED points system is gamed by designers targeting ""the easiest and cheapest"" points, such as for posting educational signage or giving priority parking to fuel-efficient cars.

Berkebile helped shape the first LEED standards, and his architecture firm, BNIM, has designed many LEED-certified buildings. In 2014, he signed on as a strategic adviser to a different green-building entity, the International Living Future Institute, which advocates for ""regenerative"" buildings that ""give more than they take."" (He remained an informal adviser to the USGBC.)

Today, he sounds lukewarm on LEED's results. ""The certification has become: Your building is doing a little less damage to the environment than everyone else's,"" Berkebile said. ""But that means you're still having a negative impact. I think that's a failure.""

Does LEED Really Save Energy?

The debate over whether LEED standards are strict enough originates, at least in part, from differing expectations of what a green building should be. The term ""green"" may bring to mind a carpet of vegetation on the roof or bamboo floors. Bike racks, waterless urinals, and electric-vehicle charging stations also connote environmental friendliness, and they're common in LEED-certified buildings.

Most people would also associate green buildings with energy efficiency. The building sector consumes nearly 40 percent of all energy produced in the U.S. and is responsible for a similar share of greenhouse-gas emissions. So energy-efficient and ""net-zero"" buildings (which offset their energy use by what they generate, via solar panels, for example) are seen as a crucial way to rein in carbon emissions and slow climate change.

The USGBC has long claimed that LEED-certified buildings use 25 to 30 percent less energy than non-LEED buildings. Those numbers originated in a 2008 study by the New Buildings Institute that was funded by the USGBC.

LEED's detractors object to how the numbers were crunched. John Scofield, a physics professor at Oberlin College, analyzed the same data set and concluded that the LEED-certified buildings actually consumed more energy per square foot than comparable non-LEED buildings in the U.S.

Scofield contends that the NBI's analysis was not an apples-to-apples comparison. Among other irregularities, he argues, it compared the ""median"" energy use of LEED buildings to the ""mean"" energy use of the non-LEED buildings—which are different metrics.

Another point of contention: the NBI study was based on 121 LEED-certified commercial buildings whose owners volunteered energy data. That represents a small portion of the buildings that had been in operation long enough to have at least one year of data to offer. In other words, it's not an unbiased random sample, and might have been skewed by the opt-in element.

""If I mail a letter out to 1,000 building owners asking for data, only the ones that think their data looks good are going to send it,"" Scofield said.

However, a number of other studies have found significant energy reductions in LEED-certified buildings over the years. Ramanujam stands by the 25 to 30 percent claim. ""I hear this [criticism] on a daily basis,"" he said. ""These numbers are not made up.""

To be fair, many individual LEED buildings are highly energy-efficient. Some have large solar arrays on the roof, or other features that take huge bites out of carbon footprints. Even Scofield found that LEED Gold buildings perform well.

Also, there are other factors that may make LEED buildings more power-hungry. These buildings tend to be newer, and today's offices pack in workers more tightly, charging more laptops and cell phones—which may cause some to use more energy. A 2013 article critical of LEED called out the LEED Platinum Bank of America Tower in Manhattan as ""toxic"" for its high energy use.

But that building has financial trading floors that are chock-a-block with computers. There's a limit to how energy efficient any trading floor can be: ""They can't tell their prime tenant that they can't work round the clock on fancy computers,"" as journalist Lloyd Alter wrote in the building's, and LEED's, defense. A third critique of LEED is that its points for energy conservation are based on a computer model showing how much energy the building should save, if certain features are implemented, and not on actual post-occupancy energy use.

Ramanujam admits this is a problem. ""What we have not done very well in the past is to actually integrate performance and outcomes-based data reporting into LEED certification."" Sometimes, he said, a well-designed building ""does not get properly translated to construction and operation. It's like buying a car and expecting a certain level of miles per gallon. If it's not performing, maybe it's time to adjust your driving habits."" Poorly performing buildings, he suggested, ""need a better operational strategy."" Operations and maintenance (""O&M"") does play a large role in the efficiency of a given building. Tweaks to the HVAC or lighting can make as much difference as a more expensive physical upgrade.

Hilary Firestone is a senior policy advisor for the City Energy Project, an initiative run by two environmental groups to cut energy use in large buildings in major U.S. cities. She acknowledges the shortcomings of LEED, but remains a fan. ""It's made green building something that the average person can wrap their mind around,"" she said. ""You can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good when you're trying to move an entire industry.""

In 2009, under mounting pressure to prove its energy-conservation claims, the USGBC began requiring the owners of LEED-certified buildings to submit annual energy-use data for the first five years of occupancy. Folks like Scofield have been looking forward to seeing those numbers—a statistically robust data set of thousands of buildings—ever since.

Ramanujam has a reason why the USGBC has never released the data: They don't have it. ""Disclosure has been minimally implemented,"" he said. ""Less than a dozen [building owners] have reported data.""

Why haven't owners coughed up their numbers? ""The simple reason is that the market did not have a platform—it didn't have a tool. The complexity of reporting the data made the barriers significantly higher."" He promised that changes made to the LEED rules in March will make data reporting a true requirement moving forward. GBCI recently launched a new software platform, Arc, that tracks and scores buildings' performance. ""Enforcement was a challenge, but now there is no excuse to not share data,"" Ramanujam said.

An alternative data source has emerged as well. At least 17 cities, plus the entire state of California, have adopted policies requiring commercial and multi-family building owners to publicly report their energy-consumption data.

Scofield has cross-referenced LEED-certified buildings in New York City and Chicago with early data from those cities, and found no statistically meaningful difference between LEED and non-LEED buildings. Other researchers repeated this exercise for New York—with similar findings.

The Hard Road to Decarbonization

The USGBC has inarguably changed the course of the building industry for the better. It mobilized the masses around the idea of environmentally responsible construction. The ""co-benefits"" of many green buildings, like ample daylight and better indoor air quality, clearly improve people's health and comfort. A Harvard University study published in January found that LEED buildings yield substantial energy savings and ""nearly equivalent"" climate and health benefits. (The peer-reviewed study was funded by United Technologies Corporation, a manufacturer of building equipment.)

Without the USGBC and LEED, smart thermostats and low-VOC paints might not be available in Home Depot. Other green-building organizations like the International Living Future Institute probably wouldn't have made it off the drawing board, and cities wouldn't be requiring energy benchmarking.

Some of the fiercest attacks on LEED have come from a lobbyist-run ""astroturf"" (or fake grassroots) group and the chemical and timber industries, and should be taken with a bucket of salt. But the conflicting evidence on energy savings is worth a gut-check, especially since more than just private profits are at stake.

Most states and hundreds of municipalities offer green-building tax incentives, many of them tied directly to LEED certification. The federal government now requires LEED Gold for every new building it constructs.

What would ""greener"" standards for buildings look like? The Living Future Institute's Living Building Challenge, a much more stringent program than LEED, certified its first building in 2010. ""Living Buildings"" must produce more energy than they consume (the excess is fed back into the grid), and are not granted certification until they've proved it for a period of 12 months. Net-positive water use and net-positive waste are also required.

The program sets an admirably high bar for sustainability. But to date, it has only fully certified 11 buildings. That's a tiny sliver of the market share of LEED.

The truth is, climate change isn't going to wait on the LBC slowly gaining adherents—or the incremental tightening of LEED standards. Carbon emissions seem to have stabilized, but carbon in the atmosphere is rising. At the current rate of emissions, we may have only a handful of years to limit global warming to a non-catastrophic 1.5 degrees. Retrofitting all urban buildings to be net zero sounds wildly ambitious, but that's what decarbonization would entail.

""The amount of carbon in the atmosphere continues to increase,"" Berkebile noted. ""And unless we change that, we'll have beautiful LEED Platinum buildings in an environment where human life is not possible.""

Currently in use in Charlotte, the Leaf Burrito won the 2017 Sustain Charlotte Award in the Waste Reduction category.

""Leaf Burrito won the Sustain Charlotte Award for a reason,” explains Shannon Binns, executive director of Sustain Charlotte. “Great product, easy to use, making where we live a better place for us and generations after us. It is a cutting edge leader in the Sustainability arena.""

Mataya came up with the idea several years ago while assisting the City of Charlotte Solid Waste staff with unloading a burrito-shaped tarp.

“However, tarps are not approved containers,” he pointed out. “I’ve always had a strong passion for environmental sustainability, green initiatives and with all the current news on what plastic contamination is doing across the world I wanted to do my part. After being recognized with the Sustain Charlotte Award and being endorsed by the City of Charlotte, Mecklenburg County and the City of Charlotte Solid Waste Services, I wanted to get the Leaf Burrito in the hands of as many folks in the landscape business, corporate entities or weekend warriors in Charlotte and eventually at most homes across the country. Crowdfunding seemed the best venue to educate the public, create awareness and get production started more quickly.""

Crowdfunding will allow Leaf Burrito to increase production and reduce the cost of the product with larger production runs. Leaf Burrito works to educate customers and cities about the impact of single-use plastic on the environment and their communities. Leaf Burrito will donate 5% of all funds raised, as well as 5% of future revenues, to support local Greenway development organizations.

The goals of Leaf Burrito are to:

Help reduce the amount of plastic pollution by keeping plastic bags out of landfills; Make the arduous task of bagging leaves, hedge and garden clippings, and grass clippings a simple and eco-friendly experience; Give back to our communities through local Greenway development organizations.

Each Leaf Burrito holds 4+ large lawn bags worth of leaves and starts completely flat for instant loading then “burritos up” with heavy-duty zippers. It’s made of a custom heavy-duty mesh that will not collect water such as through condensation as with plastic trash cans and paper bags.

At a conference sponsored by Boston Harbor Now, the study’s lead author, Paul Kirshen, said both models would be costly, inflexible, disruptive to tidal currents and possibly to fisheries, and would take decades to build. Pursuing such a plan was “not prudent,” he said. The City of Boston, which commissioned the report, could shelve the idea, at least for the time being.

WHEN RESEARCHERS FROM UMass Boston’s Sustainable Solutions Lab concluded last month that a $12 billion harbor barrier is not the preferred option for protecting the region from climate change, you could practically hear the sighs of relief emanating from City Hall.

But sea level rise and violent storms are not sitting on the shelf. The Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that 170 coastal communities in the United States could face chronic inundation (flooding more than 26 times a year) by 2035. Boston is of course among them. If we aren’t going to pursue a massive engineering project like the harbor barrier, then we need to double down on a diverse set of shore-based solutions, which can provide flood management more quickly and cheaply and – not incidentally – create a public realm that is more sustainable, more beautiful, and more fair.

“The need to adapt to climate change is allowing Boston to recover its legacy of landscape,” says Chris Reed, director of Stoss Landscape Urbanism, which designs natural flood-control projects for shorelines worldwide. Reed notes that Boston’s late 19th-century placemaking projects — including the Jamaicaway, the Fens, and the Muddy River — were often designed for flood control or other kinds of environmental management. Today, uncovering hidden culverts, restoring wetlands, installing floating pathways, and softening shore edges are all part of an urban design approach that favors resilience over resistance.

A good example is Joe Moakley Park in South Boston, adjacent to Carson Beach. The 68-acre park is on the harbor, though you’d barely know it, since views of the water are blocked by busy Day Boulevard, and the athletic fields that dominate the park don’t allow for any elevation. Reed’s firm is consulting with the city on redesigning the park, which floods regularly, to incorporate resilience strategies that also beautify the landscape. Adding marsh habitats, kayak landings, even hills for sledding in winter could also welcome a more diverse group of residents in a rapidly changing neighborhood. “We know how to create landscape solutions that offer protection, he said, “but there can also be social, cultural, and equity benefits.”

In 2014, Boston was designated one of 100 Resilient Cities by the Rockefeller Foundation, in an international effort to fund creative solutions to climate change. Boston’s pitch was “uniquely focused on social resilience,” according to the application, “in a city affected by historic and persistent divisions of race and class.” You don’t need a very long memory to know that Carson Beach was for years a symbol of racial violence and intolerance in the wake of the busing crisis. So making the area more accessible — whether through safe bike paths, activities for all ages, or a re-imagined park — is also the work of a resilient city.

It may seem a stretch to connect racial and economic justice with responses to climate change, but it is often the poorest communities that are most vulnerable to severe weather. Building social cohesion is also a climate-ready strategy, because a city where residents connect easily across boundaries will be better able to respond to a weather emergency.

Climate change is a major threat to Boston’s coastal communities, but with commitment and imagination, it can also be a chance to reknit the urban fabric into something wonderful. The pivot away from the proposed harbor barrier only adds more urgency to this task.

We called it Ghost Towne Mall, because nobody in their right mind would drive all the way out there to shop.

Since then, Utah’s population has nearly doubled. Most of the land between downtown and South Towne has been gobbled up, and the prison is being moved to facilitate more growth.

What used to be horse pastures in Herriman and Riverton have been sold and subdivided, built into communities of starter mansions filled with people who wanted to get away from the hustle and bustle and close quarters of city life.

It’s understandable, perhaps, that the folks who settled in for an idyllic exurban lifestyle are feeling anxious and even threatened as the urban sprawl that comes with a population boom is arriving in their own neighborhoods.

Last week, thousands of residents and the mayors of Herriman, Riverton, West Jordan and Copperton voiced their opposition to a major new development plan that would allow the construction of about 8,765 units on 938 acres in an unincorporated area of the Salt Lake Valley. That’s a whole lot of apartments, condos, townhomes and some small single-family home in a tight space.

“The sheer number of units in the development is nothing short of overwhelming,” the city mayors wrote.

Then, late last week, amid the objections, Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams put a final decision on hold, saying he may veto the county council’s approval of the Olympia Hills project, but would rather see if he can negotiate a compromise.

The cities’ objections are not unfounded. The estimated 25,000 to 33,000 people who could eventually move into the area would require a substantial expansion of the road system and construction of new schools.

The closest comparison to anything of this scope is the Daybreak development in South Jordan that is projected to have 20,000 units on 4,126 acres — obviously many more units but about half the density.

So McAdams was right to hit the brakes and see if there’s a way to find some middle ground here — just as I suggested the local leaders needed to be heard when it comes to planning for a massive inland shipping port on Salt Lake City’s northwest end.

We’re also facing a crushing housing affordability crisis, with costs rising faster than just about anywhere else in the country and the average home price in the metro area expected to shoot up to $1.3 million over the next 26 years.

All of this leads to some pretty fundamental questions: Where is that next generation going to live? How are they going to afford to live? How will we get around on roads choked with congestion? And how do we keep our air from becoming even more polluted?

The folks at Envision Utah recently looked at those very questions, and the blueprint for growth they produced looks a lot like the Olympia Hills model.

“We do promote a mix of housing that includes condos, apartments, townhomes and smaller-lot single families,” said Ryan Beck, vice president of planning for Envision Utah. “We know we have a huge housing shortage and we have land constraints along the Wasatch Front … so if we don’t want to go all the way around the mountain and into Tooele and Cedar Valley, we’re going to have to build a little more compact.”

Beck stressed that he is not speaking specifically about the contentious Olympia project. But Envision’s extensive Your Utah, Your Future project suggests clustered growth in a network of communities that allow people to shop, work, dine and go to school without having to drive from one end of the valley to the other, promoting more walking, biking and transit, reducing road congestion and air pollution, in the process.

Hopefully, the Olympia Hills developer is willing to make some concessions, to ease the concerns of residents and elected officials and to account for some of the expense that comes with this kind of growth.

And then, hopefully, the mayor hits pause again and the project moves forward, because this is the type of growth we need in this valley if we’re going to have any sort of quality of life for the next generation.","We called it Ghost Towne Mall, because nobody in their right mind would drive all the way out there to shop.

For the past few years, he has done this with the help of Sea to Table, a flourishing family-owned business beloved in the sustainable food movement for connecting chefs like him to independent, American fisherman.

So when Pulapaka, a member of the Grist 50, recently saw a link in an online forum for like-minded chefs to a recent Associated Press investigation into labor abuses connected to Sea to Table’s suppliers, his response was three words: “Well that sucks.”

“It’s slightly deflating, because then you have to ask yourself who do you trust? How do you go about trusting?” Pulapaka said.

Chefs across the country who care about the sustainability of the seafood they serve are in a bind. It takes diligence to trace where your seafood comes from, and many chefs had relied on Sea to Table — one of the largest distributors of earth-friendly seafood. Last week, the company came under scrutiny when an AP investigation revealed that products it marketed as locally sourced were actually caught as far away as Indonesia by suppliers with a history of labor abuses. One fisherman on a boat that sent fish to a Sea to Table supplier said workers were “treated like slaves,” working without enough food or water while earning $1.50 for a 22-hour day.

“The unimaginable working conditions and horrific treatment of marine life in the international seafood industry must be addressed,” Sea to Table said in a statement released after the investigation was published. “We would have never accepted overseas product fished in this manner.”

“We try to buy primarily American seafood for that reason.” said William Dissen, chef and owner of three popular restaurants in Asheville, North Carolina. “It makes me just want to get closer to the source rather than the middle man.”

Chefs like Dissen and Pulapaka see reason for optimism in the conversations that have followed investigations like the recent reporting on Sea to Table. The global sustainable seafood market was worth $12.7 billion last year, according to Coherent Market Insights. And as the market grows, advocates have raised questions about how to demand food procured in a way that not only preserves and protects ecosystems, but that protects workers.

Katrina Nakamura, who owned five seafood restaurants before launching Sustainability Incubator, a Hawaii-based consultancy, says that despite years of effort to reckon with the environmental impact of the seafood industry, “it’s been very much divorced from the human beings in the [supply] chain. The disconnect is that the definition of sustainability so far hasn’t been about that part of the chain where peoples’ hands touch fish.”

The seafood industry has been plagued by reports of human rights and labor abuses. In 2016, the AP uncovered slavery on American fishing fleets in Hawaii. In 2014, the Guardian reported on slavery on Thai shrimping boats. Between 2010 and 2016, the U.S. State Department’s Trafficking in Persons report identified trafficking related to seafood from 65 different countries.

Nakamura, who works with businesses to ensure forced and trafficked labour isn’t a part of their supply chain, thinks the industry has reached a turning point. “Consumers and chefs, we all have to start thinking about the face of the people touching the fish.”

Consider the queen scallop. A recent study found that eating shellfish, like scallops, could be even better for the environment than cutting out meat. And the Monterey Bay Aquarium, whose ‘Seafood Watch’ program is a go-to for consumers and businesses who care about sustainability, rates farmed queen scallops as one of the most earth-friendly seafoods. But in its slavery risk assessment, Monterey Bay gives queen scallops a critical-risk rating because of documented forced labor on U.K.-based scalloping vessels and evidence of forced labor and trafficking in U.K fisheries.

So what can seafood-loving diners do? “Consumers can talk to their seafood retailer about how they trace their seafood and how they’re supporting efforts to improve labor conditions in their supply chains,” said a spokesperson from the advocacy group Fishwise, in an email to Grist. “This sends the message that this topic is important and that customers want more transparent information, which encourages the retailer to take action.” Fishwise also recommends looking for certifications from established interest groups, such as the Fair Trade USA certification.

The Department of Labor has a mobile app called, “Sweat & Toil” that can help consumers browse for goods, including seafood, that might have been produced with child or forced labor. And Monterey Bay Seafood Watch, along with Liberty Asia and Sustainable Fisheries Partnership, recently launched a Seafood Slavery Risk Tool meant to help businesses assess the potential risk of forced labor, human trafficking, and hazardous child labor in fisheries. But these organizations say that the slavery risk assessments (unlike the Seafood Watch tool that recommends seafood with the least environmental impact) still don’t have enough data to help consumers choose what to eat.

The answer isn’t necessarily a boycott of certain foods, said Sara McDonald, a senior fisheries scientist, with Monterey Bay. That can make the situation worse. “If I boycott, then that fish is going to be sold to a less scrupulous person,” she said. “It’s going to drive it underground. We want to keep it out in the sunshine.”

What’s most important, advocates say, is for consumers to expect more from sellers and hold them accountable for taking care of the ecosystems and the people who provide our fish.

“Sustainable food is good for the body and good for the planet,” Dissen said. “And when you’re taking care of everybody in the supply chain, that’s good for business.”","Chefs across the country who care about the sustainability of the seafood they serve are in a bind.

It’s not a matter of keeping clear of fish, however – it’s simply a matter of knowing what’s local, what’s sustainable and what’s good.

“There are lots of sustainable fish in UK waters,” says Ruth Westcott, co-ordinator of Sustainable Fish Cities, who compiled a list for i of the most delicious swaps for species that are no longer a good idea.

“Some might seem a bit unusual but they are delicious and often cheaper than more familiar species,” she says. “Sustainable Fish Cities is calling on restaurants, catering companies and pubs to offer more of these species the help support our UK fishing communities, so if you see them on menus, why not give them a try?”

Cod

Some stocks of cod are still overfished (though some are doing better). Look for the Marine Stewardship Council ecolabel and if you don’t see if, look for one of these swaps.

The alternatives Coley (also called Saithe) Coley is cod’s lesser known (and much less expensive) cousin. Coley is caught around the coast of the UK, especially in Scotland. About 10,000 tonnes are landed into the UK every year. That’s more than plaice and pollock put together (cod is 20,700 tonnes). About half the coley we catch is exported rather than eaten in the UK. Coley are caught with low by-catch trawl nets and the stocks are thought to be healthy around the UK so is considered one of the top choices for sustainability Hake Hake is a deep-water fish found in abundance around the coast of the UK. Hake is caught throughout the year but peaks, and is best quality, during March, June and September. Hake has a light flavour, similar to cod and haddock, but, many believe, much more flavourful. Hake is another great UK alternative to cod and stocks are thought to be in good shape across the UK.

Skate or ray

These flatfish are still sometimes found on chip-shop menus, but nearly all varieties of skate and ray are considered overfished, or there isn’t enough data to be confident that they can be fished sustainably.

The alternatives Dab, witch, lemon sole and flounder Nothing really recreates the soft, fibrous texture of skates and rays, but these sustainable flatfish species make a great alternative. They are smaller, and eaten as whole fish rather than wings. They do well with gentle flavours or cooked simply with butter. If you are in a chip shop, haddock or hake and chips would be a better choice.

King prawns

King or tiger prawns are usually farmed in the tropics, often very intensively and in ways which can seriously damage local communities and the environment. There have been a number of reports of slave labour in fishing and processing factories.

The alternatives Mussels Mussels are produced either by culturing ‘seed’ mussels on ropes suspended in water, or dredging the sandy sea floor in which they naturally grow. Either way, mussels require hardly any impact on the environment and in fact remove heavy metals from the water to fix in their shells. Mussels are a true superfood. They are rich in vitamin B12, selenium and iodine. They contain over 9 times the vitamin B12 of beef over 8 times more iron than chicken, and more folic acid than almost any other food. Pot-caught Scottish langoustines Langoustines make a great alternative, and are a more local option (they’re also known as Dublin Bay prawns or scampi). These are large and meaty, so ideal for tempura or prawn skewers. Ensure they are pot-caught. Cold-water prawns These are smaller and traditionally eaten in sandwiches or the classic prawn cocktail, but thanks to their price and sustainability, they are a good substitute for fish pies, noodle dishes, spaghetti and paella. Look out for MSC-certified cold-water prawns from Canada, Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Brown crab Like king prawns, crab is as good with strong flavours like chilli as it is plain with lemon and mayonnaise. Brown crabs are found throughout the coast of the UK and as far south as the coast of Portugal. They are caught by lowering baited pots to the sea floor, which means they catch hardly any unwanted species and barely make contact with the sea bed. Brown crab are the second most important shellfish species for inshore landings in England (behind lobster). It is also one of the best natural sources of copper, zinc, magnesium and vitamin B12. 100g of crab provides 45% of your recommended weekly intake of Omega-3 oil.

Salmon

Salmon farming has been associated with outbreaks of sea lice (which can transfer to fish in the wild); overuse of chemicals in some farms (including antibiotics); escapees and impacts on surrounding wild salmon.

The alternatives Trout Trout is an oily fish, similar to salmon, but can be farmed with fewer chemicals and antibiotics. They are farmed in open tanks next to a freshwater supply (normally a river). Water is diverted into the tanks and then treated before being returned to the river. Trout are also farmed in enclosures in lochs. The discharge can be harmful to the environment but in the UK this isn’t considered a problem because farms are small scale, frequently tested and few in number. Trout are carnivorous fish whose feed relies on wild fisheries, which is worth noting as their main sustainability issue. Trout is a rich source of omega-3 fatty acid and is low in saturated fat so a great healthy choice and a sustainable alternative to salmon. Sardines Sardines are small, inexpensive, and considered one of the healthiest foods you can eat, so they are a great alternative to pan-fried or grilled salmon. Sardines contain more omega-3s than salmon, tuna or just about any other food; it’s also one of the few foods that’s naturally high in vitamin D. Despite the high oil content, sardines don’t have an ‘oily’ feel when eaten. Plenty of small bones are distributed throughout the fish, but these are filament-thin, so barely noticeable when eaten. Sardines are caught around the coast of the UK but most from Cornwall, in September, October and November. Mackerel Mackerel is a fast-growing fish, so resilient to fishing pressure, and caught using mid-water trawler gear that has very low by-catch and has little impact on the environment. Mackerel is good source of protein – containing 20 grams in a 3-ounce fillet. Mackerel is available year-round as smoked or tinned fillets, and is best eaten fresh during the summer months.

Eel

European eel populations are at an all-time low. They are assessed as Critically Endangered in the wild and are an IUCN Red List species. Urgent action is needed to recover the stock.

The alternatives Herring Mackerel’s smaller and less expensive cousin is one of the most abundant fish species in the North Atlantic and one of the most important in the ocean ecosystem. Herring feed mainly on zooplankton (copepods, mysids, euphausiids, fish egg and larvae) and juvenile fish. They are a very important prey for most predator species including cod, coley, whiting, mackerel, sea birds and marine mammals. Sweet marinated herring roll mops make a great alternative to jellied eels and herring is an excellent source of vitamin A and D, with more of both than beef and pork combined. Smoked herring kippers can also be used as a substitute for any smoked fish.

We know that plastic is catastrophic for our oceans, and there are a ton of reasons to cheer a cultural shift that's said to bring sustainability and save ocean animals. But a straw ban may not be as sustainable as you may think it is, and there are things we need to consider as we try to make the world a better place.

There are myriad environmental benefits to reducing or eliminating single-use plastics, which aren't recyclable more often than not. But it's important to move towards a more sustainable future in a way that doesn't make life more difficult for people who rely on plastic. Straws have been the particular focus of attention in recent years, David M. Perry writing for Pacific Standard notes, following a viral video of a sea turtle with a straw in its nose, even though straws haven't been shown to be a particularly large source of plastic pollution in our oceans. If we're thinking about solutions to the problem of single-use plastics, we need to consider options that don't cause undue harm and that are truly sustainable, in every sense of the word. Here are a few reasons that plastic straw bans might not be as sustainable as you'd think.

1 People With Disabilities Rely On Plastic Straws earthboy__ on Twitter Many disability advocates have suggested that the movement to ban plastic straws has ableist overtones. For some disabled people, plastic straws make it possible to drink without assistance, both at home and out in restaurants. ""I’m accustomed to having straws readily accessible to me when I’m out in public,"" Robyn Poweel wrote for a HuffPost op-ed. ""And as more and more cities and states seek to ban them, I’ve gotten concerned about the unintended consequences these bans will have on people with disabilities. How will I drink if straws are no longer available?"" Moreover, suggesting that disabled folks carry around reusable straws as a workaround is unfeasible, Perry writes for Pacific Standard, as it not only places the responsibility of access on disabled folks, but also can potentially be uncomfortable for people with sensory processing issues. We need to be more conscious of our environmental waste and of the needs of disabled people at the same time.

2 Replacements May Not Be As Great For The Environment As We Think tcarter14 on Twitter New Zealand's Star Media breaks down the difference between plastic straws and other popular straw materials. While plastic isn't good for the environment, options like paper and compostable straws aren't always great for our planet, either, thanks to the impact of producing and shipping them. When you get rid of plastic, it's important to do your research to make sure the replacement is eco-friendly, or you may end up still doing harm.

3 It Can Be Classist, Too mssinenomine on Twitter One of the lures of non-plastic straws is their reusability — instead of throwing away a plastic straw after one drink, you'll be able to wash a straw and use it multiple times. But for people who don't have access to full kitchens, it can be difficult to commit to reusable straws, which can be difficult to wash. Additionally, rather than getting a plastic (or even compostable) straw for free at restaurants, as is the custom currently, the burden would be placed on individuals to purchase their own straws (which aren't super expensive, but aren't cheaper than a free plastic straw) and then carry them back to their own home to wash. The restaurants who'd need to comply with this new regulation could implement reusable straws in their own dining rooms, of course, but it would be incredibly difficult to implement this on a wide scale. It's hard to ignore that a nationwide ban could make life harder for people who live in low-income communities.","But a straw ban may not be as sustainable as you may think it is, and there are things we need to consider as we try to make the world a better place.

Restaurant Success in 2018

Nearly 60 percent of restaurateurs indicate that hiring, training and retaining staff are among the top areas of opportunity for the industry, according to a survey unveiled by Toast. The “Restaurant Success in 2018” Industry Report results also suggest optimizing speed and efficiency, as well as attracting and retaining customers, are the second and third most crucial challenges, respectively, for restaurateurs in 2018.

“While attracting and retaining talent remains the highest priority for restaurants, our research into the key drivers of restaurant success found that top restaurateurs are often more focused than their peers on optimizing their business for performance,” said Aman Narang, president and co-founder of Toast. “As the leading platform committed to helping restaurants delight guests, do what they love, and thrive, we’re excited to provide restaurants of all sizes with free access to the insights and tools they need to grow their business.”

Additional key findings include:

89 percent of restaurateurs say they are optimistic for their restaurant’s sales in 2018;

63 percent of restaurateurs advertise on social media, dropping from 75 percent in 2017;

47 percent admit to scheduling employees to work fewer hours each week; and,

11 percent say reservations are crucial for their POS, despite surging guest demand.

“Having great food and service is not enough in 2018,” says Donald Burns, restaurant consultant. “Some [restaurants] are going to have a hard time if they continue doing the same things they have been doing. Innovation and bringing fresh ideas to the table are key to staying out in front of your market.”

For the survey, 844 restaurant owners, managers, and leaders completed the 2018 Restaurant Success Survey in March and April of 2018. 54 percent of respondents were from casual FSRs, while 21 percent represented a QSR, 14 percent represented a fine dining FSR, seven percent represented a bakery, and four percent represented a bar or nightclub.

Ritual’s Rapid Growth

Oder ahead app Ritual announced year over year growth to more than 44,500 workplace teams added and 2x growth of restaurant partners, in addition to expansion into four new cities and the closing of a $70 million Series C.

Ritual’s rapid growth is largely driven by workplace teams adopting its social ordering and delivery feature Piggyback. Upon signing up for Ritual, Piggyback connects users with teams based on workplace and location, creating a dynamic social element to ordering and picking up lunch, which is often an otherwise individual experience.

“For many urban workers, their neighborhood is their food court. Ritual is designed so that colleagues and coworkers can easily enjoy the local eateries around them and feel like they are one team dining together,” said Ray Reddy, Co-Founder and CEO, Ritual. “Furthermore, Ritual makes it easy for teams to order and bring food back to the office for colleagues. Once restaurants have one customer on Ritual, they are giving that customer a tool to save time when they order and pick-up, and turning that same customer into an advocate for its brand in the workplace, leveraging a network effect that drives additional lunch orders and deliveries.”

Today, more than 44,500 teams across companies like Goldman Sachs, Oath, Spotify and SpotHero have formed on Ritual. More than 50 percent of all orders placed by team members are open to others to join. Team members who often had lunch individually are now sharing lunch time, driving company camaraderie and team unity.

Ritual works with teams and restaurants to make lunchtime ordering, pickup and delivery more convenient in three core ways:

Order ahead food technology: Ritual provides restaurants with turnkey mobile ordering technology, which gives consumers a convenient solution to discover, order and pick up their meals — specifically during lunchtime. With 3,000 restaurants across ten markets, teams have access to pick-up from local eateries or national chains via a single mobile app.

Social ordering and delivery via Piggyback: Using Ritual’s social ordering and delivery feature, Piggyback, teams can connect and collaborate on lunch orders and pick-up lunch for busy teammates. Restaurants are able to leverage existing customers to effectively act as delivery persons for these orders. Restaurants on Ritual’s platform experience repeat customer visits and size orders increase up to 4x due to social features, ease of use and transparent pricing structure.

Actionable data for smoother lunch rush: Ritual provides real-time data on store experience, food quality and customer satisfaction metrics so operators can run a better business, which leaves consumers with a smooth ordering and pick-up experience to maximize their lunch breaks. In addition to providing metrics on their own business, Ritual can help operators benchmark metrics to similar businesses to help operators understand where they are doing better or worse. With actionable insights, operators can often double Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) metrics to keep more customers coming back.



To support the rapid growth, Ritual closed a $70 million Series C round led by Georgian Partners with participation from existing investors Greylock Partners, Insight Ventures, Mistral Venture Partners.

In 2017, Ritual added Tishman Speyer, the leading owner, developer, and manager of premier commercial real estate in top cities around the world, as a Series B strategic investor. Tishman Speyer is scaling Ritual through its global properties, and will help the company continue its strong growth among real estate investors and property managers.

“As part of our workplace amenity program Zo, Ritual creates a sense of community for our tenants, makes their day-to-day lives easier and boosts their productivity, and we’re excited to bring this experience to more Tishman Speyer locations globally,” said Rob Speyer, President and CEO of Tishman Speyer. “We take great pride in the distinctive quality, value and services we offer to our tenants worldwide, and Ritual fits perfectly into our philosophy.”

Ritual is currently available online and via iOS and Android apps in major metro markets, including Boston, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York, San Francisco, Santa Monica, Washington, D.C., and its hometown of Toronto. Focused on densely-populated metros, Ritual plans to expand its offering to Atlanta, Dallas, Philadelphia and San Diego in the coming months.

“This is a huge market opportunity. Ray and his team are building a great business with a beautiful product that enables merchants to quickly digitize and grow revenues.” said Steve Leightell, Partner, Georgian Partners. “We’re excited to be leading this round and to have the opportunity to partner with Ritual to further accelerate their use of machine learning, artificial intelligence and data science.”

Tripleseat Partners with Bizly

Tripleseat and Bizly have partnered to provide corporate planners direct access to leading restaurants, hospitality venues and hotels with private dining.

Through this partnership, Tripleseat restaurants and unique venues will be listed on Bizly for events and meetings. When a Bizly customer inquires about an event at one of the Tripleseat customers venues, the Tripleseat venue will automatically receive the lead via the Bizly corporate portal. Through this partnership, Bizly can expand private dining options for corporate event planners and give Tripleseat venues access to their Fortune 500 corporate event planners.

“This exciting partnership with Bizly expands our efforts in providing our customers with valuable event leads from within larger enterprises and corporations,” says Jonathan Morse, CEO of Tripleseat. “The private dining and special events market continues to prosper, and partnering with Bizly allows our customers to have access to event planners from not only Fortune 500 companies, but pharmaceuticals companies as well. In return, we provide a positive, painless experience for planners looking to book a venue for their next event.”

Bizly’s innovative platform allows companies to easily and efficiently select venues and book events while abiding by their company’s pre-set spending limits, compliance rules, and negotiated rates. Bizly’s concierge support leverages the personal attention and negotiation power of a traditional meeting agency without the excessive price tag and lag time around small meetings.

“Private dining events have always been a challenge for our Fortune 500 customers,” said Ron Shah, CEO of Bizly. “There have been tremendous inefficiencies around finding the right venue and booking in compliance to policy. Our partnership with Tripleseat helps deliver the highest quality venue options along with a consistent booking experience every time.”

B.GOOD Names CEO

B.GOOD appointed Chris Fuqua as the company’s new Chief Executive Officer. He assumes day-to-day leadership of the company following more than eight years at Dunkin’Brands, where he served in a variety of leadership roles including Marketing, Operations, Supply Chain and Strategy.

After 15 years, B.GOOD’s co-founder Anthony Ackil has decided to step down as CEO to focus on his next entrepreneurial venture and the next chapter in his life and career and to spend time with his young family. He will maintain a large position with the company as a member of its Board of Directors and as a continued investor.

“It has been a tremendous ride since I opened our first restaurant almost 15 years ago with my best friend Jon. We watched our vision grow to almost 70 locations and we made an impact across so many communities with so many of our employees and their families. It is an amazing feeling and I am so proud of what we have accomplished,” said Ackil. “But, it is time for me to pass the torch to Chris, whom I know will bring great energy and life to our business. Chris is the right person to bring our company to its next level and was my very first choice to succeed me as CEO. I know he will maintain the company’s vision and build on its authentic roots and the unique culture we’ve established over the years. Chris will put his own stamp on B.GOOD, and I know he will take us to amazing new heights. I can’t wait to see how our little company continues to grow.”

“There are very few companies with the authenticity, mission-driven focus, and brand identity that B.GOOD has developed over the years. That’s what makes this opportunity so thrilling for me personally,” said Fuqua. “I have so much admiration for what Anthony and Jon and the team developed at B.GOOD. Since joining the company’s board, I have felt the passion our people have for great tasting, locally sourced food that makes you feel good and I have witnessed the impact our mission has on so many communities. I am both humbled and incredibly enthusiastic to lead the company, scale this amazing, authentic culture and implement new ideas as we continue to expand. The future for B.GOOD is incredibly bright and I look forward to leading us through the next phase of growth.”

Open Fields Platform for Sustainable Sourcing

FarmLogix launched Open Fields, a software platform that allows food service operations at colleges, schools, hospitals, sports and leisure facilities and businesses of all kinds to more easily source and report on sustainable ingredients and purchases. Aramark is the first partner to deploy Open Fields, having signed an exclusive agreement with FarmLogix through 2019 to utilize the ground-breaking platform.

“Open Fields helps a broad range of institutions in foodservice, healthcare, higher education, retail and hospitality to meet growing consumer demand for local and sustainable food,” said Linda Mallers, CEO and President of FarmLogix. “We are the first logistics–enabled platform to provide source and attribute transparency from the time of order through delivery within a B2B and B2B2C platform that allows the user to define what local and sustainable means to them, while knowing the source and quality of their food from time of order.”

“As a global company that serves 2 billion meals each year, our size and reach enable us to influence scalable change through sourcing practices,” said Scott Barnhart, Senior Vice President of Supply Chain Management at Aramark. “Open Fields will help Aramark increase our access to fresh, high quality, local produce and sustainably sourced products that also support the thousands of local communities we serve.”

Open Fields enables institutions to search, save and build programs based on custom definitions and purchasing needs. Convenient dashboards allow users to run custom analytics, while national entities such as Aramark, can run metrics on their own sustainability initiatives by location, product, spend, attribute, farm/vendor, miles to location and distributor. It is also the industry’s first reporting and analytics engine that allows onsite managers to generate reports on sustainable purchases at their individual client locations.

Aramark is using the tool to track sustainable attributes such as: Seafood Watch® Best Choice or Good Alternative, Fair Trade USA certified, USDA Organic and more. The platform provides the ability to search and report on locally sourced products and purchasing by unique customer definition, such as mile radius, state or state agricultural marketing programs.

The dashboards enable onsite managers and corporate teams to gain insight into a range of sustainability initiatives by tracking progress and generating reports. Highlights of recent activity include:

41 participating K-12 districts in the 2017-18 school year sourced an excess of 4 million pounds of produce, including kale, arugula and spring greens, supporting 75 US farms

A major US university partner supports 15 local farms with access to detail on product, spend and distance from each farm to campus.

25 vendors supply No Antibiotics Ever (NAE) meat products to a wide variety of locations

Clients have access to over 360+ unique Fair Trade certified products, reflecting nearly $11 million in purchases

Purchases of cage free shell eggs, in alignment with Aramark’s commitment

Compliance with third party sustainability reporting programs such as AASHE STARS, Real Food Challenge and Healthcare Without Harm

“Customer definitions of local and sustainable are as unique as fingerprints,” Mallers continues. “Meeting individualized customer needs poses enormous complexity for foodservice and broadline distribution. Our platform identifies products that meet those unique customer needs, creates sales opportunities for producers and distributors, and increases efficiency and transparency across the supply chain. We are excited that our partnership with Aramark, a company that has the ability to truly change a farmer or small business owner’s life, will bring full transparency and scale to local and sustainable purchasing. The impact their resulting purchasing power has will truly create meaningful industry change, and we are thrilled to be a part of it.”

Aramark has partnered with FarmLogix since 2012. The company will utilize Open Fields to design and customize programs that meet the company’s industry-leading sustainability and health and wellness commitments.

The award program continues in his memory. Simple Price Compare

SimpleTM added Simple Price CompareTM which simplifies the price checking process—cutting the time to compare and purchase products from hours to seconds. The new proprietary pricing algorithm, is now available on the Simple Amazon-like digital restaurant marketplace. Now, restaurant operators can go online, select the items they want, add them to their cart, and request price quotes. Simple Price Compare then presents comparable offerings from different sellers, and buyers can click to choose which items they want from which vendors. Simple Price Compare makes all this possible by:

Intelligently presenting the same or similar items with different names, such as “farm-raised tilapia” and “tilapia, farm raised”—eliminating the need for buyers to search for comparable products.

Automatically calculating the price per the exact same unit size, so managers and chefs can make apples-to-apples comparisons.

Displaying information about the quantity required to get a quoted price, so operators can make smart decisions about whether a deal makes sense for their restaurant.

“In a business where profitability comes down to pennies, restaurant operators are trying to offset the rising costs of wages, rent, and food prices by making smart purchases that offer the best value for the price,” said Dan McMurtrie, Simple founder and CEO. “However, the price checking that restaurants have to undertake weekly has been a labor-intensive and time-consuming task. Now, with the new Simple Price Compare pricing algorithm, we help restaurants’ operations become more efficient by making this faster and easier. And by taking the time and mystery out of comparing products and pricing, we’re empowering managers and chefs to better manage costs while gaining valuable hours back in their day. At the same time, pricing clarity makes it easier for distributors and sellers of all sizes to compete on the value of their offerings.”

“We purchase hundreds of different items each week. It takes hours to compare different sellers’ offers, and we don’t have the time it takes to get the best deal on each one,” said Peter de Castro, Tavern at the Park owner and proprietor. “Simple Price Compare is a game changer. For the first time, it’s possible to compare available offers in one place, with pricing by the same per-unit measure, to make informed purchases in just seconds.”

Simple was launched in 2017 to bring down the traditional barriers between restaurant operators and the range of sellers they rely on—from distributors and suppliers to local farmers and gourmet food producers. Today, nearly 4,000 businesses rely on Simple to more efficiently buy and sell restaurant goods.

For restaurants, the Simple marketplace provides Amazon-like simplicity with a single shopping cart; simplified price-checking process; one-click ordering for food, beer, wine, liquor and supplies; and a dashboard with real-time spending visibility. As a result, restaurant managers and chefs can save 20-plus hours each month and tens of thousands of dollars a year—at no cost for using the Simple marketplace.

For distributors and other sellers, Simple delivers a digital platform to grow existing accounts and connect instantly with restaurant operators seeking new suppliers. Using Simple, sellers can open a digital storefront to promote their products to restaurants 24×7, find hot sales leads, and send quotes to existing customers or prospects in minutes. As a result, sellers can spend less time driving and more time selling, increase sales through better reach to new and existing customers, and grow their business with data only available on the Simple platform.

Protecting Coral Reefs

The fresh fish experts at Bonefish Grill are joining The Nature Conservancy, top photo by Carlton Ward for The Nature Conservancy, to increase awareness about the importance of protecting coral reefs and to help the nonprofit restore one million corals by 2025. The Conservancy is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization committed to conserving the lands and waters on which all life depends.

This year marks the International Year of the Reef, a worldwide initiative to create a better understanding of the significance of coral reefs. Coral reefs are one of the most threatened marine systems, and scientists estimate that unless we take immediate action the world could lose up to 70 percent of coral reefs by 2050. Bonefish Grill is taking action by supporting the Conservancy’s Plant a Million Corals Initiative. The initiative seeks to restore more than one million corals across Florida and the Caribbean and share restoration and conservation practices with local communities.

“We are excited about our new partnership with The Nature Conservancy and thrilled to support its coral restoration initiative,” said David Schmidt, President of Bonefish Grill. “Bonefish Grill and our guests truly treasure the ocean’s resources and we look forward to shining a spotlight on the importance of these efforts.”

During a series of Celebration Nights – launching June 5-11 at Bonefish Grill locations nationwide – Bonefish Grill guests can enjoy a coral reef-inspired cocktail, designed to increase awareness of the Conservancy’s coral reef restoration efforts.

The largest living structures on the planet, coral reefs are home to 25 percent of all marine species and provide critical resources. In addition to food, coral reefs provide: a means for income that sustains 500 million people, protection from storms as they break wave energy, ingredients for medicines, and incredible places to play and learn. However, over the last 30 years, ocean acidification, increased temperatures, overfishing and unplanned coastal development have caused coral cover in the Caribbean and Florida to decline by 50 to 80 percent.

“Tackling the challenges facing coral reefs in Florida, the Caribbean and beyond requires cooperation and coordination across government, nonprofit, and corporate sectors,” said Dr. Joseph Pollock, Coral Strategy Director for The Nature Conservancy in the Caribbean. “By teaming with the Conservancy to raise awareness of the plight of coral reefs and support on-the-ground action to protect and restore them, Bonefish Grill has shown its commitment to turning the tide on coral reef decline.”

156,https://www.dawn.com/news/1414708,"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",DAWN.com,New transport policy for sustainable mobility,"PAKISTAN has been struggling to meet its fast-growing demand for transport and provide quality transportation to a rapidly urbanising population.

Standing at around 208 million, the nation is already the sixth most populous in the world with a 2.4 per cent growth rate. The Planning Commission has estimated that Pakistan’s population travels nearly 400 billion passenger-kilometres (pkm) each year, which is expected to rise to 1,000bn pkm by 2030 and add pressure on the transport infrastructure.

The urban population accounts for approximately 76m or 36pc of the population and is set to reach around 60pc by 2025. Keeping this in mind, investments in road transport infrastructure and mass transit systems have so far been the focus.

Yet, such improvements have fallen short of the challenge at hand, resulting in growing congestion and both environmental and safety problems. Karachi, Peshawar and Lahore have been ranked low in terms of liveability due to the environmental quality.

Transport itself contributes 22.3pc to the services sector GDP and accounts for approximately 6pc of the nation’s total employment, says the Planning Commission that has recently got approved a National Transport Policy from the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz government as a starting point to be followed with sectoral master plans.

An underlying theme of the policy seeks fares of all transport modes to reflect true costs, including environmental and social externalities

The development in the transport sector has been unbalanced with no coherent institutional framework or up-to-date legislation. This has resulted in poor integration of transport services, underutilising the full potential of road, rail, air, ports, pipelines and waterways in Pakistan.

On the other hand, the local logistics industry is under-developed and does not provide cost-effective and integrated modern logistics services.

Pakistan ranked 68th on the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index of 160 nations in 2016 for the quality of trade and transport infrastructure, although it has improved from its 110th position in 2010.

Although the new National Transport Policy did not concede to a demand from stakeholders for the creation of a transport ministry for coordinated development of the entire transport chain, it nevertheless wants to upgrade and modernise all the transport modes in an integrated manner through a cabinet committee on transport to be chaired by the Prime Minister.

An underlying theme of the policy seeks fares of all transport modes to reflect true costs, including environmental and social externalities.

Urban transport will be a single integrated system for public/private transport, non-motorised transport, and freight transport. Individual urban transport master plans will be developed for all major cities on a 10-year time frame and with a 20-year horizon.

Public transport will cover the metropolitan urban area, integrating the main destinations with inter-urban transport terminals. Mass transit systems, including bus rapid transit and commuter rail lines will be considered for all cities.

Freight will be routed through dedicated freight corridors, limiting urban pass-through transport. For large urban cities, final mile distribution centres will be established.

The priority for passenger transport by road will be to enhance the usage of non-motorised transport and public transport. Private transport will be considered complementary to non-motorised transport.

For freight, the predominant movement by road transport will increasingly be shifted to rail and pipeline by better integration of agriculture and industry to rail stations, dry ports, and pipelines.

Rural roads will remain vital for providing accessibility to local communities and public services, while urban roads will be designed to support efficient and effective urban transport. The international road transport will be supported by accession to and implementation of relevant international road transport agreements and conventions.

Railway operations would be organised to become more commercially viable and will remain in the public sector. Private sector participation in railway operations and maintenance will be encouraged and promoted, in ways that serve the public interest.

For passengers, rail transport will prioritise the provision of fast and reliable inter-urban services between all major urban centres. For freight, rail transport will focus on the provision of long-haul transport, particularly of container, trailer and bulk commodities, to reduce the share of freight moving on the road network.

Direct connectivity to, and inter-modal connections between the ports, dry ports and industrial areas will be enhanced. Dedicated inter-modal terminals for passengers will be provided within and near urban areas to connecting public transport.

Air transport will be liberalised in accordance with the open skies policy on a reciprocal basis to stimulate new entrants establishing new routes and increasing the number of flights to and from Pakistan. Specific domestic routes for socio-economic purposes will be targeted via Public Service Obligations.

Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority will be restructured, separating its regulatory and service provision responsibilities. The CAA may enter into suitable public-private partnerships for operation, management and development of airports.

The maritime sector shall be geared to become a major engine of growth through its support and facilitation of international trade. Karachi port and Port Qasim will serve as the primary international gateway ports for all types of commodity shipments, with Gwadar Port balancing national trade opportunities, transhipment and regional transit.

Oil, gas and bulk liquid will principally be transported via pipelines. Bulk dry commodities will be considered via slurry pipelines or conveyors upon establishment of a supporting business case. Pipeline connections will be established to ports, terminals, refineries, storage depots, dry ports, airports, industrial zones and to the periphery of urban areas.

157,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/a-voice-for-sustainable-architecture/article24240421.ece,"Sat, 23 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Hindu,A voice for sustainable architecture,"Architect Fahed Majeed is a champion for sustainable building, which reuses and recycles materials

Sitting amidst the sleek, steel and glass buildings in the Dubai Design District, the creation in copper, the Abwab Pavilion, was an anachronism. Like a body from another time, something that had travelled straight out of imagination. Made of re-purposed bedsprings, the Abwab Pavilion was at the Dubai Design Week, held last year. “The bedsprings were at the end of their life cycle, having done their work...it can’t get more sustainable than that. It was also an ideal scenariorecycling material and then, at the end of the exhibition, it is again sent for recycling,” says Fahed Majeed, of Fahed + Architects.

The mandate was that the material had to come out of the yard - tyres, cans, rubber, or mattresses from one of Sharjah’s main recycling companies Be’ah. Rarely in a busy architectural practise, Fahed says, does the opportunity to let the material decide how it wants to be interpreted present itself. This chance was unlike others. “We go by standard systems, there is no time to think what a material wants to be. This time we went with how the material could be interpreted.” Turning a pile of condemned bedsprings into a temporary habitable space (for an exhibition) was exciting.

But then that is how he works, how he feels about creating spaces. Fahed explicates his concept of the ideal living space. It is not one idea, instead it is a flow of several ideas where abstract but relevant concepts such as ‘mental pollution’, well being, a balance of the indoors and the outdoors meld and mix. It is probably a nod to his sensibility that the Flying House, by his firm, won two awards last yearthe JK Awards’ National Architect of the year award, and NDTV Design Awards (Best House - Warm and Humid).

Speaking of the house, built for Jacob T Abraham in Kolenchery, he says, “The 7400 sq.ft residential building stands out on landscaped flat terrain with a sloping roof that gives the feeling of a form about to soar up to the skies. The design concept tries to give form to the ‘new liberating architecture style’ that is the evolution of traditional Kerala buildings to the current age - 2015. The uniquely inverted roof structure in this design gives it a ‘neo-contemporary’ approach with a fresh perception of the traditional roof. This residence is a single storey four bed room unit located on a 1.35 acre property designed around the landscape. The most successful effort in sustainability is the use of natural light and air.” The house is self sufficient in terms of its power with its entire electricity requirements met through solar power; the design of the rainwater harvesting system captures 100% of the rainwater that falls on the extensive 12000 square feet roof surface.

Sustainability, he is convinced, has to extend beyond the regular perception of using LED lights and solar water heaters. “Don’t look at it from a purely Western perception of just energy conservation.” He speaks about a larger benefit that includes, besides consideration of material used, physical well being where one builds a house for oneself rather than to impress. One of the few charter members of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) from Kerala, Fahed, with offices in Dubai and Bali, has designed and built commercial, residential and resorts in India and abroad. He will soon be in a joint venture with Spanish architect Celso Estevez, which will, he hopes, expand his horizon to include Europe.

Reuse and recycle in the context of a new building might come across as being suspect, but these are the small steps that need to be taken. Lot of the material that goes into construction does not degenerate fast enough, rather than dump them around he offers recycling as a solution. “The perception of reuse seems to imply cheap - it is not necessarily so.” Demolition of old constructions usually yields tiles, which can be reused, for instance and most of these are, by no means cheap.

A cause close to his heart, Fahed sees sustainability as not one act but as a collective of actions. Food sustainability is one, “you grow food on whatever land you have, and if your neighbour cultivates something else that you need, you barter. Create a sustainable ecosystem as you go.” Kerala has a strong architectural history, which unfortunately didn’t evolve and now “ we are left with neither the past nor the future. Design-wise, now, we are not very sensitive!”

Spatial quality has to contribute to the sense of well being of those inhabiting a space, “fortunately, irrespective of religion and other prejudices, any good space is appreciated universally. A good space has to have the right balance of the inside and the outside, air flow, the smell of the soil. Philosophical as it sounds it should be in touch with elements, not disconnected. A house has to grounded, close to the earth!”","“The bedsprings were at the end of their life cycle, having done their work...it can’t get more sustainable than that.
It was also an ideal scenariorecycling material and then, at the end of the exhibition, it is again sent for recycling,” says Fahed Majeed, of Fahed + Architects.

If you plan to visit one of the 1073 World Heritage sites this year, help contribute to protecting the site by not using single-use plastic. 50% of consumer plastics are designed to be used only once, and nearly one third of the plastics we do use escape our collection systems. Once they’re in the environment, plastics don’t go away—they just get smaller and smaller, and increasingly find their way into our food chain, into our water and onto our plates.

As much as 80% of tourism relates to coastal areas, and marine pollution now includes an average of 13,000 pieces of plastic litter on every square kilometre of ocean. Up to 90% of seabirds are found to have plastic in their bellies.

So for plastic water bottles, cups, bags, food containers, cutlery, and straws—replace them with a re-usable version and help make a change today. Bring your own cloth bag, stainless-steel water bottle, bamboo cutlery, or paper straws. To protect our heritage, we need to be good tourists.

Renewable and cleaner energy is a vital piece of the solution. Solar, wind, hydro and electrifying what we can are ways to move the situation in a better direction, creating a tomorrow that’s set up to handle the problems we’ll face.

Here in the UK, there’s interesting moves afoot. These are the developments that are making us feel hopeful.

More of this, please.

1. We’re making milestones with renewables

The period between April and June 2017 was a fresh record for the volume of UK electricity generated from low carbon sources. Up to 53.4% (versus 46.7% in the same period in 2016), the months also saw a record low for coal-generated electricity, which stood at 2.1%.

2. Northern Ireland’s got some big ideas

The Northern Ireland Renewables Industry Group (NIRIG) is set to publish a strategy detailing how they forecast that the country could be powered by 70% renewable electricity by 2030.

As well as being a big deal for creating a more sustainable future, they predict that this could come at no extra cost to consumers.

3. We’re buying more electric vehicles

It’s time to drive into a future of charging, rather than filling up, your car. The UK saw an 11% rise in sales of the vehicles between April 2017 to April 2018, a decent dent in the market.

No time to rest on our laurels, though – we’re still far behind Norway, where 48% of new vehicle registrations in the first quarter of 2018 were electric.

4. Coal is becoming less important

Another record declared in April 2018: this one being that we managed three coal-free days. Wind and gas-generated fuel were what powered most people in England, Scotland and Wales during this time.

5. Scotland’s stepped up

By generating 68.1% of its energy from renewable sources in 2017 – up 26% on 2016 – the country has proven its cleaner power prowess. The majority of this was driven by increased offshore wind capacity, according to a 2018 Energy Trends report from The Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy.

6. Academics are creating solutions

Over at De Montfort University Leicester (DMU), two sustainable energy projects have been recognised by the EU’s Innovation Radar. First up is the institution’s ‘Smart Spaces’ project, which saw tech which monitors energy consumption installed in public buildings around Europe.

People participating were made aware of their energy consumption via red, amber and green smiley face signals (the idea being to alert them to their consumption and provoke a decrease).

The POWER (Political and Social Awareness on Water Environmental Challenges) project, meanwhile, is an online platform which has been developed to help cities manage their water supplies more efficiently.

7. The petrol and diesel ban is in the diary

Not soon enough, it could be argued. But there will be an end to the manufacturing of new cars made the traditional way in 2040, as part of an effort to clean up our air. Fingers crossed, this pushes anticipatory change a lot faster than that.

8. Smart neighbourhoods are on the horizon

A recent report from the Solar Trade Association detailed how a ‘smart community’ of 500 low carbon homes in Nottingham is being created, complete with smart meters, renewable energy storage and an urban solar farm. A prototype of the communities of the future? Here’s hoping.","Solar, wind, hydro and electrifying what we can are ways to move the situation in a better direction, creating a tomorrow that’s set up to handle the problems we’ll face.

Thanks to Gupta’s vision, the company has multiplied its growth over the last three decades by introducing new products, improving quality, increasing productivity, benchmarking the entire product line and eventually gaining the mindspace of a large number of customers. APL Apollo is now the largest producer of Electric Resistance Welded (ERW) steel pipes and sections in India, with a capacity to produce more than 1.3 million tonnes per annum. It has truly redefined the market space for steel pipes business.



“ERW steel pipes industry is leveraging on the growth from its increased usage in unconventional sectors such as construction of malls, airports, bus body, metros, gym equipment, furniture, real estate, etc. The growth will be further stimulated by the increasing usage of ERW steel pipes in the end-user segments. Our well thought moves to strengthen our technical capability and operational efficiency will negate the competition up to 15 years. Our other key strategic decisions include the upcoming greenfield plant at Raipur (Chhattisgarh) to cater to the rising demand from eastern and central India. This will make us the only ERW steel manufacturer with a pan-India presence. We also have plans to garner revenues from Europe and the US to enhance our shareholder wealth,” said New Delhi-headquartered APL Apollo’s executive chairman Gupta in the FY 2016-17 annual report of the company.



Founded by Gupta’s father late Sudesh Kumar Gupta, APL Apollo (earlier known as Bihar Tubes) was incorporated in 1986. The company is a leading manufacturer and exporter of steel pipes and tubes, aluminised steel tubes, black steel tubes, hot dipped and pre-galvanised steel tubes, fence tubes, structural steel. Its vast distribution network is spread across India, with warehouses and branch offices in 25 cities. It now exports to over 20 countries globally.



“Strategic initiatives such as the implementation of national Steel Policy 2017, preference by the government to Indian manufacturers through its ‘Make-In-India’ initiative will provide impetus to the overall economic growth and development. Further, the implementation of GST will negate competition from unorganised players in the steel sector. This initiative will help us in leveraging the additional business share from unorganised players as well as strengthen industry operations. Our relentless pursuit to foster sustainable development is imbibed in the culture of APL Apollo. We are constantly evolving to create a sustainable brand through best in class operational practices.

Organized by UN Youth Delegates

Permanent Mission of Germany to the UN, New York

11 July 2018

Ladies and gentlemen,

Allow me to thank the Youth delegates of Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Estonia and Denmark, and the Permanent Representative of Germany for convening this discussion and for a strong commitment to the High-Level Political Forum.

By 2050, cities will be home to 70% of the projected 9 billion people living on the planet, leaving no doubt that the success or failure of the 2030 Agenda will be determined in cities.

National and city governments can encounter a broad range of challenges due to the fact that extreme poverty is often concentrated in urban spaces. Making cities sustainable means ensuring access to safe and affordable housing, investing in public transport, creating green, public and safe spaces, and improving urban planning and management in a way that is both participatory and inclusive. The urban landscape goes way beyond the physical structure; it also has to do with the way in which we manage affairs and support peoples’ wellbeing and development in the urban setting.

With those challenges also comes the enormous power of cities to change the world. These dynamic and complex organisms generally concentrate knowledge and resources, capacities to innovate, universities, research centers, companies, and networks of civil society organizations. Cities are home to millions of young people. Globally, 85 per cent of the world’s young people live in developing countries and an ever-increasing number of them are growing up in cities. Young people, and particularly urban young people, should be supported and promoted as agents of change, innovators and leaders.

In UNDP, we are fully committed to the implementation of the New Urban Agenda and the 2030 Agenda and recognize that the complex, inter-connected nature of urban development issues requires us to go beyond sector-specific or technical solutions and to place young women and men at the centre.

- Urban development should engage all stakeholders and partners, in particular youth, whom already demonstrate their resilience and capacity to innovate;

- Enhancing urban infrastructure must go together with efforts that make cities more “inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable” --- this includes youth empowerment, inclusive economic growth, jobs and livelihoods, responsive local governance, anticorruption efforts, rule of law, disaster risk reduction and resilience, among others.



- A bottom-up approach and meaningful youth participation in local policy-making and accountability are vital. Young people experience challenges first-hand and should have the space and capacities necessary to formulate and implement solutions tailored to their contexts.



- Referring to smart cities, smart citizens play a fundamental role. Who is better placed than young people to reflect on new behaviours that can drive urban innovation, support cities’ sustainability goals, push the frontiers, and feed the social, political, economic and cultural vibrancy of cities?



- As we are committed to leaving no-one behind, we must also make a conscious effort to address persistent stereotypes about young people. As outlined in the independent Study on Youth, Peace and Security, negative assumptions about youth do not just have to do with demographics but are also associated with rapid population movements and growing youth urbanisation. These have tended to produce marginalization, discrimination and prejudice, often sparking anti-immigrant populist movements that stimulate social discord and violence. Young migrants, refugees and internally displaced people are still often seen as potential threats and a drain on public services and the social security system, rather than resilient and potentially innovative.



Thank you and I look forward to a stimulating conversation.","Statement by Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator at the Side event on “Sustainable Urban Mobility: What can YOU(TH) do?”Organized by UN Youth DelegatesPermanent Mission of Germany to the UN, New York11 July 2018Ladies and gentlemen,Allow me to thank the Youth delegates of Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Estonia and Denmark, and the Permanent Representative of Germany for convening this discussion and for a strong commitment to the High-Level Political Forum.

166,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobeccles/2018/07/01/the-importance-of-the-healthcare-sector-to-the-sustainable-development-goals/,"Sun, 01 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Forbes Now,The Importance Of The Healthcare Sector To The Sustainable Development Goals,"It is now widely accepted that the private sector, both companies and investors, is essential to accomplishing the 169 targets in the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Of course, there is a tension here. The SDGs are about making the world a better place. That is not the primary reason companies exist, although the state of the world matters to them. Thus, they should work to create a better world while still delivering the expected returns to their shareholders. This can be done by focusing on the material environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues that matter for value creation and knowing which SDGs and their targets will benefit. Choices must be made. As shown in a study by Mozaffar Khan, George Serafeim, and Aaron Yoon, high performance on these material ESG issues improves financial performance. High performance on these ESG issues will also contribute to the SDGs.

Since the material ESG issues vary by industry (e.g., access to medicine is material for a pharmaceutical company but irrelevant to a chemical company where carbon emissions is material), it follows that any given industry will be more important to some SDGs than others. In a recent article in the MIT Sloan Management Review Professor Costanza Consolandi of the University of Siena and I have identified the three industries which are most important for each SDG based on an analysis at the SDG level. We have also shown that the healthcare sector is the single most important one for achieving the SDGs, followed by resource transformation, consumption, and non-renewable resources (all three of which are about the same). We reach this conclusion using a methodology based on mapping the material ESG issues identified by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) for its 79 industries aggregated into 10 sectors to the SDGs. The SDG impact of an industry is a function of the number of its material issues (out of SASB’s universal list of 30) and which SDGs they are relevant to.

With Professor Gianni Betti, also of the University of Siena, we extended this analysis down to the target level of the SDGs. Through this detailed and somewhat complex analysis, we are able to show how each industry can contribute to which targets of the SDGs based on an index ranging from 0 to 100. We hope this will provide a useful narrative to companies, enabling them to explain to their shareholders and other stakeholders how they are both creating economic value and addressing pressing environmental and social challenges. We also hope it will help investors make decisions in their investment decisions and engagement activities in companies.

Here is an overview of our findings based on a target-level analysis for the healthcare sector which is comprised of six industries: biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, healthcare delivery, healthcare distribution, and managed care. The first two, with identical scores based on a materiality analysis, have the highest and equal impact on the SDGs with an overall index of 53.7 on a score of 0 to 100. (The methodology is described in our paper.) They are followed by medical equipment (45.6), healthcare delivery (25.6), healthcare distribution (14.3), and managed care (13.8). Clearly there is substantial variation within the healthcare sector in terms of its importance to the SDGs and to which ones. Biotech and pharma are particularly important for SDGs:

#4 (Quality Education-87.50)

#6 (Clear Water and Sanitation-66.7)

#9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure-66.7)

#11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities-68.4)

#14 (Life Below Water-65.0).

The SDGs for which biotech and pharma are least relevant are:

#1 (No Poverty-40.9)

#7 (Affordable and Clean Energy-43.5)

#8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth-45.8)

#13 (Climate Action-33.3)

#16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions-43.5).

Medical equipment is particularly important for:

#2 (Zero Hunger-60.0)

#4 (62.5), #12 (Sustainable Cities and Communities-64.5)

#14 (65.0)

#15 (Life on Land-61.0)

Using a cutoff point of 60.0, Healthcare delivery is only important for #4 (62.5). From a materiality perspective, healthcare distribution and managed care are relatively unimportant to the SDGs, with the former have a maximum index of 33.3 for #13 and the latter a maximum index of 37.5 for #4.

These findings show that an industry can contribute to the SDGs beyond the intuitively obvious, as illustrated by biotech and pharma for SDG #3 (Good Health and Well-Being-52.9), which actually ranks behind their top five. The reason for this is that our methodology is fundamentally based on a mapping of SASB’s material issues to the SDGs. For example, the total count of SASB’s material issues on the nine targets in SDG #3 is 51. Not all of these are issues are material for the biotech or pharmaceutical industries and so the count is 27, resulting in an index of 52.9. In contrast, for Quality Education, the total count of SASB issues on its seven targets is only eight. Biotech and pharma have a count of seven, resulting in an index of 87.5. Thus, these indices are the ratio of the number of material issues in an industry relevant to a target to the total number of SASB issues that are relevant to it.

Our methodology does not attempt to assess the absolute magnitude of an industry on the targets of an SDG. This is a function of a number of variables including quantitative metrics of an ESG issues (e.g., volume of carbon emissions and employee turnover) which, in turn, are a function of industry and company size. Rather, our methodology is designed to evaluate the extent to which issues material to an industry, relative to all the material issues relevant to a target, are relevant to the targets of the SDGs. The virtue of this approach is that it broadens the view of companies regarding which SDGs they can contribute to. For example, the processed foods industry in the consumption sector has the same index as biotech and pharma for SDG #3 (Good Health and Well-Being) of 52.9.

At the same time, our methodology provides a very clear focus on exactly which targets a company can contribute to while improving their financial performance. For example, there are three targets for SDG #13 (Climate Action). Seven of SASB’s issues are relevant to Target 13.1 (Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries), but only three of these (energy management, lifecycle impact of products and services, and supply chain management) are material for the biotech and pharma industries. Two SASB issues are relevant for Target 13.2 (Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning) but none of these are material for the biotech and pharma industries). However, one of these, regulatory capture and political influence, is material for the healthcare distribution industry. None of the SASB issues are relevant to Target 13.3 (Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning.) This illustrates that there are some SDG targets where the private sector cannot play a meaningful role and the entire burden will lay on the public sector.

This materiality-based analysis of SDG impact can be useful to investors as well. The investment community, perhaps even more than the corporate community, sees the SDGs as opportunities for value creation. It is also concerned with the systemic degradation that will result if the SDGs are not achieved. The very large asset owners and asset managers are “universal owners” who cannot diversity away from system-level risk, the issue The Investment Integration Project is focused on. While there are clearly investment opportunities in companies whose products and services are directly relevant to the SDGs, such as those in renewable energy and water conservation, investors also want to know if all of the companies in their portfolios, particularly the largest ones, are making the world a better place or making it worse. By knowing which of a company’s material issues are relevant to which SDG targets and knowing the company’s performance on these issues, investors can make this assessment.

Costanza, Gianni, and I are now working on a paper that will evaluate on a performance basis the extent to which the private sector in the U.S. is currently contributing to the SDGs using ESG performance measures from TruValue Labs, a big data sustainability company. This will enable us to show where the private sector is providing strong support to the SDGs through its material issues and where it is not. At the same time, I will be writing a blog about the other nine sectors in SASB’s classification system similar to this one on healthcare. Next up is resource transformation.","It is now widely accepted that the private sector, both companies and investors, is essential to accomplishing the 169 targets in the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Sustainability incorporates measures against climate change so that people to policy makers could easily get rid of the treacherous practices

If sustainable development were achievable through sustainable infrastructure only, the most of the to-be-elected parties would not have glorified the term “smart” at the municipality and rural municipality levels. From the deep-down dunes to the mountains, “smart cities” just became the refrains during the elections held last year.

Flared with the frenzied smart city ideas, people adopted quite a lot of parametres, mostly, the internet kind of things to understand smart cities. Things like a card to pay the bill and travel and so on overwhelmed the Nepali psyche. It looked like smart cities are inevitable and they have to happen. However, little was done and conceptualised to assure the elegance of infrastructure and lifelines.

Sustainability concept simply disappeared from the politico-academic arena, and smart city dream inundated Nepal overnight. It should be carefully noted in Nepal that smart city would be an excellent idea if we had previously done zonation and wanted to create new urban spaces. However, Nepal, being a sparsely populated region state where planned settlements are not practised yet, may face grave challenges while creating smart cities at this moment. On the contrary, sustainability could be easily assured even in the built-up areas with little to no modifications at all. Kick-off should go along with the public infrastructure to be sustainable first, rather than jotting down the bullet points for the voluminous reports to formulate floating policies and commitment documents. The focus should be on cradle-to-grave analysis.

How the public infrastructures conjoin the triple bottom line (TBL) that is social, environmental and financial should be demarcated at this moment. That is beyond the imagination of smart cities.

When compared, sustainable cities’ longevity is incomparable to smart ones. The most striking aspect is: sustainability settles with resilience, resilience against the multi-hazards in both natural as well as anthropogenic hazard scales. The concept of city recyclability, downscaled toxicity, decommissioning of the public infrastructure to residential buildings, refurbishment, climate responsive and climate change responsive urban and rural settlements, high maintainability and low running cost, initial wise investment, prime focus on local

resources, durability, adaptation in design and deconstruction, encapsulation of social values, culture and practices throughout the service life of the public

infrastructures is a dire need of Nepal rather than just internet controlled livelihoods.

Among the 17 goals set by the United Nations for sustainable development, the 11th goal deals with sustainable cities and communities. Similarly, the 13th goal of “Agenda 2030” depicts climate action. Crucial to note here is sustainability incorporates the measures against climate change so that people to the could easily get rid of the treacherous practices that led to the severity of climate change.

A sustainable urban, as well as rural neighbourhood definitely and undoubtedly, should trap all the carbon emitted by the neighbourhood itself and let the green planet survive. Furthermore, sustainability brings prosperity. Time has come to switch the agenda of “Prosperous Nepal” into “Sustainable Nepal”. The happiness governed by sustainability would be superior to the happiness governed by prosperity. Actually, prosperity alone is an abstract term, mostly hinged to pecuniary issues and at times that may turn a deaf ear to the commonality and co-existence of all the tangible and intangible things on the earth.

Sustainability is often disused in Nepal. But government policies focus on sustainability but never concretise the holistic concept.

Sustainability cannot be achieved if practices are inscrutable and the same is happening in the surroundings nowadays.

In the high mountains, people are importing concrete from thousands of miles away to construct buildings and sell the wood at very low costs. The deficit is so high that the peoples’ earning is largely devoted to affording a home. Likewise, the government invests in infrastructure such as highway bridges without preparing for decommissioning as well as refurbishment strategy, and every time dismantling and replacing have become the tradition.

A few things are there, but the first things should be always at first. Kicking off with sustainability guidelines to public infrastructure and making all the guidelines mandatory would be an ideally instrumental step. Followed by the mandatory guidelines, assessment is needed regarding the materials and methods for sustainable structural and infrastructural construction strategies. In the meantime, the multi-hazards, their plenitude is well agreed in Nepal, should be inducted in the design and constructed to assure resilience alongside the sustainability.

The next step would be imparting the same sustainability concept to household to individual level so that even the livelihoods become sustainable. Obeying the sustainability measures portray ourselves as more dedicated to “Agenda 2030” too. To conclude, this is the right moment for Nepal to switch the dreams of “smart city” to “sustainable city”.

Jointly organized by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), UN Office for Partnerships (UNOP) and UN Global Compact, the day-long event shared best practices, and outlined how partnerships can contribute to the SDGs.

The morning agenda featured two parallel sessions: one on building institutions and platforms that are fit for partnering, and the other focusing on maximizing impact of partnerships at the national level. The former session also served to launch the guidebook, ‘Maximizing the Value of Partnerships for the SDGs,’ authored by DESA and The Partnering Initiative (TPI).

Managing people is key to maximizing value.

Moderating the discussion on building institutions and platforms, Darian Stibbe, TPI Executive Director, noted that the exchange was viewing partnerships in a broad sense, as vehicles for development rather than formal public-private partnerships (PPPs). Panelists in the session highlighted qualities that make organizations fit for partnership, which, Stibbe recognized, can be a challenge, given sectors’ differing values, terminologies, approaches and management styles. These qualities include humility, embracing partners’ diversity, cultural competency, being able to speak the same language across sectors, and converging around a shared vision that manages expectations while building trust. After overcoming these challenges and building a “pro-partnering culture,” discussants emphasized that partnerships’ contributions to society are greater than the sum of their parts.

The first parallel session also identified internal changes that organizations can undertake in order to become fit for partnering. Steps include, but are not limited to: establishing a partnership strategy that puts the SDGs at the core; dedicating human and financial resources to working on partnerships; standardizing common procedures; streamlining bureaucracies to reduce transaction costs; and monitoring to generate evidence that partnerships work. Panelists also underscored the importance of working with local organizations and being partnership brokers, especially when working at the community level. Kate Brown, Global Island Partnership (GLISPA), noted the appropriate level may span multiple levels of governance or country typologies, as GLISPA collaborates with all islands to enable learning, including small island developing States (SIDS), territories and sub-national entities such as Hawaii, US.

At the UN level, participants flagged the need to make entry points for collaboration clearer, but noted that platforms are not only UN-led and can be government-run, housed within universities or driven by non-governmental organizations (NGOs). However, participants agreed that country ownership remains key, and that dialogues can be made more effective by leveraging high-profile individuals to bring diverse groups of people together. Participants highlighted that convergence and collaboration across stakeholders remain vital, especially when seeking to partner with the private sector or mobilize blended sources of finance. Similarly, participants noted the “need to have a need to have a partnership” as making it easier to build trust, align actors, and identify the skill sets needed to navigate political environments and fragmented market spaces.

Common themes from the second parallel session, moderated by Simona Marinescu, UN Development Programme (UNDP), include the need to see partnerships as a “people business,” where managing people is key to success in maximizing value. Similar to the first session, soft skills emerged as paramount to success. Participants also flagged the importance of ensuring that monitoring is factored into results planning, while keeping expectations realistic. A summary statement reviewing what governments can do to support partnerships urged donors not to “trade quality or continuity for quick wins.” We tend to rush, the statement noted, but maximizing returns requires careful planning, an understanding of culture and behavior, and standards to build trust.

Bringing the morning’s lessons together, the afternoon sessions opened with remarks by Marie Chatardová, President of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), Liu Zhenmin, Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, and UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed.

Delivering the keynote address, Mohammed called for the scaling of solutions so that partnerships reach “not millions, but billions of people.” Highlighting that migration and other global issues cut across borders, she reminded participants that means of implementation such as technology also transcend national systems, urging the audience to move beyond pilots. Mohammed underscored that aligning financial systems, without “letting official development assistance (ODA) off the hook,” to inclusively grow economies is critical, and that “it’s not about handouts, but about handshakes.” She also emphasized the importance of working with stakeholders to ensure that civil society is on the same page as governments, quoting Mother Teresa to articulate each partner’s value-add: “you can do what I cannot do, and I can do what you cannot do, but together, we can do great things.”

Moderating the afternoon panel on building the enabling system to maximize partnerships, Kaveh Zahedi, UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), opened by recalling an element of partnerships identified by the morning panels: risk taking. New paradigms are needed, he and others noted, where nonprofits and the UN system take more risks, and private sector actors move beyond philanthropy to align their business models with the SDGs. Building a clear vision and an enabling system that moves beyond the current development paradigm, panelists stated, requires a bottom-up approach that identifies priority areas jointly with businesses, sets out a vision that is measured through established key performance indicators (KPIs), and incorporates established principles, such as those of the Busan Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation, to deliver on the SDGs. Through these measures, Zahedi noted in his recap of the discussion, society can benefit from partnerships for impacts, rather than simply for the sake of partnership.

The event’s Partnership Showcase featured presentations of 15 multi-stakeholder initiatives that contribute to the SDGs under review at this year’s HLPF. Among others presented, partnerships include efforts to reduce electronic waste, enhance learning networks on the water-energy nexus, enable developing countries to benefit from e-commerce, improve water security for the community surrounding an apparel manufacturing facility, and develop a certification scheme for biodiversity.

Closing remarks by Lise Kingo, UN Global Compact, recognized the momentum created by partnerships, but reemphasized the need to do more, scale up, and measure partnerships’ and companies’ impacts.

169,https://www.greenbiz.com/article/4-techniques-catalyze-sustainable-small-town-redevelopment,"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",GreenBiz,4 techniques to catalyze sustainable small town redevelopment,"Today, many cities fully embrace redevelopment as a strategy to revitalize whole districts, as we are witnessing in old manufacturing centers such as Detroit, Cleveland and Pittsburgh. Even smaller cities such as Lawrence, Massachusetts, and Eau Claire, Wisconsin, are getting in on the action. Instead of greenfields, brownfields and their classic, historic architecture, their raw industrial grit, are back in vogue. Redevelopment, renewal and adaptive reuse are no longer buzzwords, but well-established strategies with an impressive track record.

Our firm tends to go into places that have not seen the same degree of rebirth and renewal — places where people want to see their towns spring back to life, but cannot quite find the economic momentum to make it happen. Not all of these communities are in the country. A lot of them are in isolated corners of big cities, such as old manufacturing neighborhoods with few residents and low population density. These places have a lot of brownfields and abandoned properties with immense potential, but little in the way of a business model that can overcome the risks of economic stagnation. What is a developer to do? Are these special, historic properties doomed to disuse and eventual dilapidation?

The key word in the above paragraph is risk, although it is one discussed less frequently in economic development circles where the field tends to focus on gains, growth and potential. Just because one redevelops a brownfield does not mean that customers (or tenants) will flock to it if the community is far from customers, if it exhibits signs of social and economic decay or if it lacks sufficient amenities that many modern workers and entrepreneurs expect from their community. Any successful strategy will not only have to meet the market, but address complex risk factors that include social, political and environmental risk. The social and institutional side are discussed less often, so let us turn to those first.

A social and institutional process

Driving into a town with a boarded-up Main Street or a row of abandoned factories make it look like the community has been the victim of a destructive economic process. In truth, the devastation that is apparent on the surface is really a symptom of deeper social and institutional problems that have been going on for a very long time. Most of these communities fell victim to a severe boom/bust cycle that began with the discovery of a key resource, such as water, coal or minerals. This discovery led to the co-location of firms in one place, which then attracted both skilled and unskilled workers from other communities in search of new opportunities. However, this ""growth mentality"" often persists even after the core industry has matured or even begun to decline. Usually, the effects of decline really become apparent when the economy is under-diversified: There are no other industries to absorb the surplus labor from the primary industry.

In truth, the devastation that is apparent on the surface is really a symptom of deeper social and institutional problems that have been going on for a very long time.

What follows is a cycle through which big expectations about opportunity (the expectation that you can work in the mill for 25 years and retire with a pension) have led to disappointment, population loss or a shift to lower paying work, often in the service sector. Along with that comes a loss of local identity, followed by the erosion of important social institutions that used to bring people together and form strong bonds among neighbors.

Community sociologists call this condition disaffection, or a feeling of disconnectedness and isolation across the whole community. It is important to remember that, when undertaking a development project in one of these communities, people (and institutions) may seem isolated from one another. Everyone may know everyone in a small town, but this does not mean that they get along, or talk productively and strategically about the future of their community.

Taking action and local public activity may be relics of the past, and crime and deviant behavior may be high. This situation is especially common in small, isolated, former manufacturing communities more than agricultural communities, and it is very risky to redevelopment projects.

I have three pieces of advice for making your rural or small town project a success:

Be more than a developer of places. You will have to be a developer of communities. Instead of revitalizing only buildings, you must also revitalize relationships. With no economic momentum in the community, if you want to sail, you will have to bring your own wind.

Below are four strategies to make redevelopment projects:

More economically viable, while internalizing external risk, diversifying offerings and amenities, all while getting community members involved to ensure that the project is culturally appropriate.

These techniques are not new. In fact, they have more in common with life in the early United States than they do with life in modern times. Back then, techniques revolved around relationships and doing for one another in very strategic ways. Blending them with modern approaches and modern situations makes them feel quite innovative, and we would like to see more of them in common use by developers across the globe.

1. Partnerships and area-wide approaches

In any community, there is always somebody doing something to make the community better. Often times, these activities happen in isolation from one another and are fragmented across the community. You, as a developer, can be a catalyzing force in bringing people together behind your project. Rather than advancing your own vision, find out what others in the community want to see.

Oftentimes, local organizations already have figured out where there are major barriers to development, or major advantages, you have not considered. They can help to co-create the project to be more culturally appropriate. This community spirit can be written right into the by-laws of your project’s business entity, ensuring strong connections with local organizations and possibly local oversight. And, if the community has buy-in, they are more likely to accept the project as one of their own and are less likely to fight you at city hall. After all, you are working with, not against, the community.

Sometimes, brownfield and abandoned properties are very small, spread widely across the community, and the cost of remediating each one individually is cost prohibitive. Cities such as Indianapolis have had success in treating multiple, government-owned properties across the city like one giant property, drastically reducing the cost of EPA assessment and remediation. Instead of thinking property-by-property, zoom out to see the bigger picture across the community. Perhaps other property owners will want to get involved.

2. New economy techniques

""New Economy"" techniques are not new, but they feel that way. These economic strategies come from thinkers who were inspired by alternative economist E.F. Schumacher, and especially his book ""Small is Beautiful."" This book asked what an economy would look like if it prioritized boosting community wealth, rebuilding community life, upholding social justice and harmonizing with the environment over the pursuit of pure profit.

What would an economy look like if it prioritized boosting community wealth, rebuilding community life, upholding social justice and harmonizing with environment over pursuit of profit?

Schumacher’s (and friends) conclusion was to think small: Smaller economic activity; and alternative business forms that cycle profits back to the community. Instead of launching a typical for-profit development venture, the following business forms can enhance community involvement and defray risk:

Cooperatives

Many owners, less risk. Cooperatives have been used since the 1800s as a way to maximize the purchasing and production power of small farmers and manufacturers. Cooperatives work just as well for housing, where the risk of owning and maintaining a home is spread across all homeowners in the cooperative. Co-op businesses draw their membership directly from the community, providing a loyal customer base.

Community land trusts

Community land trusts buy the land under properties in order to sell the buildings (and improvements) on top. Land trusts ensure that land values remain affordable in perpetuity, and can be used to ensure that historically important properties are reused by the community instead of being knocked down.

Commons

Sometimes, the best use for a property is empty space, done tastefully. Commons areas give the community room to breathe and a space for interaction, festivals, markets and public activities. They can beautify the community and raise property values in the surrounding area.

Community-supported agriculture/industry

CSAs and CSIs provide agricultural and other products directly to local community members, ensuring a continuous customer base that keeps profits in the community.

3. Hybridizing strategies

Any of the above strategies provide viable alternatives to traditional redevelopment. But alternative strategies really gain their power when they are blended effectively. Hybrid strategies diversify projects much like a stock portfolio, ensuring that each project has more than one single use at any time. This is especially useful in places that lack zoning, or have flexible zoning regulations. When projects have a single use, such as redeveloping a warehouse to become affordable housing or a maker space, there is a real possibility that the project could fail, taking all investment with it. This is especially destructive in a small town. However, by launching affordable housing jointly with a food hub and a food entrepreneurship incubator, the risk of failure of one project is more likely to be buffered by the other two. In the event of a failure, project coordinators can quickly ""pivot,"" replacing the failing activity with another activity that may not have been as apparent prior to the launch of the project. Hybridization not only puts eggs into more than one basket but produces the ""wiggle room"" necessary to tweak the overall business model.

4. Self-sustenance

Put simply, grants are going out of style. Good redevelopment projects in rural areas and small towns should not rely on external grant funding that is not directly controlled by the community, as this brings external risk to the table. Good projects should have a viable business model from the first day of planning that can support the project in perpetuity. Building on what we know about hybridization, not all hybrid projects have the same profit potential.

Good projects should have a viable business model from the first day of planning that can support the project in perpetuity.

Conclusion

A community may really want a food hub, and may need affordable housing. Some clever market research will show that a related idea, a commercial kitchen and food business incubator, actually has a much higher profit potential than the other two ideas. If your project must be launched in segments, always begin with the highest profit potential activity first. This can then support the other activities as they all grow at different rates. Thus, the commercial kitchen can kick-start the launch of the food hub, opening access to local food, which enhances the commercial kitchen incubator. This power duo then can be used to launch affordable housing (a low-profit venture), which can house more potential food entrepreneurs, and so on.

Just because a community is rural, remote, small or isolated does not mean that property redevelopment and community revitalization are not possible. It just means that a different set of techniques need to be blended together to address the social and institutional risks associated with such projects. We look forward to hearing how you are applying (or plan to apply) these techniques in your own communities. Like redevelopment itself, we hope these and other innovative techniques will become more commonplace in economic development circles. Often times, the key to reconstituting community life is not building back to the original density. It’s building more diverse projects at a smaller scale.","This situation is especially common in small, isolated, former manufacturing communities more than agricultural communities, and it is very risky to redevelopment projects.
I have three pieces of advice for making your rural or small town project a success:Be more than a developer of places.

Organized by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and hosted at the Permanent Mission of Switzerland to the UN, the event discussed how companies have advocated for and achieved results on reducing impacts on consumption and production patterns.

In his opening remarks, Dominique Kohli, Switzerland’s Federal Office for Agriculture, expressed concern that linkages between stakeholders are opaque. He noted that although there needs to be a shift away from business-as-usual, the challenge of sustainable consumption and production (SCP) is too complex to be addressed by any one entity, and actors that do not traditionally work together need to coalesce around SDG 12 within a “robust enabling environment.” Kohli highlighted the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production (10YFP) as a key platform for engagement that can help foster such collaborations.

Filippo Veglio, WBCSD, described the SDGs as a “North star,” providing common, universal “languages” for businesses and other stakeholders alike. He noted the role of SDG 12 as a balancing of social progress and environmental challenges, quoting an Innove report titled, ‘Business and the Sustainable Development Goals: A guide for getting started,’ which visualizes the SDGs as a network with Goal 12 at the center. James Gomme, WBCSD, said businesses can play a role in circular supplies, resource recovery, product life extension, sharing platforms, and providing products as a service. He added that WBCSD has identified eight business cases for the circular economy, relating to: accelerating growth, enhancing competitiveness and mitigating risk.

Radical shifts away from current practices are needed to meet the global temperature goals under the Paris Agreement.

On the production side, Jeff Turner, Royal DSM, and member of WBCSD’s Factor 10 project, underscored that “the chemical industry is in everything we touch.” For example, today’s mobile phones not only contain more than half the elements listed on the periodic table, but those materials primarily wind up as e-waste due to the difficulty of recovering them. Turner emphasized the need to “design from a materials perspective” and to ensure circularity at products’ end of life. He noted DSM’s Greener Grazers product, which reduces the amount of methane associated with meat production by 30-50% and offers a positive application of blockchain technology for supply chain traceability.

In terms of consumption, Gomme flagged that many people aspire to “the Good Life 1.0,” correlating to the American Dream of the 1950s in which everything is bigger, faster and stronger. Instead, he suggested using a “lighthouse vision” that articulates what people want and need to be sustainable, then working backwards to identify what companies can do to help achieve that vision.

Nollaig Forrest, Firmenich SA, similarly highlighted the importance of reframing and speaking to consumer preferences: moving from bigger to better consumption; from “living large” to being connected; and from driving solo to sharing journeys. She described her fragrance company’s transparency initiatives and its “ecoscent compass,” which serves as a tool for customers to “measure the footprint of your fragrance.” Forrest also noted that her company must perform in a low-impact environment, for example, by providing products to mask the scent of new or altered cleaning agents while also working with minimal, cold or reused water.

On engaging people in lifestyle shifts, Jessie MacNeil-Brown, The Body Shop International, outlined how the company has been mobilizing store teams and customers for a cruelty-free campaign. She noted that cruelty-free products are a selling point with millennials and conscious consumers.

Lewis Akenji, Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES), said the overall question to consider is whether society is reducing the amount of material consumed, and he called for radical shifts away from current practices. Estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), he noted, require greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions down to a global average of one tonne emitted annually per capita by 2050, in order to meet the global temperature goals under the Paris Agreement on climate change. For some countries, this means reductions of up to 80-90%, he said. In achieving this transformation, Akenji flagged the importance of enabling “do-gooder” businesses to compete on the broader market, rather than working in niche areas or “at the periphery of the problem.” Governments, he said, need to play a facilitating role to create conditions for rapid change, where “first movers are not losers” and green businesses do not relinquish competitive edge to those who “greenwash.”

Akenji also presented an analysis of “power flows” in supply chains, rather than those of materials or goods. The results, or “power hotspots,” he noted, point to brand owners and retailers as having the strongest influence. He closed by outlining the determinants of sustainable lifestyles, underscoring the issue of “consumer scapegoatism” and stressing that changes need to come from the most powerful stakeholder (businesses) rather than the most visible (consumers).

Ireland is continuing to fall behind on its environmental commitments under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a new global analysis has found.

The Sustainable Development Goals Index and Dashboards Report compare different nations’ performance on the 17 goals at the centre of the UN’s sustainable development agenda.

The SDGs, or global goals, seek to achieve over 150 targets aimed at ending poverty, protecting the planet, and ensuring prosperity for all people by 2030.

The report is the first worldwide study to assess where each country stands with regard to achieving the goals.

This year’s report shows that Ireland has made progress on some of the social goals but continue to perform poorly when it comes to action in meeting its waste, climate action and ocean protection goals.

It shows that further efforts are needed to protect biodiversity and support sustainable production and consumption.

The measure takes into account factors such as our emissions within Ireland, emissions embodied in the goods we consume, climate change vulnerability, and exported emissions from fossil fuel shipments. The report shows that Ireland continues to make no progress in these areas.

With a global index score of 77.5, Ireland is well behind Sweden (85), Denmark (84.6) and Finland (83) who made up the top three countries on the list.

The Sustainable Progress Index for 2018 launched by Social Justice Ireland earlier this year was also critical of Ireland’s progress on its environmental commitments.

The report states that Ireland performs particularly poorly in terms of waste and emissions reduction and that the State has been playing catch up on the environmental front since it joined the EU.

“What is clear is that when compared to our EU peers, Ireland is either only keeping up or is falling behind on the environment SDGs,” the report states.

Latest in long line of failures

Speaking today, Green Party Leader Eamon Ryan said that the report is the latest in a number of “damning reports” on Ireland’s record on climate and environmental issues.

An analysis by Climate Action Network Europe released last month ranked Ireland in second last place for action and ambition on climate change in the EU.

Last year, the Climate Change Performance Index found that Ireland was the worst performing country in Europe for action on climate change. The Index placed Ireland 49th out of the 56 countries examined.

“Fine Gael has utterly failed in this area and continue to stick to their old development model,” Mr Ryan added.

Mr Ryan also criticised the Government for passing the Heritage Bill, which he called “damaging” and a threat to Irish wildlife.

The Heritage Bill, which passed through the Dáil last week, outlines plans to allow for the burning of heather and gorse in March and hedge cutting in August under a so-called pilot project.

High-level Political Forum

World leaders, Ministers and hundreds of civil society groups from around the world will be at the UN headquarters in New York this week for a High-level Political Forum on the Sustainable Development Goals.

The Irish government will be reporting back at the ten-day forum on the key goals under review for 2018, including those on clean water and energy, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production and protecting life on land.

Denis Naughten, Minister for Climate Action and Environment will be in New York on Tuesday 17th July to present Ireland’s first Voluntary National Review detailing the steps the Government have taken in the implementation of the Agenda 2030.

A delegation from Coalition 2030, a grouping of over 100 Irish civil society organisations, is also attending the event and will launch its own shadow report next week.

In the video, UNDP Goodwill Ambassador and film-star Michelle Yeoh discusses the environmental impacts of the fashion industry and shows how fibers made from wood could reduce them.

Most textiles are either made of cotton or synthetic fibers. Cotton production and processing requires large amounts of pesticides, insecticides, water and energy, whereas most synthetic fibers are made from crude oil and washing them produces microscopic plastic particles that affect water bodies, ocean ecosystems, and ultimately human health.

The fashion industry thus needs new, environmentally-friendly choices to produce large quantities of textiles to meet growing demand for clothing, while contributing its share to achieving the SDGs. One solution could be fibers made from wood. The Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), in collaboration with the Institute for Italian Design, has been exploring this option supported by FAO and UNECE.

Wood-based fibers for fashion are “a choice we all need to be aware of for a better life on our planet.”

In June 2017, the partners released the report ‘Forest for Fashion – Fashion for Forests,’ showcasing the work of designers, researchers, organizations and UN institutions towards developing wood-based alternative fibers sourced from sustainably managed forests. As a follow up to this work, FAO and UNECE organized an exhibition titled ‘Forest, Fashion and the SDGs’ displayed during HLPF, and produced a video to raise awareness of this sustainable alternative for fashion. The initiative was also highlighted during an HLPF side event on the UN Partnership on Sustainable Fashion and SDGs.

In the video, Michelle Yeoh meets with experts from UECE, FAO and Cittadellarte Fashion B.E.S.T., an Italian art foundation that promotes sustainable fashion design through art and education, to discuss how the latest research, technology and innovation combine into a “promising opportunity” for wood-based fibers. The film explains that wood-based fiber production from sustainably managed forests creates less environmental impacts than conventional cotton or synthetic fibers. Furthermore, wood-based fibers are biodegradable and can be recycled. Yeoh concludes that these advantages make wood-based fibers “a choice that we all need to be aware of, here and now, for a better life on our planet.” [UNECE/FAO Press Release] [Video: Made in Forests] [Publication: Forests for Fashion – Fashion for Forests] [Pictures of the FAO/UNECE Exhibition on Forests, Fashion and the SDGs] [PEFC Website on the potential of forests for fashion]","Most textiles are either made of cotton or synthetic fibers.

Living in a time of such environmental and climate uncertainty, new approaches are constantly being envisioned to try and lessen our impact.

One such approach is the global Transition Network movement, which started in our very own county of Cork.

The Transition Network brings communities together to reimagine and rebuild the world by “reclaiming the economy” sparking entrepreneurship, reskilling people and creating a network among them.

Made up of Transition Towns, the network works to transition communities away from the overuse of oil and gas resources and to help them adapt to deal with environmental issues and energy scarcity likely to arise in the coming decades.

Rob Hopkins, who helped create the network, told The Green News that “there is no silver bullet” when it comes to our earth’s environment and climate. “In reality, it’s a jigsaw puzzle”.

Hopkins felt that taking local action would be a key part of solving this puzzle, and the idea for the movement hit him while he was teaching permaculture at Kinsale Further Education College in 2005.

One of Hopkins’ students under a year-long project to set a roadmap for a sustainable future in Kinsale, Louise Rooney, set about developing the Transition Towns concept. This resulted in the “historic decision” by Kinsale Town Council to adopt the plan, says Hopkins.

Shortly afterwards, he relocated back to his hometown of Totnes, England and founded the Transition Network which has now spread to all corners of the earth, including towns in Australia, Germany, Chile, Japan, the United States, South Africa, and India.

This wide reach is down to the broad, inclusive approach of the project, Hopkins says, as Transition Towns do not have a membership fee and are not “overly prescriptive”. The only commitment, he says, is that “you share your stories”.

Transition Town Kinsale

Now in over 50 countries and thousands of groups, Ken Forde of Transition Town Kinsale proudly told The Green News that Kinsale was the “first of what is now a global movement”.

Kinsale has been doing exceptional work since the “seeds were planted” in 2006, Forde says, with projects ongoing in five pillar areas – energy, food, transport, health, and education.

“We are currently setting up a Community Energy Project which will involve business and domestic but also community buildings like halls and churches,” Forde says.

The project has also developed and participated in Earth Hour, set up an anaerobic digester project, a community orchard and a community supported agriculture scheme.

The anaerobic digester will recycle local farm and food waste into compressed gas fuel for local vehicles and will help keep €700,000 in the local economy, reduce landfill waste, and create natural fertilizer for farmers.

Success for these projects comes from the ability of the community to come together and creating power in numbers with Forde pointing to the role played by the Public Participation Network (PPN) in Cork County Council.

Through the PPN, Forde says, Transition Town Kinsale hopes to get its message across to the council and councillors but also to “a wider employee network along with the general public”.

Other Transition Towns

Transition Pasadena in California is building resilience and a stronger community through circular leadership, permaculture and “a whole lotta fun”, according to Therese Brummel.

She says that the town is working on a project called Pasadena 100 to “help our city get 100 per cent Renewable Energy” by 2035. They also have a Repair Café inspired by the “philosophy of a sharing economy”, Brummel says, a common trend in Transition Towns.

Ungersheim in Eastern France has also made great strides too since becoming a Transition Town, bringing in a horse to perform as a bus to take local children to school. The town has switched all public lighting to low energy bulbs, leading to a 40 per cent decrease in energy usage among its 2,000 strong population.

A new geography of power is emerging, made up of global city networks. All in all, the attractiveness of cities is based on the hope of higher purchasing power through greater opportunities, for a better quality of life. Megacities have the potential to effectively fight against poverty and enhance living conditions for a large proportion of the population – if they are managed correctly and make the most of their advantages. Nonetheless, there is a drastic need for new urban models to tackle the associated social, economic, and environmental pressures in a sustainable way.

Cities are the new engines of growth in the global economy, responsible for 80% of global GDP. It is no longer just countries that compete, but cities as well. Like there is great power competition, so will the world’s great cities increasingly compete. Every city will have to gain a competitive edge to differentiate itself from the rest. Flexible and agile cities that can diversify their resources and offer economic, social, and cultural opportunities to their citizens will not only survive but thrive. The cities that are best equipped to produce innovative, inclusive, and ethical solutions in the face of multiplying risks and threats will emerge as leaders. A clear picture emerges: cities will compete and collaborate globally as interdependent entities and will drive the future.

Speaking about megacities, let’s look for example at Mumbai, which is the financial capital of India and the second-most populated city in the world. It is not only the subcontinent’s city with the highest GDP but also ranks among the world’s top ten trade centers. The city contributes 25% of industrial output and 70% of capital transactions to India’s economy. Important financial organizations such as the Reserve Bank of India and the National Stock Exchange of India are in Mumbai. It houses the headquarters of various multinational companies and has thus become an influential commercial and entertainment center of India. It would be foolish to ignore such cities in tomorrow’s global economy.

City diplomacy could be considered a form of decentralization of international relations management, choosing cities as the key actors. In many cases, the representatives of cities involved in city diplomacy will be the mayors, given that they are often responsible for the international relations of their communities. On behalf of their cities, these key actors can engage in relations with other actors on the international stage through two-sided or multiple-sided interactions. There is a lot of room for city diplomacy to grow. It can be driven by image or investment interests, development and strategic communications complete each other.

A city relationship is formally created when the mayors or highest elected or designated leaders from two communities sign a memorandum of understanding establishing the partnership. Nevertheless, this is usually the result of a long process that involves the local city organizations along with the municipalities and other local institutions. It takes a lot of work to get to this stage, so, as in many other cases, sustained effort and clear vision pay off. So, time to shape up the in house mayoral or county staff and consolidate a stellar local talent team of global reach.

Competition matters but so does cooperation. Collaborating with neighboring or nearby cities enables cities to plan and implement actions to address emissions from energy infrastructure, public transport, food systems, waste management, and other services that often operate across municipal borders and to address cross-border climate risks. It also helps cities overcome regional or national climate-policy barriers, share the cost of staff and equipment, and secure better access to data, funding, and technical assistance – all of which can motivate other cities in the area to participate as well.

Image and Investment demand a third I in the 2020s: Innovation. The fastest way to connect cities and counties is using technology. The technological progress of recent decades has had not only a powerful but also a transformative influence on urban life. As technology progresses and becomes more affordable, the functionality and sustainability of urban practices undergo significant advancements as well. At the same time, increased access to information consolidates the role of knowledge as a powerful engine of economic growth. This enables the development of knowledge-based and connected societies. Under these continuously evolving conditions, many concepts about the organization and management of the new technological capabilities have become popular, including the smart city.

To establish an approach for the ideal future of an urban settlement that harnesses technology should be part of the integrated processes that connect cities at a regional level. In the best-case scenario, a city that aspires to become „smart‟ has an integrated, forward-looking plan that includes a vision and a methodology focused on benefiting from digital technologies to improve urban functions and develop knowledge ecosystems. Like any strategy, the plans for smart cities must be adapted to the needs, priorities, and constraints of their circumstances.

Funding for smart city projects is still carved out of overall city or department budgets, either through existing spending (e.g., IT, lighting contracts) or designated ‘smart city’ spending, which is typically relatively small. It is therefore difficult to identify the exact amount local authorities allocate to such projects. Even though a lot of the investment for smart city projects comes from the general city budget, cities have found it most beneficial to have earmarked funds for innovation initiatives. At the moment, what is clear is that the funding and budgeting has to match the ambitions of big cities and transform the smart city objective into reality.

National governments are also encouraging cities to increase funding by boosting the participation of the private sector in delivering smart city projects. Businesses’ experience with participating in the delivery of smart city projects has been dominated by pilot projects often utilizing public sector grant funding. There is room for much more. Local authorities need to make more strides towards scaling pilot projects and procuring large-scale solutions. The city must be able to articulate clearly the challenges it faces and develop a more open way for the market to respond. The sky is the limit, if the game is played well. An innovative image and investment diplomacy operation is an important way forward.","A new geography of power is emerging, made up of global city networks.

Villas used 31 per cent less water per capita than the average Dubai villa.

Thanks to developing its Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory, the city, located on Al Qudra Road, can measure the community’s carbon emissions and its impact on the ecosystem, said officials in a statement on Tuesday.

“During 2017, 363 villas and 200 apartments were occupied, and the city had a resident population of approximately 1,900. The inventory results show that the GHG intensity of the villas at The Sustainable City is almost 50 per cent less than that of a conventional villa in the UAE,” said an official.

Major eco efficiencies were achieved at The Sustainable City through better design, rooftop solar, solar-charged electric buggies, organic waste composting and other low carbon initiatives.

“The per capita grid electricity and water consumption is 42 per cent and 30 per cent less than the Dubai average, respectively.”

The report was prepared in accordance with The Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories. The emission results were verified by Dubai Carbon, a private joint-stock company established to cater to building a low-carbon and green economy.

Faris Saeed, CEO of Diamond Developers — the company behind The Sustainable City — said in a statement: “The results of our GHG inventory confirm that The Sustainable City is continually working to fight climate change and proactively reducing our carbon emissions in alignment with the Paris agreement and the sustainable development goals. Moving forward, we will be taking steps to further reduce our emissions through the addition of 3.6mw of solar PVs, the use of biodiesel for construction activities, and various awareness campaigns for residents.”

Laila Mustafa Abdul Latif, director-general of EWS-WWF (Emirates Wildlife Society in association with World Wildlife Fund), said in a press release: “Climate change is a defining issue today, and cities and communities play a key role in addressing this global challenge. The Sustainable City is a prime example of how a mixed-use community can be developed and operated in line with sustainability principles and with consequently reduced emissions, even in the harsh climate of the Gulf.”

Sustainability Education, also known as Education for Sustainable Development (ESD), has been recognized as a critical tool for the transition to sustainable development particularly since the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in 1992, where Agenda 21, a framework for action, was agreed by 178 member states.

In 2002, 191 member states got together in Johannesburg in South Africa to assess the progress of the outcomes based on Agenda 21 at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD). They also reviewed Agenda 21 and renewed member states' commitments in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation. UN General Assembly also adopted a resolution announcing the Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (UNDESD, 2005-2014) with the initiative of the Japanese government, and the United Nations Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) was assigned as the lead agency for accelerating the efforts of member states toward ESD.

In 2003, in response to the UN resolution on the UNDESD, the United Nations University Institute for the Advanced Study of Sustainability (UNU-IAS) launched the ESD project, including a global multi-stakeholder network of the Regional Centers of Expertise on ESD (RCEs). An RCE is an existing formal, non-formal and informal organization that facilitates learning towards sustainable development in local and regional communities. As of December 2017, 154 RCEs have officially been acknowledged by the United Nations University worldwide, and there have been various collaborative projects implemented by them.

After the UNDESD ended in 2014, member states have agreed to advance commitments toward ESD through the Roadmap for Implementing the Global Action Programme (GAP) on ESD with five priority areas of action: advancing policy by mainstreaming ESD, transforming learning and training environments using the whole-institution approach, building capacities of educators and trainers, empowering and mobilizing youth, and finally accelerating sustainable solutions at the local level. At all levels of society, RCEs play a crucial role in implementing these goals using their local knowledge and global network. Many RCE members are assigned as the Partner Network agencies by UNESCO to lead the world's efforts toward GAP.

ESD is also recognized as a key element of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is mentioned in the Sustainable Development Goal on education (SDG 4) under Target 4.7 and is considered a very important driver for the achievements of all other SDGs.

ESD aims to bring behavior changes to promote sustainability and it is critical to protect natural resources of the planet for future generations. There are cities and regions promoting sustainability throughout the United States, and there are various sustainability initiatives and projects implemented by the city government, NGOs, private sectors and individuals. An RCE can connect all these actors and accelerate collective impacts over the region, and also provides opportunities to impact the global policies such as GAP on ESD and SDGs through the UN platforms provided by the headquarter of RCEs, UNU. It can also connect the region with other 154 RCEs worldwideto work together and share experiences and challenges of projects on biodiversity, sustainable consumption and production, climate change, engaging youth, promoting higher education, etc. It is valuable to analyze the needs and benefits for establishing an RCE by scaling up local efforts to promote sustainability, increase awareness of ESD, and accelerate collaboration and collective impact.

The genesis of the RCE is a realization by the Institutions of Higher Education that, after implementing sustainability programs on their own campuses, the time is right to bring their knowledge and expertise outside their campus gates and partner at a broader regional scale for a multi-sector approach to education for sustainable development. It also engenders a culture of learning and continuous improvement, providing opportunities for students of all ages to contribute to these efforts and shape new ones.

George Bernard Shaw once said, “If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples, then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.” Sharing ideas and best practices and educating through the RCE gives everyone a chance to gain from the process. RCEs have the potential to tie together economic, environmental and social aspects that reflect the complexity of the pressing issues faced by a region. It also draws people together: The success of sustainability initiatives requires engagement, participation, and collaboration at all levels of the university, across campus and beyond. Working together is vital in any successful endeavor, and sharing ideas is especially important in education.

178,https://cleantechnica.com/2018/07/15/babcock-ranch-in-florida-is-to-sustainable-living-what-tesla-is-to-sustainable-transportation/,"Sun, 15 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",CleanTechnica,Babcock Ranch In Florida Is To Sustainable Living What Tesla Is To Sustainable Transportation,"Tucked into a corner of Southwest Florida about a half-hour from Fort Myers, Babcock Ranch is what developer Syd Kitson calls the most sustainable new community in America. It started when Kitson, a former NFL player, purchased the 91,000 acre ranch in 2006. He immediately struck a deal to sell 73,000 acres of the property to the state of Florida for a wildlife preserve. He then donated 440 acres to Florida Power & Light with the stipulation that it construct a solar power plant on the land. Today, that parcel is covered by 350,000 solar panels that feed electricity into the electrical grid.

Then Kitson went to work with local partners to design and build a new community on the remaining 17,000 acres. “We want to be the most sustainable new town in the United States,” Kitson tells CBS News. “We had the advantage of a green field, a blank sheet of paper. When you have a blank sheet of paper like this, you really can do it right from the beginning.”

The town gets most of its electricity from the nearby solar power plant during the day. Although the community has 10 small battery stations, Kitson says large-scale battery storage is still too expensive (Elon Musk would disagree), so at night or on cloudy days, the community draws power from the utility grid. “The people here pay the exact same amount that everybody else pays in the Florida Power and Light network,” he says. “Clearly, if you have a number of cloudy days in a row, it will impact the efficiency and the available electricity that comes from the solar field, but this is Florida, and if you don’t like the weather, just wait 10 minutes.” Last year, when Hurricane Irma swept across that part of the state, not one solar panel was damaged.

The first residents began moving in at the beginning of this year. 500 homes are expected to be completed by December. 19,500 dwelling units are planned over the next two decades. All of the structures in Babcock Ranch will feature the latest energy efficiency technology and offer 1 gigabit internet access. Alexa will handle all smart home functions. Outside, there are 50 miles of nature trails through the wildlife preserve next door. A farm-to-table organic gardening project is underway and a K-8 charter school is planned. Residents will be encouraged to leave their cars at home as they walk, bike, or take advantage of the electric autonomous shuttle bus fleet that will service the community.

“This community is a unique opportunity to really implement sustainable technology in a practical way,” Haris Alibašić, a professor at the University of West Florida, tells Good.com. “Cities around the world have started adopting 100% renewable energy targets, but it’s both intriguing and encouraging to see this happening from a developer.” He adds he would like to see more affordable housing included in the plans for the community. A three bedroom home in Babcock Ranch sells for $195,000 and a four bedroom town house lists for $795,000. “I think the ultimate key to long term sustainability is attracting people from diverse incomes and backgrounds,” he says.

Last January, Richard and Robin Kinley became the first family to move to Babcock Ranch. They chose a house near a lake, which has now been named Lake Kinley in their honor. “The air is nice and clean here and I think these types of communities are the future,” Robin says. “I felt very much like when I bought a Tesla back in 2013 and I said, this is definitely is going to make it,” Richard adds. “I felt the same way about Babcock Ranch.”

Their first neighbors were Donna and James Aveck, who moved in a few weeks later. “We love the innovation here,” Donna says. “We think it’s a very small planet and we want to do our part to conserve it.” Babcock Ranch has thought of every detail when it comes to sustainability. Jim says, “When I go to the gym, which is huge, and I get on the treadmill, the energy I generate by running actually feeds back into the electric grid.”

Communities that have already transitioned to 100% renewable energy include Aspen, Colorado; Burlington, Vermont; Greensburg, Kansas; Rockport, Missouri; and Kodiak Island, Alaska, according to the Sierra Club. But Babcock Ranch has designed sustainability into the entire fabric of the community from the beginning. Just as Tesla has driven change in the transportation industry, Babcock Ranch will encourage other cities and towns to make sustainability part of their community DNA.","He then donated 440 acres to Florida Power & Light with the stipulation that it construct a solar power plant on the land.

The COP-21 climate change talks had set a target of keeping the rise in global temperature to less than 2 degrees centigrade. And for that, all the nations will have to play a major role in reducing their carbon footprint.

Historically, the developed capitalist world has taken the largest carbon space by massive production and changing the lifestyles of its people. Presently, the per capita carbon emissions footprint of US -16.4 tonnes and Canada -13.5 tonnes outnumbers the developing countries like India 1.6- tonnes and China-7. 6 tonnes. Hence there is a common but differential responsibility of different countries, which is to be shared in the same manner.

The developed nations guided by their ruling class interests have developed an unsustainable model of development over a period of time. Take for example the two major players – the US and Canada; they have developed their roads and highways across the continent because the two major giants- the automobile capital and the oil capital wanted its consumption to be absorbed. A family of four in these two big countries will not have less than the same number of cars. But, this is not a sustainable model of development.

The developed world also has a greater responsibility to not only reduce its own carbon footprint but also to ensure transfer of green technologies to the developing world and render help to them to climb the ladder of development.

However, the stark announcement made by Trump to withdraw from the climate deal puts the entire process of joint interventions in a squander. Not only will it affect the strategic interventions by the largest polluter on earth (US), but will also affect other parts of the globe. Though, an opposition to his whimsical orders is also quite evident within the US itself. The governor of California and a former movie star, Arnold, was quite critical about his coal strategy. A mayor from a city in Colorado region described Trump as inconsistent with his words and does not know where he is going to lead the country. Nevertheless, he was optimistic that the people and the cities will be shaping their futures themselves.

The cities are growing so is the number of people living in them. By 2030 more than 60 percent of the people will live in the cities. These are considered to be the engines of growth, however the cities are also responsible for 75 percent of energy consumption and 65 percent of carbon emissions. Hence the cities have a greater role to play in order to control the emission of carbon gases. But can the cities discharge what they are supposed to do? Are the cities sovereign from their federal government to work in tangent to them? We know they are not and cannot decide their futures delinked from their federal and provincial counterparts. But that does not mean that the cities cannot build alternatives of people’s development which is also low on carbon emissions.

THE MONTREAL CONGRESS

More than 1000 delegates from the urban spectrum gathered in the city of Montreal for the world congress of cities to discuss their success and stories of failure in order to achieve the goals of sustainable development.

The Montreal commitment and strategic vision, adopted by the cities through its representatives, orients their path towards urban transformation and sets a course for delivering on the global sustainable development agenda. This has to happen with initiatives and partnerships and also projects worldwide for low carbon emissions.

This is supposedly with a new vision which aligns with the global frameworks. It is critical to have global consensus around sustainable development so that political will, systems and resources are oriented in the same direction quoted the vision document.

The UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) are a universal and collective vision, with SDG -11(make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable) as the central lever to attain all other goals. The Paris Climate Agreement is the prerequisite to safeguard all SDGs and pioneer the transformation towards a new model of a climate-safe human civilization. The new urban agenda is a compendium of good practices and policies for urban development, including the right-to-the-city, multilevel governance and urban planning.

Also Read: Increasing Carbon Emission and Sustainable Development

The roadmap for the delivery of these goals and aspirations was also discussed. The vision defines low emission, nature-based, circular, resilient and equitable development with five interconnected pathways towards sustainability, supported by policy approaches on governance, innovation and finance.

The action plan is for partnership with the local and regional governments across the spectrum to accelerate and leap frog sustainable, integrated urban and territorial development, as a means to support and complement national contributions and global sustainability goals.

The highlights have been to promote an action plan for 100 percent renewable energy. Develop urban low emission, climate resilient, mobility friendly development strategies and monitor their implementation. Lead the transition to a green economy through leading sustainable public procurement networks. Connect climate action to urban development and engage local and regional governments in making nationally determined contributions (NDCs) fit for the Paris Agreement. Support island communities at the front line of climate challenges and address land-based ocean pollution. Lead the implementation of global biodiversity targets at the city and regional level.

Hell is a city much like London --

A populous and a smoky city;

There are all sorts of people undone,

And there is little or no fun done;

Small justice shown, and still less pity.

This narrative of cities depicted by none less than PB Shelly the famous poet two centuries ago still holds good for a large number of cities in the world. The point however is to change this narrative.","The attention of global forces representing cities is keener to know how the planet earth will be shaped for the future.

Situated on the Al Qudra Road, it is the first net zero energy development in Dubai. (Image source: The Sustainable City)

The initiative is part of The Sustainable City’s strategic collaboration with Emirates Wildlife Society in association with WWF (EWS-WWF).

The Sustainable City’s total emissions for the year 2017 are 8,761 tCO₂e with electricity accounting for 50 per cent, waste for 38 per cent, and water for 11 per cent*.

The GHG inventory covers the emissions from the fully operational Phase 1, as well as electricity and fuel-related emissions from the under-construction Phase 2 of The Sustainable City.

During the year 2017, 363 villas and 200 apartments were occupied, and the city had a resident population of approximately 1,900. The inventory results show that the GHG intensity of the villas at The Sustainable City is almost 50 per cent less than that of a conventional villa in the UAE. The Sustainable City was successful in achieving a lower footprint through efficient design, rooftop solar, solar-charged electric buggies, organic waste composting and other low carbon initiatives. The per capita grid electricity and water consumption is 42 per cent and 30 per cent less than the Dubai average respectively.

The report was prepared in accordance with The Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories. The emissions results were verified by Dubai Carbon, a private joint-stock company established to cater to building a low-carbon and green economy.

Faris Saeed, CEO of Diamond Developers, the company behind The Sustainable City, said, “The results of our GHG inventory confirm that The Sustainable City is continually working to fight climate change and proactively reducing our carbon emissions in alignment with the Paris agreement and the sustainable development goals. Moving forward, we will be taking steps to further reduce our emissions through the addition of 3.6 MW of solar PVs, the use of biodiesel for construction activities, and various awareness campaigns for residents.”

Laila Mostafa Abdullatif, director general of EWS-WWF, added, “Climate change is a defining issue today, and cities and communities play a key role in addressing this global challenge. The Sustainable City is a prime example of how a mixed-use community can be developed and operated in line with sustainability principles and with consequently reduced emissions, even in the harsh climate of the Gulf. The partnership between The Sustainable City and EWS-WWF not only includes measuring and reporting the City’s GHG emissions but extends to examining best practices for mitigating carbon emissions from residential and non-residential activities.”

The Sustainable City and EWS-WWF are working together to address climate change, promote renewable energy, reduce GHG emissions and measure how the city performs against key performance indicators. The Sustainable City consistently demonstrates how a low-carbon business model can be transformational for real estate sector in the UAE, reducing the environmental impact of residential developments while also contributing to economic growth.

Professor Rose Emma Mamaa Entsua-Mensah, a Fellow of the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences (GAAS), has urged the government to pursue the implementation of key policies to promote Green Technologies for sustainable urban ecological management.

Such technologies, she said involved the recycling of all forms of waste, water purification, energy and ecosystems conservation, as well as Green construction, for materials use, design, energy saving concepts in residential and commercial infrastructure and buildings.

Prof. Entsua-Mensah who is also the Deputy Director-General of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), made the call on Thursday, when she delivered a paper on the topic: 'Sustainable Urban Ecological Management in Accra, Ghana: a Mirage or Reality?', at the ongoing International Conference on Sustainable African Cities in Accra.

The three-day conference focusses on issues pertaining to the achievement of sustainable African cities, debating current challenges and exploring future pathways to ensure sustainable, spatially integrated, balanced and orderly development of human settlements, and providing adequate, cleaner, safe, secure, quality and affordable social and private housing solutions.

She commended government for its commitment to pursue key objectives under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), saying, achieving sustainable cities and communities would however, require huge investment for both policy reforms, infrastructure development and to address the negative attitudinal challenges of the population towards the management of their environment.

The multidimensional nature of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) particularly, the 11th, and its relatedness to the other goals, she said, clearly showed its centrality to the Agenda 2030 and its relevance to the socio-economic development, especially in Africa and for that matter in Ghana.

Hence, sustainable urban ecological management becomes a key towards the provision of a strong foundation to sustain Ghana's development agenda.

Prof. Entsua-Mensah explained that the density and population of today's cities necessitates the equitable distribution of resources for their various activities, and it was necessary to understand the effects of an urban area, not only within its immediate boundaries, but also on the region and country it was positioned, due to the large amount of resources necessary to sustain it.

She catalogued a list of challenges that confronted Ghana's cities particularly Accra, citing unmet need such as basic utilities including potable water, electricity, proper waste management and roads as a result of the rapid urbanisation.

These, she said were accompanied by widespread poverty and disaster risks such as perennial flooding resulting partly to poor land use, improper planning and building on water ways.

She said current challenges confronting African cities and communities were however, surmountable if only the appropriate policies would be developed, and their implementation strictly monitored.

Prof Entsua-Mensah said the government had indicated that storm drains would be built and solid waste well managed, while the Zongo's would also be upgraded as part of the inner city programme.

She said maybe when these happens, then, sustainable urban development would no longer be a myth but a reality.

Prof. Alfred A. Oteng-Yeboah, also a Fellow of the GAAS, and a Lecturer at the University of Ghana, further interrogating the ecosystem health of the Accra Metropolis for human well-being, asked for the strict adherence to global standards in achieving sustainable cities and communities.

He said the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, which Ghana was a Party to, saw rapid urbanization as taking place all over the world, and driven largely by rural migration resulting in urban sprawl and slum developments, as well as in the development of high quality infrastructure and overall improvement in the standard of living.

If current projections were accurate, 66 per cent of the world's population would be living in cities by 2050, a situation, which was bound to have dramatic impacts on the environment and increasing pressure on limited land resources, thus future urban expansion was likely to result in the loss of some of the more productive croplands, he said.

Prof Oteng-Yeboah however, noted that although Accra was a sprawling city per the global changes, systems and structures to achieve uniformity were being poorly implemented, and that the environmental, social and economic challenges mentioned above, needed to be tackled seriously.

Accra, he noted, would be ready when opportunities existed for cross fertilization of knowledge to optimise the use of technology and supporting coherence for the 2030 global Agenda and that of the 2063 Africa 'We Want'.

He said with the proliferation of open access to information available in Accra and across the country, the city could benefit from the broad knowledge available on human wellbeing in the midst of the current global challenges being worsened by climate change influence on sustainable development.

Prof Oteng-Yeboah therefore recommended a strong stakeholder participation and commitment, calling for their apt engagement for proper understanding of the concept of a sustainable City or Eco-city, in order to effect a change in attitudes and behaviour, and to guarantee their peaceful co-existence.

He further called on the city leadership to develop and enforce policies that were environmentally friendly, following strictly on the Local Government Act on Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies, and implementing the local Bye Laws taking into consideration the guidance provided in the various global processes.","Listen to articleProfessor Rose Emma Mamaa Entsua-Mensah, a Fellow of the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences (GAAS), has urged the government to pursue the implementation of key policies to promote Green Technologies for sustainable urban ecological management.

Dependency on energy has been pivotal for the existence of human civilization, from Stone Age to today’s Contemporary Age. In context of India, we are the seventh largest energy consumer (in the world) and out of which energy usage in building blocks accounts for 33 per cent of the nation’s energy use. And what is rather alarming is that it is growing at a rate of 8 per cent annually. In the last two decades or so there has been an overwhelming migration of people from rural lands to urban spaces in search of better opportunities, education and standard of living. This has triggered a real estate boom in urban parts of the country leading to numerous residential and commercial projects; ultimately increasing the overall usage of energy several folds.

Going by constant rise in consumption of energy, a balance has to be struck between the immediate need to fulfil the growing usage of energy while keeping in mind the repercussions it might have on the environment. Thus, emerged the concepts of Green buildings/Sustainable buildings which are by far the most effective solutions to address the current situation and which have been duly promoted by the various Government bodies.

So what exactly constitutes a sustainable building?

Sustainability principles have been carefully adhered to, right from site selection and design to engineering, construction, materials and operations. This includes but is not restricted to the usage of native flora, minimizing both environmental impact and reducing the need for landscaping water, low-energy/green materials, appropriate orientation of building facades that ensure adequate day lighting and minimizes glare etc.

Planning & Design

The planning and designing phase of sustainable architecture involves utilization of evolving techniques and innovative methods which will ultimately curtail the adverse effects of pollution. In India, sustainable buildings are often based and constructed on the precedents set by developed countries like the usage of natural and non-toxic materials, choosing recycled material (lumber, clay plaster, straw bales, and mortar), structural insulating wall panels etc.

Energy Efficiency

The most important component of energy efficiency is the application of sustainable building concepts in fully constructed or completed structures. These structures utilize innovative methods that promote generation of energy by sustainable means such as wind turbines, hydroelectric plants, bioreactors and solar panels among others.

The Indian real estate sector has witnessed the coming of sustainable structures in the form of zero energy homes which are highly energy efficient and are integrated with passive solar building designs. Though they incur high initial costs, zero energy homes are becoming increasingly popular because of their ability to promote positive environmental impact.

Expertise

Another important cog in the sustainable machine is getting good advisory and consultancies on board, agencies with proven success rate in the field. These organizations play a critical role in minimizing water wastage, understanding the value of biodiversity, and more importantly the importance of their preservation and longevity. This knowledge is incorporated at the design phase itself which can then be value-engineered all throughout the project lifecycle. There are many established and globally recognized organizations that have proved their prowess in this field and could be an important partner especially in a developing country like India.

The lightning speed at which India has been growing, the increase in energy consumption is an expected by-product. The large chunk of which will be devoured by sprawling buildings spread across the country. Ecologically safe structure is not a luxury item but an urgent and immediate need in the realty landscape, this is only possible through education, policy level changes, working in unison but most importantly developing a sense of urgency to environmental conservation.","So what exactly constitutes a sustainable building?

Though these problems affect rural and urban communities across the region in different ways, they all have one factor in common: climate change.

As global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, Asean nations, including Singapore, are bearing the brunt of intensifying climate impacts such as rising sea levels as well as more intense extreme weather events.

The reaction to this climate challenge, at the government, community, and business levels, has been to ramp up the search for sustainable solutions that help reduce waste and emissions, improve resource efficiency, and reduce pollution.

It is in response to this growing demand that Singapore, whose government has designated 2018 as the Year of Climate Action, has been hosting the biennial CleanEnviro Summit Singapore (CESS) event, which brings industry and government leaders from around the region to identify, develop and share solutions for Southeast Asia’s complex environmental challenges.

This year’s CESS, which is themed ‘Transforming Tomorrow’s Cities with Clean Environment Solutions’, will, in addition to revisiting topics like waste management and cleaning, explore three new environmental challenges: pest management, clean energy, and pollution control.

As Dalson Chung, managing director of CESS—which is hosted by Singapore’s National Environment Agency—notes: “These [issues] are interconnected and crucial to cities looking to create clean, liveable, and sustainable environments.”

Slated to take place in Singapore at the Sands Expo & Convention Centre at Marina Bay Sands from 8 to 12 July, CESS is held in conjunction with the World Cities Summit and the Singapore International Water Week.

Now in its fourth edition, this year’s event will showcase the latest in green technology and solutions via a variety of test beds, and offer opportunities to deep dive into the topics through several platforms, including the new Clean Environment Leaders’ Summit, says Chung.

The leadership event is a customised programme for high-level leaders, decision-makers, and policymakers to engage in multidisciplinary issues from a macro perspective, he explains.

Other sessions at CESS, a global platform, will see government and industry leaders spearheading discussions to identify and develop practical and sustainable solutions for the cities of tomorrow.

Looking to Singapore’s land constraints and the limited space in its offshore landfill at Pulau Semakau, Chung notes that choosing sustainable waste-to-energy technologies, recycling solutions, and innovative cleaning strategies is crucial for the city-state.

This is something that neighbouring nations like Japan and China, both of which are facing similar land challenges, have been actively developing, in addition to cleaning solutions that require less manpower, he adds.

Another initiative at CESS that will showcase cutting-edge sustainability solutions is the Innovation Pitch, says Chung. This is a platform for innovators to sell their ideas to all CESS visitors, some of whom may be investors and venture capitalists.

One initiative that will be highlighted this year is a project by Singapore Polytechnic, which employs green technology in the recovery of precious metals from e-waste, shares Chung.

“Current e-waste recycling operations usually involve the use of hazardous chemicals which pose high risks to industrial workers and the environment,” Chung notes.

“With technology, the innovators have found ways to ensure that recycling and proper disposal of e-waste is safe and sustainable,” he adds.

Another technological trend that will be front and centre at CESS 2018 is robotics and automation, says Chung.

Companies in Singapore and around the world have started to use artificial intelligence for waste management, in processes such as mechanising and automating sorting recyclables he notes.

Machine learning-enabled robotic devices that mimic the human eye in the identification of recyclables can help reduce the need for workers to perform such operations manually, Chung explains.

He adds that it also makes waste management operations more efficient by enabling the use of virtual reality remote technical assistance, where site technicians wearing Wi-Fi-enabled headsets may seek assistance from manufacturers directly to troubleshoot system faults.

Robotics can also transform cleaning processes, Chung notes. For example, machines can map out the areas to be cleaned autonomously, with minimal human intervention. This helps to increase the productivity of those involved in cleaning operations, freeing up their time to do more value-added tasks.

“In the near future, we can expect a wider use of such robotics in the industry and probably those with more innovative functions such as cleaning robots taking lift to clean other floors,” says Chung.

He adds that participants at the CESS conference will be able to gain useful insights about waste and resource management challenges and opportunities alike from the world’s foremost environmental leaders and technical experts.

Ultimately, Singapore is Asia’s hub for developing and testing smart cleantech solutions, and platforms like CESS accelerate the adoption of these solutions across the region, says Chung.

He adds: “In the face of challenges brought about by rapid urbanisation, it is critical to throw the spotlight on global best practices, and to seek out meaningful collaboration across local and international stakeholders.”

The reaction to this climate challenge, at the government, community, and business levels, has been to ramp up the search for sustainable solutions that help reduce waste and emissions, improve resource efficiency, and reduce pollution.

Zimbabwe needs to apply sustainable town planning to its cities and towns to enable efficient use of urban space, experts in the real estate and urban planning have said.

There has been a rapid urbanisation not only in Zimbabwe, but the rest of the Sub-Sahara African region as people move from rural areas to urban centres in search of employment and other services.

This has led to shortages of housing, transportation challenges and poor environmental management among other problems.

As a result, there has also been an increase in new settlements in urban centres, with “cowboy” developers giving home seekers a raw deal, selling land without roads, water and sewer reticulation and public facilities such as schools and clinics.

Speaking at the recently held Real Estate Institute of Zimbabwe (REIZ) winter school in Victoria Falls, urban planner Mr Innocencia Tigere, stressed the need to create viable neighbourhoods with all the requisite infrastructure ideal for residential areas.

This, she said, could start with the new developments that are sprouting across urban centres, which is presenting an opportunity for applying the sustainability concept in creation of new communities.

“The high urban population growth has resulted in spatial concentration of people, industries, commerce, vehicles, energy consumption, water use, waste generation, and other environmental stresses.

“Urban space must be pro-actively planned and controlled, rather than being an ad hoc response of land use management.

“Create viable neighbourhoods. This is accomplished by creating human settlements, which are well supported by requisite services; shopping, public schools, and other community facilities, in addition to developing transportation connections between the neighbourhoods,” she said.

Purposing settlement areas through planning for attracting investment could also help improve the quality of life for community members in their built environment.

Existing town planning decisions have been viewed as too fragmented, insufficiently sensitive to environmental and social factors, excessively rigid and rule-bound, too slow, reactive, and arbitrary.

Yet town planning decisions should lay the foundation for the structuring and growth of urban settlements to accommodate the ever growing population in a sustainable manner.

Tigere added sustainable town planning would enhance the quality of life and ensure the country meets some of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as access to safe and affordable housing and basic services by 2030.

However, there has been a sad development in most urban setups where some cooperatives and individuals, mainly former town councillors become land barons selling stands even in wetlands and all areas reserved for recreation and future public amenities.

The councils turned a blind eye on most of the sprouting suburbs and only to destroy the structures, some of the finished houses..","Enacy Mapakame Property ReporterZimbabwe needs to apply sustainable town planning to its cities and towns to enable efficient use of urban space, experts in the real estate and urban planning have said.

185,https://www.greenbiz.com/article/reeling-investments-sustainable-fisheries,"Fri, 06 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",GreenBiz,Reeling in investments in sustainable fisheries,"A total of 31.4 percent of global fisheries are being fished at biologically unsustainable levels, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. However, a 2016 study by Costello and others said the application of sound management reforms to global fisheries will increase biomass by 619 million metric tons relative to a business-as-usual scenario.

One way to enable sustainable fisheries management is to target the activities of small-scale coastal fishing businesses. Given their socioeconomic status, coastal fishing enterprises typically lack the economic independence to be able to completely disengage from unsustainable practices that are in favor of lucrative catch. They also represent 90 percent of the total 30 million fishing businesses globally, according to the FAO. This shows their vital role in the transition toward sustainable fisheries.

It is critical for funding to be channeled into fishing businesses as a way to incentivize a behavioral shift toward sustainable practices. With government resources becoming increasingly constrained as some nations address multiple challenges, there is a greater need to leverage private capital. Despite this need, there is a scarcity of platforms and financial instruments available to channel resources toward fisheries.

Bridging the gap

Two organizations working to bridge this gap are Meloy Fund and Catch Together.

Meloy Fund is an impact investment fund that makes debt and equity investments in fishing-related enterprises that support the recovery of coastal fisheries in Indonesia and the Philippines. The fund is a subsidiary of Rare, a global conservation organization.

Catch Together partners with fishing communities in the United States and Canada to structure and finance impact investments. It also provides support services such as help for fishing communities in acquiring quotas.

Risky business

Smallholder agriculture and small-scale fisheries have similar business models. But impact investments in the latter are trailing behind.

At this point, almost every fishery-management investment has been accompanied by some kind of subsidy.

Dale Galvin, managing partner at Meloy Fund, said the unpredictability of fisheries is the reason for this. Kelly Wachowicz, cofounder, managing partner and CFO at Catch Together, said the ""ocean environment is much more dynamic than terrestrial environments."" Therefore, ""management systems and investment strategies need to be able to be adaptive to accommodate changes over time"" that need to be successfully implemented in fisheries.

An additional reason for risk in fisheries is the difference in property rights. Unlike with agriculture, where land tenure is very clear, in fishing ""you don’t have the right to generally manage your fishery,"" Galvin said. As a result, ""investments are much harder to organize"" and ""monitoring fisheries management strategies in the water is difficult,"" Wachowicz said.

Investment results

Building a track record of successful fisheries investments is key to creating established credibility and curtailing perceived risk. Meloy Fund and Catch Together do exactly that.

Meloy Fund looks at growth-oriented enterprises that have a direct connection to coastal fisheries. Galvin said not only are coastal fisheries an under-invested sector, they also ""achieve most of the social and environmental objectives."" These include affecting the state of coral reefs, generating livelihoods for small-scale fishing enterprises and benefiting the broader economy. Along with making its investments, the fund works to improve the management of coastal ecosystems.

Catch Together focuses at the harvest level. Its staff work with fishing communities to finance the purchase of quota rights. ""It is these investments that are most aligned with long-term fishery health,"" Wachowicz said. Investing downstream in the value chain often places added pressure on the fishery. In such cases, it is important to pair investments with a management strategy that accounts for the standards upstream.

Another dimension of Catch Together’s strategy is the cultivation of community leadership. According to Wachowicz, ""Our thesis is that by working with communities to own quota, we create a long-term economic interest for the community and fishermen that’s tied to the health of the fishery.""

In effect, inherent value is created in the fishery that is constantly adapting to changing fishing conditions.

Investor uptake

While a strong impact case can be made for fisheries, it is up to players such as Meloy Fund and Catch Together to build a strong investment case.

As a first-time fund in a new sector, Meloy Fund sees encouraging interest from investors. Galvin said the partnership with Rare is critical to the fund’s value proposition.

While large-scale investments are indeed the goal, at present it appears that direct investments are the way to go.

""Rare is scaling coastal fisheries management in the countries Meloy is operating in. So you have this great opportunity to marry governance and management with investment,"" Galvin said.

However, there is some difficulty in building investment traction. This is because the investor mentality is typically that ""no one wants to be first,"" Galvin said. ""The downsides of being in a new sector [include] that it is not easy to make a decision because there are not a lot of data.""

Wachowicz said flexible investment terms are key in this sector. For instance, foundations can often provide program related investments (PRIs) at 1 percent to 3 percent interest with three- to five-year terms. In contrast, fisheries investments may require longer amortization terms. Equity transactions can offer as low as 5 percent to 6 percent annual cash yields and up to 12 percent to 15 percent in total return. These types of strategies would require a five- to 10-year investment horizon.

Apart from foundations, predominantly family offices are active investors, Wachowicz said. While there is a lot of appetite from institutions, the challenge of scale limits their participation: ""We work with investments that are as small as $100,000 as the first step — and this might lead to a $2 million-3 million portfolio.""

This tends to be too small for institutional investors who manage billion-dollar portfolios, seeking minimum investment commitments of $25 million-$50 million in size. At this early stage of market development, there are not yet opportunities to make commitments at that scale.

Higher impact

Both Wachowicz and Galvin said there is a potential for larger-scale investment vehicles such as blue bonds to attract private capital into fisheries. For instance, Rare is looking at bonds as a way for governments to ""finance dramatic increases in the amount they allocate to coastal fisheries management,"" Galvin said.

However, for private capital to be properly absorbed in this sector, fisheries need to be managed well.

Along with wild-catch fisheries, investments in aquaculture also offer huge opportunity.

""So where is the government going to get money to increase fisheries management?"" Galvin asked. ""If they do go out to the market, invest in a blue bond, and then raise that money and deploy it correctly — [and see] the benefits of spending that money on fisheries management in terms of fish, jobs, food security, and climate change — all of these benefits can be measured and more than pay back the cost of the bond.""

While blue bonds would deliver the scale that institutional investors look for, there are added complexities when adapting them to fisheries. Wachowicz said that while it may be challenging to create a larger scale of public-private partnerships and use creative financial structuring to develop blue bonds, they represent a promising direction for sustainable fisheries financing.

Future investments

According to Galvin, there is a strong sustainability angle for investing in aquaculture because it reduces pressure on wild-caught fisheries and also provides stable incomes to fishing enterprises. Similarly, Wachowicz said that the technical innovation allowed by aquaculture creates room for building companies to scale.

In the end, investment return in fisheries is less of an issue for investors than the complexity and risk of the transaction structures. Wachowicz said the long investment time periods required as well as the lack of initial project-development capital are barriers to private-sector investment: ""Efforts to support the creation of fisheries investment blueprints and projects can facilitate capital flow to the sector and also serve to help investors become more comfortable with the transaction complexities.""

Investor participation to date has been encouraged by risk-mitigating instruments such as guarantees.

Galvin said the presence of guarantees ""changes the risk profile significantly"" and motivates investors sitting on the fence to ""pull the trigger."" Wachowicz said, ""At this point, almost every fishery-management investment has been accompanied by some kind of subsidy, suggesting that blended finance strategies may be more successful in the short run than purely privately funded investments.""

While large-scale investments are indeed the goal, at present it appears that direct investments are the way to go. So are sector-focused funds. Proof of concept is the main driver in order to build investor confidence regarding the potential of this sector. As such, coupling investment strategies with technical assistance is necessary, as is evident in the approach of both Meloy Fund and Catch Together.

As investors start to channel funds into fishery-related enterprises that integrate sustainability, the case for strong impact and financial performance going hand in hand becomes even stronger. Thus, developing success stories may be the first step towards generating a larger market buy-in.","One way to enable sustainable fisheries management is to target the activities of small-scale coastal fishing businesses.

186,https://www.scidev.net/asia-pacific/opinions/bamboo-can-power-sustainable-development/,"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",SciDev.Net,Bamboo can power sustainable development,"Bamboo can be vital in mitigating climate change and alleviating poverty but remains ignored, say experts.

Bamboo covers more than 30 million hectares of land and is a common sight for rural communities across tropical and subtropical Africa, Asia and Latin America. Fast-growing and flexible, several species grow up to 90 centimetres a day. Some bamboo characteristics are well known, but its ability to lift people out of poverty is frequently overlooked.

While bamboo is associated with panda food in the Global North, many developing countries regard it as little more than ‘poor man’s timber’— a cheap substitute for timber products.

This may be about to change. At the Global Bamboo and Rattan Congress, referred to as BARC, held in Beijing last month by the International Bamboo and Rattan Organisation and China’s National Forestry and Grassland Administration (NFGA), 1,200 participants from almost 70 countries highlighted the uses of bamboo and agreed on a plan for the plant’s future.

“From poor man’s timber to green gold, the science is there to support bamboo’s importance for sustainable development. What is needed is urgent action to get the right policies and investment for this wonder plant” Hans Friederich, International Bamboo and Rattan Organisation

Millions of people across the world make a living through bamboo, including some eight million in China alone. According to NFGA Administrator, Zhang Jianlong, the sector employs almost 10 million people, and has reduced poverty in China’s remote rural areas.

With an estimated global trade value of US$60 billion, the bamboo sector clearly has vast potential for poverty alleviation. Innovative uses of bamboo include heavy duty drainage pipes and wind turbines and in post-disaster housing and schools.

Fighting climate change

Moreover, a number of bamboo species are potential tools for carbon sequestration and combatting climate change. Bamboo plants store carbon at a fast rate, and bamboo products can effectively ‘displace’ more emissions-intensive materials such as cement, steel and plastic). Recent INBAR research suggests (well-managed) bamboo can store 200 to 400 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year.

With such high carbon storage rates, there is clearly potential for countries to integrate bamboo into their climate mitigation plans. Says Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change: “Bamboo and rattan can make an important difference in the fight against climate change. Nature-based solutions like bamboo do not just contribute to sustainable development, they also help build the kind of world we want.”

According to Gunter Pauli, the founder of My Blue Economy, bamboo’s lightweight nature and high natural strength make it an excellent construction material, earning it the name “vegetal steel” among architects around the world. The flexibility of bamboo structures makes them ideal for earthquake-resilient housing as demonstrated while rebuilding schools in Nepal following the 2015 earthquake.

But if bamboo is so critical to sustainable development, why is it not more used?

A key challenge is lack of awareness about bamboo’s uses. The BARC ended with commitments to recognise the benefits of these plants by governments, representatives of research institutions, development organisations, construction firms and the private sector.

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang led the way at BARC by recognising the value of bamboo and rattan in promoting green growth, addressing climate change, improving the environment, increasing incomes, and expanding South-South cooperation.

From poor man’s timber to green gold, the science is there to support bamboo’s importance for sustainable development. What is needed is urgent action to get the right policies and investment for this wonder plant.



Hans Friederich is the director general of the International Bamboo and Rattan Organisation, a multilateral development organisation of 44 member-states which promotes the use of bamboo and rattan for sustainable development. Friederich is currently based in Beijing, China, and has over 30 years’ experience working in Africa, Asia and Europe in natural resources management.

187,https://inthesetimes.com/article/land-for-sustainable-farming,"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",In These Times,Land Trusts Are a Step Toward a Step Toward a Sustainable Future for Agriculture,"In its short three-year’s lifespan, SILT has protected 5 farms with more than 400 total acres. This is an impressive start, but a start on what might seem an impossible mission. With the average age of U.S. farmers over 58-years old , something like 92 million acres or 10% of U.S. farmland has changed hands in the past five years. In the next 20 years, approximately 70% of U.S. farmland is likely to change hands. It’s certainly going to be an uphill battle to make U.S. farmland accessible and affordable to farmers who are committed to the sustainable, regenerative farming systems needed protect the land and grow healthy food for generations to come.

Sustainable agricultural easements administered by SILT remove speculative pressures that keep costs of farmland too high to be paid for by sustainable farming. Farmland owned by SILT is made available to farmers through long term leases that allow farmers to benefit from appreciation in the farm business without the economic challenges of land purchase and ownership. SILT also works through private and public partnerships to facilitate land ownership transfers and land use planning to ​“permanently protect land to grow healthy food for future generations.”

“The Sustainable Iowa Land Trust or SILT was launched 2015 to help save and protect the best of the family farm – small, diverse, clean farms that feed Iowans.” The SILT website proclaims, ​“We are dedicated to permanently protecting land to grow healthy food for generations to come.” Farmland trusts, like SILT, are a means of making more farmland available for sustainable production of healthy foods.

Access to farmland is consistently ranks among the biggest obstacles faced by the new generation of farmers committed to the traditional values of family farmers as stewards of their lands and responsible members of their communities. These new farmers face land prices inflated by competition from large-scale commodity producers who are heavily subsidized by government programs. In addition, farmland prices are being inflated by speculative investors who see even high-priced farmland as a low-risk alternative to financial instruments. More than 30% of U.S. farmland is currently owned by non-operator or non-farming landlords — including individual owners as well as corporations and investment funds.

A growing cadre of professional farm managers are making the farm management decisions on these non-operator or non-farmer owned farms. These professional farm managers are not managing farms for the triple ecological, social, and economic bottom line of sustainable family farms. They are managing for the single economic bottom line of industrial agri-business. Increasingly, large, commercial farming operations are using ​“precision farming” systems that utilize extensive digitized data gathered from soil tests and yield monitors to control GPS guided crop seeding, fertilization and pesticide application and rely on real-time monitoring of crop conditions via satellite. The large and growing data bases collected for precision farming have allowed high-tech ​“climate-smart agriculture” to make inroads into the global sustainable agriculture movement.

“Big Data” is the new challenge to sustainable food systems of the future. Some futurists envision a food system that is essentially controlled at every level, from dirt to the dinner plate, by decisions made by computers and carried out by robots. Even more troubling is the fact that a few multinational agribusiness corporations, notably Bayer and Monsanto, own and control a large share of the ​“big data” associated with agricultural production. With a future in which hundreds of millions of acres of farmland could be owned through multinational speculative investment funds and operated by computers and robots controlled by multinational agribusiness corporations, ​“permanently protecting farmland to grow healthy food for future generations” seems a daunting, if not impossible, mission. That being said, it is a mission that we simply must complete.

The achievements of SILT might seem insignificant compared to the challenge, but they are not. There are dozens if not hundreds of other land trusts and other non-profit organizations all across the country who share the mission of making farmland accessible to sustainable farmers. Each organization is unique in its approach and its vision for the future, but they share a common mission. There is inherent strength in their diversity. There are hundreds of thousands of farmers reaching retirement age who still have the commitment to stewardship and community of traditional family farmers. These farmers want to leave a legacy of farming that reflects those values, but they simply have not yet found a means of doing so that works for them. There are thousands of others, like the folks who support organizations like SILT, who are passionately committed to making it possible for these farmers to ​“permanently protect” their farms so new generations of like-minded farmers can ​“grow healthy food for future generations.”

Ironically, Iowa’s right-to-farm legislation might prove useful in making farmland accessible for sustainable farmers. It states: ​“It is the intent of the general assembly to provide local citizens and local governments the means by which agricultural land may be protected from nonagricultural development pressures. This may be accomplished by the creation of county land preservation and use plans and policies, adoption of an agricultural land preservation ordinance, or establishment of agricultural areas in which substantial agricultural activities are encouraged.”

The apparent intent of the law is to separate rural residences from farming operations. However, local government officials could instead use agricultural zoning laws to establish large ​“safe zones” around Iowa’s cities, town, and rural communities where farmers and other rural residences could coexist in mutually-beneficial, supportive relationships with the farmlands ​“permanently protected to grow healthy food” for their local communities ​“for generations to come.” The farms could be good places for neighbors to live around as well as good places farm families to live on.

SILT and other farmland preservation initiatives may well be creating the grassroots support for substantive changes in land use planning. Small beginnings can lead to big changes, like the small ​“trim tabs” that change the direction of large ships on the ocean. The trim tab is a small rudder in the larger rudder of large ships. The trim tab changes first, which allows the rudder to change, which then changes the direction of the ship. Image that today’s industrial agriculture is like a fleet of large ships headed toward the turbulent seas of an unsustainable future. However, the trim tabs, like SILT, are already changing, creating opportunities for local farmland preservation ordinances, which eventually will turn the agri-food system toward a resilient, regenerative, sustainable future.

Even if you doubt that such big changes are possible, your support for SILT might help create opportunities for dozens of thoughtful retiring family farmers to pass on their legacy of stewardship and community on to a new generation of farmers who are committed to growing healthy food for current and future generations. Finally, even if the odds of success seem small, there are some things in life that we must support simply because it’s the right things to do.

Lebanon’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Health Ghassan Hasbani called for the dissemination of Saudi Vision 2030 to the rest of the Arab countries to improve access to the 17 UN sustainable development goals by 2030, as a means to mitigate conflicts in the region. He also urged further measures to diversify Arab economies, including the use of renewable energy sources.

Hasbani delivered the ESCWA speech at the United Nations High Level Political Forum on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of 2030 in New York, where he presented the decisions of the Arab Forum for Sustainable Development 2018 hosted by Beirut and organized by ESCWA, in cooperation with the League of Arab States and United Nations organizations In the Arab region.

Hasbani told Asharq Al-Awsat that he presented to the delegations in New York the results of the ESCWA Forum held in Beirut. He pointed out that the most important recommendations included what he described as the transformation and diversification of the Arab economies for sustainable development and social and economic stability.

“Expanding the use of sustainable energy and alternative energy has been the subject of considerable debate, because it is a key objective of the United Nations development agenda by 2030,” he said. He also emphasized that the participation of the youth and women in economic development achieved the sustainability of the sector.

“Capacities vary in the Arab world according to the development paths and strategic plans adopted by each country,” he said, adding that the biggest challenge was the need for greater cooperation among Arab countries to bring these capacities closer and develop sustainable development goals.

As for promising results in the Arab world, Hasbani said: “The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has shown a great ability to collect information and develop an advanced database compared to other countries in the Arab world. The UAE also has extensive statistical and administrative information,” noting that the field was open for development and improvement.

He stressed the presence of important databases in Lebanon, but distributed among ministries and government institutions, and not located in one center.

The UN 17 objectives of sustainable development include combating poverty and hunger, developing health, securing affordable clean energy and new jobs, ensuring equality in society, building cities and sustainable communities, promoting the responsible use of resources, caring for the climate and nature sustainability, providing peace and justice, and strengthening partnerships at the local and global levels.","Hasbani delivered the ESCWA speech at the United Nations High Level Political Forum on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of 2030 in New York, where he presented the decisions of the Arab Forum for Sustainable Development 2018 hosted by Beirut and organized by ESCWA, in cooperation with the League of Arab States and United Nations organizations In the Arab region.

It was about a mile away from my destination. However, by the look on the faces of a small crowd of local people there was no other way to get through.

So, somewhat reluctantly, I parked my bike along with another half a dozen others and squelched onwards. I have regularly visited this region since, but upon my most recent visit things are beginning to noticeably change – a bigger road is coming.

Ta Phin is situated in the mountains of Northwestern Vietnam, bordering China. The village is near the former French hill station town known as Sa Pa. These verdant hills and valleys consist of iconic rice terraces, some of the world’s most stunning scenery, and are inhabited by a colourful collection of Vietnam’s myriad ethnic minorities.

Ta Phin

Diaspora tales

A total of 87 percent of the Vietnamese people are known as Kinh (Viet), however, there are fifty-four separate ethnic groups living within these borders.

This complex assemblage of communities in Vietnam has an equally diverse historical background: some groups are thought to have arrived over 2,000 years ago, whilst others more recently, from over the last five hundred years or so.

Those in the Central Highlands of Vietnam and the Mekong Delta region have migrated from the west, whilst those farther north have migrated southwards from China.

Each ethnic group has its own diaspora tales; whatever their story — these communities have found home and settled in Vietnam.

Black and Flower H'Mong

Embroideries translated

Ta Phin village is predominately Red Dao (pronounced zow). The settlement itself is a mere crossroads of two muddied tracks.

Ethnically garbed women sit in clusters embroidering their wares. The Red Dao women are easily identified by their distinctive bright red and white headscarves, their indigo dyed hemp jackets and trousers — at times fronted by complex silver jewellery — all elaborately embroidered with distinct colours and motifs.

I was privileged to have some of the stories of their embroideries translated for me and was surprised to hear that many of the intricate patterns depicted their diaspora.

Journeys over mountains, changes in trees from fruits to pines and curiously bright yellow and gold swastikas. “What are these?” I enquire. “Ah, they are the tiger’s footprints in the snow.”

Red and Black Dao

Land labourers

One particular family I have stayed with over time have allowed me great insight into their ancient way of life. Their homestead on the outskirts, down by the river, is where my lovely friend Tan Ta May and her husband Sieu live.

May is a Red Dao medicine woman: the Dao are renowned for their wisdom in regard to plant medicine.

Here the extended family run a small business for herbal bathing. Wooden tubs are filled with an extremely hot brew concocted from local plants and trees.

One immerses into the sweltering hot tub and slowly sinks into the medicinal infusion. It’s a heady and steamy experience.

As hot as one can bear, yet with windows open to views of rice terraces, lush hillsides and water buffaloes — all accompanied by the babble of the adjacent stream; it’s a simple paradise.

Whether to alleviate the aching limbs of hard worked land labourers, to detoxicate or simply to relax – this ‘therapy’ is at least locally a well-known cure-all; and May and Sieu have the reputation to run a good business.

Herbal bathing therapy

Commercial operations

However, traditionally the main ingredients for this treatment have been locally foraged – but visitors are coming from further afield, and the demand for the baths is increasing.

Larger commercial operations are also in the main town and surrounding areas. In addition, the concentrated liquid for these baths can now be bought by the bottle.

Other vital ingredients have been concentrated into essential oils and now soaps are also being made. It’s proving very popular amongst the Vietnamese and trade is increasing into the northern cities such as Hanoi and even as far south as Saigon.

All good for business – but nonetheless, the forest's supply is finite. And here is the positivity I encountered.

Through an amalgamation of a recently formed Red Dao cooperative (2015), a Vietnamese NGO and funding from the Vietnamese government and some foreign investment — a little bit of cash is hopefully going to go a long way to protect at least one of the essential herbal ingredients being utilised by this group.

The plant is known locally as Chu Du (pronounced chew zoo) Elsholtzia penduliflora. A relatively tall plant of the mint family, with a delightful aroma and almost magical properties, indeed I personally call it ‘magic oil’.

I use the concentrated form on a daily basis. I live in one of the most polluted cities in the world, Hanoi. The oil can be rubbed on your chest, face and head and it immediately relives breathing, blocked sinuses and gives a sense of calm – a wonder it truly is.

Chu Du

Deftly scythed

So, on my most recent visit – the main question on my mind was — ‘how was money going to help protect an endangered plant?’

Upon arrival, May walks us up and down some serious hills and deep into the forest. Here we arrive at extremely isolated small holdings, only women and children at home, the men are out ploughing the terraces for the next season of rice.

Surrounding these large, dark and smoky old wooden houses are farms that simply blend into the surrounding forest. From the chickens in the wood pile to the pigs in their sties, all seemingly merge quite naturally.

As we step into the forest I saw pots of orchids under the canopy, one essential source of income for these mountain dwellers. And then through marshy areas and onto the forest edge and I am introduced to patches of Chu Du.

I witnessed the careful harvesting of this wild plant. Deftly scythed to ensure regrowth and a quick demonstration of how easily it is to propagate by simply taking a stem and sticking it back in the mud.

Red Dao house

‘How then is cash going to prevent overharvesting?’ It is simply a matter of land and time management amongst the entirely female cooperative.

With some money and an emphasis on the importance of these forest plants, the Dao women are able to prioritize attention to their foraging activities.

It gives value to the wooded area where the Chu Du grows and may prevent forest clearance for future arable growth or livestock grazing. The investment will also allow for simple fencing to protect against the free-range buffaloes.

Foraging for herbs

Last year May’s own operation required 14 tons of Chu Du, 700kg of the plant is needed to make 1 litre of essential oil. She is not alone, many people in this region are commercialising their plant medicine enterprises, I am so grateful to have witnessed the sensible sustainable management of these wild herbs.

These foragers are now forest farmers

Keeping up his energy during a full day of work and getting all the dirt washed off can be challenging, too, but none of it compares to the satisfaction the University of Minnesota Duluth senior feels about his work.

""Some of us have said that you don't feel good, but you feel good about what you did at the end of the day. Like when we were putting plastic down and putting rows in; at the end of the day, you can see that you did a lot of stuff. It feels really rewarding,"" Koons said.

Three miles from campus, seven UMD students are spending the summer working at the university's Sustainable Agriculture Project, also called the Land Lab or, simply, ""the farm."" Ten fields are home to more than 80 varieties of produce, and the farm has a total output of about 40,000 pounds of food, most of which is served on UMD's campus by dining services.

Beyond the pounds of fresh produce, the farm has provided a space for students to learn about sustainable agriculture since 2009. More than 1,000 UMD students visit the farm in classes or internships throughout the year, and all Duluth school district seventh graders visit for a life sciences lesson. The farm has a teacher training garden for teachers to learn how to manage school gardens. It works with the Intertribal Agriculture Council to adapt flint corn to the region. Birdhouses, beehives, bat houses and pollinator plants are also on the farm to enhance the biodiversity of the region's landscape.

These educational opportunities are in large part why UMD's Land Lab was ranked fifth in the nation for ""fantastic college farms"" by Best Value Schools in June.

""It's an outdoor classroom. It's a research laboratory. It's a production space and a space of community engagement,"" Land Lab Director Randy Hanson said.

Hanson has taught for 25 years and said he's noted an increase during the past decade of students interested in supporting sustainability and local food production forming part of a larger movement throughout the country. Colleges and universities, UMD included, are increasingly adding campus farms in response to that, he said.

""This generation of students has grown up, from the time they are cognitive, knowing that we live in an unsustainable world, and yet, we give them few platforms to practically address that complicated problem,"" Hanson said. ""I think universities can become more accelerators of positive change, leveraging their resources in collaboration with communities and regions to really anchor regenerative change.""

Hands-on experience

The farm's student workers typically begin at the start of summer break, working into the fall semester. The planting for this season is now done, and students have moved onto tasks such as weeding until harvest time in the fall. They were busy last week using a tiller to pile soil on top of potatoes and creating low tunnels to cover strawberry rows.

UMD senior Alyssa Minder called the farm ""a collective of skills and knowledge"" because each student working at the farm brings a different set of agriculture interests.

""It's really, really a land lab in that sense, where it's a collective of knowledge, and we can go out and experiment a little on our own, experiment a little bit around here and then talk about it and innovate and make it more efficient,"" Minder said.

A high tunnel that houses a hydroponic production system is a recent addition to the farm. UMD senior Austin Parenteau has been working with Mike Mageau, director of UMD's Environment and Sustainability Project, on growing lettuce using hydroponics. Parenteau came to UMD to study environmental sustainability, not knowing the university had the farm. In addition to soaking up information on farming logistics, biology, ecology and marketing from the professors, he's learned about hydroponics and wants to incorporate it into his future plans to become a farmer. He was previously interested in hydroponics and researched it on his own, but it seemed ""too intimidating"" to try on his own before trying it with Mageau, he explained.

""The biggest thing working here overall is: just try. Try and if you fail, try something different because if you're always waiting to try and worried about failing, you're just never going to do anything,"" Parenteau said.

Minder didn't know about UMD's farm until she visited it in Hanson's class and became hooked when she helped with the harvest last fall. She said she'd like to have her own farm someday, and she's focusing on food systems in her anthropology major. Working on the farm complements her coursework with hands-on learning about agriculture, and she enjoys knowing she was a part of the process to bring food to students when she sees them eating on campus.

""It's kinda this unspoken thing where you're walking through and you have this pride. It's like, 'I gave this to the students. How can I do more of that?' It makes me thirsty to do more,"" she said.

Ripple effect

The land for UMD's farm was once the home of the Northeast Agricultural Experiment Station, which played a key role in enhancing the region's agricultural food system through applied research from 1912-1976, Hanson explains.

By the time the station closed, the American food system was evolving toward more processed food and concentrated food production, which people thought was a good thing at the time. However, the economic and health benefits of local agriculture are better known today. UMD felt it could play a role in educating the campus and community and reshaping the region's food system by reopening a farm on the land, he said.

Hanson said he hopes the farm teaches students what it means to put sustainability into practice and what the tradeoffs are when adding sustainability to key infrastructure. People know how to adapt infrastructure to be more sustainable, but work remains to integrate it into the social fabric where everyone collaborates on sustainability across governments, nonprofits, private businesses and educational institutions, he said. No one institution can do it on their own.

Higher education can accelerate that work, creating a ripple effect as students move into jobs in government, nonprofits and private businesses, Hanson said. Exposing students to the challenges of engaging institutions and communities to become more sustainable often gives them more questions than answers, but it provides useful learning opportunities about engaging communities on sustainability issues. People today can ""become good ancestors"" by starting to make the world a more sustainable place, he said.

""It takes a village to become sustainable. Learning how to collaborate is key, and it's very complex. How do you do that with large communities, like all of Duluth or all of the western Lake Superior region?"" Hanson said. ""It means we have to educate ourselves. We have to educate each other and learn how we collectively produce our individual and community health through food. ... What we're doing is just a piece of what's happening all across the United States and, really, the world in the early 21st century.""","Three miles from campus, seven UMD students are spending the summer working at the university's Sustainable Agriculture Project, also called the Land Lab or, simply, ""the farm.""

Team building or team work is a must to achieve our goals. There are many activities which cannot be performed well by any individual but the same can be done through a team or group. People come together and form association or societies to address certain issues to bring solution or change. One of the classic examples of this is none other than cooperatives. Well, we have to understand what a cooperative is and how it works and its power in the society or in bringing sustainable change.

A cooperative (also known as co-operative, co-op, or coop) is “an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise”. It may include non-profit community organizations, businesses owned and managed by the people who use their services (a consumer cooperative), organisations managed by the people who work there (worker cooperatives), organisations managed by the people to whom they provide accommodation (housing cooperatives), etc.

The co-operative principles are guidelines by which co-operatives put their values into practice and includes Voluntary and Open Membership, Democratic Member Control, Member Economic Participation, Autonomy and Independence, Education, Training and Information, Co-operation among Co-operatives and Concern for Community.

The co-operative movement has been also recognized as a distinct and major stakeholder in both national and international affairs. Co-operatives’ open membership model affords access to wealth creation and poverty elimination. Co-operatives also foster external equality as they are community-based; they are committed to the sustainable development of their communities - environmentally, socially and economically. The cooperative movement is highly democratic, locally autonomous, but internationally integrated, and a form of organization of associations and enterprises whereby citizens themselves rely on self-help and their own responsibility to meet goals that include not only economic, but also social and environmental objectives, such as overcoming poverty, securing productive employment and encouraging social integration.

The earliest record of a co-operative comes from Fenwick, Scotland where, in March 14, 1761, in a barely furnished cottage local weavers manhandled a sack of oatmeal into John Walker’s whitewashed front room and began selling the contents at a discount, forming the Fenwick Weavers’ Society.

In 1844 a group of 28 artisans working in the cotton mills in the town of Rochdale in the north of England established the first modern co-operative business - the Rochdale Equitable Pioneers Society. The weavers faced miserable working conditions and low wages and they could not afford the high prices of food and household goods. They decided that by pooling their scarce resources and working together they could access basic goods at a lower price. Initially, there were only four items for sale: flour, oatmeal, sugar and butter. The Rochdale Pioneers are regarded as the prototype of the modern co-operative society and the founders of the Co-operative Movement.

In 1994, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution 49/155 of 23 December 1994 on cooperatives which not only called on governments and international agencies to “consider fully the potential of cooperatives for contributing to the solution of economic, social and environmental problems in formulating national development strategies and consider reviewing legal and administrative constraints on the activities of cooperatives with a view to eliminating those constraints that are not applied to other businesses and enterprises,” but also invited “...governments, relevant international organizations, specialized agencies and national and international cooperative organizations to observe annually the International Day of Cooperatives on the first Saturday of July starting from 1995, as proclaimed by the General Assembly in its resolution 47/90.” Since that date the global community celebrates United Nations International Day of Cooperatives and ICA’s International Cooperative Day on the first Saturday of July.

The theme for this year is ‘sustainable societies through cooperation’. At a time when income inequality is rising around the world, it is good to be reminded that solutions to inequality do exist. The co-operative model is foremost among these solutions, since it contains aspects of sustainable development at its core and is based on ethical values and principles. On July 7, 2018, members of cooperatives around the world celebrate the International Day of Cooperatives. In the past the United Nations General Assembly has declared 2012 as the International Year of Cooperatives, highlighting the contribution of cooperatives to socio-economic development, particularly their impact on poverty reduction, employment generation and social integration

There are many cooperatives in our country too. Amul is one of the best example of cooperative movement. There are cooperatives banks, agriculture cooperatives, etc which are engaging and helping many individuals and families in the country. Agricultural cooperatives work to maintain the longevity of the land where they grow crops through sustainable farming practices. Consumer cooperatives support sustainable sourcing for their products and educate consumers about responsible consumption. Housing cooperatives help ensure safe dwellings. Worker and social cooperatives aim to provide goods and services in an efficient, planet-friendly way, while creating long-term, sustainable jobs. Its important for us to strengthen the cooperatives movement. We may be part in the movement directly or indirectly as cooperatives have power to bring sustainable change and development.","Co-operatives also foster external equality as they are community-based; they are committed to the sustainable development of their communities - environmentally, socially and economically.

The first step involves lifting the former cargo ships out of their boat yards by crane to be placed into their new locations on land. The estates themselves will be selected according to their landscapes. The eco-communities will be arranged on lush natural terrains in the vicinity of open water in order to strike a balance between providing privacy to the residents and fostering a strong sense of community.

Once in place, the original metal structures will then be built out into proper living spaces with sustainability at the forefront of the design. Since the ships vary in shape and size, each home will have a unique aesthetic, but the entire renovation process will focus on retaining the ships’ nautical origins.

According to the architects, original features such as the stern, wheelhouse and foredeck will be enhanced with “sleek geometric shapes” on the exterior. Measuring up to 200 feet in length, the elongated volume of the interior will be broken up with flexible partitions that will enable future residents to personalize the layout. To embed the new homes into their landscapes, the firm included a large rooftop garden terrace on each home that will provide stellar 360° views of the estate grounds. The homes will also have outdoor decks to further connect the new homes with their surroundings.

""As the Galway Races are such an intrinsic part of Ireland’s tourism and culture, we hope that by introducing these initiatives, a national and international audience will see how Irish businesses and event teams are working together to do their bit to protect our future.”

Mr O'Grady added: “Greening an event like the Galway Races Festival it will raise awareness about how we can all do our bit to care for the environment. Collectively, we can make a difference when it comes to reducing the impact on the environment and in doing so, have a positive effect on our local communities.

A question posed by an Indigenous representative to the government about such killings – of which there were more than 100 last year – went unanswered, illustrating the many layers at which civil society is obstructed from meaningful participation in achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, from the local level to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

Civil society are often on the frontlines, protecting the most vulnerable in our societies as well as our natural resources– vital work that must be protected and not attacked. When activists are killed, kidnapped and locked up because of their defense of the environment and human rights, the 2030 Agenda is set back. These actions undermine the achievement of targets under Goal 16, and they are also a slap in the face for the wider civil society community, which continues to make some of the most important contributions to achieving the 2030 Agenda at national and global levels.

Meanwhile, governments are also restricting civil society’s involvement in monitoring the 2030 Agenda at the annual meeting of the HLPF in New York. This is the forum where governments present their Voluntary National Reviews – reports that account for the progress they have made towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This year’s HLPF, which concluded on 18 July, continued several bad habits that have dogged the body’s five-year existence, and which place crucial limits on civil society engagement.

The Colombian government’s skirting of the question on human rights defenders is just one example of how governments can hide behind the limited time and format of the Voluntary National Review process. In another example, the government of Switzerland prepared its Voluntary National Review with active engagement from civil society, but presented a much shorter version that omitted a number of sections, including text on the impacts of Swiss financial institutions on global economic inequality.

Not content to sit on the sidelines, even when facing the threat of retaliation, civil society is increasingly producing its own reports to complement the Voluntary National Reviews. The UN has yet to provide a mechanism to include civil society reports in the formal review process, and the format of the HLPF continues to undermine any real potential for meaningful engagement from civil society. Governments are only allotted 30 minutes in which to present their report and take questions and statements from other Member States as well as civil society. In this year’s sessions, only one or two representatives from civil society were able to publicly comment on their government’s report during each session. Often civil society collaborates to produce a joint statement that must fit into just two minutes, giving extremely limited space for diverse voices to be heard.

And while some governments include civil society in their official delegations, the limited time allocated still restricts their voices. This proved the case when Canada invited Chief Wilton Littlefoot to join the Canadian delegation on the podium as the government presented its Voluntary National Review, an inclusion that amounted to little more than a token gesture given that there was not enough time for Chief Littlefoot to speak during the proceedings.

At the other end of the spectrum, some civil society representatives were concerned they would face government reprisal if they posed even benign questions in this public setting. The fear of some activists to speak out, even at the UN, is a harsh reminder of the reality of the threats posed by governments towards civil society in many of the countries under review at this year’s HLPF.

As data from the CIVICUS Monitor shows, civic space is rated “closed” in seven of the 46 countries that submitted their reviews to this year’s HLPF: Egypt, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, the United Arab Emirates, Viet Nam, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Sudan. These countries restrict civil society to the point that few if any non-governmental organizations exist, let alone work to hold leaders accountable, promote human rights or monitor their governments’ progress towards achieving sustainable development.

Repression of civil society in these countries also tells us that their government leaders have failed to recognize the many valuable contributions that civil society can make to sustainable development at the national level. While civil society organisations often play an important role as watchdogs by holding governments accountable, they are also often some of the primary implementing partners working with governments to achieve most of the SDGs, from health to equality to climate change. By contrast, governments and the UN seem intent on increasing the private sector’s involvement in SDGs, without also acknowledging that much greater private sector accountability is required if the Goals are to be achieved. Instead of holding the private sector to account for its contributions to rising inequalities, environmental degradation, unsustainable consumption and more, the UN is inviting private sector organizations to present their “achievements” in New York, with little to no scrutiny.

Civil society’s role as an implementer makes civic space essential to achieving the 2030 Agenda. Civic space is measured under SDG target 16.10, which encompasses fundamental freedoms such as the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of association. One of the indicators for this target is the number of killings of human rights advocates, an issue too many governments are failing to address. Governments should be mindful of this commitment as they implement the Agenda and look for ways to support truly inclusive participation from civil society in their efforts at both the national and international levels.

Governments should also be mindful of their commitments to civil society partnerships under SDG target 17.17 as they present their Voluntary National Reviews. The lack of space for civil society scrutiny meant that several of the VNR sessions during the 2018 HLPF became a space for governments to boast of their achievements with virtually no scrutiny of their claims. In some cases, the presentations included videos that seemed primarily promotional in purpose, taking up precious minutes that could be used for a more interactive presentation.

In 2019, the format of the High-level Political Forum will be under review and CIVICUS urges member states to use this as an opportunity to formalize civil society’s valuable contributions to the 2030 Agenda. This formalization should include providing a way for civil society organisations to present their own reports to complement the Voluntary National Reviews prepared by governments as well as longer review sessions at the HLPF to allow for more meaningful critiques from civil society and other member states.

It is positive that many governments at this year’s HLPF spoke of their partnerships with civil society. In order to achieve the 2030 Agenda, these partnerships need to be meaningful, and most importantly civil society needs to be free to contribute their end of the bargain, without fear of reprisals.

Lyndal Rowlands works in UN Advocacy for CIVICUS, the global alliance for citizen participation, and previously covered the launch of the 2030 Agenda as a member of the UN press corps. Twitter: @lyndalrowlands","When activists are killed, kidnapped and locked up because of their defense of the environment and human rights, the 2030 Agenda is set back.
Meanwhile, governments are also restricting civil society’s involvement in monitoring the 2030 Agenda at the annual meeting of the HLPF in New York.
And while some governments include civil society in their official delegations, the limited time allocated still restricts their voices.
Repression of civil society in these countries also tells us that their government leaders have failed to recognize the many valuable contributions that civil society can make to sustainable development at the national level.

198,https://www.business.com/articles/un-sustainable-development-goals-for-small-business/,"Tue, 07 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Business.com,Sustainable Development Goals on a Small Business Scale,"In September 2015, the United Nations (UN) adopted a set of goals to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity as part of a new sustainable development agenda.

For the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be reached, ""everyone needs to do their part: governments, the private sector, civil society and people like you,"" the UN's website reads.

According to the SDG's 2018 Report, the participation and reporting of countries is hopeful, but progress has not been rapid enough.

""Achieving the 2030 Agenda requires immediate and accelerated actions by countries along with collaborative partnerships among governments and stakeholders at all levels,"" wrote the report's authors.

As the corporate world continues to embrace sustainability, acknowledging and reporting on the SDGs has become increasingly popular. A February 2018 study by KPMG found that four in 10 of the world's largest companies already reference the SDGs in their corporate reporting.

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) often can't approach the goals in the same manner as large corporations or governments, but that doesn't mean it's okay to do nothing. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), SMEs account for an overwhelming majority of private sector business and economic activity in both developed and developing countries.

Given the role of small business in the global economy, it is essential to understand the potential contribution in the progression toward the sustainable development goals and why they are so important.

The case for participation

Tracy Triggs-Matthews, associate director of UNC Kenan-Flagler's Center for Sustainable Enterprise, said SMEs typically do not have the time for higher level strategic thinking on sustainability unless the enterprise started out with such a mindset.

""I think many SMEs would be surprised to see how 'good' their company already is and how small tweaks can make them even better,"" she said. ""Consumers are looking for brands that are making a big difference and being able to tell that story will only help differentiate an SME among competitors.""

Although some incentives to embrace the goals lie in the realm of contributing to the greater good and a better future, there are countless potential benefits for small businesses to consider.

""I think the way for businesses to look at the UN's sustainable development goals is through the lens of business opportunity,"" said Tensie Whelan, director of NYU's Center for Sustainable Business.

According to the Business and Sustainable Development Commission, sustainable business models could open economic opportunities worth $12 trillion and create 380 million jobs by 2030.

""Putting the Sustainable Development Goals, or Global Goals, at the heart of the world's economic strategy could unleash a step change in growth and productivity, with an investment boom in sustainable infrastructure as a critical driver,"" the report said.

Regardless of size or industry, all companies can contribute to the SDGs. The UN Global Compact asks companies to first do business responsibly and then pursue opportunities to solve societal challenges through business innovation and collaboration.

The Compact recommends that businesses utilize an SDG compass to measure the progress and alignment of your business operations with the SDGs. The SDG compass guide is developed with a focus on large multinational enterprises. SMEs and other organizations are also encouraged to use it as ""a source of inspiration and adapt as necessary.""

Given the overwhelming influx of information available and the general lack of expertise compared to larger companies, it's easy to see why SMEs would struggle to identify how they should contribute.

A closer look at the goals

Based on the UN's targets and indicators for the SDGs, the SDG Compass, a list of ""Good Life Goals"" set by lifestyle consultancy FUTERRA and advice from SME executives, small businesses can adopt the following practices to start taking SDG action.

Some of these items may be more relevant to certain industries than others, and there are certainly many other ways that businesses can approach the goals, but any step toward sustainability is a step in the right direction.

1. End poverty

Set and enforce strict non-discriminatory policies

Recruit, train, and employ local community members, including those living in poverty, and integrate them in your value chain

2. Zero hunger

Support and encourage small-scale farming, practice farm-to-table or 'farm-to-office snacks' sourcing from local entities whenever possible

Demonstrate transparency in the agricultural supply chain

3. Good health and well-being

Offer employee health benefits

Make investments in health a priority in business operations.

4. Quality education

Create programs (e.g., internships, work-study programs, traineeships, etc.) that give students earlier access to the corporate environment

Provide employees with continuous opportunities to improve their (job) skills for their current and future employment

5. Gender equality

Pay equal remuneration, including benefits, for work of equal value

Support access to child and dependent care by providing services, resources, and information to both women and men

Establish a zero-tolerance policy towards all forms of violence at work, including verbal/ and/ or physical abuse

6. Clean water and sanitation

Prioritize water efficiency by installing best-practice technologies for water conservation

Educate employees about the importance of water efficiency

Prohibit the use of chemicals and materials that can be particularly detrimental to water quality if improperly disposed

7. Affordable and clean energy

Pursue efficient certifications, like LEED or Energy Star

Prioritize energy efficiency across all operations, preserve light, heating, cooling, etc. whenever possible

8. Decent work and economic growth

Offer apprenticeship opportunities

Foster entrepreneurial culture and invest in/mentor young entrepreneurs

Install a firm policy against unfair hiring and recruitment practices

9. Industry, innovation and infrastructure

Establish standards and promote regulation that ensures company projects and initiatives are sustainably managed

Promote innovation by giving all stakeholders the opportunity to offer creative solutions to sustainability challenges

10. Reduced inequalities

Invest in business-driven poverty eradication activities (e.g., develop living wage policy)

Partner with civil society networks to provide education and entrepreneurial skills training

11. Sustainable cities and communities

Jointly develop and/or participate in a sustainable community that brings together relevant stakeholders through a common and neutral platform to jointly analyze, discuss, and act on urban functionality, resilience, and sustainable development

Support and utilize public transportation services

12. Responsible consumption and production

Reduce manufacturing impacts by substituting virgin raw materials in products with post-consumer materials through recycling and upcycling

Significantly reduce waste and ensure that any unavoidable waste is utilized to the fullest degree (e.g., organic waste as fuel or fertilizer).

13. Climate action

Retrofit the lighting systems of the company’s facilities to energy-efficient LED lighting.

Understand climate risk and build resilience into the company’s assets and supply chain.

Expand sustainable forest management through responsible sourcing practices and product substitution.

14. Life below water

Track the life cycle of products and materials to understand how they are disposed and which products could likely find their way into marine environments.

Record and disclose information on the chemical and material usage within products, packaging, and processing systems to facilitate closing the loop.

Prevent waste mismanagement or littering that could pollute the marine environment.

15. Life on land

Measure, manage, and mitigate impacts on ecosystems and natural resources.

Scale up best practices for land-use planning and management.

Commit to and implement responsible sourcing practices beyond compliance – applying environmental and social safeguards – for all raw materials and commodities.

16. Peace, justice and strong institutions

Comply with laws and seek to meet international standards; require and support business partners to do the same.

17. Partnerships for the goals

Partake in SDG-related partnerships like the UN's Make the Global Goals Local campaign, the SDG reporting initiative and locally based sustainability initiatives

Transparency and reporting

If your company is new to sustainability, focus on operating responsibly. Communicate your practices to consumers regardless of how you address this responsible operation, whether it be with the SDGs, a certification or employee initiatives.

For example, one T-shirt production company in North Carolina, tsdesigns, strives to make its supply chain as transparent as possible. President Eric Henry said that sustainability is not limited to a product or a business – it's the whole picture. For anyone curious about the company's business operations, tsdesigns offers monthly tours of the facilities to ensure transparency.

""We continue to reduce our footprint and hope that it will inspire others to do the same,"" Henry said.

Remember, the ""global goals"" are intended for all tiers of business, and each company will approach the goals differently according to their operations. It's important to first understand the goals, define priorities, integrate, and, finally, report and communicate the progress of their implementation.

Triggs-Matthews suggests that an SME should begin by creating a tiered system analyzing goals they have already positively addressed, goals that could be easily accomplished and goals that would take time and money to accomplish.

""There is no way to tell all SMEs, 'start with this…'"" she said. ""Each enterprise will need to look at the 17 goals and determine for themselves how and where their business practices fit into those goals.""","For the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be reached, ""everyone needs to do their part: governments, the private sector, civil society and people like you,"" the UN's website reads.
Given the role of small business in the global economy, it is essential to understand the potential contribution in the progression toward the sustainable development goals and why they are so important.
""I think the way for businesses to look at the UN's sustainable development goals is through the lens of business opportunity,"" said Tensie Whelan, director of NYU's Center for Sustainable Business.

Introduction

Cities in India are focal points of regional growth and development. The rapid pace of urbanisation is no longer considered ‘parasitic’, but rather ‘generative’, contributing to the growth of the national economy. The increasing wave of globalisation, particularly after the economic reforms in the country, has enhanced the pivotal role of cities in the process of development. It cannot be overemphasised that national and regional development rests largely on the competitiveness, vibrancy, efficiency and liveability of cities. At the same time, questions of sustainability, inclusiveness and equity have been raised as a reaction to globalisation-led urbanisation.[1]

The remarkable growth of cities in recent years has put tremendous pressure on their infrastructure and socio-economic resources. As a response, the concept of ‘smart city’ has evolved over the recent years—the aim is to transform the cityscape with more investment in traditional infrastructure, and by wide-ranging applications of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to “fuel sustainable economic growth and a high quality of life, with wise management of natural resources, through participatory governance”.[2] The use of ICT will enhance urban productivity and lead to more efficient urban governance.[3]

Aizawl City: An Overview

Aizawl, the administrative capital of Mizoram, is a hill city with moderate climate throughout the year. It is connected to the rest of the country by National Highway No. 44 from Guwahati via Silchar. The nearest airport is Lengpui – a two-hour drive from the city. The city has a highly dense core with multiple land-uses interspersed with uninhabitable steep slopes (Figure 1). From the core, there has been linear urbanisation in several directions along transport routes, which have severely restricted accessibility. The city is known for its vibrant culture.

Figure 1: Land Use/Land Cover Map of Aizawl City

From its establishment as a colonial military outpost in 1890 to accommodate soldiers, Aizawl has grown rapidly in the last 128 years to reach a population of more than 2.93 lakh, according to the 2011 Census (Figure 2). Socio-political turmoil in the state due to 20 years of insurgency (from 1966 to 1986) led to large-scale migration into the city. Other reasons for the rapid growth of Aizawl are availability of employment opportunities, and better amenities and infrastructural services than elsewhere in the state. At present, the city is home to 27 percent of the total population of Mizoram, though it occupies only 0.6 percent of the state’s total geographical area. The second biggest town in the state, Lunglei, which had a population comparable to Aizawl’s in pre-independence times, now has only a fifth.

Figure 2: Growth of Aizawl Population, 1961-2011

The rapid growth of Aizawl’s population has put tremendous pressure on the land, economy and physical infrastructure of the city. In the absence of a proper urban policy, the city has simply sprawled, and its inadequate infrastructure and services have barely managed to cope. The space economy of the state has been highly distorted in favour of Aizawl, with infrastructure, services and avenues for employment largely concentrated in this single city. Consequently, it attracts people and resources from other district capitals, smaller towns and villages. The lack of spatial planning has resulted in construction of buildings on steep slopes, a poor transport system, narrow roads, inadequate provision of drinking water, poor management of solid waste, lack of open spaces, insufficient pavements and parking lots, and other municipal deficiencies.

The topography and associated limited available land has encouraged intensive utilisation of useable lands. All residential areas have mixed land-use, including commercial and small-scale industrial uses. Recently, the municipal corporation took the initiative to shift production and manufacturing units out of inner city areas. There are proposals to make these ‘restricted residential areas’. Less economically competitive land-uses like green spaces, parks and playgrounds are but a fraction of the built-up space. There is little space left for construction or widening of roads. Even if this is made possible with a huge amount of outlay, it may come at the cost of immense environmental and physical degradation, and lead to frequent landslides.

Figure 3: Household Amenities, Aizawl City, 2011

Increasing migration and scarcity of affordable land have severely affected ownership of housing. Only 39.5 percent of all households are living in houses which they own (Figure 3). The increasing demand for housing has led to the proliferation of housing units on steep slopes, which are considered unsuitable for living. At the same time, vertical extension of buildings has become popular. A pattern of housing called ‘vertical differentiation’ has developed in which the rich and the poor occupy the same building – the upper floors are occupied by the better-off while the poor live in the basement.[4] Even in the wealthiest residential areas, the basements of multi-storied buildings are in slum-like condition.

It is increasingly becoming difficult to provide basic services to every household. The state has done a commendable job of providing electricity and cooking gas connections to more than 90 percent of total households. However, the supply is irregular and inadequate; water is also becoming more scarce. Strengthening institutional and infrastructural capacities to cope with increasing demand is highly needed. It is also necessary, given the threat of global warming, to increase utilisation of renewable sources of energy.

Even so, overall, the city maintains a green, harmonious and peaceful environment. It has a literacy rate of 90 percent, and its large population of educated people could yet serve as an innovative and transformative resource if provided proper skills, technologies and infrastructure. The community (including the minorities) has strong linkages through participation in organisations such as the Young Mizo Association (YMA), the Mizo Hmeichhe Insuihkhawm Pawl (MHIP), Mizo Women’s Federation/Association, and various religious organisations.

Urban Governance and Planning: the Road to a Smart City

Until 2007, the only local bodies in Aizawl city were the ‘Village Councils’ of the 76 localities within the city area. The Village Councils worked under the Local Administration Department (LAD) with minimal functions and powers. Urban planning fell under the jurisdiction of the Town and Country Planning (T&CP) Wing of the LAD. The state government enacted the Mizoram Urban and Regional Development (MURD) Act, 1990 “to make provision for the regulation of planned growth and development of urban and rural areas and regions”. Accordingly, the MURD Rules were passed in 1998. However, they have been poorly implemented.

Realising the increasing needs of the city to tackle urban problems, the state government created an Urban Development and Poverty Alleviation (UD&PA) department in 2006. The Aizawl Development Authority (ADA) was also constituted the same year under the provisions of ADA Act, 2005. With an earlier master plan for Aizawl prepared by the T&CP wing having lost its relevance, a new “Aizawl Master Plan: Vision 2030” was prepared. In 2015, however, the ADA was dissolved and subsumed under the Aizawl Municipal Council (AMC).

The formation of the AMC was rooted in the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) initiated by the Centre in 2005 to improve urban infrastructure, ensure the provision of basic services to the urban poor, and strengthen municipal finances. The creation of an urban local body was made a prerequisite to receiving JNNURM funds. Thus was enacted the Mizoram Municipalities Act 2007, which led to the formation of the AMC, Ward Committees, and the rechristening of Village Councils as Local Councils (LC) with redefined powers and functions.[5] The first election of the AMC took place in 2009.The civic status of Aizawl municipality was changed from ‘Municipal Council’ to ‘Municipal Corporation’ in 2015 when it was estimated that the population of the city had reached 300,000.

In 2009, the Asian Development Bank selected Aizawl as one of the five capitals in Northeast India to be included in its North Eastern Region Capital Cities Development Investment Programme (NERCCDIP). The programme sought to make the newly established Aizawl Municipal Council (AMC) financially self-sufficient by 2017 through reforms in governance, and management of urban amenities and infrastructural services.[6] Infrastructural development, particularly water supply, sewerage and solid waste management, were carried out by the State Investment Programme Management and Implementation Unit (SIPMIU) under the UD&PA department.

The ‘100 Smart Cities Mission’ was launched by the central government in 2015. It deliberately avoided defining a ‘smart city’, but asked each chosen city to evolve their own parameters. However, it stated that the main purpose of the mission was “to drive economic growth and improve the quality of life of people by enabling local area development and harnessing technology, especially technology that leads to smart outcomes”.[7] The main sectors suggested for applying and formulating smart solutions were water supply, sanitation, mobility, housing, energy and environment.[8] The most crucial components of the Indian smart cities mission were its Area Based Development (ABD) and pan-city components. For ABD, cities were directed to choose any area for city improvement (retrofitting), city renewal (redevelopment) or city extension (greenfield development). They were also allowed to choose a mix of these. Pan-city development, also a strategic component of ABD, envisioned the application of selected smart solutions to existing city-wide infrastructure.

The proposal submitted by Aizawl city was accepted in the third round of competition for inclusion in the ‘Smart Cities’ initiative. The vision statement of Aizawl’s Smart City Proposal (SCP) declared that the city will be an inclusive, sustainable and resilient one by leveraging its human capital through technology, and celebrating its culture and nature by focusing on resilient environment, economic sustainability, improved quality of life, improvement of basic services and strengthening of human resources. To implement these objectives, a special purpose vehicle (SPV) called ‘Aizawl Smart City Ltd (ASCL)’ has been constituted under the chairmanship of the Secretary to the Government of Mizoram, UD&PA.

Under the ABD component, the Aizawl SCP has opted for retrofitting-cum-greenfield development. The selected site for retrofitting is the core or ‘economic spine’ of the city which runs from Chaltlang to Dawrpui (including the Assam Rifles premises in the heart of the city). This core area may have been selected due to technical feasibility, need to promote tourism, and inner city redevelopment. The retrofitting proposals include opening and connecting ground floors of public and private lands in the built-up areas for ‘multiple public congregation spaces’ and enhancing accessibility; development of open spaces and walkways; and promotion of renewable sources of energy.

Inclusive City

Inclusive governance is one way to transform ‘traditional cities’ into ‘smart cities’. This is done through the provision of infrastructure and services to various sections of the population. It also ensures participation of all stakeholders in the decision-making process. Mizoram has inclusive cultural institutions such as YMA and MHIP and they are unique. Although the names of these associations include the word ‘Mizo’, membership is open to all. Since their establishment, these institutions have proven themselves to be effective channels of communication between the government and the public.

Cities tend to get divided across population groups and spaces. In Aizawl, the infrastructure and facilities are not suitable for those who are physically handicapped. The topography of the city alone severely restricts their physical movement; it has not helped any that provisions for them in building regulations and construction manuals have been sorely neglected. The Aizawl SCP gives due importance to creating smart infrastructure to enhance their accessibility to the disabled, as well as other marginalised groups. The children of Aizawl have also been forgotten in the process of development—the city has only one community park and a few small playgrounds, and they are in poor condition.

A smart city should give priority to making adequate space for people’s needs.[9] By putting more emphasis on area-based development, the Indian smart cities mission has largely failed to include the poorer sections at the urban peripheries. The state government recognised 73 slum pockets under the Rajiv Awas Yojana (RAY) scheme. Subsequently, the 2011 Census counted 26.8 percent of Aizawl’s population as living in ‘recognised slums’. These slum pockets are mostly found at the periphery of the city, on hill slopes and at valley bottoms. They occupy the least accessible, most vulnerable and unliveable spaces. It was surprising to see that the Aizawl SCP has made contradictory assertions by referring to the construction of ‘slum housing’ under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Housing for All (PMAY-HFA) scheme (which has subsumed the RAY scheme) in the city profile section, while the ‘Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) analysis section boasts that there are no defined ‘slums’ in the city.

Moreover, a number of job-seeking migrants and poorer households are found living in the basements of multi-storied buildings within the inner city core area and adjacent localities. Most of them have settled there either due to their attachment to these places or proximity to their workplaces. These basement slums have not been recognised in the SCP, and no provision has been made to improve their quality of life.

Sustainable City

Sustainability is an important component of a smart city. The Aizawl SCP also stresses the importance of sustaining economic growth through human resource development and provision of infrastructural services and amenities. It emphasises utilisation of renewable sources of energy, recycling, and efficient management of waste.

Sustainable Urban Economy

Enhancing the economic growth rate of Aizawl city is essential for the development of the state. With Mizoram lying at the periphery of a ‘globalising world’, the economy of the state, devoid of industry, has been dominated by agriculture and services. The state government is the biggest employer. Other major employment generating sectors are trade and commerce, education, health, transport and construction. All these, except construction, have been dominated by local workers. Construction is dominated by migrant labourers from Bangladesh and various parts of India.

The urban economy is dominated by the informal sector. In Aizawl, the so-called ‘invisible economy’ is where the poor find their livelihood. The Aizawl SCP, however, only mentions demarcation of vending zones for street vendors. The formal economy of the city could be enhanced by increasing its absorptive capacity and employment opportunities for the educated and skilled professional residents as well as migrants.

Tourism, meanwhile, is expected to become an important source of revenue. The state is known for its beautiful landscape and unique tribal culture – its local food, folk dances, textile, ornaments, traditions and other markers of identity. Aizawl alone receives more than 500,000 domestic tourists every year. There are thousands of travellers every day from other parts of the state and neighbouring states. However, accommodating this floating population is a challenging task.

Sustainable Resource Management

Increasing population, economic growth and conspicuous consumerism have resulted in considerable depletion of natural resources, use of non-biodegradable materials such as plastic, and emission of pollutants. There has been a decline in the number and volume of public spring waters –an important water source for the poor and the middle class. Chite Lui, the river flowing in the eastern part of Aizawl becomes a channel of waste water during the rainy season and almost dries up in the dry season. The absence of measures to regulate rivers and streams in the state has led people to encroach upon them and utilise them for commercial purposes. Conservation measures have been taken up only lately by cleaning up plastic wastes and planting trees along the Chite Lui’s course.

Sustainable development demands harnessing of flow resources. It has been estimated that the annual average availability of solar energy in Aizawl city is 4.46 KW/M2/day. If harnessed properly, this could be a good alternative source of energy. However, 99.3 percent of Aizawl’s households have reported grid electricity as their main source of lighting. The state government has already initiated a solar programme by introducing its ‘Policy for Power through Non-Conventional Energy Sources’ in 2003 and the Mizoram Solar Power Policy in 2015. Some of the most important components of the Aizawl SCP under its pan-city component are the installation of solar powered street lights, traffic lights and digital hoardings, and the construction of public toilets with solar roof tops.

The provision of adequate water supply is a challenging task in Aizawl, particularly during the dry season of November to April. Only 70 percent of Aizawl’s residents depend on piped water supply from the government. The remaining 30 percent use other sources, including springs, and wells. The per-capita water supply is 70.1 litres per day, which is far below the minimum standard of 135 litres. Transmission loss of water due to the use of obsolete materials and equipment is estimated to be as high as 50 percent. Normally, water supply pipes provide water for only one or two hours twice a week and water is stored tanks, usually on the top of buildings. During the dry season, many people buy additional water from private water carriers.

The amount of solid waste generated in Aizawl city is estimated at 160 MT per day. Of this, 38 percent is biodegradable or wet waste, while 39 percent is recyclable or dry waste. The remaining waste is inert ash and debris. The per-capita waste generation is 495 grams per day per person. Since 2009, solid waste management in Aizawl city has been carried out through the ADB-funded NERCCDIP project in public-private partnership mode, in which local councils are entrusted with collecting waste within their areas. Dry and wet waste buckets have been distributed to every household, and are collected by garbage trucks at collection points where residents bring their waste. The collected waste is disposed of at the Tuirial dumping site where it is burnt in the open. The AMC recently procured 54 especially designed dry and wet garbage trucks. A modernised solid waste resource management centre is also being constructed at the Tuirial dumping site.

Another serious issue in Aizawl is sewerage. With no existing sewerage, more than 84.5 percent of households use septic tanks. Pit latrines, connected to septic tanks, are used by 7.6 percent of households. Though septic tanks are usually two-chambered, they easily fill up because they were not constructed properly. Emptying of septic tanks has to be done manually by private agencies. In the absence of treatment facilities for the waste, collected septages are dumped on private lands along roads to be drained away by rain. The state government has purchased five cesspool cleaner vehicles under the ADB-funded NERCCDIP project, though people prefer to hire private agencies for the task.

Sullage or wastewater from kitchens and bathrooms is discharged into open drains. Only 27 percent of households have closed drainage systems while 10.3 percent have no drainage at all (Census 2011). This lack of proper drainage is considered one of the important causes of frequent landslides in the city. The Aizawl Master Plan has proposed setting up nine sewage treatment plants at different locations. One of them is being built under the ADB project near the Chite River at Bethlehem Vengthlang. It will treat household sullage and septage from public toilets, and is expected to benefit 67 percent of the population living in core city areas, which is 30 percent of the entire city population.

Safe City

Smart cities are safer cities, whether from natural hazards or issues of law and order. Aizawl is vulnerable to landslides, earthquakes, cyclones, and long-term hazards such as environmental degradation and climate change. Almost every year, heavy and continuous rains trigger landslides that cause deaths, obstruct roads, and destroy buildings and other property. With the city being located in the highest earthquake risk zone, Seismic Zone V, thousands could be killed if a major earthquake occurs. To make the city more resilient, municipal building regulations have prohibited construction of buildings on steep slopes, as well as high-rise buildings. The maximum permissible height of a building has been fixed at 22 metres. The State’s Disaster Management Authority has prepared the Mizoram State Disaster Management Plan 2011-12 as per the mandate of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The plan has formulated strategies for the prevention of landslides, monitoring and mitigation of hazards, as well as preparation for, and coordinated response to disasters such as earthquakes.

Crimes and road accidents are growing public safety issues in Aizawl. A few CCTV cameras have been installed at various strategic locations to ensure safety of residents and tourists. The Aizawl SCP has laid out plans to install more surveillance cameras and better solar powered street lights. The streets and important buildings must have a sophisticated and integrated surveillance network.

Urban Mobility

As a highly monocentric city with narrow roads, Aizawl is badly affected by the rapidly increasing volume of motorised vehicles. The absence of proper planning and the nature of the terrain are the main causes of traffic problems. Enhancing accessibility is one of the most challenging tasks for the city planners, since transportation affects the environment, employment, health, education, and security. A traffic-congested city cannot be smart, liveable, economical and secure.

Aizawl city has a high density of motor vehicles: the Census 2011 recorded 144 cars and 234 two wheelers per 1,000 households. Two-wheelers are increasingly popular because of the hill topography, narrow roads, and sprawling nature of the city that limits travelling on foot and use of bicycles. The state government introduced two-wheeler taxis in 2016 to reduce traffic congestion and facilitate mobility.

The most important route in Aizawl city runs in a north–south direction at the crest of the main ridge of the city. This route from Bawngkawn to Kulikawn (B–K route), also called the N-S Corridor, connects the most important sites of the city. Land value is the highest along this route. The Aizawl SCP proposal, however, failed to suggest ways for improvement of public transport on this corridor. Given the high population and vehicular congestion of this area, it is questionable if the proposals made under ABD components, such as development of multi-utility centres, rejuvenation of markets, and construction of housing for economically weaker section (EWS) will lead to improvements in liveability. The core city is already congested due to its centrality and narrow roads, and redevelopment of the area without widening of the existing roads may lead to even more congestion.

Parking is another issue in Aizawl, even as the state and municipal governments have initiated several measures to mitigate the problem. Non-parking areas have been delineated along important roads, and vehicles without a proper parking lot are not registered. However, effective implementation of parking rules is difficult due to the absence of regular checking and monitoring. The Aizawl SCP has tried to address the parking problem through construction of multi-level car parking lots.

Facilities for walking unhindered are an important feature of a smart city. Here, Aizawl also falls short: the city has only a few sidewalks/footpaths for pedestrians, which are found along the main roads. The spaces for potential footpaths along roads are usually used as parking lots. While a number of footpaths are recently being constructed in the inner city, steps along steep slopes need to be remodelled to make them suitable for the elderly and the disabled.

Conclusion

The future of cities depends upon their increasing use of technology, and the capability and commitment of urban managers and users. The following measures are recommended to make Aizawl smart, inclusive, sustainable, resilient and liveable:

Participatory, Open and Inclusive Governance – The ‘smart city’ concept has pushed for greater participation of smart citizens in policymaking – from planning to implementation. It also calls for better coordination and interconnection between citizens and decision-makers through social media and the Internet of Things (IoT). Devolution of more powers and functions to the ‘unique’ fourth tier of government, the Local Councils, would enhance popular participation.[10]

Smart governance is inclusive. The city should provide more spaces for children, the handicapped, pedestrians and women. Vulnerable groups could also be provided digital infrastructure to cater to their specific needs. The urban poor also deserve particular attention.

Smart Mobility –Urban mobility can be enhanced by implementing an intelligent transport system (ITS) to reduce congestion. This can be done by collecting real-time traffic data from strategic locations to monitor and evaluate traffic movement. Likewise, parking lots must be equipped with digital devices to collect data on the duration of parking time. Other possible measures could include reduction of vehicular flow during the day by shifting wholesale and hardware shops and small-scale production units out of city core areas, declaration of off-days for specific markets, and opening markets at night.

Smart Resource Management – Renewable energy – solar and water resources – could be efficiently harnessed through innovative rooftop rainwater-cum-solar harvesting systems. To improve the energy distribution system, remote-controlled smart meters could be installed to monitor allocation and leakages.

Solid waste management measures could include construction of solid waste gasification facilities, installing of GPS on garbage collection vehicles to know their exact movements, installing of underground smart bins equipped with sensors to measure the amount of garbage to increase the efficiency of collection.

The sewage treatment facility that is currently under construction will serve only 30 percent of Aizawl’s population. It is necessary to construct more facilities to serve other parts of the city. Private agencies emptying septic tanks should be regulated.

Smart Living – Provision of affordable housing to the urban poor is one of the first steps needed for smart living. Buildings should have solar-powered lighting systems and building automation systems (BAS) to enhance sustainability and liveability.

To improve the quality of education, online courses such as the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) could be introduced. Healthcare could be improved by wider use of sensors, electronic devices and smartphone applications, integrated through 3G/4G connections with health workers and medical practitioners to enable remote diagnoses, treatment and monitoring.

Urban and Regional Planning – The land use zones proposed by the city’s Master Plan should be properly implemented. Basic infrastructure such as roads, water supply, electricity, education and healthcare should be provided adequately in the peripherally located proposed land-use zones to attract private investment and skilled labourers.

The growing problems associated with increasing migration into the city need to be tackled with a regional planning and development approach.[11] The state government should be committed to strengthening administrative, educational and healthcare institutions in other district capitals and bigger towns. These should also be provided traditional and digital infrastructure to check migration to Aizawl.

The industrial estates have realised a pivotal role in the country’s development. Industrialisation, while being important for the economic growth and development of a society, can also be harmful to the environment; if not persuaded in a sustainable manner. Amongst other things, the industrial processes can accelerate climate change, level of pollution, health issues, extinction of species and many more. Industrialisation has its impacts on land resources, energy and resource consumption, atmospheric emissions etc.

In the current dynamic environment, a key challenge for urban areas is to achieve economic growth benefitting all citizens without compromising the environment and the ability of future generations to meet their needs.

Additionally, within urban development and planning practice, a little-acknowledged conflict exists between urban industrial land and overall urban development. Strategic planning and mixed land-use development are the responses, adequate to meet the challenge and resolve the conflict. For this, policymakers require a good understanding regarding which industries are the most competitive in central cities; and within these industries, which functions are most compatible with the surrounding areas’ activities. This understanding is needed for creating a robust approach to provide urban infrastructure that supports industrial estates in a manner compatible with desired residential, commercial, and service (private and public) activity.

Hence, a sustainable industrial estate is one where environmental impacts are considered during conception, planning, and setting stage. This can be defined as an earmarked area for industrial use at a suitable site, ensuring sustainability with integration of social, economic, and environmental quality aspects. In addition to safeguarding the environment, a sustainable industrial estate supports individual industries housed within the estate with high performance workplaces, to enable industries to strive for efficiency and profitability.

The Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH (GIZ)supported project on ‘Sustainable and Environment-friendly Industrial Production’ works on reducing environmental problems related to industrial waste water and waste management for which technical solutions and business/management models are developed in pilot states. The project is financed by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and is being implemented jointly with the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC). Worldwide new instruments and techniques for eco-innovation including fiscal measures are being applied, however, one innovative way is to introduce ‘Sustainability Standards’ for better planning of new and retrofitting the existing industrial areas systematically. The project has developed such ‘Sustainability Standards’ guiding the stages of planning, retrofitting, operating and managing industrial estates in a sustainable manner. So far the Gujarat Industrial Development Cooperation has already adopted the proposed standards.

These efforts offer multiple benefits: Sustainable industrial estates help mitigate climate change by reducing urban expansion pressures and by integrating low-impact infrastructure standards that can reduce long-run costs of infrastructure provision. Moreover, attractive and successful industrial estates create positive economic effects for urban community where they are located as well as for the entire region in which they are embedded. Such industrial estates can influence the regional economic development positively by initiating new supply and product chains and increased economic activities leading to job creation and prosperity for all.","The industrial estates have realised a pivotal role in the country’s development.

22 August 2018, Incheon – Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan are in advanced stages of disaster risk reduction strategy development and contributing significantly to the achievement of Target E of the Sendai Framework; to increase the number of countries with national and local disaster reduction plans.

The progress was shared at the UNISDR Global Education and Training Institute in Incheon, where Twenty-one participants from Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Mauritania, Palestine, Sudan, Tunisia and Qatar, including some Sendai Framework focal points, met to exchange their experience on approaches towards national strategy development. They were joined by officials from Afghanistan and experts from the Republic of Korea.

Participants discussed current risk trends and shared progress and approaches taken to develop their strategies and plans. Despite varying national contexts within the region, there was agreement that developing such strategies requires new and renewed coordination and partnerships across public and private sectors and stakeholders. It also requires an increased capacity to understand and make arguments for disaster risk-informed investment.

Ambassador Wahbi of the League of Arab States recalled that before the adoption of the 2011 Arab Strategy for DRR, “We had no clear concepts of disaster risks, but after, we began step one by establishing an institutional framework to cope with disaster risks. Now the League of Arab States’ mission is to put such strategies into all Arab countries. Implementing Target E by 2020 in countries and locally is a priority.”

During the workshop, the officials worked together across countries to share experience and contribute to draft DRR action plans for Algeria, Kuwait, Lebanon and Sudan.

Target E calls for an increase in the number of countries with both national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020 - a target shared with indicators for Sustainable Development Goal 1 aimed at ending poverty, Goal 11 on sustainable cities and communities, and Goal 13 on addressing climate change.

At a similar in-country workshop held in July in Kabul, a draft Afghanistan national action plan took shape and opportunities for enhanced collaboration across ministries and cooperation with partners were identified. The Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA) committed to continue developing an action plan and to update the national Road Map and develop a national strategy ahead of the 2020 deadline.

Deputy Minister M. Q. Haidari, who is the Sendai Framework focal point for Afghanistan, was invited together with his adviser and the UN-Habitat Afghanistan Project for City Resilience officers to share the country’s recent experience.

He said: “This workshop has given ANDMA an opportunity to share our National Action Plan with the countries of the Arab States region following the recent training of trainers programme conducted in Kabul…We expect that our fast track approach to developing our DRR Action Plan would provide a model for various countries in the region.”","Participants discussed current risk trends and shared progress and approaches taken to develop their strategies and plans.

203,https://balkangreenenergynews.com/nuwiels-electric-powered-bike-trailer-brings-sustainable-mobility-closer-to-your-doorstep/,"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Balkan Green Energy News,NUWIEL’s electric-powered bike trailer brings sustainable mobility closer to your doorstep,"Freight transportation in urban areas accounts for up to 21% of all CO2 emissions, while it is also responsible for noise emissions and traffic congestion. Germany’s NÜWIEL, a finalist of this year’s clim@ competition for startups organized by the Green for Growth Fund (GGF), has a solution.

NÜWIEL is a tech startup from Hamburg founded by Natalia Tomiyama, Fahad Khan, and Sandro Rabbiosi with a vision to free cities from unnecessary car use, noise, and air pollution. To achieve this, NÜWIEL developed an electrically powered bike trailer for cargo transportation in urban areas.

Freight transportation responsible for 21% of all CO2 emissions

With urbanization and increasing digitalization, more people will be living in cities and more things will be ordered online and delivered to our homes. Today, urban freight mobility already accounts for up to 21% of all CO2 emissions.

This is not only significantly contributing to climate change, but is also negatively affecting public health, with up to 70% of carcinogenic and other dangerous air pollution caused by traffic emissions.

Intelligent electric bike trailer

NÜWIEL is addressing the need for safe and convenient sustainable mobility solutions in urban areas. The startup has developed an intelligent electric bike trailer – the patented technology enables the trailer to accelerate, decelerate, and brake automatically with the bike. A cyclist doesn’t have to make any additional effort and yet can carry 150kg without noticing it. The trailer can be connected to any bike, electric bike, and even a cargo-bike within a second. Disconnected from a bike, it can be used as an electric handcart indoors and in pedestrian areas.

The trailer has been successfully tested by various package delivery companies, as well as with Europe’s first urban IKEA store in Hamburg.

Helping achieve the UN SDGs G11, G13, and G3

The European Commission has set a goal to achieve CO2 free city logistics in major urban centers by 2030. NÜWIEL aims to contribute to the achievement of this goal by offering market-ready and scalable clean mobility solutions.

The startup’s ultimate goal is to reduce traffic congestion by 30% and air pollution by 40%, to decrease number of people suffering from noise pollution by 10%, and to improve the quality of life for many people in the EU and worldwide.

NÜWIEL directly contributes to achieving the following UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Sustainable Cities and Communities (G11), Climate Action (G13), and Good Health and Well-Being (G3).

Today NÜWIEL works with logistics and retail companies, while it also seeks to make the NÜWIEL-trailer accessible to private users in the future. This is particularly important in view of the fact that even one NÜWIEL-trailer running 72km a day substitutes 6,300 km of car use and results in avoiding up to 2,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year.

Impact

The NÜWIEL-trailer enables package delivery companies and retailers, as well as private users, to move anything by bike and contributes to more sustainable and resilient cities.

Natalia Tomiyama, co-founder of NÜWIEL

We are extremely grateful to the Green for Growth Fund and Finance in Motion for raising awareness on climate change and recognizing NÜWIEL as one of the solutions to mitigate it.

We won third place at the clim@ competition entered by 260 startups from around the world. Most importantly, the competition gave us an opportunity to present our solution to an international audience, get to know 19 outstanding startups fighting climate change, and expand our network of potential partners to the Middle East and Africa.

We wish all the other startups the best of luck in their endeavors and thank the organizers, sponsors and pitch trainers of the first clim@ competition.

204,https://sustainablebrands.com/read/waste-not/thread-forges-better-backpack-with-most-responsible-fabric-on-the-planet,"Wed, 08 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Sustainable Brands,Thread Forges 'Better Backpack' with 'Most Responsible Fabric on the Planet',"Thread, the Pittsburgh-based startup that's collected over 41 million plastic bottles from landfill communities in Haiti and Honduras and created fabric for some of the world's leading brands, today launched its own product on Kickstarter with a first-of-its-kind bag — the Better Backpack.

""There are a couple of items in our closets that we use every single day,"" said Thread founder and CEO Ian Rosenberger. ""We believe those items should fit us at every moment without costing an arm and a leg. We've worked hard to make sure that our first product — the Better Backpack — is an upgrade for everybody out there trying to 'adult' but that aren't able take their backpack into that big meeting and on a date, or have to carry two and sometimes three bags just to make sure the day works.""

Rosenberger started Thread in an effort to help with the immense amount of plastic waste and dearth of jobs he saw after traveling in Haiti and the Caribbean — the company has since sold over $3M worth of its signature fabrics to brands including Timberland, Reebok and Marmot looking to incorporate recycled materials into their product assortments; and partnered with companies such as HP, Inc to provide education and jobs to its recyclers in Haiti.

Over four years, the Thread team has worked to develop a canvas that wears and feels like cotton, but with the performance characteristics and durability of polyester. The Better Backpack continues to make use of the planet's enormous glut of plastic bottle waste in the form of a versatile lifestyle bag designed to fit the wearer throughout every part of their week. With the help of a variety of “old retail” industry veterans, Thread improved and simplified the product design, including adding neoprene compartments within the bags that keep items such as gym clothes, lunch or even a bottle of wine safe and separate from the rest of the items you use every day.

""We’re proud of the impact we’ve had, and will continue to make our fabrics available to brands who want to choose better materials. However, we think there is an even bigger opportunity to create high-quality items for the work week made entirely of the incredible excess resources that end up in landfills and the ocean,"" said Kelsey Halling, Thread’s Director of Partnerships.

The company envisions designing all work-week essentials in a better way — with a focus on the more inventive use of recycled materials.

Thread is a certified B Corp and a Public Benefit Corporation, and scores in the top 10 percent of B Corps globally on its governance and incorporation of the world's waste into its products. These efforts attracted a group of well-known investors to raise over $2.7 million in a financing round led by Draper Triangle Ventures. Thread has plans to continue to innovate other elements of the modern wardrobe in the future, all with the same focus on clean, simple design; top-notch craftsmanship; and a focus on recycled materials that help put people back to work.

The Better Backpack launches today on Kickstarter in a range of colors for both men and women. The campaign will run until September 19.","Thread, the Pittsburgh-based startup that's collected over 41 million plastic bottles from landfill communities in Haiti and Honduras and created fabric for some of the world's leading brands, today launched its own product on Kickstarter with a first-of-its-kind bag — the Better Backpack.

205,https://sustainablebrands.com/read/press-release/three-sustainability-trends-reshaping-the-food-packaging-industry,"Wed, 29 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Sustainable Brands,Three Sustainability Trends Reshaping the Food Packaging Industry,"Accelerating demands for sustainable products and responsible corporate behavior are reshaping the food, beverage and restaurant industries – and with them the food packaging industry. Think plastic straws, which no longer stir the drink for a wide range of leading organizations including Starbucks, Hilton and American Airlines.

Consumer expectations are one driver. As early as 2014, a Horizon Media study found 81% of millennials expect companies to make public commitments to good corporate citizenship. And 66% of consumers at large will pay more for products from brands committed to environmentally friendly practices, according to the Nielsen Global Corporate Sustainability Report. So sustainability is good business, too.

A swelling wave of legislation is also mandating sustainable actions, worldwide. Seattle has been ahead of the curve, going back to its 2009 ban on Styrofoam and 2010 requirement for food service items to be recyclable or compostable, and for restaurants to have composting and recycling bins.

All this public and private sector momentum – highlighted in the three sustainability trends below – is creating openings for innovative food packaging products and thinking.

1. Corporate leaders are embracing sustainable food and beverage packaging

A key food packaging trend in 2018 has been toward recycled and recyclable materials, partly in response to stunning media reports of waste plastic, notably the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (three times the size of France).

Beyond plastics, leading beverage and restaurant brands have answered the call and announced major sustainability-oriented commitments in 2018. The trend-setters include:

These actions have pleased everyday consumers as well as committed environmentalists, and will have trickle-down effects, encouraging other companies to follow.

2. Governments are not only banning plastic, but mandating recycling and reusable materials

California was the trend-setter, finally initiating a ban on plastic bags from major retail stores after the November 2016 elections. Dozens of North American cities have followed suit. In the United States, during the 2017-18 legislative season, more than 70 bills have been introduced in state legislatures regarding plastic bags, encompassing bans, fees and recycling programs.

In Australia, national, state and territory environment ministers have agreed on an admirable target: 100% of Australian packaging is to be recyclable, compostable or reusable by 2025. This is only a few short years away, and a major opportunity for the food packaging industry.

Vancouver, the first major Canadian city to ban plastic straws (effective 2019), has also adopted a ban on the distribution of polystyrene foam cups and containers in that year – so users of food packaging are looking for sustainable solutions, now. Vancouver also adopted restrictions on disposable cups and plastic shopping bags. And the city aims to completely eliminate the disposal of solid waste by 2040.

The worldwide trend is clear on the legislative front: Less in the way of plastics and single use materials, more in the way of recycling and sustainable food packaging.

3. Innovative and sustainable food packaging is creating new solutions

Innovative recycled and recyclable food packaging materials are emerging as sustainable alternatives to plastics, Styrofoam and other environmentally-unfriendly materials. A few notable examples:

Ecologic paper bottles, made from recycled corrugated cardboard and newspapers, and already popular for products like wine, pet food and protein powders, are now being used by L’Oréal USA in a new line of body-care products called Seed Phytonutrients.

TemperPack supplies Plated, one of the leaders in the fast-growing meal kit industry, with insulated packaging made from jute and material recycled from burlap bags. It keeps perishables chilled during shipping, and after use it is compostable.

USDA researchers have developed an edible, biodegradable packaging film made of casein — a milk protein — that can be wrapped around food (e.g. meat, bread, and cheese) to prevent spoilage. A sustainable alternative to plastic film!

Sustana is on the side of innovation with our unique food packaging product, EnviroLife, made from recycled fiber. It is the only 100% post-consumer recycled fiber that is FDA-compliant for direct food contact under all conditions of use, allowing food service brands to serve customers with environmentally-friendly paper cups and meal boxes. Post-consumer fiber is inherently sustainable, eliminating the resource utilization and environmental impacts related to forestry (which benefits biodiversity) and to landfilling.

EnviroLife is also certified by the Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC), making it one of many Sustana products which meet the FSC’s strict environmental and social standards.

Conclusion

Consumers everywhere are increasingly looking to companies and brands to take the lead on environmental issues. And, as outlined above, the broad legislative trend toward bans and restrictions on unsustainable materials is encouraging adoption of sustainable materials and practices.

For the food, beverage and restaurant industries, environmentally-friendly post-consumer recycled products like Sustana’s EnviroLife reduce environmental impact and contribute to the development of a truly sustainable economy, aligned with the above trends.

206,https://www.eco-business.com/news/an-indigenous-village-navigates-its-sustainable-ecotourism-success/,"Tue, 07 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",eco-business.com,An indigenous village navigates its sustainable ecotourism success,"Reaching the village of Wae Rebo on Indonesia’s Flores Island requires a seven-hour drive down rugged jungle roads from the port town of Labuan Bajo. At the edge of the village of Kombo, motorcycle taxis whiz tourists to a trailhead, where they hike three hours up to a mountain. Passing stunning views of the jungle valley and the ocean and leading travellers over a bamboo bridge, the trail meanders through a forest interspersed with ripening coffee trees. Finally, it gives way to a stunning sight: the village of Wae Rebo. Nestled into a mountain valley 1,100 meters (3,600 feet) above sea level, its seven conical houses are tipped with mist from passing clouds.

While the journey may sound challenging, it doesn’t dissuade an average of 50 tourists from making it every day. Arriving anywhere from the late morning until the late evening, visitors from all over the world sleep on simple woven mats in the five-story-tall cone-shaped “drum houses,” called mbaru niangin the Tombo Manggarai language. They are free to explore the village grounds and chat with locals before sitting down to a traditional dinner, all for the equivalent of about $24 a night.

The village of 1,200 inhabitants began its dalliance with ecotourism in 2007 and by 2016 it was already recording 6,000 annual visitors. The rapid tourism growth is almost as spectacular as the locals’ apparent acceptance of it, considering that the first recorded outsider to visit came just three decades ago, in 1984. As its popularity as a destination grows, there are concerns that the community’s traditions and way of life could be sacrificed in the process, as can happen when an influx of tourists enters a small community.

The International Ecotourism Society defines ecotourism as “Responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment and improves the well-being of local people.”

Ecotourism offers an alternative to mass tourism that can help locals prosper financially while fostering intercultural exchange. Tourism is a major industry in Indonesia; the island of Bali, for example, hosted more than 5 million tourists last year. Based on Bali’s success, in 2017 President Joko Widodo presented a “10 New Balis” plan to increase tourism around the country. The main city on Flores Island, Labuan Bajo, is among the 10 sites, meaning tourism to Wae Rebo, its closest ecotourism village, will likely continue to increase.

Ecotourism can allow communities to generate income without relying on natural resource extraction, which can harm the environment if overdone. In Wae Rebo, agriculture and ecotourism work side by side.

Residents of the village have traditionally relied on coffee production as a primary source of income. They harvest and process the crop, before carrying it on their backs down the mountain to nearby markets. But with unpredictable weather in recent years, the harvest wasn’t enough to keep the community afloat. In the early 2000s, Martin Anggu, a Manggarai local who now runs a guesthouse in the nearby village of Denge, approached Indonesian ecotourism NGO Indecon with the idea of patching up Wae Rebo’s two ailing drum houses and building five new ones, introducing ecotourism in the process.

“He told me the community was quite frustrated with the economic situation because their agriculture isn’t really enough to support them,” Indecon’s Ary S. Suhandi, who has worked with the village from the outset, told Mongabay.

A series of high-level meetings followed in Jakarta, and eventually Jakarta-based architect Yori Antar took on the building component of the project. With input from locals, his team built five new drum houses with funding from private donors, including French water company Danone. In 2012, the village received a UNESCO Cultural Heritage award, further putting it on the map.

Indecon, which had already helped nine other villages in Flores introduce ecotourism, guided the villagers through the process at the beginning and offered counsel when they requested it. The mountain path was made more accessible, Indecon offered tourism-management lessons, and the villagers set up working groups to cook meals for tourists, maintain the grounds, and continue with agricultural activities.

“We never wanted tourism to take [the] place of agriculture; they have to go hand in hand,” said Suhandi. His team also focused on a slow tourism growth model for Wae Rebo: “We realise that if business is too booming, it will backfire for the culture.” Today, Indecon advises on ecotourism operations and a small council of Wae Rebo residents controls the revenue from tourism, as they have done from the beginning.

That the village was groomed for ecotourism does not seem to bother many of the inhabitants, including Kassius Manie, a 26-year-old from Wae Rebo who is one of several people responsible for managing tourists.

“The old houses were not good enough to live in and rebuilding them is so expensive, so we were lucky when some organizations and Indonesian architects came here and said ‘this is perfect for ecotourism,’” he told Mongabay. “We needed some help from people and at that time, people came to help us. It’s a lucky place.”

The drum houses are undeniably unique. Made of palm thatch, the 15-meter-high (50-foot) buildings are each home to six to eight families who live side by side, as they have done for centuries, in small adjacent rooms separated by curtains for privacy.

Families share the large hearth built into the centre of the floor, and sacred drums hang above it—the medium to communicate with the ancestral spirits. Each house has five floors, each with a specific purpose. The second floor, for instance, is used to store food and supplies, and the fifth is reserved for offerings to the spirits. Two houses in the village have been designated specifically for tourists.

During an early Sunday afternoon visit, the village was unusually quiet. Many of the residents live between Wae Rebo and its sister village of Kombo at the base of the mountain, where schools and other facilities are located. On this particular day, there was a school celebration and most people had travelled down to attend it.

Sitting under the scorching sun in a traditional Manggarai sarong paired with a faded red T-shirt, middle-aged villager Lodovikus Damput said tourism had benefitted Wae Rebo. “It’s had so many positive effects on the community. We used to have simple wooden homes before and now we have only a few houses that are not in very good condition,” said Damput. Villagers who do not live in the drum houses reside in basic homes financed by ecotourism revenue.

The money generated from tourism means the community can rely less on government support and send their children to school, added Damput’s friend, Kobus Lori Bai.

In addition to the fee for a one-night stay, tourists also contribute a small symbolic amount—$1 or $2—during the welcome ceremony given by “Papa” Alex, the 90-year-old village chief, who gives a prayer to the spirits of the ancestors when each visitor arrives. All the revenue goes into the fund managed by community members, who put it toward maintaining the houses and grounds, funding children’s education through university, building new houses in Kombo and maintaining a pension for the elderly.

We are at a crossroads. If we are to address climate change, let alone our broader sustainability challenges, we need significant disruptive innovation across a wide-number of sectors.

Will we be able to energize our innovation ecosystem to create the disruptive, sustainable technologies we need? Will we create the conditions under which sustainable innovations can flourish?

Our book is about how we may collectively catalyze business and markets to innovate sustainable technologies. We adopt a systems perspective, arguing that social sector leaders of all types—nonprofit leaders, policymakers, academics, business leaders, entrepreneurs—all play a role. There is no simply solution. Thus, this book is for everyone. We discuss how the innovation system works and provide specific suggestions on the levers available to each stakeholder to drive sustainable innovation.

Given the current political climate, it would be understandable to lose faith in our ability to address our sustainability challenges. We remain optimistic, however. Sustainable disruption is occurring across the economy even with the US federal government actively working to revive dying old technologies. Social sector leadership is critical to continue the path towards future technologies that drive economic growth, create jobs, and help secure a sustainable future. Working together, we can catalyze innovation in sustainable technologies. —Michael Lenox and Aaron Chatterji

The Innovation Imperative

Many scientists, policymakers, and business leaders argue that to address our sustainability challenges requires innovation on a massive scale. Simple calls to “cease and desist”—to stop engaging in activities that have negative environmental consequences—are neither realistic economically nor likely sufficient to drive us toward sustainability. Similarly, calls to simply reduce consumption, while sensible, are like the proverbial little Dutch boy holding back the floods by putting his finger in the dike. People will continue to demand products and services, and producers will provide them. Any reduction in per-person consumption needs to more than compensate for the increasing number of people in the world to reduce net impact. Absent wholesale changes in worldwide attitudes and consumption patterns, we need entirely new products, services, business models, and production processes that simultaneously create value to humans while minimizing, or even ameliorating, environmental impacts.

To illustrate this point, consider global climate change. An influential study by the Princeton Environmental Institute estimates that in order to keep carbon emissions flat over the next fifty years, we will need to trim our projected carbon output by roughly eight billion tons per year by 2060. The study’s authors identify fifteen strategies to achieve these reductions, from wind, solar, and nuclear energy to energy efficiency and carbon capture. Importantly, they observe that no one strategy is sufficient. The upshot is that we must simultaneously innovate across multiple technologies and adopt multiple approaches if we have any hope of meeting this goal.

Some argue that we already have the technology necessary to address our sustainable challenges. Renewable energy is gaining momentum and, as a result, is starting to compete with fossil fuels. According to the REN21 Global Status Report, renewable sources provided 19 percent of global energy output in 2014. Organic farming techniques demonstrate the viability of agriculture that does not overly rely on irrigation and fertilizers. Tesla and the introduction of electric vehicles by the likes of BMW and Nissan demonstrate that alternatives to gasoline-powered automobiles are viable. The technology exists, the argument goes; what we lack is the will to adopt.

We disagree. Technology cannot be considered in isolation from the broader socioeconomic system in which it is embedded. Innovation is not just invention—defined as the creation of something new. Innovation is the marriage of invention and commercialization. For an innovation to be viable, it must create value for individuals who are ultimately willing to subsidize the development, installation, and scaling of a new technology. Solar cells and wind turbines are wonderful technologies. Innovation has helped improve their efficiency and lower the cost of their manufacturing—as much as 200% in the case of solar cells from 2010 to 2015. This in turn has attracted investment and helped spread adoption. But it has not reached its potential or fully captured the hearts and minds of the public. What future can we predict for renewable energy if significant innovation in the use of fossil fuels keeps pace with renewable technologies? Consider July 11, 2008. The price of oil hit $147 per barrel. As many worried about the impact of high oil prices on economic growth; others quietly celebrated the creation of an opportunity. Now was the time for renewables—solar, wind, biomass—to significantly shift our energy portfolio. Investment in green technology surged. Numerous renewable energy start-ups emerged, and, in the United States alone, investments in green tech start-ups reached a high of more than $7 billion in 2008.

Fast forward five years. The price of oil dropped to $50 per barrel. Innovation in the energy sector has flourished—just not in the way that technology optimists had predicted. Advances in hydraulic fracking and horizontal drilling had lowered the costs of extracting oil and gas from regions previously left fallow. In the United States, an energy renaissance was under way. It was looking like the country would achieve energy independence by 2017. By January 2015, the price of gasoline in the United States was under $2 per gallon. The price of natural gas had plummeted to $3 per million Btus (British thermal units). Despite gains in solar technology, energy produced by natural gas power plants continued to be more cost effective. Projections released in the 2015 US Energy Information Administration (EIA) Annual Energy Outlook show the cost of electricity produced at a conventional combined-cycle natural gas plant ($/MWh [megawatt-hour])—put into service by 2020—will be on average 35 percent lower than that produced at a utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) installation (65 percent without tax credits). Venture capital investment has consistently dropped since 2008, down to $2 billion in the United States by 2014.

What went wrong (or right, depending on your perspective)? We argue that the success of an innovation is ultimately judged by the value it creates for some end user. Investment and adoption in renewable energy depend on a myriad of factors, including advancements in competing, mainstay technologies, specifically natural gas and oil. That brings us back to markets. Love them or hate them, markets are the way that most innovations express their value. As every entrepreneur knows, a new product or service is judged by the willingness of others to pay for her goods at a price that exceeds the entrepreneur’s cost to produce them. Thinking about it this way casts innovation in a different light. The innovation imperative is to drive up the efficiency and drive down the cost of renewable energy to compete with fossil fuels. This goal can be achieved by improving the underlying technology—such as PV cells—or by innovating around any number of complementary technologies such as energy storage solutions (batteries), electrical distribution (smart grid technology), or business models (financing for residential adopters of solar panels).

The same innovation imperative exists for numerous other “sustainable” technologies: energy-efficient computing and electronics, low- or no-emission vehicles, green buildings and supplies. We define sustainable technologies as those products, services, business models, and production processes that reduce the environmental impact of these goods relative to other existing technologies. A sustainable technology in and of itself does not guarantee sustainability; rather, it promises to reduce the unsustainability of existing technologies. By continuously innovating new sustainable technologies, however, we can reduce unsustainable practices such as natural resource depletion and environmental degradation and increase the prospects for future generations to flourish….

Our Argument

Value-laden pleas about what businesses should or could do cannot help us understand what they will do. Similarly, blind faith that markets will “figure things out” ignores the broader institutional context and the imperfections of markets. Economists are often cited for their advocacy of free markets, but they have also long pointed out the potential for market failures. Pollution is a classic example of one such failure, what is referred to as a negative externality—where individual efforts create a negative by-product that causes many to suffer. Many of our environmental resources are common pool resources—goods for which one individual’s consumption reduces the availability to others, while the collective finds it difficult to exclude individuals from the pool or users or reduce consumption. Fisheries and shared rivers are common examples.

Ultimately, the extent to which businesses will innovate disruptive, sustainable technologies is determined by a complex interplay between markets and various institutional actors: innovators who champion new sustainable technologies, investors who see market opportunities in these sustainable technologies, executives who steer large organizations toward profitable and sustainable opportunities, customers who are willing to pay for these sustainable technologies, activists who pressure businesses to invest in green innovation, and governments who incentivize new sustainable technologies through regulation, taxes, and other policy levers. Each of these players influences the degree to which businesses invest in and develop sustainable technologies.

We propose a model of innovation as a system (see Figure 1). At the core is the process of innovation; the steps by which a concept is advanced into a viable product or service that disrupts existing markets or creates new markets. There are many ways of characterizing this process, but we suggest a simple four-step process from research to development to commercialization to scaling and diffusion. Each step is part of a critical path toward disruption. Not every concept will eventually scale and diffuse. In fact, most will not. The innovation process is as much a process by which concepts and technologies are winnowed with a few winners emerging in the end. Innovation is sometimes characterized as a funnel where thousands, if not millions, of ideas enter with only a handful exiting the funnel as disruptive technologies in the end.

Buffering the innovation process are two attractors: factors that help motivate action in the process. One attractor is the demand side of innovation. The demand side, or “demand pull,” refers to the market incentives to innovate created by the demand for goods and technology. In other words, demand pulls the technology through the innovation process. For example, consumers can create demand pull by desiring environmentally friendly products and services. Or government can create demand pull for sustainable goods through taxes or subsidies. Or other businesses can create demand pull by demanding improvements from their suppliers, perhaps to mitigate their own risks and to avoid the ire of environmental activists.

The second attractor is the supply side of innovation, or what is often referred to as “technology push.” Technology push refers to the support that is needed to drive innovation. What if innovation is not a simple Pavlovian response to a market stimulus but emerges from the genius of the innovator? This is the heart of the idea of technology push: scientists, engineers, and designers pushing the boundaries of technology and creating new goods and services that transform markets. Innovators require capital to invest in research and development and to help bring their products and services to market. Innovation arises out of a rich tapestry— what is often referred to as the innovation or entrepreneurial ecosystem. Technology push includes those resources that make up the innovation ecosystem that supports the innovation process.

Scholars have long debated the relative importance of technology push versus demand pull in driving innovation. Not surprisingly, the evidence suggests that both are critical. A broad blossoming of new technology incubators and venture funds directed to sustainable technologies will have limited impact if those technologies do not ultimately create value that is demanded in the marketplace. Similarly, the creation of market incentives—say, the creation of a carbon tax—will not lead to fundamental disruption unless there is an underlying support system to create the conditions under which innovation can flourish. Both technology push and demand pull are needed.

Surrounding our attractors are a broad set of public interveners and private intermediaries that impact the degree to which technology push and demand pull drive the innovation process. Markets are driven by a number of actors, including innovators, entrepreneurs, established businesses, suppliers, employees, investors, and consumers. Furthermore, markets do not operate in isolation. They are embedded in a broad sociopolitical system that enables and constrains their functioning. Thus, activists and NGOs, regulators and policy makers, lobbyists and legislators, global trade organizations and industry trade associations, universities and national laboratories all play a role. In concert, these market and non-market players create the conditions under which innovations either flourish or languish.","Michael Lenox and Aaron Chatterji 200 pages, Stanford Business Books, 2018 Buy the book »We are at a crossroads.

208,https://www.environmentalleader.com/2018/08/investors-demand-better-standards-for-sustainable-palm-oil-certification/,"Fri, 17 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Environmental Leader,Investors Demand Better Standards for Sustainable Palm Oil Certification,"Institutional investors, increasingly concerned about the risks of deforestation on their investment portfolios, have called for stronger provisions for certifying the sustainable production of palm oil. More than 90 investors, representing more than $6.7 trillion in assets under management, sent a letter to the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) to strengthen its draft standards for certifying palm oil so as to include more robust protections for peat lands, high carbon stock forests and labor concerns.

The RSPO is the multi-stakeholder sustainability certification body for the palm oil industry, tasked with providing assurance that palm oil has been produced sustainably.

Companies need assurance that their palm oil supplies are deforestation-free. Without that, their businesses are vulnerable to reputation and market risks, explains Julie Nash, director of food and capital markets at Ceres, the nonprofit organization that coordinated the letter.

Rapid expansion of the $37 billion palm oil industry has contributed to the destruction of rainforests, drainage of carbon-rich peatlands, and land conflicts with local communities. Palm production continues to be a leading driver of deforestation, which causes 10% of global GHG emissions. In fact, new data from the University of Maryland indicates that last year was the second-worst on record for tropical tree cover loss.

Investors Increase Focus on Sustainability

As Environmental Leader has reported several times over the last year, investors are increasingly demanding that companies commit to — and report on — environmental, social and governance (ESG) efforts. In fact, investors say that ESG profiles have become a key driver of their decision-making, according to a report from S&P Global published last fall.

The report also found that nearly all (95%) of respondents plan to engage with companies they invest in about issues related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

But Palm Oil Certification Is Far from Simple

With palm oil found in nearly 50% of all packaged goods, sustainable sourcing of the ingredient is vital to reducing environmental risks for manufacturers as well as for investors. In many regions, oil palm cultivation has caused – and continues to cause – deforestation. Additionally, some palm oil plantations were developed without consulting local communities over the use of their land, and others have been responsible for forcibly displacing people from their land. Violations of workers’ rights to fair payment and safe working conditions and other malpractices have also occurred.

But ensuring that the product has been sourced sustainably is a challenge. The palm oil supply chain is long and complex. In order to develop environmental and social criteria for sustainable palm oil, the RSPO must pull together stakeholders from seven sectors: oil palm producers, processors or traders, consumer goods manufacturers, retailers, banks/investors, and environmental and social non-governmental organizations.

Today, just 19% of the world’s palm oil is RSPO certified. But despite widely-reported malpractices in the industry, a growing number of players in the palm oil industry have committed to adopting more sustainable practices. “The result of this gradual transition is an increasing amount of palm oil in our products that has been produced and sourced in a sustainable manner,” the RSPO says.

The RSPO has more than 3,000 members worldwide who represent all links along the palm oil supply chain. They have committed to produce, source and/or use sustainable palm oil certified by the RSPO.","The RSPO is the multi-stakeholder sustainability certification body for the palm oil industry, tasked with providing assurance that palm oil has been produced sustainably.

211,https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/mexico-needs-more-responsible-sustainable-tourism/,"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Mexico News Daily,"Mexico needs more responsible, sustainable tourism","A high-level federal environment official and an academic have called on government and other stakeholders to make Mexico’s tourism industry more responsible and sustainable.

Lucía Ruiz, a strategy director at the Natural Protected Areas Commission (Conanp), told the newspaper Milenio that rules need to be put in place to avoid “overcrowding” and the consequent environmental damage of popular tourist destinations.

The Marieta Islands National Park, off the coast of Nayarit, is one example of a destination where an overload of visitors triggered concerns over environmental damage.

Conanp closed the park for three months in 2016 and later limited access to 116 people per day and increased entrance costs, which Ruiz said had “the aim of avoiding the collapse of the area’s attractions.”

She added that communities that depend on tourism along with the government and visitors need to work together towards achieving “responsible tourism that allows attractions to be protected and, at the same time, for locals’ lives to improve.”

The need to better protect Mexico’s natural treasures is emphasized by a 2017 report issued by the World Bank, which ranked Mexico second for quantifiable natural resources but 116th of 136 countries for environmental sustainability.

The increasing number of international tourists coming to Mexico — making the country the sixth most visited in the world — is also placing extra strain on the environment.

Francisco Madrid Flores, director of the School of Tourism at the Anáhuac University, said the challenge Mexico faces is to make that growth sustainable.

“. . . Mexico has the possibility to do more for sustainability . . . There are real instruments in the General Tourism Law of 2009, with two explicit chapters about sustainable tourism. One has to do with tourism legislation . . . and the other is related to sustainable tourism development zones,” he said.

Madrid, who is also a former federal tourism (Sectur) official, added that federal, state and municipal authorities need to work together to establish criteria for sustainable tourism development using a model similar to that in place for archaeological zones and natural protected areas.

Doing that, he said, would be “conducive to more orderly growth” and limit the power of municipalities to grant land use authorizations that are harmful to the environment.

Madrid also said that he believed that Sectur should declare a “moratorium on the construction of [new] accommodations until housing and public services needs have been met.”

Federal Tourism Secretary Enrique de la Madrid has cited both Los Cabos in Baja California Sur and Tulum in Quintana Roo as destinations where tourism development has advanced quickly but infrastructure for local residents hasn’t kept pace.

He blamed municipal authorities for lacking long-term vision and said that federal intervention is needed.

De la Madrid also said that sustainable tourism should be based on three principles: respect for the environment, profitability and improving the lives of local residents of tourism-oriented communities.

Sectur is currently working in conjunction with the federal secretariats of Environment, Interior and Finance as well as Conanp and state and municipal governments to establish sustainable policies for all of the country’s tourism destinations.

Teresa Solís Trejo, a Sectur undersecretary, said – the aim is to establish a “legal framework” that protects the environment and promotes “programs, strategies and actions against climate change.”

She also said that strict regulation of tourism projects which guarantees sustainable development is also a priority for the federal government.

MORE’s (D-Mass.) Accountable Capitalism Act is an ally rather than an obstacle.

Over the past few years, investors have already begun to act as if they understand the importance of a broader set of interests beyond short-term financial returns.

Warren’s bill has brought these issues to the fore more so than any moment since Larry Fink’s annual letter to shareholders. Will investors’ momentum and analysis be sufficient to tame unbridled capitalism, or would they benefit from the legislative nudge (or shove) she proposes?

A review of a decade of progress in ESG investing suggests a need for policy change such as Warren espouses.

A decade ago, ESG investors focused on values and developed lists of “exclusions” (i.e., companies or products that they would avoid on ethical or moral grounds).

At best, such strategies sacrificed only minor returns and allowed socially conscious investors to sleep better at night knowing their portfolios did not include munitions manufacturers, tobacco growers or private prison operators accused of human rights violations.

Subsequently, a small group of long-term investors began to identify governance, environmental or social issues neglected by management in large corporations and actively partnered with big firms to address these issues and the material risks they posed to shareholders.

For the narrow set of companies engaged by these investors, evidence of positive financial returns began to emerge.

Efforts to expand this strategy beyond a few hundred firms have foundered on the lack of credible data by which to assess what ESG risks are material for what firms and how they could best be measured. Most ESG data was disclosed voluntarily in sustainability reports or in response to surveys.

Not surprisingly, companies chose to disclose obfuscating data related to material risks and showcased data that put them in good light. Bloomberg reports that only 29 percent of investors are confident in the ESG data they receive and Ernst & Young reports that confidence is falling rapidly.

There are multiple reasons for this dissatisfaction. At the core, however, is the black box nature of each data provider’s methodology. What variables should I consider? With what weights? How do I manage missing data?

Each data provider makes their own choices and these differences lead to wildly different rankings for the same firm from different data providers. As compared to a 0.9 correlation among credit rating agencies, correlations among providers of ESG data are typically below 0.6 and, for S scores, as low as 0.05.

This gives rise to a legitimate concern that any link between ESG performance and financial performance could have more to do with strategic choices on information disclosure by firms or short-to-medium-term industry-specific returns rather than actual variation in firm-level ESG performance.

This gap between the demand and interest in ESG and the supply of reliable data necessary to build a diverse portfolio of companies taking into account ESG risks has triggered innovation and competition among data providers.

Recent advances in automating the collection and coding of news clippings, social media posts, government regulatory filings and other data sources using big data approaches and artificial intelligence to sift signal from noise have markedly improved the reliability, objectivity and coverage of ESG data.

It starts by giving workers at big companies the right to select 40 percent of the company's board members. pic.twitter.com/SzTsiqMkAC — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) August 16, 2018

A growing body of evidence highlights that portfolios that draw upon more accurate data substantially outperform benchmarks. The data reveals great opportunity:

Independent research by, among others, Harvard Business School’s George Serafeim and his co-authors, show that portfolios of high performing ESG firms outperform benchmarks.

Research by London Business School’s Alex Edmans shows as high as a 4 percent per annum return to investing in firms within an industry with above average employee satisfaction;

Euler Hermes, Breckenridge Capital and Calvert Research and Management independently report a significant negative correlation between credit market spreads and ESG scores highlighting that better management of ESG risks is correlated with lower risk and more stable return profiles;

MSCI reports that firms in the bottom quintile of ESG performance are twice as likely to suffer a catastrophic loss within three years as their peers.

The same tools can be used to identify risks of individual companies. For instance:

Equifax received the lowest ranking from MSCI and was rated as an underperformer by Sustainalytics for their management of cyber risk months before the catastrophic data breach.

Snap substantially underperformed its industry peers for over a year on diversity, human rights and data security and privacy in TruValue Labs data prior to the May 2018 collapse of its stock price in response to claims of rampant sexism and a toxic work environment.

3M lagged its industry peers in TruValue Labs data since 2016 due to repeated stories regarding water pollution in Minnesota, but the stock price only dipped in February 2018 with the announcement of an $850 million settlement to the $5 billion lawsuit.

While we are still in a period of ferment, ESG factors have entered the mainstream of the investment calculus. Firms that demonstrate an understanding of the potential risks and opportunities posed by environmental, social and governance factors are both less likely to experience catastrophic loss and more likely to generate sustainable financial returns.

New data providers are competing with more established counterparts to offer the best signal-to-noise ratio and a means to integrate ESG factors into traditional investment strategies. Asset owners and managers are taking note and so should individual investors.

Yet, absent greater transparency and voice over high-level decisions regarding capital allocation and distribution, there is a necessary limit to the current scope of change. The incentives to limit reallocation of returns from workers and communities to executives and financiers are weak at best.

The backlash against the current distribution is growing. Warren’s legislation would accelerate progress and assuage populist concerns by increasing the authority of employees, requiring supra-majority approval for corporate political activity and forcing executives to hold onto shares for longer terms after receiving options or undertaking buybacks.

Investors who desire more and better data on ESG factors believe that decision-making has underweighted these factors and that long-term sustainability requires greater attention to them should consider whether granting external stakeholders more formal power and executives less could well be consistent with the long-term returns of their portfolios.

– Jaclyn Moyer, “What Nobody Told Me About SmallFarming: I Can’t Make a Living” (Salon, 2/10/15)



A Foodie Culture



Every year since 2013, Maine has secured the number- two spot on the national “Locavore Index,” a measure of commitment to the availability and consumption of healthy local food. (



A thriving restaurant scene, a network of co-ops and natural food stores, and a cornucopia of farmers’ markets create a dependable market for local producers in the midcoast. This region also holds an unusual concentration of nonprofit entities dedicated to fostering farming, including Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association (MOFGA), Maine Farmland Trust (MFT), Midcoast Farmers’ Alliance, Coastal Enterprises, Inc. (CEI), Slow Money Maine (SMM) and two investment clubs supporting food-related businesses.



The region’s farmers now benefit from a longer growing season as well. When the USDA updated its planting zone designations in 2012, the coastal region from Bath to Rockland received the same milder designation (6A) as coastal York County. “It used to be that you had to sell 90 percent of your product” between July 4 and Labor Day, says Dave Colson, MOFGA’s agricultural services director. He recalls when the Common Ground Country Fair in late September marked “an end-of-season celebration.” Last year, in contrast, people there passed out from heat stroke. But warmer falls and springs mean that farmers can take advantage of shoulder seasons, particularly with hoop houses, and can more readily supply winter markets.



Lay of the Land



Most farmers in the midcoast rely primarily on “direct-market” sales to consumers and chefs, although some add in wholesale accounts (less than a fifth—according to the USDA’s agricultural census—sell primarily wholesale). Mike Bahner, of Bahner Farm in Belmont, ticks off an array of sales outlets, part of what he calls a “diverse marketing strategy.” The Camden Farmers’ Market provides the farm’s “bread and butter,” he says, while a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) operation generates early-season income. Bahner Farm also has a Winter Buying Club and a summer farm stand. “To sell everything you grow is hard,” he says; “you have to be entrepreneurial.”



Many area farmers are starting to find existing venues saturated or, as Cooper Funk of Camden’s Dooryard Farm puts it, “all of us are running up against each other.” His farm has a prime location for a farm stand and Funk balances that with supplying restaurants and some wholesale customers; he launched his farm business here in 2014 (having farmed previously in California) and says “it’s a multi-year process to get on people’s radar, but it’s trending in the right direction.”



Wherever you are, “there’s a percentage of people drawn to what we do and then there’s the rest of the population,” he says, adding, “That’s both the truth and a copout.” In Maine, the vast majority of food consumers do rely primarily on the convenience and variety of chain retailers, with only about 15 percent routinely buying local foods, according to a 2008 report to the Maine Legislature (



Data on who routinely buys local food are elusive, in part because some local food is sold wholesale to chain stores. Michael Norton, director of external communications with the Hannaford market chain, notes that most of the 125 Maine farms they work with deliver direct to one or more stores, while some also supply their distribution centers with larger volumes.



Elizabeth Sprague, a farm business planning project manager at MFT, sees potential for more farmers to supply wholesale accounts — whether chain markets or institutions like hospitals and schools. She’s done buyer surveys that indicate “demand for Maine-grown products is higher than supply.” The challenge, she notes, is to have products conform to food safety requirements and regulations.



Among farmers who supply supermarkets, the experience has been mixed, Colson says. Staff turnover can make it difficult for farmers and some of the markets offer so much similar produce that it’s hard for local providers to compete.



Economies of scale often push farms to increase production and specialize to better serve institutional or out-of-state markets, but many area farmers would rather keep their operations small. Jed Beach, a farmer and business development counselor to other farms, finds that’s a transition “they don’t necessarily want to make.”



MOFGA’s Colson isn’t convinced that farms in this region have to scale up to succeed. Farther north in Maine that may be necessary, he says, “but that’s the unique thing about the midcoast; it’s still somewhat a decentralized set of communities” yet collectively they represent Maine’s second biggest market, particularly when population booms in summer.



Direct market sales can only grow if farmers can reach a greater diversity of consumers, drawing more people to markets, farm stands and CSAs. “Changing consumer behavior is really hard to do,” Beach says, “and takes a long time.” But he sees cause for optimism; buyers of his farm’s produce tell him that “local as a brand is continuing to rise.”



Groups are working statewide to make local foods more accessible and affordable to lower-income Mainers through several initiatives: Good Shepherd Food Bank’s program, Mainers Feeding Mainers (



Rep. Chellie Pingree and others introduced a Local FARMS act for incorporation into the Farm Bill, which includes a “Harvesting Health” pilot program in which doctors could “prescribe” fruits and vegetables in low-income settings — providing vouchers so patients could acquire that produce free from local markets. However, the fate of the local agriculture provisions, and the larger Farm Bill, remains uncertain.



A Rocky Field



Because federal subsidies go primarily to industrial-scale agriculture, small-scale farmers are at a competitive disadvantage in pricing their products. There’s an inherent tension, Harris says, because the costs of running a farm business “don’t always square with what a consumer is willing to pay.” Local producers feel pressured to match supermarket prices, all the while realizing — in Bowdoinham farmer Abby Sadauckas’ words — “We can’t make a living if we can’t cover our production costs.”



The 2012 agricultural census confirms that small-scale farming does not necessarily translate into “making a living farming,” much less a comfortable one. Fully half of Maine’s farms are not profitable, according to census figures, Sprague notes, and “what I see leads me to believe that’s accurate.” The census reports that less than a third of the farms operating in Lincoln, Knox and Waldo counties have an annual value of sales over $10,000, and roughly half of the farmers there report working off-farm for their primary income.



“Farmers need fair-trade pricing on what they grow,” Sprague asserts. Consumers routinely weigh considerations of producers’ needs when buying artisanal coffee, she adds, but “it would be useful and beneficial for us to think about the same sort of concerns for farmers here.” Their prices need to reflect a margin that covers health needs, retirement savings and their investments in building soil health. “In general,” Colson says, as a farmer “you’re not rewarded for being a good steward. You’re rewarded only for cutting costs.”



Systemic Supports



Recognizing that agriculture needs to be economically as well as ecologically sustainable led to the creation in Maine of new supports over the last decade that are helping buoy fledgling and established farm operations. “Access to capital is a problem” for farmers, Sadauckas says, in part because lenders don’t always understand farm constraints. As a former teacher of MOFGA’s Farm Beginnings program and a field organizer for the regional organization Land for Good, she sees this dynamic frequently and cites an example from her own experience. The federal Farm Service Agency wanted her farm to supply “letters guaranteeing sales” from customers in its loan application as if the farm had wholesale accounts. But for a business selling through farmers’ markets, the request was nonsensical. Still, the agency provided a reduced loan when that requirement was not met.



Farms can have difficulty getting small or bridge loans for essential and time-sensitive expenses — like a delivery vehicle or walk-in cooler. Slow Money Maine, an informal network of private lenders and grantors, has helped fill that gap directly and through two investment clubs it helped spawn, No Small Potatoes and Maine Organic Lenders. When the farming community voiced the need for more accessible capital, Bahner notes, “they stepped up relatively quickly.” These three groups combined have put more than $4.5 million into Maine farms and local food businesses since 2010, and an application is now pending to start a Maine Harvest Credit Union targeted to farms and food businesses.



Those successes still pale relative to the need, observes longtime SMM board member Linzee Weld, who helped found No Small Potatoes; “in fact we are small potatoes; we’ve filled a gap in providing small loans.” She wishes more people understood that farms are inherently high-risk and low-margin businesses on which we collectively depend; “I just don’t think there’s any substitute for public support.”



Part of that support has come to the midcoast through the state’s Land for Maine’s Future program and federal grant programs that have helped local land trusts, Maine Farmland Trust and Maine Coast Heritage Trust, support continued farming at settings like Beech Hill in Rockport and Dooryard Farm in Camden. State support also filters down from FAME’s Agricultural Loan Fund and its “Maine Ag in the Classroom” program. Some public support comes through school districts that commit to funding school garden programs (like the thriving one at Belfast’s Troy Howard Middle School) or to extensive local food purchases, as Five Town CSD makes—with $10,000 spent last year on products from four area farms.



Anticipating Change



For their operations to be economically viable long-term, though, Maine farmers will need more public support. That could take many forms, explains Harris. It might involve more supportive state policies (an agricultural policy platform for gubernatorial candidates, she notes, is currently being developed). Infrastructure improvements like broadband would benefit many rural farmers, she adds, as would strong investments in the University of Maine’s Cooperative Extension and research work. Many people in the farming community would like to see better succession planning with those who own and farm the land now. The average age of Maine farmers is 57 and “too often the land is the retirement strategy, whether that was planned or not,” Harris says.



Area farmers, like other small-business owners, also need help getting consistent workers in the growing season, a problem exacerbated by the shortage of affordable housing during summer months. Funk says there are plenty of young folks from around the country who would welcome a chance to try the farming life in coastal Maine for a summer but only if the farm could house them: “Housing is a huge issue,” he says. “Everything is going to Airbnb.”



The region has some training opportunities for potential farm workers, like the Teen Ag Crew at Erickson Fields Preserve, Youthlinks and the University of Maine Gardening Program for inmates at Maine State Prison, but the numbers they supply are not adequate to meet demand.



Bahner, Beach and others mention the need for more support and infrastructure to engage in value-added production of processed goods like sauces and jams or “foods to go,” all of which offer a higher profit margin. Improved systems for helping small farmers aggregate their goods for sale and distribution could also help. Beach notes that this is happening informally, led by farmers, but support for more such efforts could improve distribution channels.



Some farmers and farm advocates would like to see the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry shift its focus from international trade to building local markets and creating the stable infrastructure and seasonal work force needed to support farm operations here. Recent research from the University of Southern Maine’s Food Studies Program (



A critical role for the state, in the view of Sadauckas and Sprague, is to reinstate the State Planning Office that once provided guidance on land use planning and could tackle related policy development (such as balancing farmland protection with provision of affordable housing) and research (like determining the support infrastructure needed in each agricultural region).



Ultimately, though, the most essential public support might simply be the public: a broad base of consumers who understand the value of local food — not just for personal health or nutrition — but for community well-being.



In a world where global markets experience ever-more hiccups and natural disasters can disrupt food-supply chains, local foods could help buffer Maine from those disturbances. A 2017 report gauging the “food resilience” of Portland and four other cities (



Greater profitability of farms, in turn, might fuel further economic growth in the region. Research done in the midcoast 15 years ago points to that conclusion. The Institute for Local Self-Reliance assessed how much money remains in the local economy from purchases made at locally owned businesses versus big-box stores. The data drew from storefront businesses, not farms, but the same spending patterns generally apply (in that locally owned businesses and farms typically bank locally and rely routinely on local service providers — like accountants and repair people — whereas larger chains do not). The contrast was stark: $100 spent at a locally owned business returned $45 dollars to the local economy, whereas only $14 of those dollars remained locally when spent at a big-box store.



An economic analysis of buying local, done in Portland in 2011 (



For a state that just received an abysmal projection from the Department of Labor (



When a student asked if my farm was sustainable, I told her that I was certified organic, I managed my soil fertility through crop rotations and compost applications … [but] I didn’t think my farm was sustainable. Like all the other farms I knew, my farm relied on uncompensated labor and self-exploitation … [and] the years my partner and I could continue to work without a viable income were numbered.– Jaclyn Moyer, “What Nobody Told Me About SmallFarming: I Can’t Make a Living” (Salon, 2/10/15)Every year since 2013, Maine has secured the number- two spot on the national “Locavore Index,” a measure of commitment to the availability and consumption of healthy local food. ( www.strollingoftheheifers.com/- locavore/) The culture surrounding fresh food is becoming one of the state’s greatest lures — for visitors and for new farmers. In a state survey, nearly 60 percent of visitors ranked the state’s cuisine as the reason for their stay (there’s even a blog now devoted to Rockland’s food scene, eatrockland.com). Between 2007 and 2012, the number of young farmers in Maine rose nearly 30 percent, with Waldo County alone adding more than 200 farms.A thriving restaurant scene, a network of co-ops and natural food stores, and a cornucopia of farmers’ markets create a dependable market for local producers in the midcoast.

The midcoast might benefit from a similar analysis, getting better data to determine what improvements — like processing centers or distribution channels — could strengthen both farm profitability and community resilience.Greater profitability of farms, in turn, might fuel further economic growth in the region.

Not everyone in the midcoast cares how far their tomato traveled, but most would agree the prospect of greater regional vitality sounds delectable. Is it possible the first taste of that renewal lies no farther than the nearest farm stand?

215,https://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/08/09/impossible-foods-mission-find-earthbound-sustainable-sustenance-first-brand-campaign,"Thu, 09 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Drum,Impossible Foods on a mission to find earthbound sustainable sustenance in first brand campaign,"Utilizing a space exploration metaphor to drive its point home, Impossible Foods’ mission is to venture into our world as an astronaut would on a new planet – with eyes wide open – but rather than search for alien life, in this case the mission is to find better, more sustainable ways to feed ourselves.

Impossible Foods, creator of the plant-based Impossible Burger, has launched its first brand mission campaign to coincide with the release of its annual Sustainability Report.

The campaign centers around a film called The Return, which tells the story of an astronaut returning to Earth and roaming around with a fresh set of eyes, appreciating every small detail of the planet, much like the first astronauts on the Moon. We see the space-suited man roaming through a neighborhood, taking in the plant life growing from a crack in the asphalt. He is amazed by a praying mantis, the colors of a street stand selling fresh fruit juices, the beauty of a pigeon’s eyes and more everyday things humans may take for granted.

“It looks like a living, breathing organism,” says the voice through the space helmet to an unseen mission control. “I’ve dreamed of this planet for so long…this is paradise,” he says, walking through the forest before removing his visor and breathing in fresh, clean air.

It ends with the line that the Impossible Foods’ mission is for Earth, not Mars, and reflects the company’s drive to fight for our planet by finding better, more sustainable food sources.

The film will be backed by experiential elements, like wandering astronauts in New York, who look to reintroduce people to the wonders of the world, along with a heavy social drive. The campaign is the first production of the Impossible Foods in-house creative department led by executive creative director Sasha Markova and creative director Giselle Guerrerro. It was directed by Nick Walker, a Nicki Minaj/FKA Twigs music promo director. The voice of the astronaut belongs to Fatlip from The Pharcyde.

The short film premiered at an event for the release of the Impossible Foods 2018 Impact Report, which summarizes the company’s substantial progress in sustainability developments, as well as the commitments that Impossible Foods is making to fix the food system and meet rising demand for meat in new and better ways.

The event included a panel discussion featuring Pat Brown, founder and chief executive of Impossible Foods, alongside former governor and administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency Christine Todd Whitman, director of Center of Sustainable Development Columbia Jeffrey Sachs and author Jonathan Safran Foer.

In the report, titled ‘Mission: Earth,’ highlights the company’s successes (the Impossible Burger is now available in 3,000 locations in the US, Hong Kong and Macao, and growing rapidly) to its challenges (understanding how plant-based foods benefit the planet and actually taste good).

The 52-page report is full of statistics, including charting its efforts to become a zero waste producer, to how much water and what produce it uses (including explaining what its heme – soy root – is to consumers). Impossible Foods states it wants to be “the most transparent food company in the world” and even includes notes on its safety, public health and open access to records.

“As we grow, so does our commitment to sustainability at all levels of our business. From supply chain engagement to sustainable packaging, from empowering our employees and customers to zero waste in manufacturing – we’re putting stakes in the ground and setting targets. But our true impact will be in greenhouse-gas emissions prevented, in land and water spared, in ecosystems and wildlife protected and restored, in food security strengthened and in communities served through our success in replacing the world’s least sustainable technology,” stated Brown in the introduction to the report.

The new campaign and report helps solidify Impossible’s push to be an innovator in sustainable foods, and the people on the inside of the company wholly believe in what they are doing.

“We want to be a spirit of something. You’re part of something when you’re in the Impossible world. You’re part of this energy around this thing,” said Markova in an interview with The Drum earlier this year.","Impossible Foods, creator of the plant-based Impossible Burger, has launched its first brand mission campaign to coincide with the release of its annual Sustainability Report.

The Sustainable Development Goals apply to Australian cities too,"We are still settling Australian cities on unceded Aboriginal lands. With the global agreement on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, development has finally come home to the developed world. Yet in Australia we still often proceed as if development goals are about foreign aid, somehow separate from our own development activities and civic responsibilities.

The Senate inquiry into the SDGs, for example, has been referred to the Department of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Three of the seven terms of reference relate to Australia’s Official Development Assistance program.

Reports that trade with Europe might be in jeopardy because of Australia’s failure to act responsibly on climate change – a commitment enshrined not just in the Paris Agreement but also in SDG 13: Climate Action – illustrate the naivety of thinking this country can carry on as usual while others tackle sustainable development.

Australia’s SDG indicator framework

The National Sustainable Development Council’s focus on transforming Australia is an important starting point. The NCDC draws on the SDG Progress Report to “highlight key trends and emerging issues for policy and decision-makers and communities across Australia”. But it doesn’t go far enough.

The focus is on targets and indicators that are deemed relevant and important for Australia. This is complemented by a wheel-of-fortune-style dashboard set of aggregated results across four key benchmarks.

The result is a colourful, largely unintelligible – albeit very well-intentioned – national SDG assessment.

Looks like we get a C grade. But what does this actually say about Australian settlements?

Sanitised and complacent

The real issues facing Australia are sanitised and out of sight with a 6.5 score. With 90% of Australians living in urban areas, how does this assessment inform and transform the state of sustainable development in our cities?

A core sustainable development challenge for Australia is the spatial unevenness of its development – between cities and non-city regions, between the dominant cities (Sydney and Melbourne) and the rest, or between different suburbs within cities.

Our patchwork economy generates serious social inequities. The answer is not just to stimulate greater economic activity or spread the boom to “lagging” areas.

We need to recognise that the apparent success of the “bright patches” is often based on their exploitation of “dull patches”. Some areas are set up to be sacrifice zones that suffer, for example, the ill effects of resource extraction, heavy industry and waste disposal.

Read more: An environmentally just city works best for all in the end

And some regions struggle not simply because they are physically distant, but because uneven provision of infrastructure has made them functionally distant. Prioritisation of certain regions over others and an over-reliance on infrastructure provision as a proxy for development are two issues that the nation needs to tackle to deliver the SDG agenda.

Beyond national silos

Australian cities rely on and impact upon these spaces and others far beyond their boundaries. Thus tackling SDG 11 on cities cannot be separated from tackling the other SDGs, including sustainably managing life on land (SDG 15), clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), affordable and clean energy (SDG 7) and life below water (SDG 14).

This means thinking not just about where and how cities access resources, but where their outputs go. For example, when China halted a major waste flow to its recycling plants this exposed the reliance of Australian cities on often distant facilities.

Read more: China's recycling 'ban' throws Australia into a very messy waste crisis

This demonstrates how cities are inextricably linked to spaces beyond their city limits, and the need for Australian cities to reduce and reuse as well as just recycle waste. It also illustrates the entwining of Australian settlement development with multiple spaces beyond our borders. Australia’s responsibility for sustainable development includes attention to the nation’s own urban heartlands as well as their impact on both neighbouring and distant countries.

Putting the SDGs to work in Australian cities

The SDGs can be mobilised to help achieve sustainable development, but we are not putting them to work in Australia. We stumble our way into the challenges of our climate of change, no more nationally self-aware it seems than before.

A new sustainable development approach is needed in Australia. An SDG ethic and compass must guide our direction so no one is left behind.

The SDGs are an invitation to take seriously the sustainable development challenges we face as a nation, and the implications of our actions for other nations. Rather than look for ways to reinforce our developed country privilege with a C grade report card, we could use the SDGs as a two-fold opportunity to:

1) ask the hard questions about the sustainability of our development

2) collectively explore transformative pathways, particularly within our cities.

Both suggest the importance of connecting more genuinely with Indigenous understandings of sustainability and living ethically on Country. And what do the SDG indicator frameworks and benchmarks tell us about our progress in our sovereign relationship with Indigenous people on whose unceded land we live and work?

We are not arguing for a more parochial agenda, or that international development is not important. Indeed, Australia could usefully follow the UK in positioning national science and research priorities within broader “global challenges”.

Rather, we are pointing to the risks of framing sustainable development issues as problems “over there”. This obscures both Australia’s own acute settlement problems and its role in creating problems “over there”.

What is needed is joined-up policy, planning and research that includes Australia within the frame as a sustainable development site, as well as a funding provider.

It could also include identifying Australia as a country in need: a nation that needs to better contribute to all the SDGs. In the case of SDG 13 on climate action, that need is glaring.

In Australia we need to make sure our identity does not include an implicit assumption that our home base is not in need of SDG attention – or only in certain areas. Many if not all aspects of development in Australia are maldevelopment, which calls for strong critical evaluation and action as much as in any other space. As a nation we can do much better.","We are still settling Australian cities on unceded Aboriginal lands.

218,https://www.sportanddev.org/en/article/news/annual-survey-results-sport-and-sustainable-development-goals,"Tue, 04 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",sportanddev.org,Annual survey results: Sport and the sustainable development goals,"We recently ran our annual survey and a few weeks ago we shared the main results related to views about our work; however, we also asked a few questions to assess your views on sport and development more generally, including two about the sustainable development goals (SDGs).

We first asked survey participants to select the three SDGs that they thought sport could have the biggest impact in addressing. The top five chosen were as follows:

1. Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages (81%)

2. Goal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls (65%)

3. Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all (57%)

4. Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels (54%)

5. Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalise the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development (30%)

We then asked survey participants to select which three SDGs they feel are the most pressing in the world today. The top selections were as follows:

1. Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere (63%)

2. Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture (45%)

3. Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages (37%)

4. Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all (35%)

=5. Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts (31%)

=5. Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels (31%)

When comparing these two lists, three interesting observations emerge. The first is that only two of the SDGs that survey participants believed sport could have the biggest impact in addressing are among the top six identified as the world’s most pressing issues. That may suggest that the sport and development community, or at least those people who participated in the survey, does not believe sport has a major role to play in tackling the topics they find most important, most notably ending poverty and ending hunger.

Secondly, the results largely confirm the findings of work already done by the Commonwealth Secretariat. A consultation it undertook with a variety of stakeholders in 2015 identified six SDGs that sport could have the biggest role in addressing, plus a seventh – Goal 17 – that was seen as cross-cutting. All of the top five from sportanddev’s survey were among the seven highlighted by the Commonwealth consultation. The other two from the Commonwealth consultation (Goal 8, decent work and economic growth and Goal 11, sustainable cities and communities) were not far behind in sportanddev’s list. Those two came joint seventh, each with 26% of people selecting them. There seems to be broad agreement on which SDGs sport can be most effective in addressing, although that does not devalue the impressive work done by organisations using sport to work towards the other goals.

Thirdly, it is interesting to highlight that Goal 17 came fifth when we asked where sport can have the biggest impact but was only identified as the fourteenth most pressing issue in the world today. We did not ask for participants to give reasons, so cannot be certain why; however, its high position on the first list seems likely to be because of sport and development’s relatively unusual ability to involve a variety of actors, from universities and NGOs to sports federations and governments. Its low position on the second list is likely due to the wording of our question – when compared to topics such as addressing climate change, ending poverty and reducing inequality, Goal 17 sounds a little generic to be considered the most pressing issue in the world today. However, some might argue that, because implementation and partnership-building affect the success of all other 16 goals, the importance of SDG 17 deserves wider recognition.","We recently ran our annual survey and a few weeks ago we shared the main results related to views about our work; however, we also asked a few questions to assess your views on sport and development more generally, including two about the sustainable development goals (SDGs).

“Tourists: Your luxury trip, my daily misery.”

“Your tourism kills my neighborhood.”

These kinds of sentiments have likely been heard in travel destinations that have become victims of their own success and attractiveness. Indeed, for many residents living in popular landmarks, tourism can often be a nightmare rather than a dream.

While many cities have been overwhelmed by mass tourism and what is now called “overtourism,” Seoul has been striving to promote alternative forms of tourism that do not put pressure on destinations and offer quality experiences to citizens as well as visitors.

As the host city of last week’s 7th UNWTO Global Summit on Urban Tourism, the South Korean capital is determined to spearhead global discussions and efforts towards fair, responsible and sustainable urban tourism.

The burden of overtourism

Over the past decade, international tourist arrivals (or overnight visitors) have grown steadily across the world to reach a total of 1.3 billion, according to estimates published by the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). In 2017, international arrivals grew by 7 percent, the highest increase since 2010, and are expected to exceed the threshold of 1.8 billion by 2030.

The world third-largest export sector, tourism is a fast-growing industry that accounts for 10.4 percent of global GDP through its direct, indirect and induced effects, and represents one in 10 jobs on the planet. Due to the investment and economic benefits or opportunities it provides, tourism has become a priority sector for many countries, especially in developing nations.

The benefits of tourism have been acknowledged by the United Nations and the international community: At the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) in 2012, global leaders recognized that “well-designed and well-managed tourism” can contribute to the three dimensions of sustainable development, to job creation and to trade. Tourism is clearly mentioned in the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and three of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, and the UN General Assembly designated 2017 the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development.

Having said that, tourism-development strategies have usually focused on quantitative rather than qualitative objectives, namely increasing the number of tourism arrivals, most of the time without any specific plans to prevent, control and monitor the negative impacts of tourism.

As a human activity, tourism is a heavy consumer of local resources that are often scarce. Occasionally dubbed “an industry without chimney,” tourism can cause environmental damages and pollution, including noise and visual pollution. Even if tourism has been taking its toll on destinations for decades, the term “overtourism” is actually quite new and became a hot topic and concern only a few years ago. According to a 2017 report by the World Travel & Tourism Council and McKinsey, it can be associated with a variety of issues, including alienated locals, degraded tourist experience, overloaded infrastructure, damage to nature, and threats to culture and heritage.

Moreover, a recent study by the University of Sydney quantified the carbon footprint of the global travel and tourism industry across the supply chain, and revealed that it contributed to 8 percent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, 70 percent of them due to transportation. It is likely that this contribution will continue to grow in the future, and some tourism experiences and even destinations might disappear due to climate change.

In addition to megatrends such as globalization, urbanization, demographic shifts, rising middle-class and affluence – together with technological innovations leading to increased convenience and awareness, the emergence of new tourist destinations, and the rapid rise of low-cost carriers – have fueled the expansion of international travel at a tremendous rate. Due to the overcrowding of their environments and the subsequent nuisances and disturbances, local residents have been feeling the stress, leading to a growing rejection of tourists and tourism, sometimes called tourist-phobia. This has been worsened by the emergence of home-sharing platforms that have priced residents out of the property market.

At the same time, there has been a growing interest or even demand for more responsible and respectful forms of tourism that have net positive effects and impacts on the visited areas and their residents, at environmental, social and cultural levels. The concept of fair travel, responsible tourism or sustainable tourism has emerged as an attempt to reconcile and harmonize the sometimes opposing needs and experiences of all tourism stakeholders, while optimizing their immediate and future effects on local economies, societies, cultures and environments. In the end, sustainable tourism can be defined either as a strategic vision (or visionary strategy), a business model or a lifestyle.

Overtourism and cities

Research indicates that the volume of tourism demand for city destinations has increased by approximately 50 percent worldwide in the last decade.

Some key destinations, particularly European cities such as Amsterdam, Barcelona and Venice, just to name a few, have been exploring various measures to preserve the quality of life of their citizens without giving up on tourism development, promotion and competitiveness.

The seventh-largest city in the world with almost 10 million inhabitants and the third-largest metropolis with more than 25.6 million people, Seoul has been actively and efficiently promoted as a top urban destination for leisure and business over the past decades, which resulted in a significant growth of international arrivals.

In 2016, the Seoul Metropolitan Government recorded 13.5 million foreign visitors. It was estimated that the milestone of 20 million arrivals would be achieved in 2018, boosted by the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang. In comparison, Venice’s 63,000 residents receive 30 million visitors a year.

Concurrently, various landmarks in Seoul – for example, the villages of Ehwa and Bukchon in the central district of Jongno – have already suffered from excessive noise, traffic congestion and littering due to overcrowding. Due to its well-preserved Korean houses known as hanok, which date back to the Joseon dynasty (1392-1897), Bukchon village has become a key tourist attraction, receiving a daily average of 10,000 visitors, 70 percent of them foreign tourists. In the 2000s, Bukchon residents were encouraged to renovate their hanok through government support so that these traditional houses could be promoted as key sightseeing spots and even offer home stays. However, the locals quickly started to feel overwhelmed by the uncontrolled flows of tourists; according to an academic study released in 2017, the tourism boom in Bukchon contributed to a 14 percent decrease in the number of residents over the past five years.

This situation prompted Seoul to explore sustainable strategies through developing new tourism experiences and contents, focusing on value over volume – through indicators such as the level of spending per visitor, the propensity to consume, and revisit rate – and establishing a series of measures to prevent overtourism.

Fair and sustainable solutions in Seoul

The first Seoul International Fair & Sustainable Tourism (SIFT) Forum was held in 2016 to discuss topics related to sustainable tourism and community-based tourism in megacities, including Bukchon. Hosted annually by the Seoul Metropolitan Government in collaboration with UNWTO and organized by the Seoul Tourism Organization, the SIFT Forum has gathered global and local experts and policy-makers, representatives of tourism business and academia to advance strategies and practical solutions to address the needs of the local communities as well as the visitors.

The Seoul International Fair & Sustainable Tourism Forum 2018 took place on 18 September, in conjunction with the 7th UNWTO Global Summit on Urban Tourism in Seoul. The Session was attended by hundreds of high-level representatives from national tourism administrations, city authorities and related tourism stakeholders, and offered a venue to share policy strategies and action plans to handle overtourism and to promote harmonious relationships between all stakeholders/co-creators of the tourist experiences, including travelers, host communities, tour operators, etc. Five panelists representing the cities of Amsterdam, Barcelona, Cape Town, Venice and Seoul tourism organizations provided their insights on how to adopt a local approach to economic and social development in urban destinations by integrating the local community into the tourism value chain.

Two of the major outcomes of SIFT 2018 were the launch of the UNWTO report Overtourism? Understanding and managing urban tourism growth beyond perceptions; and the signing of MoUs between the Seoul Metropolitan Government and Venice Municipality Council, and between the Seoul Tourism Organization and Amsterdam Marketing for the joint development and promotion of fair and sustainable tourism.

Promoting compassionate and responsible travel behaviors

As a result of the two first SIFT Forums, the Seoul Metropolitan Government and the Jongno District last month announced a set of eight measures aimed at promoting fair and sustainable tourism in Bukchon through better management of the flows of tourists. Moreover, during the 7th UNWTO Global Summit, Seoul announced the second edition of the “Fair Travel Living Together"" campaign, aimed at promoting mutually beneficial relationships between tourists and host communities.

Now in its second year, the global campaign seeks to:

Raise global public awareness of the issues related to fair travel and sustainable tourism;

Mobilize action from all involved stakeholders, particularly urban destinations and global organizations involved in tourism;

Promote fair and sustainable behaviors and respect from travelers for host communities.

Good planning and management have been identified as key factors of success not only for sustainable tourism development, but also for overcoming the challenges of overcrowding / overtourism. Based on its experience and the lessons learnt throughout its modern history, Seoul has proven its willingness and capacity to become a model of a smart, sustainable, resilient and hospitable city. Each destination is unique and should have its own agenda, but all tourism stakeholders must continuously engage and join forces, so that the sector can grow in a responsible way, towards peace, global prosperity, social inclusiveness and environmental sustainability.","As the host city of last week’s 7th UNWTO Global Summit on Urban Tourism, the South Korean capital is determined to spearhead global discussions and efforts towards fair, responsible and sustainable urban tourism.

220,https://ssir.org/articles/entry/philanthropy_bets_big_on_sustainable_development_goals,"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Stanford Social Innovation Review,Philanthropy Bets Big on Sustainable Development Goals,"The United Nations made headlines around the world in September 2015 when it adopted an ambitious set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that aim to end extreme poverty, protect the planet, and ensure health and prosperity for all by 2030. Delivering on these goals won’t come cheap. The UN estimates that it will require an additional $2.5 trillion in funding each year above what is currently being spent by government, business, and philanthropy.

Government and business have the deepest pockets and, no doubt, will shoulder the largest financial burden. But they cannot do the job alone. Philanthropy also has a critical role to play. It brings not just much-needed money, but often a willingness to support big thinking, innovation, risk-taking, and collaboration.

The power of those contributions is particularly evident in philanthropic “big bets” that aim to speed progress on specific social issues, such as pediatric AIDS or quality education. The Bridgespan Group’s research has established the outsized role big bets can play in propelling social change. Building on that work, we set out to research the flow of big bets to areas targeted by the SDGs—hoping to discern patterns that could inform future philanthropic efforts.

UN Foundation President and CEO Kathy Calvin has elevated the need for more research of this sort, pointing to insufficient data as a barrier to more rapid progress on the SDGs. “A core challenge within the philanthropic community is that there isn’t enough data on where the dollars are flowing vis-à-vis the SDGs, or enough transparency on what impact the dollars are having,” says Calvin. This Bridgespan study is part of a constellation of efforts aiming to fill that void and help funnel more dollars, more effectively to achieving the SDGs.

Tracking Donor Big Bets Aligned with the SDGs

Bridgespan began by identifying and researching the big bets made by 90 leading US and international philanthropists. We sought a representative sample of three types: traditional foundations, wealthy individuals, and corporate foundations. For each, we identified grants of $10 million or more between 2000 and 2016. Although the SDGs did not take effect until January 2016, and thus did not directly motivate the philanthropic activity, the 17 goals provided a useful framework to categorize them.

For each big bet, we made a judgment call about which SDG to categorize it under, given that the goals are interrelated. Among the 90 funders we studied, 52 made big bets aligned with the SDGs. They collectively deployed $42.4 billion via 836 big bets over the 17-year timeframe of our research.

Not surprisingly, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which gives away six times more money than the next largest global funder we studied, tops the roster with just over 500 SDG-aligned big bets (about 60 percent of the bets in our database), totaling nearly $20 billion.

More than half of the other funders we researched also made big bets in SDG areas. Most did so outside of their home countries, reflecting a broad commitment to global development issues. Moreover, these funders sharply increased their financial commitment to SDG-aligned big bets even before the UN ratified the new goals in September 2015. When we compared five-year spans ending in 2010 and 2015, pledged spending rose 84 percent.

The amounts pledged tell only part of the story. How the donors deployed the funds is equally important. Despite the diversity represented by the 836 big bets in our database, we found that funders’ efforts clustered around four broadly defined roles: developing and testing innovative solutions; implementing and scaling solutions that work; collaborating to finish the job; and advocating for policy change.

Developing and testing innovative solutions | Grants targeting innovations accounted for nearly a third of the $42.4 billion in SDG-aligned big bets. This is a role that other funders, such as governments or international development agencies, often are unwilling or unable to play given the uncertainty and risk inherent in innovation efforts.

Bridgespan’s recent study of 15 successful social-change efforts highlighted the frequent need for advocacy.

Where Have Funders Made SDG-Aligned Big Bets?

The $42.4 billion in big bets made between 2000 and 2016, however, flowed unevenly to the 17 SDGs. About half of the funding, $21.1 billion, went to a single SDG, number 3, Good Health & Well-Being. At the other end of the spectrum, seven of the goals, comprising roughly 40 percent of SDGs, collectively received $2.9 billion, just 7 percent of the big bet dollars.

Most funders targeted four broad categories of SDGs: health, education, gender equality, and environmental issues. A closer look at these four categories highlights the impact of big bets in service of innovation, implementation and scaling, finishing the job, and advocacy.

SDG 3: Good Health & Well-Being

Funding for SDG 3, Good Health & Well-Being, towered over all the other categories, attracting 364 big bets from 22 funders totaling $21.1 billion. The Gates Foundation dominated this category with 300 big bets exceeding $14 billion. But even after removing Gates funding, this SDG attracted the most money of any SDG. Eight of the 22 funders made big bets to support innovative solutions, such as new vaccines; nearly all made at least one big bet focused on scaling proven programs; and roughly one in four supported efforts to finish the job.

Wellcome Trust, a London-based biomedical research charity and one of the wealthiest foundations in the world, exemplifies funders that propel innovation. The trust supports more than 14,000 scientists and researchers in more than 70 countries. We identified 11 SDG-related health big bets by Wellcome since 2000, totaling $850 million. Of that, $320 million funded research to combat malaria, a major cause of sickness and death across the developing world. Wellcome’s funding contributed to the use of life-saving insecticide-treated bed nets and more than 50 other breakthroughs in malaria prevention and treatments. The fight against malaria has shown strong progress, with current malaria global incidence rates of 94 per 1,000 people at risk, a 41 percent decline since 2000.

“Our big bets, or long-term commitments, include funding on-the-ground research capabilities in Kenya, India, and Thailand,” says Dr. Michael Turner, head of infection and immunobiology at Wellcome. “We provide the stability needed for research progress. Our time horizon for investment payoff is more than 20 years.”

While Wellcome focuses on innovation, other health care funders focused more on partnerships to scale programs that work. The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), for example, partnered with the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation and the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care in 2010 to combat mother-to-child transmission of HIV. The three partners worked together to implement and scale World Health Organization recommendations in a country with one of the highest rates of mother-to-child transmission in the world.

CIFF committed approximately $45 million to the program between 2010 and 2015. “A big bet was the only way to tackle this issue,” says Kate Harrison, former program manager for CIFF’s Survive and Thrive program. When the program launched, the mother-to-child transmission rate in Zimbabwe was 28 percent. By 2015, it had fallen to 6.7 percent, saving an estimated 13,000 children’s lives. Nearly all (95 percent) of pregnant women in Zimbabwe now take advantage of these life-saving prevention services.

While global health receives the most philanthropic money, much still needs to be done to achieve all 13 sub-goals within this SDG, including ending the epidemics of malaria, TB, and neglected tropical diseases, such as river blindness; reducing by one-third premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, smoking related illnesses, and suicide; and halving the number of deaths and injuries from traffic accidents. A report by the UN’s Sustainable Development Solutions Network estimates an annual spending shortfall of $69 to $89 billion to reach the SDG’s ambitious health targets.

SDG 4: Quality Education

Nineteen funders in our sample invested $3.5 billion in 35 big bets targeting SDG 4, Quality Education. More than nine of every ten dollars went to implementing and scaling access to quality educational opportunities. Much of this work involved building public schools and universities, and investing in teachers and school leaders.

The Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) illustrates the impact a major funder can have in

growing university-level educational opportunities. AKDN, led by His Highness the Aga Khan, the 49th hereditary Imam (Spiritual Leader) of the Shia Ismaili Muslims, has spent more than $1 billion since 2000 to construct and expand two AKDN universities. One of those universities is the University of Central Asia (UCA), which AKDN established in partnership with governments in Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, and the Kyrgyz Republic. UCA’s three campuses attract students from a region bisected by the historic Silk Road, a trade and transportation route that facilitated the global exchange of goods, cultures, and ideas for hundreds of years. This major initiative aims to nurture future leaders and spur economic development in Central Asia. “These institutions are critical for long-term sustainable development efforts in these countries,” says Khalil Shariff, CEO of the Aga Khan Foundation Canada.

In Africa and India, AKDN also has built the first three of 18 planned Aga Khan Academies, a network of schools for exceptional K-12 students in 14 countries. “These are leadership development engines for people who do not have the opportunity to access this quality of education,” says Shariff.

Similarly, Azim Premji, one of India’s most successful tech entrepreneurs, has committed billions of dollars over time to strengthening public education in India. “Education is perhaps the most organized social process and mechanism for developing a better society,” says Azim Premji Foundation CEO, Anurag Behar. “Good public education is also the foundation for a vibrant democracy.”

The Azim Premji Foundation has more than 1,500 employees focused on education in eight Indian states. The foundation partners with state public school systems for capacity building, and establishes field institutes at the district and state level for teacher education, leadership development, assessment reform, and curricular improvement. Behar recognizes that effecting the systemic education change Premji seeks will take multi-generational efforts and require “deep patience, unrelenting tenacity, humility, and capacity to work with the socio-political reality that is out there.” He reports heartening signs of progress, including visible changes in teacher capacity and practices.

The UN report estimates a yearly global education-funding gap of $39 billion through 2030. While significant progress has been made in expanding access to primary and secondary education in general, much remains to be done for targeted segments, such as girls and the disabled, and expanding access to other forms of education, including early childhood, vocational, and technical.

SDGs 7 and 12–15: Energy, Climate Change, and the Environment

Twenty-six funders made 75 SDG-aligned big bets on energy (SDG 7), the environment (SDGs 12, 14, and 15), and climate change (SDG 13) totaling $5.8 billion. Three out of four dollars went to scaling existing approaches to ameliorate these issues. Notably, a far greater share of the funding went to advocacy than in either health, education, or gender equality—14 percent versus roughly 3 percent for each of the other three areas.

Many of the big bets flowed through intermediaries such as the ClimateWorks Foundation, the Energy Foundation, and the European Climate Foundation, that receive and channel money to other organizations. Funders are in essence outsourcing the process of developing strategies, searching for worthy grantees, structuring the deal, and tracking metrics that measure progress. These intermediaries give foundations and individuals an effective way to implement and scale programs that require more technical expertise than is available in-house.

ClimateWorks, for example, attracted major gifts from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, which made multiyear gifts of $850 million and $611 million, respectively. ClimateWorks makes grants to six philanthropic investment portfolios supporting organizations and initiatives around the world that are working to solve the climate crisis. It also devotes considerable resources to help businesses, governments, and communities implement energy-efficient technologies.

Funders outside the United States also backed climate change initiatives. Among them, the Geneva-based Oak Foundation made a $75 million gift over five years to ClimateWorks. “We are a family-led foundation, and our trustees think big and have made major investments in a broad variety of areas,” says Kathleen Cravero, president of Oak Foundation. “But our $75 million ClimateWorks grant is our largest grant yet. There is a lot of energy around doing something significant in the area of climate change because it’s such a pressing global issue. We are doing more thinking around big bets going forward, assessing where they can significantly drive change.”

To date, SDGs with energy, climate change, and environmental objectives have made modest headway. For example, from 2012 to 2014, renewable energy increased from 17.9 to 18.3 percent of total energy consumed worldwide. And global energy consumption growth slowed to a 1 percent increase between 2015 and 2016, due largely to efficiency improvements. But overall progress in these SDG areas falls far short of what is needed to reach 2030 goals.

The UN did not calculate a figure for annual increases in energy, climate change, and environment expenditures to meet the 2030 goals. A shortage of data made it impossible “to determine by how much current public and private expenditures need to increase in response to climate change adaptation and mitigation,” the report noted.

SDG 5: Gender Equality

A dozen funders in our database made 82 big bets in gender equality totaling nearly $3.3 billion since 2000. The Gates Foundation accounted for almost half of all grants—$1.4 billion. Eight of every 10 dollars went to implementing and scaling effective programs; one in 10 funded innovation.

Among big bet funders committed to gender equality, the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation (STBF) stands out for its commitment. Backed by Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett and named after his late wife, STBF is the largest private funder of sexual and reproductive health and women’s rights worldwide. Since 2004, it has made 19 separate big bet investments in organizations supporting gender equality, primarily in implementing and scaling programs addressing sexual and reproductive health.

For example, the foundation provided DKT International with a multiyear gift of $118 million. In 2015 alone, DKT reported serving 30 million couples and preventing more than 5 million unwanted pregnancies, 13,000 maternal deaths, and 2.6 million abortions.

STBF has also given more than $300 million since 2011 to Population Services International (PSI), which works in more than 50 countries in the areas of malaria, family planning, HIV, diarrhea, pneumonia, and sanitation. In 2015, PSI reported that it saved the lives of 9,246 mothers, prevented nearly 4 million unintended pregnancies, stopped more than 234,000 new HIV infections, and avoided an estimated 379,286 deaths due to diseases like malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia.

The Ford Foundation, long known for its commitment to reducing poverty and injustice, has also dedicated significant resources to gender equality. In 2012, the foundation announced a five-year, $25 million commitment to help end child marriage. Ford’s funding supported advocacy work at global, regional, and national levels and linked that work with policy dialogues; community-based, multi-stakeholder research into what works; and culture change efforts, among other things. One of the main conduits for these efforts was Girls Not Brides, a global partnership spearheaded by The Elders (an independent group of global leaders working together for peace and human rights). Girls Not Brides now brings together more than 900 civil society organizations committed to ending child marriage and enabling girls to fulfill their potential.

Trend data suggests such broad, collaborative efforts may be helping to produce results. Child marriage is declining. One in three women married before age 18 in 2000, but that number was cut to one in five in 2018. Ford’s support for advocacy has helped to sharpen understanding of the problem and set milestones to measure progress. Of course, the ultimate solution is complex and cultural, and will require the collective championing of many, including governments in the countries where child marriage is most prevalent.

Concerted public and private efforts since 2000 to improve the social and economic status of women and girls has made a difference. Girls’ access to education has improved and progress has been made in the area of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, including fewer maternal deaths. Nevertheless, gender equality remains a persistent challenge for countries worldwide, and the lack of equality is a major obstacle to sustainable development.

The UN sidestepped putting a price tag on the annual gap in gender equality funding because “the bulk of investment needs … must be included in gender-sensitive sector investments, including education, health, and access to basic infrastructure services.” A 2006 analysis, however, considered this complexity and concluded that donors should commit an additional $13 billion annually to gender equality.

Moving the SDGs to the Foreground

The clock is ticking on fulfilling the SDG agenda by 2030. The UN’s 2017 Sustainable Development Goals Report summed up the challenge: “Focused actions are needed to lift the 767 million people who still live on less than 1.90 US dollars a day, and to ensure food security for the 793 million people who routinely confront hunger. We need to double the rate at which we are reducing maternal deaths. We need more determined progress towards sustainable energy, and greater investments in sustainable infrastructure. And we need to bring quality education within reach of all….”

UN Secretary-General António Guterres worries that the SDGs are off to a slow start. “If the world is to eradicate poverty, address climate change, and build peaceful, inclusive societies for all by 2030, key stakeholders… must drive implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals at a faster rate,” he said upon release of the Sustainable Development Goals Report 2017 update report.

Momentum clearly is building. More than 50 governments have integrated the SDGs into their development plans. Businesses also are discovering how sustainable business models can create economic opportunities. For instance, the Rise Fund, a $2 billion impact investment offshoot of global private equity firm TPG, factors SDGs into its investment decisions. Unilever’s CEO Paul Polman helped found the Business & Sustainable Development Commission, which champions business opportunities tied to the SDGs. And companies ranging from Mars to Coca-Cola have publicly acknowledged the value they see in the SDGs.

“Corporations have really jumped on the SDGs,” says the UN Foundation’s Calvin. “Everyone, including the philanthropic community, has a huge role to play and can do more to make a larger impact,” she adds. “Unless the level of ambition and collaboration increases, there’s no way we’ll meet the targets.”

The recent burst of new large-scale efforts to aggregate philanthropic capital hold promise here. A number of funders have joined ambitious collaborations purpose-built to deploy big bets in SDG areas. Co-Impact, a new collaborative involving donors from across the globe, plans to invest $500 million in grants of up to $50 million each in health, education, and economic opportunity for underserved populations across the developing world. The Audacious Project (a new funder collaboration housed at TED, the nonprofit devoted to “ideas worth spreading”) has raised more than $400 million to fund ideas that have the potential to impact millions of lives. The Reaching the Last Mile Fund, launched in November 2017 by the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and hosted by the END Fund, aims to raise $100 million to finance work towards eliminating river blindness and lymphatic filariasis.

More broadly, the Foundation Center reports that since January 2016 foundations have contributed $53 billion in grants aligned with the SDGs. While encouraging, the figure “is not meant to suggest that foundations intentionally aligned all that giving with the SDGs and/or internalized the SDG framework,” according to the Foundation Center. “It’s easy to articulate your work within the SDG frame,” says the UN Foundation’s Calvin. “But shifting to a much more active role in the collective work required to implement and deliver on the SDGs is what is needed. Aligning with the SDG framework while otherwise remaining business as usual will fail to make the significant changes needed. Let’s hope that the next phase of this chapter brings about more focus on measuring impact and trajectories for SDG progress and partnerships.”

Any funder seeking to learn more about moving the SDGs to the foreground of their grantmaking can turn to several sources for help. The SDGfunders.org website offers an Indicator Wizard that helps philanthropists determine which SDGs relate to their work and which indicators to track to measure impact. The SDG Philanthropy Platform facilitates partnerships between foundations, governments, and the private sector. The UN has established the Sustainable Development Solutions Network to mobilize global scientific and technological expertise to promote practical solutions for sustainable development. And the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched the Global Network of Foundations Working for Development to serve as a bridge between foundations and policy makers.

For funders ready to embrace the SDGs, answering these three questions can also help:

Can you describe how your grantmaking aligns with the SDGs and the appropriate development targets? Start by matching your grant portfolio with the 17 development goals. The full value of the SDGs as a common global development language cannot be reached until funders understand how their work aligns with the UN’s 2030 goals, apply that framing to their grantmaking, and take part in the collective work required to implement and deliver on them. Make sure you can describe your outcome target, the more audacious the better, and exactly how you will get there.

What role(s) can best advance your philanthropic goals? Most of the big bet grants we identified went to implementing and scaling successful programs or services, an unsurprising finding given the need to expand programs that work. But our research identified three more roles funders typically play to deliver social change: developing and testing innovative solutions, collaborating to finish the job, and advocating for policy change. Be clear about which of these roles best matches your own goals. While our data indicate that funders often gravitate to a single role, that role also may change over time as a funder’s goals change.

How should you engage with others doing this work? The SDGs lay out sustainable development goals that no single actor—government, business, NGO, or funder—can accomplish alone. Partnerships and collaborations offer funders a way to leverage both their financial resources and advisory expertise, as demonstrated by many of the funders in our study. This isn’t to say that independent efforts aren’t a viable option. Some funders may prefer the solo approach to preserve their autonomy and avoid some of the costs of collaboration (such as the extra time and energy spent on alignment with collaborators). Even so, knowledge of what others are doing in your areas of interest can and should inform your work. The SDG framework makes it easier to identify others from whom you can learn and work alongside.

The world has never before aspired to achieve goals as ambitious and costly as the SDGs. If past is prologue, global philanthropy is prepared to invest tens of billions of dollars—often in the form of big bets—to make strides toward ending poverty, protecting the planet, and ensuring health and prosperity for all by 2030. While the journey has just begun, the international philanthropists we studied seem eager to bring their enormous resources to bear on these goals. More than ever, the world needs donors willing to think big, innovate, take risks, and build collaborations.

Methodology for Compiling Big Bets

We used US and international public sources, such as Forbes’ “America’s Top 50 Givers” and the Charities Aid Foundation’s World Giving Index, to identify three types of donors and rank them by size: traditional foundations, corporate foundations, and wealthy individuals. In the United States, we identified 30 traditional foundations (independent, community, and family), 10 corporate foundations, and 10 individuals. Internationally, we identified 20 foundations, 10 corporate foundations, and 10 individuals.

We selected $10 million as the threshold for a big bet because it is low enough to capture major gifts in fields where organizations and initiatives tend to be smaller, yet high enough that gifts would have the potential to fuel significant change. We did our best to consolidate multiple grants from a single donor for the same initiative into one big bet, even if the grants occurred in multiple years and independently would not meet the $10 million threshold. We also conducted interviews with representatives of several international foundations to gather information on big bet activity not available publicly. Given our focus on the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, we excluded gifts to arts institutions, religious causes, disaster relief, and patient assistance programs. We also excluded gifts for medical or higher education institutions in high-income countries, unless funders stipulated the gift for antipoverty initiatives or underfunded diseases that disproportionately affect low-income people. But we included such gifts in low- and middle-income countries.

We strived to create the most comprehensive database possible based on available data, and we believe we have captured a majority of big bets our sample of donors made in this period. Still, we have likely missed some. Though foundations in the United States must report all grantmaking activity, individuals and many foundations based abroad are not subject to the same requirements. We relied on publicly available information for the bulk of our research and supplemented this with interviews whenever possible.","Tracking Donor Big Bets Aligned with the SDGsBridgespan began by identifying and researching the big bets made by 90 leading US and international philanthropists.

Less than a month after Vancouver became the first city in the world to adopt a comprehensive zero waste strategic plan and the first city in Canada to ban plastic straws and polystyrene containers, the city played host to Sustainable Brands, the annual global flagship conference of one of the leading corporate sustainability communities of brand innovators and sustainability professionals working to shape the future of commerce worldwide.

Held June 4-7 at the Vancouver Convention Centre and for the first time in Canada, Sustainable Brands drew more than 2,300 participants from across the globe, including representatives from some of the world’s largest global brands such as IBM, Target, Coca-Cola, The North Face, Radisson Hotel Group, IKEA, Harvard University and Hershey, as well as disruptive social entrepreneurs, NGOs, investors, academia and the stakeholders who support them.

With a pointed focus on why global corporations should step up to protect the health of the planet by embedding social and environmental purpose into the core of their brands, SB’18 featured four days of more than 300 speakers and panels, in an interactive expo called the Activation Hub, 10 conference tracks, networking opportunities and offsite activities.

“We were thrilled to convene the Sustainable Brands community in Vancouver this year, a city where innovation, sustainable living practices and cutting-edge design are interwoven with daily life,” said KoAnn Vikoren Skrzyniarz, founder and CEO of Sustainable Brands, which was launched in 2008 and is a division of San Francisco-based Sustainable Life Media.

She continued, “At SB’18 Vancouver, we (enjoyed) enabling collaboration and co-creation between global change-makers and local ones. Vancouverites were welcome to join our community for full conference programming and for networking and design-oriented sessions in the central hub of our conference, the Activation Hub.”

To be renamed the Innovation Expo next year, the show’s Activation Hub featured 89 exhibitors representing brands with unique social and environmental innovations, some of them showcased within eye-catching, creatively designed exhibits.

Speakers at SB‘18 included many of the world’s top leaders and thinkers in corporate sustainability, including Marc Pritchard, CBO at Procter and Gamble; John Izzo, bestselling author and thought leader from Izzo Associates, and Jill Cress, CMO of National Geographic Partners.

Vancouver-based speakers included Sadhu Johnson, city manager of the City of Vancouver; Esther Speck, vice president of global sustainability at Lululemon; Gwendal Castellan, sustainable destination specialist for Tourism Vancouver; Dr. Peter S. Ross, vice president of research for Ocean Wise, and James Tansy, executive director for the Centre for Social Innovation & Impact Investing at the University of British Columbia.

“Vancouver’s entire tourism and events community (was) very proud to host Sustainable Brands’ global flagship conference,” said Ken Cretney, board chair of Tourism Vancouver and president and CEO of BC Pavilion Corporation.

He continued, “With the Vancouver Convention Centre’s demonstrated leadership in environmental sustainability underscored by its two LEED Platinum certifications, the facility (was) a fitting home for the event. Furthermore, we…partnered with Sustainable Brands to offer a special Sustainable Event Professional Certificate Course with the goal of improving sustainability in the global meetings and events industry.”

According to Craig Lehto, general manager of the VCC, a major part of the venue’s sustainability efforts during SB’18 involved working closely with event organizers prior to the event to discuss their ambitious sustainability requirements.

“As a facility where we already have comprehensive sustainable practices incorporated into our operations, it became a matter of confirming our practices,” Lehto explained.

He continued, “For example, we ensure that condiments were served in bulk and replenished only when necessary; no water bottles were served and instead, water fountains were retrofitted with bottle fillers; all leftover exhibitor items were donated, and all waste was sorted and diverted. We believe our commitment to sustainability and our demonstrated leadership in this area, underscored by our two LEED Platinum certifications, set our venue apart (and make) us a great fit for global conventions like Sustainable Brands and others dealing with environmental sustainability.”

Meanwhile, some leading companies used SB’18 as a launching pad for their own sustainability and CSR strategies, including The Hershey Company, which released its 2017 Shared Goodness Corporate Social Responsibility report and unveiled its new CSR strategy, “Shared Goodness Promise,” at the event.

Inspired by Founder Milton Hershey, the new strategy aims to make a positive difference in peoples’ lives through investments, collaborative programs and sustainable business practices and provides a focused framework for the company’s CSR work in four areas: Shared Futures, Shared Communities, Shared Business and Shared Planet.

Aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the initiative addresses some of the biggest challenges facing communities around the world by nourishing the lives of children and helping them succeed in school; investing in purpose-driven initiatives and business models; safeguarding the natural environment; helping Hershey communities thrive and engaging Hershey’s employees in these efforts, according to Jeff King, senior director of sustainability, corporate social responsibility and social innovation at Hershey.

“The Shared Goodness Promise aims to make a difference in the lives of thousands of people around the world, from the West African farmers growing the cocoa used in our products to the employees in our facilities in the United States,” King explained. “It helps us to focus our resources and the talents of our people – whether they’re nutrition, manufacturing or finance experts – in ways that are a making a powerful difference in the lives of individuals and entire communities.”

According to King, while sustainability has always been important to Hershey, its broader stakeholders, including activists, customers, consumers and shareholders, are becoming increasingly interested in the company’s behind-the-scenes efforts, so Sustainable Brands seemed like the perfect arena to share that information in front of a global audience.

“Sustainable Brands is an outstanding venue to gain insight and examples of how other like-minded companies are increasing their sustainability efforts,” King said. “We gain inspiration from others as well as hopefully make contacts for future partnership for our own efforts.”

Sustainable Brands 2019 is set for June 3-6 at Cobo Center in Detroit.

Officials have tried to make improvements in the area for decades. (Photo by Micah Bledsoe/Cronkite News)

LOS ANGELES – About 60,000 people are homeless in Los Angeles, and Mayor Eric Garcetti has declared homelessness a state of emergency.

“Housing to me is the prism through which we refract almost every other issue,” Garcetti said. “So if we’re talking about sustaining life in Los Angeles and California, traffic, the air we breathe, the poverty people experience, homelessness, even things like public safety, they’re all related to whether or not we can house people and house them in decent, clean, sustainable, affordable housing.”

LA’s infamous Skid Row has about 4,000 people living in tents and lean-tos in a 54-block radius. Despite many attempts to rehabilitate the area, the homeless have persisted for decades.

Mickey Gagnon, 53, lives on the streets.

“My husband and I came here from Las Vegas thinking that we had an apartment,” Gagnon said. “And when we got here, it was just way too expensive to live.”

She tried to find space in a shelter, but there was no room. And she worries about safety.

“Someone who could be your friend at six o’clock at night … then at midnight, kill you cause they know you have a couple dollars in your pocket.”

Gagnon’s mom, who had been paying their rent, died at 48, and that’s when Gagnon first become homeless.

She said she struggles with deep depression: “There’s still not a day that goes by that I don’t wish I could die and be with her.”

Jackie Vorhauer works for Skid Row Housing Trust, a nonprofit developer that’s served the area for about 30 years. Vorhauer works to educate the public on homelessness and sustainable housing solutions. The nonprofit builds affordable permanent supportive housing for homeless people.

The agency also provides on-site services, such as case management, life-skills training, counseling, health clinics and mental health help.

Three decades ago, Skid Row Housing Trust started buying many of the old and dilapidated buildings in and around downtown LA to turn them into affordable housing.

“A more sustainable model is to do more permanent supportive housing, which is supplying homes for people but with all the services on-site that they need to not only break the cycle of homelessness but to try to address issues where we can break the cycle of poverty,” Vorhauer said.

She said the trust can address mental, physical and emotional illness, and help people be more self-reliant. The trust has 26 buildings, home to nearly 2,000 people.

“It’s not just a Band-Aid for the time being,” she said. “This is a long term sustainable solution.”

So if this is the solution, why aren’t there more of these sustainable models throughout Los Angeles? The answer is complicated.

“More and more people in many cities across the world are becoming homeless because the price of real estate has gotten so high,” said Stephanie Pincetl, a sustainability scientist with the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at UCLA and the director of the California Center for Sustainable Communities.

“That’s an enormous sustainability question for cities today because people need to live in places where there’s employment, where there’s activity, where their children can go to school, where there’s good services – and that happens to be largely in cities.”

Architect Rob Jernigan, regional manager of the San Francisco design firm Gensler, said the issue goes back to supply.

The company has been working with organizations such as the Skid Row Housing Trust to design and build sustainable housing for the homeless. Jernigan said this has not been an easy task, partly because it takes so long to deal with regulations, including environmental impact statements.

“With regards to housing, what that’s doing is that’s really slowing down the supply and increasing the cost,” Jernigan said. “Developers are required in this state to actually manage or mitigate the different impacts that that project may have so they’re not passing it on to the typical citizen. They really are bearing those costs.”

The hypothetical question of running out of plastic is a good one, except that it shows the disconnect between most consumers’ knowledge of this material and the reality of how much plastic exists in the world. I would love to face this challenge (of running out) and grow our business model to transform other abundant waste streams. However, even after we begin working with other types of waste, we won’t run out of plastic in my lifetime. We just won’t.

There is more than 9 billion tons of plastic waste in the world. 91 percent of that is not recycled. This causes at least 26 million tons of plastic to flow into our oceans every year, the rest sitting in landfills or clogging the streets and canals of neighborhoods with minimal waste infrastructure. Despite the staggering amounts of this material outlined above, 1 million plastic bottles are purchased every minute.

Are re-usable water bottles the new status symbol?

While it is becoming trendier in richer communities to eschew single-use plastic for beautifully designed reusable containers, in many places, the only way to access safe drinking water and food is through the use of plastic packaging. Despite plastic bans and proposed policy, the production and consumption of plastic isn’t slowing down. Even if we stopped all virgin plastic production tomorrow, we still have the aforementioned 9 billion tons of existing material to deal with.

Luckily, this material can be as useful as it is problematic. If we begin to treat plastic as the renewable resource it has become, we have the opportunity to stimulate economies, reduce the need for virgin inputs, and reduce the harmful consequences of plastic litter. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates that a circular economy trajectory could bring India annual benefits of $624 billion by 2050, while reducing negative externalities such as greenhouse gas emissions. This could have similarly massive benefits for countries around the world.

Recycled polyester is not new, and is an outlet for only one type of plastic (Polyethylene terephthalate, commonly abbreviated as PET), but the model of upcycling single-use plastic into more durable and lasting products can and should be replicated as much as possible.

Investing in the first mile of recycling

What sets Thread material apart from other recycled plastic bottles is that we can tell you not only what country the material was sourced from, but the network of people responsible for picking it up. In a lot of places, recycling is still an informal, unregulated industry. This means the collection of recyclable materials can be host to a number of human rights violations including child labor and hazardous working conditions. Thread invests directly into the First Mile of every one of our supply chains, bringing dignity and opportunity to recycling at the collection level.

Recycling is far from a perfect solution, but I believe we are at a point in global sustainability when perfection cannot be the enemy of good. We should all reduce and reuse before we recycle. We should cut down on plastic production and consumption. The reality, however, is that we are not running out of plastic anytime soon — and until that day comes, we need to do something responsible with it today, tomorrow and however long it takes to eliminate the problem. For now, a Better Backpack is at least one solid step in the right direction.","One of the most frequently asked questions I get when pitching Thread is “what happens if you run out of plastic to recycle?”The hypothetical question of running out of plastic is a good one, except that it shows the disconnect between most consumers’ knowledge of this material and the reality of how much plastic exists in the world.

Name: Food Chain Workers Alliance

What they do: The Food Chain Workers Alliance believes in a truly sustainable food system, one that can provide healthy and locally made food, and that has the potential to lift up communities, workers, and our shared environment. It is a coalition of worker-based organizations across the country whose members plant, harvest, process, pack, transport, prepare, serve, and sell food, and who have organized to improve wages and working conditions for all workers along the food chain. Click here to view a list of the Alliance’s members. As a country-wide alliance, they have the ability to make changes on the local, state and national level. Currently, the group has 31 members representing more than 350,000 food workers in the US and Canada.

How they do it: The Food Chain Workers Alliance focuses on three areas of work. Each member organization participates in at least one of the following program committees:

1. Growth & Learning: Worker solidarity and leadership among workers all along the food chain is key to making improvements in the workplace. This committee plans the Alliance’s annual worker leaders summit as well as the regional Justice in the Food Chain training series, and develops other ways that members can learn from each other.

The annual worker leaders summit is a powerful opportunity for workers in all sectors of the food chain, from around the U.S. and Canada, to come together to share their stories and experiences, learn from other’s campaigns and gain new skills.

Participants in the Justice in the Food Chain training series share concrete skills in organizing, coalition-building, and campaign strategy development. The training sessions are held regionally, three times a year.

2. Campaigns & Messages: This committee helps to build public support for members’ organizing campaigns and the principal campaign of the Alliance, which is focused on the Good Food Purchasing Program and develops messaging, materials, and social media tools to support those campaigns.

The Good Food Purchasing Campaign encourages large institutions to direct their buying power toward five core values – local economies, environmental sustainability, valued workforce, animal welfare and nutrition – using the Good Food Purchasing Program to guide their efforts. The Program provides a flexible framework to support cities in creating benchmarks for procurement around these five values. In many cases, the goals they set build on existing local momentum in order to expand good food in the region by working in tandem with ongoing efforts. Recently, Chicago committed to the Good Food Purchasing Program .

3. Movement Building: The Alliance believes that to achieve their vision of a sustainable food system they need to build broad and deep social movements, and that they can’t do this alone. They therefore have co-founded and play leadership roles in a number of national groups including the HEAL (Health Environment Agriculture and Labor) Alliance and the Domestic Fair Trade Association.

The HEAL (Health Environment Agriculture and Labor) Alliance brings together workers from various sectors of food and agriculture with agricultural policy experts and community organizers and activists. The Alliance is a co-founder of HEAL and serves on its steering committee.

The Domestic Fair Trade Association holds up principles of social justice for trade in the U.S. and Canada, focusing particularly on the agricultural and food systems. The Alliance is a member in the NGO (non-government organization) sector. Other membership sectors include farmworker groups, manufacturers/processors, retail coops, and farmers.

Mission: to build a more sustainable food system based on the principles of social, environmental and racial justice, that respects workers’ rights and provides everyone with access to healthy and affordable food.

Latest project/campaign: The Food Chain Workers Alliance is expanding its worker leadership development training, Justice in the Food Chain series, to add Level 2 sessions for those who have already attended the training and to train food workers and organizers to lead training sessions in their own communities.

Major Funding: Food and Farm Communications Fund, Ford Foundation, Jessie Smith Noyes Foundation, Lawson Valentine Foundation, LIFT Fund, via the Solidago Foundation, Norman Foundation, Panta Rhea Foundation, Presbyterian Hunger Program, Unitarian Universalist Service Committee

Profit/nonprofit: Nonprofit

Annual Budget: $780,000

Interesting fact about how it is working to positively affect the food system: The Good Food Purchasing Program (GFPP) is nationally regarded as the most comprehensive and metric-based food procurement policy in the country. It provides a way for institutions to work with food service providers, distributors, processors and growers to create a transparent “farm-to-fork” food supply. The Alliance encourages local coalitions around the country to advocate for the adoption of this program in order to bring more good food to low-income communities and strengthen regional Good Food systems.

That was one of the recommendations civil society leaders and residents in the Kansai region discussed at the first Kansai Sustainable Development Goals Citizens Agenda meeting in Osaka earlier this month.

When world leaders gather in Osaka for the Group of 20 summit in June 2019, discussions will include the 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has hinted that one of the 17 development goals, women’s empowerment, may be on the official agenda, which is expected to be formalized after the G20 summit in Buenos Aires in December.

Recommendations from civil society groups in Japan, including some of those who participated in the Sept. 11 meeting, will form part of Japan’s approach to the summit and broader domestic policies to achieve the SDGs as a whole.

“One of the issues that can lead to gender equality is a system that promotes the participation of women in politics, and Japan has been insufficient in this regard,” says Atsuko Miwa, director of the Osaka-based Asia-Pacific Human Rights Information Center. Miwa is closely involved with civil society preparations for the G20 summit .

Statistics compiled by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications show that as of Dec. 31, only 264 of 2,614 prefectural assembly members, or 10.1 percent, were women.

While 28.6 percent of Tokyo’s assembly members were women, the figure in second place Kyoto was only 19 percent. In 28 of the 47 prefectures, the ratio was under 10 percent. In Osaka Prefecture, ranked 40th nationwide, only four of the 86 members are women.

The figure is only slightly better at the municipal and ward assembly level, where 2,855 out of the 19,103 members, or 14.9 percent, were women.

Tokyo again held the top spot, with women holding 28.1 percent of the seats. Saitama Prefecture was in second place, with female assembly members in its cities and wards accounting for 21.3 percent of the total. Osaka, poorly represented in the prefectural assembly, finished third, with 163 of its 804 city and ward assembly members, or 20.3 percent, women.

At the national level, only 10.1 percent of the Diet members were women as of the end of 2017, according to data from the Inter-Parliamentary Union, a global organization of national parliaments that is based in Geneva. Japan was ranked 165th among 193 countries.

With a round of nationwide local elections scheduled just two months before the G20 summit, the timing appears right for Japan to show the world in Osaka that it’s making progress on gender equality. Not only in the urban economic arena, where much government, media, and corporate attention is focused, but in prefectures, towns and villages facing rapidly aging, declining populations, and wondering whether they will be extinct when the world meets in 2030 to judge which SDGs were met.","To help meet the United Nations’ 2030 sustainable development goal for gender equality and empowering all women and girls, Japan needs more female politicians, especially at the local level.

227,https://ecowarriorprincess.net/2018/09/sustainable-living-just-for-rich-people/,"Fri, 14 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Eco Warrior Princess,Sustainable Living: Is It Just For Rich People?,"A couple of years ago I published an article about the lack of affordability in the ethical fashion industry which received spirited responses from the community. Price is a factor for many shoppers, I concluded in the article, to pretend it’s not is doing a disservice to the ethical movement.

The price issue has been an ongoing concern for many. When we published a post curating affordable eco-friendly and ethical underwear brands, which was set at USD $29 or less, a reader pointed out that most people couldn’t afford to purchase underwear at the higher end of this price range.

So I polled our Instagram audience on the matter and asked, “Do you think ethical underwear over $20 is too expensive?” Roughly 500 people responded and the results were in: 67 percent said yes it was.

This result did not surprise me. The Eco Warrior Princess (EWP) community also includes budget-conscious students, low-income earners, and cash-strapped parents. I suspect the reason we’ve attracted such an eclectic set of followers is because we actively work to ensure that EWP does not frame the sustainable lifestyle message through the lens of elitism, but rather, promotes eco philosophies of innovation, anti-consumerism, self-sufficiency, frugality, purchasing quality and environmental stewardship.

Now recently on Facebook, I happened on an innovative eco-friendly plastic-free toothpaste product where you pop a bite-sized toothpaste tablet in your mouth and it breaks down as you brush your teeth. “So so cool,” I thought. It was $12 a bottle. As I began to crunch the numbers in my head, calculating how many pills were in a bottle and how long it would last me, I scrolled to read the discussion thread and came across these comments:

“And as usual, green products are too expensive for most people. Find a way to keep costs to the same as over the counter products and I’ll buy them!”

“So why does everything that’s supposed to help the planet cost so fn much? Oh yeah, just like healthy food…they guilt you then jack up the price to get rich while you struggle to not be judged.”

“Most people cannot afford $12 for toothpaste they pay 88 cents for. Families are struggling to make ends meet. Sad but true no matter what excuses you provide.”

Concerns about affordability in ethical consumerism surfacing again.

I’ve been stewing on this issue a lot lately since it’s one of the biggest barriers for the mass consumer; the consumer we need to be influencing over to the green side if we really want to move the needle as a movement. Earlier in the year, I made a pact with myself that I would actively get out of algorithmically-influenced online communities and seek to engage with diverse people outside of the ‘eco chamber’ in the hopes of planting lots of green living seeds. I had been feeling that the online community was becoming too exclusive and we were wasting precious resources and energy preaching to the already converted. With climate change a pressing concern since some of our politicians are bed follows with the fossil fuel industry and are too slow to act, I decided that I needed to commit to getting the message out to the broader masses in the hope of making a greater difference. Engaging with people online and offline, the same concerns about the movement kept coming up:

Sustainable living is too expensive.”

Debunking the myth that a sustainable lifestyle is expensive

I grew up in Melbourne’s western suburbs, what used to be (and still is) a working-class area. My parents migrated to Australia from the Philippines in 1985 and on their humble incomes, built us a comfortable life where we did not go without. There was very little money in the kitty for extravagant consumer purchases since the household budget was tight and income stretched just enough to cover the mortgage, utility expenses, and private school tuition. Since the Filipino culture is a hierarchical one and children are expected to obey their parents; acting spoilt, selfishness and complaining were not tolerated. We made do with what we had and what we were given.

It’s in my childhood that I learned the foundations of a sustainable lifestyle even if at the time, that’s not how I would have described it. We were taught money was earned and that our parents’ money didn’t grow on trees. We were taught the value of hard work and of saving money. My father shopped secondhand and frequented garage sales and my mum purchased produce from the markets (sometimes purchasing organic when she was feeling especially luxurious) and cooked dinner most nights. Since my parents had lived in the developing world where scarcity is a real problem, they viewed waste, and particularly food waste, a sin. We were told time and again that kids in the Philippines weren’t as blessed as us, and that we should be lucky that we had a roof over our head and good food on the table. My siblings and I were expected to eat all the food on our plates, turn electrical items off at the socket, switch off lights when we left the room and to wear layers in winter to prevent unnecessary use of ducted heating.

When I look back on my childhood, I realise that the adoption of these sustainable lifestyle activities were born purely out of having little disposable income, necessity and survival. My parents were hard-working, practical and humble and taught us simple values that centered on frugality, humility, and resourcefulness. These are the values that I carry with me to this day and this is the point that I want to drive home.

You don’t need lots of money to live sustainably. People living in the developing world, for example, have a lower carbon footprint than those in the Western world. In fact, it’s people residing in the industrialised nations that are responsible for a greater share of consuming the world’s resources and global carbon emissions.

Thus, sustainable living is not about consuming the fanciest eco-conscious product so as to win the approval and admiration of people within the community. Nor is it a game of one-upmanship. It is about minimising our environmental footprint and protecting nature, which, let’s face it, can be best done by embracing a simple lifestyle. When one remembers that the point of it is to reduce one’s carbon footprint, consume less and learn to live in alignment with our natural environment, the journey becomes relatively easy. Cultivating these intrinsic values helps to fortify against the competition and comparison nature fostered by capitalism and even “conscious capitalism“.

So while there are sustainable living products and options that only the wealthier demographic have access to given the high upfront costs – some brands of ethical clothing, home solar systems, electric cars, shopping package-free bulk foods, and certified organic produce – there are still so many options available to people on lower income brackets, from embracing minimalism and consuming less to carrying a zero waste kit (as well as those ideas I’ve outlined above and others you will find in our free green lifestyle e-book here).

Sustainable living has the perception of being out of reach for the everyday person because clued-in greenies are using fancy-schmancy marketing and Photoshopped images to attract more people to the cause. It’s debatable whether these aspirational marketing messages promote more consumption or less; it’s just too early to tell. But one thing is clear – it’s confusing a hell of a lot of people and making some people feel bad that their lives don’t measure up to the images depicted.

Now acknowledging that creative marketing is being used by members of our community doesn’t mean that class privilege doesn’t exist; it does. It exists almost everywhere in the world and its values system can serve to erode the community if we let it. Our DC-based contributor Mary Imgrund in her article on the subject writes:

“One of the core beliefs of sustainability is to unplug from consumerism — buy less, save more, grow your own food, repair rather than replace, and so on. These are humble solutions, and usually the best ones. However, the new, capitalist version of environmentalism suggests that one can buy into the movement without making major lifestyle changes. Continue buying the same amount, they say, just buy my sustainable or new age version of that thing.”

Mary gets to the heart of the matter. Capitalists have found a way to turn the entire movement into a marketable commodity that consumers can buy into; cleverly manipulating the human desire for social status since it’s now cool to be ‘conscious’ ‘sustainable’ and ‘ethical’. Scroll through Instagram or Facebook and the message being perpetuated by these opportunists becomes clear: if you purchase the $100,000 Tesla, that $500 ethically designed dress or book that ‘eco’ resort located in the Maldives, you will acquire the status of being ‘sustainable’. Congratulations, your money gets you to the top of the sustainability pyramid. Hooray!

It can be frustrating for those who’ve worked at the grassroots level to see the movement being commodified by these seeming disingenuous actors, but this is capitalism and human nature for you. Where status is to be achieved and profits to be made, humans with questionable motives soon follow. The sustainability scene is no different. But let’s not make the mistake of thinking that the people who can afford the Teslas and expensive ethical dresses are bad people. They are people who have the capacity to spend lavishly on ethical consumer goods. Whether they’re trying to buy a conscience or not, does it really matter?

Related Post: An Insider’s Take on Eco Fashion Blogging and Ethical Fashion Influencers

Now I empathise with people who are priced out of the market, are feeling anxious and making comparisons between their humble, frugal lives to the Instagrammable lives of the eco glamorous. There is no shame in the simple life, regardless of how the predatory capitalists and advertisers make you feel through their “you need to purchase this to make you feel sexy/cool/loved” aspirational marketing. I grew up humbly, I still live humbly and I like to think that I make sustainable living look simultaneously cool, attractive, attainable and achievable.

My heart also goes out to the people who feel that their low incomes are preventing them from achieving all their sustainable lifestyle goals. But succumbing to the manipulations of the capitalist system and other people’s egos doesn’t help, we can feel bad about ourselves when we let these ideas in; when we give our power away and when we start to compare rather than focus on our individual and collective actions.

Likewise, I implore people of means and opportunity to recognise the challenges that people in the lower income brackets face and use whatever time and resources they can give to support climate change policies and programs that make affordable eco-friendly options convenient and accessible to everyone.

In her book, “This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs The Climate”, author and award-winning journalist Naomi Klein encourages us to move beyond focussing on individual responsibility and instead encourages us to tackle the issue through demanding changes in political and corporate attitudes and push for low-carbon policies that will help all people live sustainably. She writes:

“We will need comprehensive policies and programs that make low-carbon choices easy and convenient for everyone. Most of all, these policies need to be fair, so that the people already struggling to cover the basics are not being asked to make additional sacrifice to offset the excess consumption of the rich. That means cheap public transit and clear light rail accessible to all; affordable, energy-efficient housing along the transit lines; cities planned for high-density living; bike lanes in which riders aren’t asked to risk their lives to get to work; land management that discourages sprawl and encourages local, low-energy forms of agriculture; urban design that clusters essential services like schools and health care along transit routes and in pedestrian-friendly areas; programs that require manufacturers to be responsible for the electronic waste they produce, and to radically reduce built-in redundancies and obsolescences.”

The enemy we all have in common is extreme capitalism which encourages the “greed is good” mentality, drives social and economic inequality, pits us against each other, exploits our natural environment and the vulnerable. Since we know it has the propensity to divide us, we need to steel ourselves from it and ensure that its corrosive nature and the capitalist-slash-opportunists looking to prey on our willingness to pay more and thus profit from green consumerism, don’t seriously undermine what we’re trying to achieve as individuals and as a movement.

The Donald Danforth Plant Science Center will be a strategic partner to help further develop and validate promising agriculture technologies addressing critical sustainability challenges. The announcement was made at Danforth’s Ag Innovation Showcase on Sept. 11 in St. Louis.

“ In looking to expand IN2, we discovered that one of the greatest opportunities for creating smart, connected, sustainable cities is finding efficiencies in the connections among food, energy and water use,” said Mary Wenzel, head of Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility at Wells Fargo and IN2 board member. “ Agriculture uses 70 percent of global water and 14 percent of global energy, and our IN2 program is uniquely positioned to further the development and commercialization of technologies that reduce agriculture’s carbon, energy and water impact.”

The Danforth Plant Science Center, the world’s largest independent plant science institute, will focus on research and validation of innovative solutions that address how to use digital agriculture to produce food more sustainably, much like the way NREL leads the program’s validation of technologies related to commercial buildings. Future IN2 activities under the food-water-energy nexus will include food system inefficiencies and water conservation to help meet IN2’s goal of advancing smart, connected communities.

“ We are extremely pleased to be working with an organization that deeply understands the trifecta of basic science, innovation and commercialization,” said Trish Cozart, IN2 program manager at NREL. “ We cannot wait to see the benefit our next round of portfolio companies will receive.”

“ As one of the largest lenders to the agriculture and agricultural technology (agtech) sectors, Wells Fargo will bring its expertise to bear in helping these early-stage startups make it to the commercial marketplace,” noted Ramsay Huntley, Clean Technology and Innovation Philanthropy program officer with Wells Fargo.

“ Wells Fargo and NREL, through the expanded IN2 program, are the right partners with which to accelerate delivery of benefits from science and technology on the farm,” said Jim Carrington, president of Danforth Plant Science Center. “ We are excited about this new partnership as a way to combine the focused scientific research capability at the center with pressing needs to deliver more sustainable and productive agriculture.”

IN2 finds and selects companies through a network of Channel Partners consisting of incubators, accelerators and universities across the U.S. After validation, participating companies with commercially ready technologies have the potential to beta test with a strategic program partner. IN2 already is examining its networks for potential beta testing partners and plans to announce the selection of Round 5 agtech portfolio companies in spring 2019. To date, IN2 has funded 20 early-stage companies that have gone on to raise $89.5 million in follow-on funding from external sources.

“ For 20 years, the Danforth Center has been a driver in the growth of the food and agriculture innovation ecosystem,” said Sam Fiorello, chief operating officer at Danforth Plant Science Center. “ By leveraging the center’s excellence in plant research and its best-in-class technology infrastructure, the expanded IN2 platform will help accelerate agriculture technology commercialization for early-stage companies across the U.S. and the world.”

Today's sustainability teams charged with boosting the impact of their initiatives could gain a lot by adopting this mantra, too. Whether the goal is to cut CO2 emissions, reduce waste, conserve resources or all of the above, more and more brands have sustainability strategies in place. But making them a meaningful part of your brand is another story.

Research shows that today’s socially and environmentally conscious workforce is looking for more than just perks and a paycheck. They want their jobs to make a positive impact in their communities and the world around them, giving them a deeper sense of meaning and purpose at work and at home. If you’re looking for a way to boost the impact of your sustainability programs and brand, think about your company’s people as your most precious and high-potential resource. That’s what PayPal did when it set out to engage employees in its sustainability initiatives, and the results were impressive (see infographic).

1. Become an armchair neuroscientist

We are hardwired for doing good — or what we call “Goodness.” When we do the right thing — help someone in need, contribute to a charity or cause, or even just pick up litter — that good feeling is not just in our imagination. Oxytocin, also known as the “hug drug,” is flowing and not only does it make us feel good, it’s also been proven to deepen personal connections. Just like when the bonding hormone is released between mother and baby, it plays a role when we engage in activities linked to feelings of empathy, trust or generosity. Working together to improve the earth can make co-workers feel more connected to each other and their employers. These benefits not only help the environment, but can strengthen employee engagement and retention at a much deeper level. So, break down those silos and recruit the support of Employee Engagement teams from both HR and CSR, since everyone can reap the benefits of the good feelings created by your programs.

Make it a Mission (and gamify it!)

Do office compost bins, instructions on how to recycle used toner cartridges and carpools make that much of a difference? We think so! The truth is that small actions such as these, when repeated over and over and engaged in collectively, do add up. Think about using your company’s workplace giving program and platform to empower employees to contribute in ways that are meaningful to them. This is what PayPal’s team recently did as an early adopter of Benevity’s Missions platform, which uses an engaging, gamified approach to increase participation in pro-social activities, including those that boost environmental sustainability.

Missions provides opportunities for people to learn about corporate initiatives, gives them a way to track their contributions via a personal dashboard, encourages co-worker competition; and, most importantly, helps employees have fun while forming new positive habits. Using this technology, PayPal’s people took part in a host of actions at work and at home, such as carpooling to the office, eating meatless meals or reducing energy consumption. The results? In just three weeks, the PayPal team saved 998 pounds of waste, 10,683 gallons of water, 29,503 kWhs of energy and 22,205 pounds of carbon. Not only is that impressive in terms of environmental impact, it’s also a great brand story that you and your employees can easily share with the world.

It’s a small world after all

There are sure to be some employees who can’t take part in your sustainability initiatives because of time and money constraints, personal circumstances or abilities. It can also be difficult for remote or non-HQ employees to participate in corporate programs. This is why it’s important to provide a range of ways for employees to contribute. Easy-to-complete activities for people who work in regional offices, home offices or even on the road — such as turning off monitors at the end of the day or taking the stairs instead of the elevator — offer a great way to get everyone involved.

In PayPal’s case, 64 percent of Missions participants were from offices located outside of the company’s California headquarters, with employees based in Europe, Asia, Australia, the Middle East and South America joining in. This is important because it’s not enough to only have sustainability champions at the executive level or at headquarters. Allowing employees everywhere to take ownership of activities designed for local environments — focusing on air pollution in dense cities, for example, or water conservation in the desert — can greatly increase engagement by offering relevant activities and demonstrating that everyone’s contribution matters, regardless of where they sit.

Your people are one of your brand’s greatest assets, so why not harness their passion and desire for purpose and positive impact to make your business more sustainable? Companies that take an employee engagement approach to their sustainability initiatives will be rewarded on multiple fronts — they’ll be able to take a stand with their brand, help take better care of the planet, and see an uptick in employee engagement and retention. So, break down those barriers and make friends with your counterparts across the company, because your brand can serve a greater good with the power of your people.","Today's sustainability teams charged with boosting the impact of their initiatives could gain a lot by adopting this mantra, too.

230,https://thefifthestate.com.au/innovation/retail/vicinitys-sustainable-future/,"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Fifth Estate,Vicinity’s Melissa Schulz on a shopping centre path to a more sustainable future,"You’d think that Melissa Schulz would be feeling pretty good right now. The company she’s worked for as general manager sustainability for nearly four years, Vicinity Centres, recently slam dunked every other shopping centre in the country with a massive solar panel commitment. It will not just save tonnes of carbon but line investors’ pockets with a few more rays of sunshine – of the folding kind.

Champions of sustainability in the built environment who look longingly to retail property as the last Mount Everest to scale – not so much because its owners don’t care or don’t want to go greener, but because it’s so hard – could see Vicinity as the new poster child.

Out of a complicated background that incorporated several shopping centre vehicles including the troubled Centro after the dark days of the GFC, Novion, Gandel and Colonial First State, Vicinity has gone through an evolution that’s attracted fresh blood along the way, including former Grocon chief executive Carolyn Viney, now executive general manager development, and another former Grocon executive, David Waldren, now national head of design. Schulz’s own background includes ANZ and Transburban.

In an interview with Schulz about the company’s new sustainability profile the first question must be why shopping centres are so hard to make highly sustainable, compared with, say, big office towers?

Schulz is open about the difficulties but also the opportunities.

First, we know, is the model – both the function of these generally massive facilities and their investment structures. As Frasers Property retail chief Peri Macdonald put it at The Fifth Estate Tomorrowland summit last year, it would be easy to achieve a high degree of sustainability and energy efficiency if all you’re doing is creating a sealed box that no-one comes to.

But try to achieve highly efficient HVAC in a building that’s designed to attract as many visitors as possible and you have a vastly more difficult task.

Then there’s the investment model. In office buildings, the tenants take long leases and they’re invested in the profile of the building and, because of this, so are the landlords.

Not so much in shopping centres, where the biggest user of the building is the shopper who’s interested in the thing they’re buying, not so much the space they’re buying it in.

Consumers are on the move

Schulz knows consumers are on the move: their sensitivity to eco and ethical issues is on the rise and this will impact on the retailers and their landlords.

A recent survey from The Australia Institute, for instance, shows around 76 per cent of people surveyed want action on climate.

HP Australia and Planet Ark also showed in September that 90 per cent of Australians are concerned about the environment, “yet just half think they are doing enough to preserve it”.

Even more interestingly, consumers are not only looking to businesses and brands to take the lead when it comes to environmental sustainability, the survey report said, but more than two in three consumers, and three in four businesses surveyed, would be willing to pay more for environmentally friendly products.

Surveys such as these must give big outfits like Vicinity the confidence to move up a notch in how they tackle sustainability.

Schulz agrees.

“The absolute evidence is that that consumers are becoming more sustainably minded and we are starting to see retailers respond to that, particularly with Millennials,” she says.

“The issue is finding credible information. People want to do the right thing, but it can be tricky; the focus for the consumer is on the product itself and the decision can be overwhelming.”

For instance, is it OK to buy an organic cotton t-shirt made in Bangladesh because it’s cheap, or is there a modern slavery risk? Ethical analysts will add further questions such as how do the modern slavery issues weigh up against the idea that making the t-shirt provides work for people previously on or below subsistence level and that cheap labour has lifted millions out of poverty in places like China?

That’s hard enough.

Right now, says Schulz , sustainability ratings for shoppers are “out of sight and out of mind… out of their realm.”

That’s a challenge but also an opportunity for Vicinity.

“How we can communicate our credentials directly to the consumer and also, possibly, the credentials of the retailers?” These are ideas that are exercising the mind, but still in their infancy, she says.

Some retailers though are starting to connect the dots and matching their physical selling space, with their brand, with Green Star Interiors ratings.

“A couple of the banks are doing it and a couple of smaller retailers as well, for example Kathmandu.

“Historically and still, probably, a lot of things like Green Star Interiors has had greater visibility and focus from the investment community. “For Kathmandu it’s simple – the notion sits with their brand.”

For Vicinity the drivers are clear, Schulz says.

“Sustainability has three main focus areas us. It’s about committing to a handful of opportunities where we feel we’ve got a big chance of doing well, having an impact”.

For the company it comes down to three pillars of action.

Low carbon smart assets

One pillar is around low carbon smart assets focused on resource efficiency, mainly energy, Schulz says.

Programs are designed to reduce energy use and move to renewable energy, most dramatically highlighted with the company’s announcement this month that it will increase its solar investment to a massive $75 million solar portfolio rollout adding an additional 31,000 MWh of solar energy for the centres, and linking to Power Ledger so surplus can be traded with neighbours.

See articles

Waste is another big resource issue in centres and much harder to crack, Schulz says.

It’s not so much the consumers in the food courts creating the waste; it’s the retailers themselves, Schulz says.

But how to incentivise change is difficult. The cost of dealing with waste is rolled into rents so finding a financial incentive is hard. Likewise, how to measure waste generated by each tenant – with attempts to do so fraught with difficulties and evasion techniques.

“We’re increasingly starting to see improvements in technology like waste compactor bins where we can measure each tenant’s waste generation but even that is difficult,” Schulz says.

“But when we trialled it, it’s encouraged dumping in the loading docks rather than putting into the correct bin.”Financial incentives are still on the cards, “but we need to be sure we have a level of accuracy before we go down that path and assess before and after improvements..”

Climate resilience

A second pillar, Schulz says, is around climate resilience. For the company this is no matter of notional interest but something that can have direct impact on stakeholders – customers and investors both.

In a portfolio of around 80 centres around the country, this means dealing with quite a diverse range of weather patterns and potential storms, floods and extreme weather.

“Our aim is to understand the impact of those events so centres can remain open or quickly open to support the local community and make sure our consumer can access the retail community. This is also about supporting our retailers – they rely on us to enable them being open for trade,” Schulz says.

This has involved using CSIRO tools and scenarios analysis to make assessments of centres with higher risks.

“Our approach was to do a risk assessment and use the results of that to identify where we want to prioritise.”

The lessons of Cyclone Debbie in the Whitsundays

The Whitsundays for instance were hit by Cyclone Debbie in March last year. “We used the learnings from that to make some improvements.” Such as: “making sure the radios were charged ahead of the event. Making sure we had diesel.

“The cyclone passed and then everyone needed food and needed the shopping centre to open quickly.”

Climate change in the future is another big focus area for communities

The pressures for financial disclosure are a factor driving performance and strategies, and part of this is climate resilience, which is particularly acute for shopping centres, which are seen as a place of refuge, especially in very hot weather.

Resilience, Schulz says, can be as simple as making sure HVAC equipment at the end of its life is replaced with something that can stand up to extreme heat – “because if the system can’t cope it’s pretty dire”. It also means including generators that can be switched on in case the grid goes down. That’s where solar can also kick in with some extra power.

Community resilience

A third pillar of sustainability, Schulz says, is around social sustainability and with quite a few centres in areas that are socially vulnerable the aim is to come up with strategies that acknowledge the centres are part of their local community and to make decisions about their role within those communities.

If there are multiple problems it won’t help to deal with everything all at once, Schulz says.

“We recognise we operate in dozens of communities around Australia and our approach to community investment is to find a common theme and focus on a single issue. That’s not to say other issues are not important but we believe in being quite focused and can hopefully move the dial on chosen areas.

“For instance, through research the team found youth unemployment was higher than average in some communities we operate in and that’s reflected youth related sometimes anti social issues. This can impact on consumer perceptions of our business as well.

“An area we thought it’s important to focus on as a large employer is disengaged and unemployed youth – it made a lot of sense.

“A good program can do a lot of things,” she says. “It’s about choices the business makes and how that can impact on day-to-day business activity.” Not to mention the lives of the people within the communities.

For instance centres use social enterprises such as YMCA Rebuild that can carry out repairs and maintenance, the Activ group in WA and The House with No Steps in NSW.

The Beacon Foundation runs preventative programs for young people to “open their eyes to jobs and skills and catch them before they become disengaged”.

“The group runs mentoring programs with corporate partners to provide work, matched to our footprint.”

Other programs developed with Beacon is “Vicinity Uncovered”, a school program where centre or office staff talk to young people about their career journeys.

“Not everyone knew what they wanted to be when they grew up.”

Part of the program gets young people together to design shopping centres of the future with prizes for the person most likely to be a future CEO. This one “has really connected to our employees,” Schulz says.

The future will be greener

According to Schulz there is no doubt that the shopping centres of the future will be greener than the current crop.

There is big interest, she says, in Fraser’s Burwood shopping centre being refashioned from a former brickworks site. It’s directly pitched to a strong environmental profile including striving for the tough Living Building Challenge standard.

Biophilic design being trialled at the centre will “absolutely play to the future of consumer expectations,” and the expectations are that, at Burwood, it will lead to increased dwell time and foot traffic. There is no way she thinks this is a gimmick, she says, but the trouble is there is not much research into that space – certainly not compared with greener office buildings – so it’s a wait and see time.

“Everybody will be watching.”

But if the feeling is that Brickworks will prove what everyone expects it to prove – that highly ambitious greener centres will pay off – will others follow?

“I hope so,” Schulz says.

There’s a caveat. In many ways it’s easier to build a high achieving green centre from scratch and a lot harder to refurbish to that standard.

Most centres don’t have that luxury. Generally Vicinity refurbishes or at best can demolish part of the centre.

“It’s very rare we can impact on 100 per cent of a centre,” Schulz says.

And with industry leaders flagging there is very low capacity for new shopping centres, the big question is what everyone does with the existing crop.

As Schulz says, this is very much a wait and see time.","Not so much in shopping centres, where the biggest user of the building is the shopper who’s interested in the thing they’re buying, not so much the space they’re buying it in.

231,https://ensia.com/articles/wild-greens/,"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Ensia,"Innovators look to “accidental crops” as a nutritious, environmentally friendly and free source of food","Philip Stark was on a long run in the hills above Berkeley, California, when he started thinking differently about the wild green plants around him. “I knew some that were edible,” says Stark, a statistics professor at the University of California, Berkeley. With research interests in nutrition and health, he wanted to learn more about these edible plants and find out which ones could be foraged for food. “Once your brain starts to notice the environment that way — once plants are not just an undifferentiated sea of green — you see the plants everywhere.”

Edible wild greens are consumed globally, particularly during food shortages, and many are used medicinally in teas, poultices and supplements, Stark learned. But he found little about their nutritional qualities. Living in the San Francisco area, he started wondering if plants growing wild in cities — not just on the trails he ran and other less urban environments — were safe to eat. If some of them were, and if they were nutritious and free from pollutants, he wondered if foraging could potentially help combat food insecurity in cities, boost public health, and — because he lived in earthquake country — boost communities’ disaster resilience.

Stark and his research team set out to find answers. In a new paper, which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, they described what they found, including: Wild greens grow abundantly in poor industrial regions of San Francisco, even surviving droughts; the six most abundant greens tested had nutrients rivaling that of cultivated kale; and after the wild greens were rinsed in water, levels of pesticides, PCBs and heavy metals were well below doses considered safe by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The group has documented 126 edible species of wild food in the area so far.

Wild vs. Cultivated

While wild greens have been ignored and even vilified, domesticated greens have been bred for several traits — such as sweetness, yield, shelf life and visual appeal — that can compromise their nutritional value. Not only did the tested wild species feature generally higher vitamins and minerals than cultivated kale, they were full of phytonutrients, compounds that may help reduce ailments like cancer and heart disease.

Stark’s research complements evidence of nutritionally superior fruits from abandoned orchards and gardens, growing wild in the Boston area. Those findings follow other studies that find high nutrient concentrations in wild edible food — although there isn’t much information to go on.

“Despite the growing recognition that foraged foods are a component of urban food systems and urban ecosystems, surprisingly little is known about their safety, nutritional value, or availability,” Stark and colleagues wrote in their paper.

The evidence that is available for safety is mixed. While the wild greens in San Francisco had heavy metal content well below levels considered safe for consumption, some research shows that a few species have higher levels of contaminants when growing near major roadways or in rural areas. On the whole, research suggests that trace metals accumulate the least in legumes and the most in leafy greens, with root vegetables somewhere between. The advantages are apparent to Stark, both in urban and rural areas. “They are essentially universally available and free, so equity and access are clear,” he says.

“If I had my way,” Stark says, “municipalities would levy a one-time parcel tax — probably less than [US]$50 — to test the soil at every address for heavy metals and relevant industrial and agricultural contaminants. Then they could publish maps of where it’s safe to grow or forage food.”

Ecological Benefits

Beyond potential to be a nutritious and free edible resource, wild food offers several ecological benefits. These accidental crops don’t need to be cultivated or watered. They’re abundant in farms, gardens, sidewalks and median strips on public and private land. Those that are natives are well adapted to local ecosystems and their biodiversity. The hardy plants have thrived despite disruptive human activities and environmental extremes, and because they are close to where people live, there is no concern about associated “food miles” and the emissions that go with them.

The advantages are apparent to Stark, both in urban and rural areas. “They are essentially universally available and free, so equity and access are clear,” he says. And “embracing them as edible cover crops would be expected to reduce erosion on farms, attract pollinators, and improve farm biodiversity and soil health.” But, “convincing farmers that there is a market for what grows between the rows” is a challenge, Stark says. Obstacles and Opportunities Another challenge to widespread (re)adoption of these foods is financial constraints to continue the scientific work, Stark says. “It’s hard to get funding for this sort of thing, and tests for nutrition and toxicology are expensive.” Foraging laws can present one more obstacle — in some places it’s illegal to pick plants from public land. Food law and policy expert Baylen Linnekin is dedicated to improving America’s inconsistent and often conflicting foraging restrictions — many of which he writes are “wrongheaded and draconian.”

There have been reported instances of people getting in trouble with law enforcement for picking dandelions in Chicago and New York, while another forager was penalized for picking berries from a suburban park in Washington, D.C. Some foraging laws are in place to protect local ecosystems. So would-be urban foragers are cautioned to make sure they understand foraging etiquette and local laws.

And it’s also important to understand local plants, says Australian gardening expert Kate Wall. Although some weeds like dandelion and purslane grow around much of the world, others are specific to local areas. “So, to really get the best out of what’s available to you locally, source your information locally,” she advises. “There are local courses springing up in capital cities everywhere.”

But there’s the issue of whether people would even want to eat what they consider weeds if they could. Stark says it comes down to familiarity: People eat what they recognize and are comfortable with. For those wanting to broaden their culinary horizons into urban foraged food, he recommends taking a class from a local expert. Then make a list of plants — and parts of plants — that you know are safe. “Start with one plant you know is edible and bring some home for dinner,” he suggests. Then gradually add more species to your diet.

Wall has been eating edible wild greens since she was a child. She now runs regular educational workshops in Queensland, Australia, where participants forage and then have a meal together “based on weeds,” she says. Meanwhile, Stark’s team offers an annual “Wild/Feral Food Week” to showcase the gastronomic opportunities offered by wild foods and entice people and chefs to become more familiar with them.","The group has documented 126 edible species of wild food in the area so far.

The statewide initiative includes a detailed menu of sustainability best practices, tools and resources, peer learning, and opportunities for recognition.

The Council approved the resolution to join Sustainable CT on August 14 and designated the Common Council Planning Committee as the “Sustainability Team” for the program. Norwalk was officially registered with Sustainable CT on August 24.

“I am delighted the city has joined Sustainable CT in our latest efforts to develop and implement sustainability and renewable energy initiatives in Norwalk,” said Mayor Harry Rilling. “Being energy conscience is the right thing to do as we all have a moral obligation to lessen our environmental impact. I am glad the city has taken a leadership role and joined this important sustainability initiative.”

The Sustainable CT platform supports a broad range of actions, such as improving watershed management, supporting arts and creative culture, reducing energy use and increasing renewable energy, implementing “complete streets” (streets that meet the needs of walkers and bikers as well as cars), improving recycling programs, assessing climate vulnerability, supporting local businesses, and providing efficient and diverse housing options. There is no cost to participate and communities voluntarily select actions that meet their unique, local character and long-term vision. After successful implementation of a variety of actions, municipalities will be eligible for Sustainable CT certification.

“We are thrilled that Norwalk has passed a resolution to join Sustainable CT. The program builds on many current success stories in our communities to create and support more great places to live, work, and play,” said Lynn Stoddard, Director of the Institute for Sustainable Energy. “We are looking forward to working with the city as they pursue Sustainable CT certification.""

The initiative was developed under the leadership of the Institute for Sustainable Energy at Eastern Connecticut State University in partnership with the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities. Three Connecticut philanthropies - The Emily Hall Tremaine Foundation, the Hampshire Foundation, and the Common Sense Fund – have supported the program's development and launch.

233,https://www.theplanner.co.uk/opinion/is-sustainable-transport-a-myth-0,"Mon, 10 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Planner,Is sustainable transport a myth?,"In July, the government published its much-anticipated revised National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) . This has been described as one of the biggest shake-ups in the planning system. But how will this change affect the planning landscape?

Delivering sustainability plays a central role to the proposed changes in the NPPF and Chapter 9 (‘Promoting Sustainable Transport’) addresses this. It incorporates policies to promote a modal shift towards sustainable forms of transport. Paragraph 105(e), for example, promotes a greater shift to charging plug-in and other ultra-low emission vehicles.

Paragraph 106 discourages the use of maximum parking standards unless circumstance dictate, and endorses increased density in towns and cities if proposed developments are served well by public transport.

Will these policies be effective in tackling the UK’s ambition to promote sustainable communities?

Climate change is accepted to be one of the biggest threats facing the world. The summer heatwave that has swept across Europe is a reminder of the potential impacts. We appear to be on autopilot to environmental disaster. Surely altering this path is in the interests of all inhabited societies?

“Reducing levels of petrol-propelled cars is broadly accepted as one solution to reduce carbon emission”

The Climate Change Act 2008 seeks to to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the UK by at least 80 per cent (based on 1990 levels) by 2050. Planning is seen as one component to deliver this change, but it cannot deliver change alone.

Reducing levels of petrol-propelled cars is broadly accepted as one solution to reduce carbon emission.

But is this a dream? The UK seems to have a love affair with the car. Department for Transport Transport Statistics Great Britain 2017 shows car trips accounted for 65 per cent of all journeys made.

Milton Keynes Council is committed to promoting sustainable communities and neighbourhoods. Currently, the car accounts for 80 per cent of trips in Milton Keynes, even though it has one of the best cycle networks in the UK.

Its Mobility Strategy 2018-2036 reinforces the desire for sustainable transport. This explores the use of autonomous vehicles and smart technology to deliver mobility as a service. The emerging development plan (Plan:MK) continues the theme: it proposes policies to encourage the installation of electric vehicle charging points), maximise the use of sustainable transport for new development, and promote residential and office-led densification. Such policies are ahead of the planning curve and accord well with the new NPPF.

The new NPPF policies remain yet to be debated and implemented and, as such, their effectiveness is unknown.

One of the most effective ways to do this is through integrated performance. That is, assessing impacts and dependencies on nature and society to use the information in business and investor decision-making.

Even though the problems we’re facing are complex, we cannot be paralyzed by the complexity. We need input and insights from a range of experts and practitioners — from corporate sustainability and EHS professionals to finical accountants, management accountants, enterprise risk managers, academics, conservation organizations and more.

Here’s how to make it happen:

1. Eliminate the jargon

I’m an ecologist by training and entered the sustainability world through environmental management and business. Although people with a similar background may be comfortable with technical discussions around, for example, how to define ""natural capital,"" I can understand why someone from a different background could get completely lost in the flurry of jargon.

For example, could the average person articulate the difference among ESG, natural, social and human capital, multi-capital, integrated capital, pre-financial, extra-financial, non-financial or environmental and social issues? Probably not.

Jargon makes newcomers think they need to start their education or assessment from scratch (they don’t). One senior financial accountant from a major company recently told me: ""Why would you ever want to use the term non-financial? It just sounds irrelevant, like the stuff you don’t really care about and shove to the side.""

Surely, this isn’t the impression we want to give.

Individuals operating in the business and sustainability space need to align on terms and language because:

The jargon intimidates people who may want to engage

It makes newcomers think they need to start their education or assessment from scratch (they don’t)

It’s even starting to confuse experts when, in truth, we’re all talking about the same thing.

Under section three of this paper are some tips about how to align and simplify, making sure that your language is appropriate for your audience.

2. Experiment, learn and share

I have yet to come across a company who’d say that they’ve cracked the methodology for measuring and valuing all forms of capital. Usually, people take pride in their companies’ efforts to do so, but there’s also modesty that comes from the fact that all organizations are still experimenting.

Some are further along on their journey and can lead by example. Take, for instance, Kering’s EP&L, BASF’s Value-to-Society, Nestlé’s Social Impact Valuation (PDF), AkzoNobel’s 4D P&L, Novartis financial, environmental and social impact (PDF), Solvay’s Extra-financial statements, Natura’s EP&L and upcoming SP&L, and most recently Philips EP&L.

Some leading cement companies — LafargeHolcim (PDF), Argos Cementos and CEMEX — also have used similar approaches to develop integrated financial-like statements that all use KPMG’s True Value approach. This is an exciting development. Will we start to see sector-led methodologies, where companies who have the most material impacts in common align on how to proceed?

What about those companies who are experimenting internally but not sharing externally yet?

Companies with useful approaches should share as soon as they are ready. There’s a great collection business examples on natural as well as social and human capital that are always expanding (see the Natural Capital Coalition’s Hub, for example).

We will only progress on practical, consistent and comparable approaches to integrated performance if we share what business is actually doing.

Kudos to those who publicly shared their methodologies back in 2015 (PDF) of which PwC with its 400-plus page methodology for valuing corporate environmental impacts used with clients — it’s time for others to join in.

3. Don’t reinvent the wheel

Although what’s out there isn’t perfect, the Natural Capital Protocol (2016) is a great step forward. It was developed by WBCSD with input from many organizations and experts, on behalf of the Natural Capital Coalition.

In other words, it was a joint effort that went through a public consultation and is regarded as a generally accepted framework for business to measure and value natural capital.

Transforming the financial system to reward the most sustainable companies all starts with measuring and valuing impacts and dependencies. We’re working to do the same with social and human capital.

WBCSD is also behind the draft Social & Human Capital Protocol and has established a new Social & Human Capital Coalition to drive convergence on how companies can assess their relationships with people and communities.

Whatever work a company is undertaking — an assessment, sector-specific guidance, a new metric or methodology on a specific issue — it’s best to connect it to these generally accepted references to encourage coherence, buy-in and uptake.

One effective way of doing this is to join and participate in the Natural Capital Coalition and the Social & Human Capital Coalition.

4. Collaborate, compare, converge

In 2016, a handful of leading companies as part of the informal Impact Valuation Roundtable (IVR) used their own valuation methodologies on a common hypothetical example and got completely different results. Why? Because the methodologies and data each company used were completely different.

Worldwide, organizations need to work together to converge on standard approaches to avoid this issue.

WBCSD is working with MIT SHIFT, a user-friendly library of sustainability resources, to create a ""TripAdvisor for Tools"" by transferring resources from the Natural Capital Protocol Toolkit and later on from the Social & Human Capital to the SHIFT platform. The idea is to reduce the number of platforms companies need to reference so that they easily can find the tools they need.

Based on an analysis of practical applications of the tools, our overall ambition is to identify the tools that could become standardized approaches and accelerate progress to more comparable results.

5. Prepare for integrated performance

Recently, the head of Socially Responsible Investing at an asset management company asked groups of investors to put their hands up if they think a carbon price will be included in investment decisions next year. ""Maybe one or two people put their hand up,"" he said. ""Then I asked whether it will happen in 5, 10 or 20 years’ time. More and more hands go up.""

The future of financial accounting will change. We need to anticipate and influence what it looks like.

If we anticipate that investors increasingly will consider broader performance beyond purely financial measures, we need to think carefully about two fundamental things:

First, how can ESG impacts be considered alongside financial performance? Given the current rules around financial accounting, you can’t just add — for example — a carbon price to a financial statement. But could you include it in a long-term, new forward-looking financial statement, as proposed by the Reporting 3.0? Or could there be an additional ""integrated performance measure"" related to ESG that complements existing financial performance measures?

Second, can you add up E + S + G = total ESG performance? If you do, you might miss important trade-offs and risks. But by doing so, you also can get a sense of the overall relative value of the company to society. Just watch out when you interpret what the results actually mean, especially regarding a potential ""net (positive) impact.""

The way forward

Transforming the financial system to reward the most sustainable companies all starts with measuring and valuing impacts and dependencies. This information then can feed into risk management, broader decision-making, capital allocations, retirement plans, budgeting, management accounting, strategy, investor relations and overall corporate finance.

We’re deep in the R&D experimental phase to figure out how to achieve integrated performance management. We should expect it to be messy. We should expect it to be challenging, and to challenge our assumptions, knowledge and expectations. But people have the power to come up with tremendous innovative ways to progress, and I’m looking forward to seeing how we converge, collaborate and together change the rules of the game to reward more sustainable companies.","One of the most effective ways to do this is through integrated performance.

These courses are held by leading professionals, shedding light on the most current trends in construction.

Talks on sustainable cities have brought crowds to the Doha Exhibition & Convention Centre (DECC), eager to learn more about Qatar’s master urban plans and the smart technologies used to develop them.

Roberto Molinos, Professor at Instituto De Empresa in Spain says: “Technology in buildings is crucial to enable the sustainable management of a city. Great opportunities arise by adopting these technologies in the construction industry, and we see that Qatar is extremely keen in doing so.”

Eng. Amal Yousuf Al-Mulla, Quality And Sustainability Engineer Technical Office at Ashghal, adds: “Adopting Lean methods in construction, health and safety, waste recycling are examples of the commitment already made to meet the Qatar 2030 Vision utilizing latest technology in Project Management, recycling, and BIM (Building Information Modeling). Tech, digital and BIM all have important contributions to make, to improve productivity and also disrupt the current delivery model through innovation to deliver superior performance.”

With experience across many leading projects in the country, including Hamad International Airport, Tornado Tower, Sidra Medical Research Center, Lusail Car Parks, Doha Oasis and Doha Metro, Mr. Youssef A. Wazni, Senior Sales Manager at Thyssenkrupp Elevator Qatar confirms, “In Qatar, clients are early adopters of innovative technologies, always looking for increasingly efficient and sustainable solutions to apply to their projects.”



Dr. Hossam Samir Ibrahim, Senior Urban & Regional Planning Expert for the Ministry of Municipality and Environment says, “Evolving urban ways of life through the use of innovative technologies is at the centre of sustainable cities. The process starts by defining goals around the quality of life and growth in a green city, focusing on health, mobility, energy, smart citizens and smart learning.”

The Big 5 Qatar hosts a total of 40 free-to-attend workshops, running until 26 September and covering a wide range of topics. Beyond Sustainability, visitors can listen to experts in the field of Project Finance and Project Management, Architecture and Building Design, and the Women in Construction Series.

Speaking at Women in Construction Seminar series, Ms. Omeima Ismaiel, Founder of The Architects Hub, shares her positive outlook on the construction industry in Qatar, “As an architect and through some of the projects on which I have worked, I am always inspired by the willingness to embrace novel experiences and innovative technologies.”

She concludes, “With such an open mind set, Qatar is surely a good place for trade fairs and business networking.”

Reflecting the industry trends revealed throughout this year’s education agenda, The Big 5 Qatar displays hundreds of innovative products and new technologies across seven dedicated sectors: Plant Machinery and Vehicles, Concrete, Construction Tools & Building Materials, MEP Services, Building Interiors & Finishes, Building Envelope & Special Construction, and Construction Technologies & Innovations.

Supported by the European Union, the platform features 34 selected World Heritage sites spread across 19 European Union countries, and it has been developed in collaboration with National Geographic.

The launch will take place when UNESCO Paris Headquarters opens its doors to the public for the European Heritage Days event on 15 September. World Heritage Journeys is co-funded by the European Union and promotes sustainable travel to some of the most remarkable World Heritage sites in Europe. It encourages people to travel beyond the major tourist hubs, staying longer and experiencing more of what the local region has to offer. This initiative is part of a new alliance formed between UNESCO and National Geographic.

“Our goal is to change how people travel. Staying longer in destinations, experiencing the local culture and its environment, and gaining a deeper knowledge and appreciation of World Heritage values,” said Mechtild Rössler, Director of the World Heritage Centre at UNESCO.

World Heritage Journeys invites travelers to travel along four cultural heritage itineraries—Royal Europe, Ancient Europe, Romantic Europe and Underground Europe—which intertwine to tell fascinating stories of Europe's heritage and history. The website has practical information and tools to support travelers in planning their European holidays based on local knowledge about the destinations’ cultural heritage.

“In addition to reaching travelers directly, we hope that the travel industry—including tour operators, travel agents, and local and national tourism authorities—will be inspired by the content we have curated, and will develop and promote authentic tourism that aligns with the goals of the project and reflects the outstanding universal value of World Heritage,” added Ms. Rossler.

World Heritage Journeys will also play a key role in attracting Chinese visitors to Europe for the 2018 EU/China Tourism Year, an initiative led by the European Commission and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the People’s Republic of China in collaboration with the European Travel Commission (ETC). The website is available in English, Chinese and French. The platform also contributes to the goals of the 2018 European Year of Cultural Heritage.

“This project is a great example of how National Geographic ignites the explorer in all of us looking to explore the farthest reaches of the Earth and beyond. It seeks to contribute to the economic health of the communities in and around the World Heritage sites, and guide tourists to unique cultural attractions and experiences, as recommended by local experts,” said Frank Biasi, Director of digital development and travel programs at National Geographic Maps. “With this local knowledge, the website encourages travelers from North America, China and other major tourism markets to travel differently and travel deeper, and use the platform to inspire and plan their European trips.”

Sustainable certifications benchmark:

Certification is one of the most powerful and used tools to measure the sustainable aspect of eco-touristic experiences. In fact, certifications enable all type of organizations to deliver qualitative experiences to their consumers while enhancing environmental, economic, cultural, and social dimensions.

According to a study conducted by GreenHotelWorld.com (2016) in July 2015, only 6.2% of 130,000+ hotels worldwide have gained an eco-certification. The percentage of green certified hotels per continent is described as:

North America: 10.1%,

Europe: 6.1%,

Oceania: 4.8%,

Africa 3.7%,

South America: 2.7%,

Asia: 0.9%

Thus, tourism-oriented organizations might wonder what the real benefits of eco- certifications are. Thanks to precise and defined indicators and processes, gaining a certification may help to:

– Implement an efficient management of resources (human, economic, environmental) that are critical for the organization survival,

– Reduce operating costs via sustainable practices or technologies,

– Give external credibility that the organization’s actions in the path of sustainability are effective and efficient.

– Increase revenues by targeting eco-conscious customers,

– Establish and consolidate a sustainable positioning on the worldwide market.

– Enjoy new promotional canals via the certifier organism own network. On the other hand, it is important to note that obtaining an eco-certification can be a challenging task that generates cost before generating profits. Hundreds of certifications are available worldwide and parameters such as price, reach, complexity, or process may vary from a certification to another. To different degrees, they virtually all address typical sustainability matters through set of criteria and baseline that are defined by the Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC): energy, water, and waste management, heritage conservation, biodiversity protection, local culture preservation and respect, maximization of social and economic benefits for the host population, and so on. It might be confusing for tourism organizations to select the most satisfying certification to fulfill their own needs and concerns. The choice of an eco-certification will depend on the goals followed by the organization. As we will see below, some certification are more focus on environmental protection, others have wide considerations of societal values and cultural heritage conservations; some others try to create a balance between those topics.

Worldwide great sustainable practices:

1) Using green renewable energy: the case of Faroe Island.

Issue(s) addressed: green energy supply.

Faroe Island, an archipelago in the North Atlantic Sea, has a very ambitious and challenging goal: becoming totally free of fossil fuel power by 2030 and to only use green electrical energy to fulfill its needs. By investing consequently in wind power, wind turbines, tide plants, batteries, pump systems, and to some extent, solar power stations, the islands aim is to completely cut imports of fossil fuels for energy consumption. By mixing different renewable energy sources to balance the grid, Faroe Islands plans to overcome the incidence of meteorological conditions on renewable energy production. Moreover, the government is also developing an important electric car plan which will (in the optimistic scenario) make irrelevant the use and importation of pollutant vehicles by 2030.

SEV, the Faroese electricity company that undertook this promising project in 2015, received the 2015 Nordic Council Nature and Environment Prize for this initiative.

The results of this action are already effective: in 2015, the company recorded an electrical production record and in 2017, only two years after the beginning of the project, 51% of its electrical production was generated by green sources.

2) São Tomé and Príncipe Island: A war against plastic bottles.

Issue(s) addressed: pollution, water accessibility, education.

It is not a secret anymore; plastic is an environmental and public health disaster that critically pollutes and destroys lands and oceans, and leaves toxic micro plastics in drinking water and food.

In 2012, São Tomé and Príncipe Island has been declared a biosphere reserve by UNESCO and since that announcement, the local government is working on the preservation of its natural environment and the access to drinking water. Since 2014, the Island is walking on the path of a zero-plastic future with aspiring goals: to become the first plastic-free island by 2020, to educate its population to environmental preservation, and to give access to public drinking water to its

inhabitants.

The nation-wide project is involving the whole population of the island. A “No plastic campaign” was launched in towns and schools to educate children and adults to the preservation of natural environment and the danger of plastic. The government is also working on the development of a tax aimed to reduce plastic imports.

During punctual events, the whole population, and also transportation and recycling companies were engaged in collecting plastic bottles. Fifty plastic bottles collected can be exchanged for one reusable plastic-free stainless steel bottle to the benefits of the whole local population. The “Biosphere Bottle” can be refilled at various drinking water fountains, strategically installed throughout the island public space, and local public workers were trained to maintain the drinking water dispensers. Once the bottles collected, they were transported to facilities to be recycled or eco-disposed. From 2014 to 2016, more than six tons of plastic have been collected and processed.

3) New Zealand and its green national transportation plan.

Issue(s) addressed: transportation, pollution, tourism sights accessibility

Transportation policy, including air, marine, and ground options, is a critical matter for Destination Management Organization that should be developed in an efficient and cost effective way. It should also enhance the sustainable aspect of the destination, and facilitate the destination accessibility. Local public transportation network has to facilitate visitors’ journeys to and from tourist attractions, make it pleasant, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

In this area, the New Zealand government gives a good example of a sustainable national transportation policy, by encouraging the use non- motorized vehicles such as cycling and walking. The local transport agency was looking for alternatives solutions for both tourists and residents and thus, has connected urban centers and tourist attractions by upgrading already existing infrastructures with designed cycle routes. Also, to make cycling more convenient for daily use, the government has developed bicycle- sharing programs.

According to the New Zealand Transport Agency, investing in cycling had several benefits for the country: towns and cities are more enjoyable (e.g. aesthetic, less noisy), safer, more accessible and less polluted, local councils have less costs, and people using bikes on a daily basis are healthier. Investing in biking infrastructures is also good for economically disadvantaged people, and people who do not drive. Tourists in New Zealand themselves found biking more convenient and recreational than traditional public transportation.

4) Sandals Resorts International Group’s Farmers Program

Issue(s) addressed: linkages, local communities benefits

The Sandals Group is a large international resort chain and an important employer in the Caribbean that operates in Jamaica, the Bahamas, and St. Lucia and Antigua. Its Farmers Program is a good example of how different sectors, and people working in them, can benefit from a sustainably managed tourism phenomenon and from responsible private companies. Deeply linked to several industries, tourism can have a snowball effect that directly or

indirectly ameliorate local communities’ life through job creation and improvement, education, income increase, or infrastructural development.

In the case of Jamaica, the Sandals Resorts International Group developed a strong partnership with local farmers, via the Rural Agricultural Development Authority, since 1996. Before that, Sandals Groups used to purchase food outside of the country for several reasons such as mediocre quality standards, poor reliability, low volume of production, and lack of communication between the group and local suppliers.

With the development of the Farmers Program, the international resort group wanted to source its food locally, and started to created strong relationship between its resorts and local food producers that led to several benefits for both sides. With the group assistance (through education, interest-free investment, and improved communication and information sharing), local farmers had the opportunity to increase the quality and the production volume of their product, improve their incomes, upgrade their production methods and techniques, have a more reliable job with strong demand, and attend workshops to ameliorate their marketing procedures. On the other hand, the group could reduce its sourcing costs, increase the quality of its product, gain local recognition, and improve its reputation and brand awareness.

5) Tourism eLearning in Switzerland

Issue(s) addressed: education, local population empowerment.

The national tourism board of Switzerland launched in April 2017 the Switzerland Travel Academy: an eLearning platform, consisting of core and specialization modules, that provides certifications to become a Switzerland Travel Expert. Totally online and multi- screen, the platform is open to everyone, from everywhere.

The certification process is simple and free: once they have signed in, users have full access to a range of online courses in which they learn about the country geography, culture, attractions, transportation offers, itineraries, events, and so on. Once they feel comfortable, users can pass the final exam to become a certificated Switzerland

Travel Expert until December of the following year. They can also renew their certificate and stay informed through new and updated modules.

The modules make an important use of images, videos and quizzes, and give access to specialized topics such as family holidays, luxury, leisure, or nature-based tourism. Another important part of the platform is the ability it gives users to discuss with the national tourism board and other travel professionals on the forum.

Interactive, connected, free, professionalizing, the Switzerland Travel Academy is a very interesting case of how ICTs can empower local people and deepen education accessibility. People who cannot attend classes for diverse reasons (economical, geographical, socio-demographical or other) or people who want to change career, have the opportunity to become travel experts and actively participate in the positive tourism development of their region.

On April 25th 2018, 437 professionals became certified Switzerland travel experts in the comfort of their home and are now designing the journey of their international clients.

6) Building a Turtle Sanctuary in Dominican Republic.

Issue(s) addressed: marine biodiversity, tourists education

The story of the Turtle Sanctuary localized in Mano Juan Island (Dominican Republic) is about a turtle hunter who became their hero. Pelagio Paulino aka Negro has been a fisherman all his live and used to hunt turtles for their eggs that were believed to be a remedy erectile dysfunction. A decade ago, he built the biggest nesting area for marine turtles in Dominican Republic and, with the help of Yolanda Leon, scientist, he works hard to preserve this critically endangered species, and teach locals and visitors about the necessity of preserving the marine biodiversity.

With the effort of the local fisherman, preservation has improved and monitoring activities are regularly held to protect sea turtles beach nests.

In his Turtle Sanctuary, Pelagio Paulino shows to visitors why he created this project and how he protects marine biodiversity. For example, he helps them understand the danger biodiversity encounters when they buy illegal handicraft made from turtles’ shells or when we throw plastic on the beach.

With his project, Pelagio Paulino diversified the experiences available in Mano Juan Island and created the main tourism activity of the island while making visitors more aware of critical sustainable issue and making a great effort in protecting the local marine biodiversity.

Today, his sanctuary is supported by the Dominican Republic Minsitry of Tourism, which is now exporting Pelagio Paulino ideas to other local marine species in danger. It is a great example of how individual projects can have a big echo and impact on local tourism policies.

But the continent’s huge potential can be unlocked by eco-tourism, cultural experiences, domestic travel and political stability, said experts at an African tourism conference hosted by Airbnb in Cape Town last week.

“When you look at the success stories, it’s those countries who’ve embraced trends,” said the African Tourism Association’s (ATA) managing director Naledi Khabo who spoke at the summit. “When you look at some countries which have made sustainability a focal point, like Tanzania, or Rwanda, they’re very attractive for certain travellers.”

Eco-friendly safaris and carbon-neutral lodging draw increasing numbers of tourists from Europe and North America. The number of tourists visiting Tanzania has more than doubled since 2006 to above one million contributing 14% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), according to Tanzania Invest.

Khabo, who speaks for the African tourism sector, said other success stories included South Africa, which is promoting the diversification of their products beyond the safari. South Africa has witnessed a boom of experience-based tours, taking travellers to disadvantaged township and rural communities as well as wine farms and game lodges. Abigail Mbalo founded the 4RoomEkasi concept to showcase food and lifestyles in South Africa’s black communities to visitors

“We tapped into the development of tourism in rural and township spaces,” she said. “We are now starting to see cultural inclusivity. Those areas have been untapped.”

A safe place to travel?

Tourism is a major employer of poor black South Africans and accounts for nearly 7,00,000 jobs — a rare success story in a country with an unemployment rate of almost 27%. The World Bank, which spoke at the tourism summit, praised the emerging trend for community-based travel projects like Mbalo’s for creating opportunities for women and young people.

“Every new business, destination, route or visitor creates opportunity for local people,” said the World Bank in a statement. While many African destinations have courted foreign visitors’ hard currency, Kenya has invested heavily in promoting “staycations”. The country moved to promote domestic travel after dips in foreign arrivals following violent unrest and criminal attacks in recent years.

“We have managed to develop the domestic market. Twenty-one percent of Airbnb occupancy is domestic market. It’s benefiting us,” said Kenya’s Tourism Minister Najib Balala at the conference. Tourism, now the second largest driver of Kenya’s GDP growth, was worth $1.2 billion in 2017. But many countries on the continent have struggled to woo foreign visitors fearful of political instability and violence. “The biggest challenge is perception,” said Khabo. “Sometimes there is a real threat and sometimes it’s just perceived.”

Rwanda’s transformation

Rwanda is one country that has successfully transformed its global image. The small east African nation was torn apart by a genocide in 1994 but has since established itself as a high-end destination. “Tourism is the number one foreign exchange earner, which is amazing to see in a country like Rwanda,” said Rosette Rugamba who was appointed by President Paul Kagame as head of Rwanda Tourism from 2003 to 2010. “It is a huge contributor to the image-building of our country.”

Zimbabwe, which is home to some of Africa’s best game and Victoria Falls, has enjoyed a boost in visitor numbers since long-serving despot Robert Mugabe resigned in November. While the number of foreign visitors to Victoria Falls jumped nearly 50% in the first quarter of this year, the country still operates far below its tourist potential. “The onus is on African governments and tourism boards to be more proactive in addressing perceptions,” added Khabo.

One African country that has seen its tourism industry squeezed is Egypt, once a magnet for travellers that has since the 2011 revolt seen visitor numbers plummet, despite the huge draw of the Pyramids and the Red Sea. Another is the Democratic Republic of Congo, which for years has been riven with often deadly political and ethnic unrest. There’s an enormous amount the DRC has to offer including gorillas, pristine national parks, and smouldering volcanoes, said tourism author Anita Mendiratta, who spoke at the conference. “That’s limited now because of the safety and security.”

“When you look at the success stories, it’s those countries who’ve embraced trends,” said the African Tourism Association’s (ATA) managing director Naledi Khabo who spoke at the summit.
Khabo, who speaks for the African tourism sector, said other success stories included South Africa, which is promoting the diversification of their products beyond the safari.

241,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/09/14/national/tokyo-showcase-efforts-sustainable-water-cycle/,"Fri, 14 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Japan Times,Tokyo to showcase efforts on sustainable water cycle,"Tokyo will host the IWA World Water Congress & Exhibition for the first time, bringing together over 6,000 water-related professionals from over 100 countries. Director General of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government’s Bureau of Waterworks Masahiro Nakajima shared his expectations on this largest-ever congress.

“The 21st century is called the water century,” said Nakajima. “As the global water sector faces huge challenges, this congress is significant since different water professionals from around the world will gather to share, exchange and discuss their knowledge on water-related matters. While Tokyo Waterworks is a supplier of urban water, this congress will cover many areas from water shortages, droughts, agricultural water, environmental water issues, including sustainable development goals and more, meaning the topic of water will be discussed from multilateral perspectives.”

Being part of this international congress, Nakajima believes that Tokyo Waterworks’ initial goal is to successfully organize and execute this global event. “Then after the congress, we must show specific achievement results and carry them out. What we often call legacy is important,” he said. Tokyo Waterworks needs to disseminate its accumulated knowledge and technology while picking up cutting-edge techniques shared from around the world.

120 years have passed since a modern waterworks system was established in Tokyo. Although Tokyo has faced challenges in the past, today, Tokyo waterworks provides clean water to around 13 million people. “Tokyo has mountains and rivers that run into Tokyo Bay. Due to Tokyo’s landform and steep gradient, rainwater from rivers rapidly flows into the bay. In this sense, Tokyo has some risks in terms of water. We built dams and took other measures to secure water in this megacity,” said Nakajima. With these acquired skills and experiences, Tokyo waterworks is a world-class operation with only a 3 percent leakage rate.

Tokyo waterworks already has a proven track record regarding international cooperation in the field of human resource development, project development and information dissemination. According to Nakajima, an average of 400 water business personnel from Asian countries come every year to Tokyo’s Bureau of Waterworks Training and Technical Development Center annually, for lectures and training from the bureau’s experienced staff.

As part of official development assistance (ODA) activities classified as non-revenue water projects, Tokyo waterworks dispatches staff to places such as Yangon, Myanmar, and Delhi, India, for technical support, especially regarding leakage detection. “In the case of Myanmar’s ODA project, we were involved from initial planning, repairing water pipes and installing water meters. We mainly support the modernization of the water environment, such as water pipes and water technology in Asian countries,” said Nakajima.

Tokyo waterworks’ staff present and share their knowledge and expertise at various international conferences, such as this congress, for accumulation of innovative cases and cooperation with leading cities.

To welcome overseas guests, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government will hold Tokyo Garden Night, an omotenashi (Japanese hospitality) reception, on Sept. 18 in Tokyo’s historical Kiyosumi Gardens for guests to experience and understand Japanese culture and enjoy Japanese food and drinks. “We’d like to offer delicious Japanese food and present some Japanese culture so guests can enjoy what Tokyo and Japan have to offer,” Nakajima said.

Several technical tours are also scheduled for Sept. 21, where participants can visit Tokyo waterworks and other related facilities to learn about Tokyo’s innovative water technologies. The Akigase Intake Weir and Asaka Purification Plant and the Training and Technical Development Center of the Tokyo Bureau of Waterworks are among the planned tour sites.

As the host country and to help support this congress, approximately 200 Tokyo waterworks’ staff are involved in various ways. For example, about 100 members wearing white Tokyo waterworks staff jackets will be on site to assist participants.

“There are only a few countries in the world where you can drink tap water and Tokyo is one of them. Considering that Tokyo is a megacity of 13 million, this is amazing,” said Nakajima. To promote the city’s safe, potable water, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government is selling bottled tap water, branded as “Tokyo Pure Water.” Last year, the label was redesigned to mimic Edo-kiriko (traditional Japanese cut glass), with a blue translucent design and the kanji for mizu (water).

“Recently, plastic waste has become an issue, so the Tokyowater Drinking Station, a temporary water dispenser, will be installed at Tokyo Big Sight during the congress. This water dispenser will allow guests to drink cold tap water and fill their bottles,” said Nakajima. The Tokyowater Drinking Station features the same Edo-kiriko graphic as the Tokyo Pure Water bottles and has a physical design that accommodates all visitors, including those in wheelchairs.

“Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike is the keynote speaker on the morning of Sept. 17 and will speak about Tokyo’s water situation, global water issues and how to resolve these matters,” said Nakajima. “The governor will be delivering an important message, so I hope everyone will take this opportunity to listen to this speech.” Gov. Koike’s keynote speech is to be themed around a sustainable urban water cycle.

On top of reducing collisions and alleviating traffic, autonomous vehicles have the potential to dramatically shrink our carbon footprint. That’s a major win — not only for the public but for businesses, too.

Fuel, electricity and business travel cost a lot of money. Reducing a company’s carbon footprint is as much a financial boon as it is environmental. Companies that up the ante by replacing their piloted vehicle fleets with autonomous ones can get ahead of the curve as demand for sustainable practices increase from both consumers and the government. Here’s how driverless vehicles can help companies lead that charge.

Efficient driving patterns

One of the main precepts behind driverless technology is that robots will be smoother on the pedals than we are. Hard-braking events and excessive acceleration contribute to increased CO2 emissions — and they’re inherently the domain of humans.

Companies that embrace automation may see a reduction in costs associated with wear and tear, and they’ll also be playing a part in shrinking their footprint. Driverless fleets can optimize scheduling (which we’ll get to later), plus choose fuel-efficient routes. Efficient driving behavior also helps mitigate the effects of congestion — another source of CO2 emissions.

Enhanced traffic flow

There’s a strong correlation between traffic congestion and CO2 emissions. One study from the University of California Transportation Center makes the case for policymakers to focus on congestion-mitigation programs to reduce greenhouse gases. They found that improving collective traffic speeds from around 34 mph to about 53 mph could reduce CO2 by over 20 metric tons.

As mentioned above, the main variable for stop-and-go traffic is the human driver. Remove the human variable, and the results are impressive.

Autonomous vehicles will interact with each other and highway infrastructure, such as traffic lights, signs, medians and the road itself. This constant web of interaction enables cars to move in a kind of synchronous dance, improving traffic flow and dramatically reducing accidents. Last year, at the Washington Auto Show, a team of researchers reported that even just 5 percent of driverless cars on the road could reduce fuel consumption by upwards of 40 percent and minimize braking by a whopping 99 percent.

Improved aerodynamic efficiency

One byproduct of synchronous-moving, driverless cars is their ability to follow each other closely on the road. Keeping a close following distance could improve fuel efficiency, especially for a convoy of commercial trucks.

It’s a system called “highway platooning,” and an MIT study found that it could reduce fuel costs by up to 20 percent — the more trucks in the platoon, the less drag you get. In addition, platooning improves scheduling policies. In their simulation, convoys leaving at fixed five-minute intervals were more efficient than those leaving at, say, three- to seven-minute intervals.

The study does not take into account how human drivers would feel sharing the road with an impassable wall of trucks stretching several hundred feet. As Esurance found in a recent report, the majority of drivers in the US are still wary about self-driving cars. Obviously, parameters are in order for everyone to get on board.

Innovation alongside smart policy

Research from the Department of Energy reports that autonomous vehicles could bring fuel savings of almost 90 percent — if solid policies are in place, that is. If not, fuel consumption could conversely increase by 200 percent.

One of the biggest drawbacks for self-driving vehicles is that they could increase the number of miles driven on the road without proper oversite. Not having to watch the wheel means people might be more amenable to commuting farther distances and taking extra trips.

There’s also the issue of zero-occupancy vehicles picking up groceries or simply driving around the block in lieu of parking (especially in crowded cities). Diligent efforts from the government and automakers will therefore be important to assure efficiency. There’ve been talks of incentivizing cars to be programmed to choose fuel-efficient routes. Highway mandates could also penalize vehicles that are unoccupied, or reward car owners who let their vehicles be used for ride-hailing.

The onus will still be on businesses to implement best practices around automation. Doing so protects their bottom line and streamlines general business operations. More importantly, it improves the health of our ecosystem — the very system that sustains us.","Self-driving cars are on the horizon and widespread adoption holds many promises.

An email recently landed in our inbox from a reader named Tammy, who shared about an online sustainable fashion short course that she had recently completed:

I have a huge passion for Ethical Sourcing and have been trying to learn as much as possible and have found a course that was very helpful and eye-opening.

Fashion & Sustainability is a short course through the London College of Fashion. This course is a collaboration between Kering, who are the owners of designers like Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen and Gucci. It brings your attention to the fact that fashion is the 2nd dirtiest industry in the world. It highlights the impacts of fashion on both social and environmental levels. A huge eye-opener for me was the impact of everyday items being produced every day by retailers globally. Cow leather having the most impact on the environment from cradle to gate, silk and then cotton.

I was hoping you could spread the word on your website for anyone else looking for more information.

When I checked out the course, I realised it is being delivered by Future Learn, the same brilliant organisation behind a free online course that I had enrolled in a couple of years ago on building a sustainable fashion business. I was impressed with the quality of that course so hence why we’re sharing about this one too.

A big thanks to our lovely reader Tammy for bringing it to our attention!

for Cana­da T&T

The bril­liant blue of the Caribbean Sea shim­mers as it sur­rounds T&T and the over 7,000 is­lands of the Caribbean re­gion. It is a blue that im­mers­es us in its beau­ty, its boun­ty, its re­silience, its fragili­ty. As the oceans con­tin­ue to sus­tain us, we be­gin a jour­ney to tran­si­tion to­ward a sus­tain­able blue econ­o­my—a com­mit­ment to har­ness the po­ten­tial of our oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers for eco­nom­ic growth, while en­sur­ing con­ser­va­tion for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions.

Cana­da is ho­n­oured to be co-host­ing the Sus­tain­able Blue Econ­o­my Con­fer­ence with Kenya in No­vem­ber 2018. Work­ing with Kenya and oth­er glob­al stake­hold­ers, we are en­sur­ing the con­fer­ence is a vi­tal step in help­ing the world tran­si­tion to a blue econ­o­my that is pros­per­ous, in­clu­sive, and sus­tain­able.

As part of this com­mit­ment, Cana­da’s Am­bas­sador for the Sus­tain­able Blue Econ­o­my Con­fer­ence, William Cros­bie, will vis­it T&T on 12-13 Sep­tem­ber, fol­lowed by Guyana, Ja­maica, and Be­lize. This vis­it high­lights Cana­da’s sup­port and fo­cus on the Caribbean and un­der­scores the tru­ly in­ter­na­tion­al scope of the con­fer­ence.

As Trin­bag­o­ni­ans know, Cana­da’s ties to the wa­ter run deep in our iden­ti­ty as a na­tion. Cana­da has the longest coast­line in the world—over 200,000 kms. We bor­der three oceans and we have one of the largest stores of fresh­wa­ter in the world. The health and sus­tain­abil­i­ty of our oceans and wa­ters couldn’t be more im­por­tant.

The same is true for T&T and the Caribbean. As Small Is­land States (or as re­cent­ly coined to me—Big Ocean States), the Caribbean blue econ­o­my is as mul­ti-faceted as the con­fer­ence themes them­selves: food se­cu­ri­ty; man­age­ment of ma­rine life & con­ser­va­tion; peo­ple, com­mu­ni­ties & so­ci­eties; trans­porta­tion & glob­al con­nec­tiv­i­ty; em­ploy­ment, job cre­ation & pover­ty erad­i­ca­tion; cities, tourism & cul­ture; en­er­gy re­sources & sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment; cli­mate ac­tion, agri­cul­ture & pol­lu­tion-free oceans; and, mar­itime se­cu­ri­ty & en­force­ment. A huge cross-sec­tion of is­sues—all in­te­gral to T&T and the Caribbean!

Cana­da is co-host­ing this con­fer­ence to help repo­si­tion the blue econ­o­my in the main­stream of eco­nom­ic plan­ning—not in the mar­gins. The world has ral­lied around the enor­mous pres­sures fac­ing our oceans, from plas­tic pol­lu­tion to the sig­nif­i­cant im­pacts of cli­mate change. At the same time, there is in­ter­na­tion­al recog­ni­tion that we must do more to de­vel­op our wa­ters in an in­clu­sive and sus­tain­able man­ner to cre­ate jobs and com­bat pover­ty and hunger—for the ben­e­fit of all. This con­fer­ence ad­dress­es both sides of the coin—rec­og­niz­ing that healthy wa­ters and eco­nom­ic de­vel­op­ment are not mu­tu­al­ly ex­clu­sive but go hand in hand.

It takes many play­ers to tran­si­tion to a blue econ­o­my—it can’t be done by gov­ern­ment alone. As such, Am­bas­sador Cros­bie will meet with the Min­istry of Plan­ning and De­vel­op­ment, the Min­istry of Agri­cul­ture, Land and Fish­eries, rep­re­sen­ta­tives of the To­ba­go House of As­sem­bly, the In­sti­tute of Ma­rine Af­fairs, oth­er Heads of Mis­sions from the Caribbean and be­yond, and lead­ers from T&T’s civ­il so­ci­ety, busi­ness, acad­e­mia, and re­gion­al in­sti­tu­tions com­mu­ni­ty. He will dis­cuss ex­pec­ta­tions around the con­fer­ence, seek in­put on con­crete out­comes, en­gage with Caribbean ex­perts, and en­cour­age ac­tive par­tic­i­pa­tion and sup­port for the con­fer­ence.

To be suc­cess­ful, a blue econ­o­my must be in­clu­sive. We know that sup­port­ing the lead­er­ship and em­pow­er­ment of women, youth and in­dige­nous peo­ples as agents of pos­i­tive change, will en­able us to achieve the full ben­e­fits of the blue econ­o­my. This con­fer­ence will strive to am­pli­fy the voic­es of women and girls, es­pe­cial­ly women from least de­vel­oped coun­tries and Small Is­land De­vel­op­ing States.

In­no­va­tors and en­tre­pre­neurs will al­so have an im­por­tant role to play to en­sure that eco­nom­ic de­vel­op­ment is al­so a win for so­ci­ety and the en­vi­ron­ment.

For those who don’t give much thought to the origin of everyday household items, the Canadian roots of the disposable trash bag may come as a surprise.

Every day, Canadians buy more than a million Glad garbage bags, an essential staple item created in 1950 by Canadian inventors Harry Wasylyk and Larry Hansen. Originally intended for commercial use, the polyethelene bags were first sold to the Winnipeg General Hospital before Union Carbide Company bought the idea in the 1960s. They then began manufacturing them for household use under the brand name of Glad.

It would be yet another Canadian who would finesse the trash bag as we know it today through the discovery of compostable plastics. In 1971, University of Toronto chemist James Guillet developed a plastic material that decomposes when left in direct sunlight, paving the way for the sustainable waste management solutions that have since become synonymous with Glad and the Clorox Company of Canada, which owns the brand today.

Now in its 51st year of operation, the world’s only manufacturer of Glad compostable bags is located in the south-central Ontario town of Orangeville at a facility that operates at full capacity with 120 staff. A designated “zero waste to landfill” site, the Orangeville plant is a Canadian success story, recently doubling capacity for its compostable bags manufacturing line while also making clear, black and white garbage bags, blue recycling bags, and Cling food wrap.

It has also invested significantly in reducing its energy use and overall footprint in its factory, through measures such as installing LED lighting and office skylights, utilizing more efficient HVAC units, and upgrading the plant’s air compressors. Sustainability is a key objective of the $22-million in investments the company has made over the past six years, including new manufacturing infrastructure that will reduce the use of materials like plastic resin while improving the strength of compostable bags.

Open this photo in gallery For more than 50 years, the Glad plant in Orangeville, Ont., has been quietly creating innovative products to minimize the amount of material going to landfills and to support recycling programs across the country.

“In the manufacturing of trash bags, a very high percentage of overall costs is associated with the cost of resin,” says Mike Pilato, president and general manager of the Clorox Company of Canada. “Our main objective is to minimize the resin we use while ensuring the customer also has a strong bag.

“We’ve invested to double our output because we know that in municipalities that allow compostable bags, the compost participation rates are three times higher, which help divert waste away from landfills.”

Since the late 1980s, Glad has partnered with cities from Vancouver to Halifax to launch waste diversion programs across Canada, providing residents with product samples and education to increase their participation. Some of those products include almost all of Ontario’s clear, blue and compostable bag programs, clear bag garbage and blue bag recycling programs in Newfoundland, and the introduction of compostable bags in Montreal and Calgary.

In addition, for the past eight years, Glad has also supported cleanup initiatives with annual events in 21 cities both large and small, from Iqaluit and Chilliwack, B.C., to Brockville, Ont. and Edmonton.

As of 2016, approximately half of Canada has been on a curbside compost program, a number expected to grow significantly in the next 10 years thanks to new waste diversion efforts such as Ontario’s Food and Organic Waste Framework, which requires all businesses, institutions and high-rise buildings to prevent food waste.

Almost all communities accept Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI) certified compostable bags, including Glad. Glad currently occupies a 36-per-cent market share of the bioresin compostable bag market, with main competitors including store brands, Biosak, Al Pack, and Bag to Earth.

“We have transformed from making garbage bags into a company that educates the public on composting – and it is that ability to adapt to changing needs and times that has kept us thriving for 51 years,” Mr. Pilato says.

Over the past two decades, Canadian manufacturers have increasingly adopted more innovations to increase efficiencies and cut costs, including computer-driven technology, 3-D printing, and automation, says Paul Preston, director of science, technology and innovation policy at the Conference Board of Canada. However, the gap between Canada and other countries continues to widen.

“Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters conducted some interesting studies which show we’re lagging on tech adoption and not improving fast enough to close the gap we have with peers like Germany,” Mr. Preston says. “One of our challenges is over 99 per cent of our companies are small to medium sized. We need to find new ways to encourage investment and technology – and to do that, we need more companies to scale and grow.”

One potential solution could be to reallocate carbon pricing schemes so more funding goes toward tech adoption and automation in the manufacturing sector, Mr. Preston says.

“Another recommendation is for enhanced depreciation rates – being able to write off technology over a shorter time frame than the typical 10 years and also providing tax credits for tech adoption,” he says. “The key lies in not just enhancing the ability of companies to develop manufacturing technology, but also the ability of the manufacturing sector to adopt it in ways that make good business sense.”

Darren Lawless, the dean of Applied Research and Innovation at the Humber Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning, concurs. This January, Humber will launch the ground-breaking Barrett Centre for Technology Innovation (BCTI), a 93,000-square-foot facility intended to assist manufacturing companies increase their capacity to benefit from transformative technologies.

Students, faculty and technicians will work with industry partners and community organizations to solve business challenges, respond to new markets and become more globally competitive. The Barrett Family Foundation donated $10-million for the completion of the centre, and to Humber’s Access to Education and Skills Training fund, which provides tuition scholarships for students.

Additional companies that are part of the BCTI include Festo Didactic Inc., Cisco Canada and SEW-Eurodrive, all of whom have entered into five-year partnership agreements designed to address the skills gap between industry and education.

“This is a new approach to education, where we act as active listeners and work with industry to address their needs,” Dr. Lawless says. “Rather than traditional classrooms, we’ll have interactive demonstration areas, prototyping labs and makerspaces where we can solve the problems preventing Canadian companies from growing to their maximum capacity.”

It is precisely such collaboration between businesses, policy-makers at all levels and end users that is key to success in the manufacturing industry, says Mr. Pilato at Glad.

Recently the firm partnered with York University’s Faculty of Environmental Studies to assess the performance of existing recycling programs in Canada. Ideally, such findings would identify the most cost-effective systems for generating the highest diversion rates from landfills, while significantly lowering contamination. The information can be used to help Canadian municipalities make informed decisions about their recycling programs that will also them help minimize costs.

“The raw data from municipalities was out there, but no one had taken the time to parse through it and produce a digestible study to share the learnings with provincial and municipal stakeholders,” Mr. Pilato says. “Policy makers set aggressive targets and goals for cities, but they don’t have the insight into their residents that we do. Glad has invested research dollars to speak directly to residents and better understand their pain points when it comes to waste diversion. As a result, we have a strong understanding of what Canadians need.

“When it comes to waste diversion, we’ve found that most Canadians want to do their part for the environment, but that they are often left frustrated by the complexity of managing waste in their homes. At Glad, our goal is to offer help by providing solutions for easy collection and storage of all waste types, while reducing the overall ‘ick’ factor associated with waste in the home.”","Story continues below advertisementOpen this photo in gallery Glad's small compostable bag has become a staple in many households that participate in municipal recycling programs.

The PNGSDP is a fund that was established as a result of the ecological damage to the Western Province by the OK Tedi Mine, and is used for special projects in the area to meet the development needs of the citizens. The area has long been neglected, primarily due to the sparse population. However, in 2011 Digicel and PNGSDP worked together to deploy 49 telecommunications towers, and this contract will see Digicel upgrading the towers, expanding coverage, deploying LTE and offering managed services.

This agreement between PNGSDP and Digicel means the Western Province will benefit from 19 new telecommunications towers that will be owned by PNGSDP, new power generation units and LTE on 78 towers owned by Digicel and a seven-year managed service agreement to deliver operations and maintenance of the telecommunications services including internet bandwidth.

INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND GAMBIANS ABROAD OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE GAMBIA ON THE CONTINENT-WIDE COMMEMORATION OF THE AFRICAN UNION DAY

THEME: “AFRICAN UNION: ACHIEVEMENTS, CHALLENGES AND NEXT STEPS”

Fellow Gambians,

Today, 9th September, 2018 the African Union Day is being celebrated throughout the African continent and the Diaspora. This is indeed a special occasion to collectively reflect upon and celebrate the successes of our continental organisation as well as analyse the challenges facing the African Union as we strive to achieve the objectives of AGENDA 2063 – the blueprint for the long-term development vision of the African continent anchored on our pan-African aspirations for a fully integrated, developed, prosperous and peaceful African continent.

My address today will therefore focus on the achievements that have been registered since the African Union evolved from its predecessor, the Organisation of African Unity; the role that the Gambia has played and continues to play in the attainment of continental goals and the challenges that need to be addressed if we are to overcome the constraints and impediments in the realisation of our noble goals and objectives towards making Africa a force to be reckoned with in the comity of nations, both politically and economically.

It was in pursuit of these noble aspirations that the Organisation of African Unity was transformed into the African Union. This evolution would ensure that the African Union has the legal, administrative and political impetuses of fast-track the implementation of the integration and development agendas of the African continent. Accordingly, the Constitutive Act that has been adopted by Member States, Including The Gambia, reaffirms the continents quest for democratisation, gender empowerment, good governance and accountability, preventive diplomacy, peaceful resolution of conflicts and full participation of all Africans, including those in the Diaspora in the political, financial and economic governance of the African continent.

Fellow Gambians,

As I mentioned earlier, the African Union blueprint for long term development has been enshrined in the document entitled AGENDA 2063. Since its adoption in 2015, all the integration and development programmes of the African Union are synchronised towards achieving its goals, which includes the following:

A prosperous African based on inclusive growth and sustainable development An integrated continent, politically united and based on the ideals of Pan-Africanism and the vision of Africa’s Renaissance An African of good governance, democracy, respect for human rights, justice and the rule of law A peaceful and secure Africa An Africa with a strong cultural identity, common heritage, shared values and ethics An Africa whose development is people -driven, relying on the potential of African people, especially its women and youth, and caring for children Africa as a strong, united and influential global player and partner

These are the seven principal aspirations of AGENDA 2063 and several programmes have been designed to actualise them. Amongst them is the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement which was signed by the majority of the Member States of the African Union including The Gambia at the 10th Extraordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union held in March 2018 in Kigali, Rwanda. The Agreement is an important mechanism for the full financial and commercial integration of the African continent. It is a fact that financial and commercial integration of the African continent cannot be attained if there are restrictions on the movement of peoples and goods within Africa. Therefore free and unhindered mobility of African citizens within the continent is indispensable to the realisation of the objectives of the Free Trade Area. It was for this reason that the Kigali Extraordinary Summit also adopted the Protocol on the Free Movement of Persons, Right of Residence and Right of Establishment as a clear expression of intent in instituting a regime of freer mobility of peoples and goods throughout the continent. The Gambia government is working on the processes to ensure that the necessary actions and policies are put in place for the implementation of the Protocol.

In the same vein, the African Union is spearheading a move towards greater integration in infrastructural cooperation and development in road, maritime and air transportation. With regards to the latter I would like to highlight the launching in January this year of the Single African Air Transport Market. This initiative is expected to accelerate the momentum in decreasing the legal, financial and infrastructural bottlenecks to a fully developed and integrated African aviation sector. A liberalised aviation industry will make air travel more efficient and reduce cost of airfares which would be a boost toward the desired goal of economic and commercial integration of the continent. The Gambia will seek to harness its strategic location in West Africa by taking full advantage of the opportunities offered by the Single African Air Transport Market.

Sustainable peace on the African continent is an important pillar to realising the goals of Agenda 2063. Through the African Peace and Security Architecture and other important initiatives such as “Silencing the Guns by 2020” and the African Union Amnesty Month, the sustainable peace agenda of the African continent is being pursued rigorously. The African Union is also playing an important coordinating role to ensure that the peace initiatives of the Regional Economic Communities and other Ad-hoc mechanisms are successful.

I will now turn to the relations between The Gambia and the African Union and the important role we continue to play in the continental body. For The Gambia, the African Union is a strategic partner in our foreign policy posture and orientation. We continue to be unswervingly committed to the ideals of the Union and shall strive to contribute towards achieving the goals and aspirations of the African Union. In return The Gambia has received and benefited from the strong support of the African Union during the political impasse of 2016 that threatened to usurp the democratic will of the Gambian people expressed in a free and fair electoral process. Through the support of the African Union and other institutions, the Gambian people were made the rightful and sovereign arbitrator of their political destiny.

In the “New Gambia”, the African Union continues to provide valuable support to the Gambia government’s reform programmes. A team of African Experts will soon be dispatched to the country for a period of 12 months to provide technical support to the reform programmes of government in the security and judicial sectors.

The Gambia continues to be the proud host to one of the key organs of the African Union in the promotion of good governance, accountability, respect for rule of law and human rights. The location of the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights in The Gambia is something that we take pride in because it is a manifestation of our democratic credentials and commitments to the respect for the human rights of our citizens and of peoples all over the world. The Gambia Government will continue to provide the right environment that will enable the Commission to be successful in the execution of its important mandate. Efforts will be intensified to implement the construction of a permanent headquarters for the Commission with adequate facilities and amenities commensurate with its status as an important institution of the African Union.

The Gambia has been actively participating in the efforts toward a peaceful, fully integrated and developed African Union. We continue to participate in AU sessions and make robust and meaningful contributions at various platforms, be it at the level of Permanent Representatives Committee, the Executive Council or the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union. At the last Ordinary Session of the Assembly held in Nouakchott, Mauritania and before that at the Extraordinary Summit in Kigali, Rwanda, His Excellency President Adama Barrow made several interventions on various agenda items. His statements were delivered in a considered and dignified manner and received genuine acclamations from his colleagues. President Barrow also had bilateral meetings with other Heads of State and Government thereby raising the diplomatic profile of The Gambia to a higher pedestal.

As a manifestation of this trend, The Gambia will be hosting in 2019 the 3rd Ordinary Session of the Ministerial Session of the Specialized Technical Committee on Migration, Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons. Fifty-five (55) African ministers are expected in The Gambia to discuss the way forward in fully implementing the migration agenda of the African continent and the plight of refugees and internally displaced persons. This Ministerial Meeting will be held at a moment when the African Union Theme of the Year for 2019 is “The Year of Refugees, Returnees and Internally Displaced Persons: Towards Durable Solutions to Forced Displacement in Africa”. As a consequence, efforts will be made to ensure that the outcomes of this Ministerial Meeting significantly influence the trajectory of the implementation of the 2019 Theme of the Year.

The Gambia currently chairs the Policy Sub-Committee on the Special Emergency Fund on Drought and Famine. This Sub-committee has the important mandate of giving financial support to African countries that are affected by drought and famine. Important activities are envisaged under the aegis of this Sub-Committee that would improve the versatility of the African Union in addressing both the causes and the effects of drought and famine on the African continent.

The Gambia is widely recognised as an important troop contributing nation in the maintenance of pace and security in Africa. Our gallant men and women continue to demonstrate selfless sacrifice and valor in the discharge of their duties in the various theatres of peace support operations on the African continent.

At the headquarters of the African Union in Addis Ababa and other cities in the African continent where the African Union has institutions and offices, I would like to acknowledge and recognize the immense contributions of Gambian nationals working with AU are making to the achievements of the Union. As a government and a nation we are always proud and delighted to witness the moments when their professionalism is recognised and validated.

Fellow Gambians,

I have highlighted the achievements and successes of the African Union since it was established and made reference to the contributions made by The Gambia in these endeavors. I have also mentioned the aspirations of our leaders and peoples to transform Africa into a powerful, peaceful and economically integrated continent. These aspirations are encapsulated in agenda 2063 which some cynics and ill-informed observers have called mere slogans. Far from sloganeering, the agenda 2063 blueprint is a well worked out document predicated on sober and objective analysis of the problems of our continent. Its adoption and the drive to implement the policies and programmes enshrined therein demonstrate the commitment and determination of our countries and peoples to build the “Africa we want.”","DR.

11.B By 2020, substantially increase the number of cities and human settlements adopting and implementing integrated policies and plans towards inclusion, resource efficiency, mitigation and adaptation to climate change, resilience to disasters, and develop and implement, in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, holistic disaster risk management at all levels.



11.C Support least developed countries, including through financial and technical assistance, in building sustainable and resilient buildings utilizing local materials.

Progress to date

The progress report for SDG11 makes for bleak reading, confirming that delivering sustainable urban development is one of the biggest challenges set by the SDGs. ""With rapid urbanization, many cities are facing challenges in managing population growth, ensuring there is adequate housing and resilient infrastructure to support these growing populations, and addressing the environmental impacts of expanding cities and vulnerability to disasters,"" the UN states.

Rapid globalisation, which in recent years has seen the proportion of the global population living in cities top 50 per cent for the first time in human history, has triggered huge environmental and development challenges.

Between 1990 and 2014 the share of the global urban population living in slums may have fallen from 46 per cent to 23 per cent, but the rapid expansion of the overall urban population means the total number of people living in slums has risen from 689 million to 881 million.

This surge in the number of city dwellers has also seen one of the main environmental benefits of urban living eroded. Population density in cities is falling as they expand, often in an unmanaged fashion. Globally, the average rate of physical expansion of cities is about one and a half times that of population growth. Anyone who has ever visited an emerging economy mega-city will be unsurprised to hear the trend is most stark in Eastern and South-eastern Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and Central and Southern Asia.

The fall in urban density is driven in part by improving per capita incomes and transport links, but it also brings with it significant new challenges in the form of lost agricultural land, worsening congestion, and generally higher environmental impacts.

It also makes it harder to deliver the basic infrastructure many cities still lack. The UN's latest progress report confirms that managing solid waste ""continues to be a challenge in many regions with significant and adverse effects from uncollected waste in cities, including direct and indirect effects on the health of residents and the environment"".

A study of 213 cities found just a quarter of municipal solid waste is collected, with the share falling to less than half in the cities in sub-Saharan Africa.

Developing world cities face similar challenges improving resilience in the face of natural disasters and climate impacts. Unplanned and rapid urbanisation and poor land management, together with non-risk informed policies and investments are major underlying risk drivers of disaster mortality,"" the UN notes, and as result almost 90 per cent of disaster-related deaths between 1990 and 2013 occurred in low and middle-income countries.

The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction was agreed in 2015 and provides a template for countries to develop more effective disaster resilience strategies that are likely to become more important as climate impacts escalate. However, a recent UN survey found that of the 87 states that responded to the questionnaire, only 50 reported they have national disaster risk reduction strategies and 34 have local strategies in place. More encouraging progress is being made through investments in

Moreover, in 2015, out of 95 countries, 84 reported investing in drainage infrastructure and the adoption of building codes, but basic resilience remains a major issue for many large cities.

Meanwhile, industrialised and developing world cities alike continue to be gripped by a public health crisis in the form of air pollution. In 2016, 91 per cent of the urban population still breathed air that did not meet the WHO's Air Quality Guidelines value for particulate matter (PM 2.5) and more than half was exposed to air pollution levels at least 2.5 times above that safety standard. The emergence of electric vehicles and the growing adoption of clean air policies in European and US cities are yet to bring air quality into line with health standards in many regions.

Business implications

It is not just the majority of the global population that resides in cities, it is also the bulk of economic activity. Cities have always been the primary crucibles of business activity and as such SDG11 promises to address some of the major challenges businesses face and open up a raft of new opportunities for the private sector.

Delivering on SDG11 should drive significant new infrastructure investment, boost the global construction sector, and usher in a whole new sector in the form of fast-emerging 'smart city' technologies.

Meanwhile, improved air quality, road safety, more public transport and green spaces all promise to enhance employee health and productivity, while minimising costs to businesses from congestion and pollution. Similarly more resilient cities with clearer disaster management plans are likely to be critical to minimise the costs to businesses and insurers associated with rising climate risks.

However, the lack of clearly quantifiable targets or specific definitions for sustainable urban development, coupled with the slow progress to date in tackling urban problems and rapidly growing urban populations, especially in the developing world, all serve to fuel fears that businesses will continue to see unsustainable urban planning act as a drag on development.

Business risks

The primary risks associated with SDG11 will arise from any failure to deliver on the goals.

As the leading development economist Lord Nicholas Stern has long argued the only long term development path available is a sustainable development path. This is particularly apparent in cities, where endless congestion, choked air, and the insecurity created by slum conditions, make running a business infinitely harder.

Poor air, limited waste management services, and weak public transport provision all translate into higher costs, lower productivity, increased risks, and worse labour markets for businesses.

As has been evidenced in countless developing world cities, poorly planned urban development to provide new offices for businesses can create reputational risks as impacted communities respond to the resulting displacement and/or gentrification.

However, government efforts to deliver on SDG11 could also create some business risks. The private sector is likely to be required to contribute to the considerable cost of essential urban infrastructure upgrades, while new planning rules could slow development and new mega-projects could lead to short term disruption for businesses.

Business opportunities

The business opportunities arising from SDG11 are both multi-faceted and obvious. More sustainable cities are simply a better environment in which businesses can operate. They lead to lower air pollution, less crime, and less congestion, all of which result in lower running costs, as well as a healthier, wealthier and more productive populous from which to draw employees and consumers.

They are also essential to continued economic development, especially in climate vulnerable emerging markets. The wider adoption of the Sendai Framework will be of critical importance to many businesses facing rising risks with the insurance industry likely to put particular value on enhanced urban resilience efforts.

Similarly, the global tourism industry stands to benefit from the pledge to protect the world's cultural and natural heritage, although all businesses also stand to gain from employee and customer bases with the freedom to enjoy such resources.

More broadly, the commitment to tackle slums and provide drastically improved urban transport infrastructure provides a huge investment opportunity for many businesses, as well as a critical path for delivering efficiency savings and greenhouse gas emissions reductions through new smart city, internet of things, and AI enabled technologies.

Effective sustainable urban development and planning regimes should also help trigger progress against numerous other SDGs through enhanced resource and energy efficiency, reduced air pollution, and city environments that aid healthier and happier lifestyles. In short, the pace of the global revolutions in green buildings, smart grids, and electric vehicles will be determined to a large extent by what happens in cities.","11.3 By 2030, enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning and management in all countries.

Yet, urbanization reveals two inherently concurrent dimensions vis-à-vis the emergence of cities as engines of socio-economic development — a rising vulnerability to multiple disaster and climate-related risks.

We often ask - what should the inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable urban development look like?

First, the key dimension of ‘inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable cities’ is their ability to anticipate, reduce, mitigate, respond to and recover from a wide range of risks. The increased frequency and magnitude of urban disasters inflict an exponential economic cost as is evident by a string of disasters over the past decade. In big metropolitans as Cape Town and New Delhi, climate change is already aggravating water scarcity. Higher susceptibility to risks tends to manifest in rising inequalities and lop-sided urban development.

Second, governance, including risk governance, is central to resilience building and for fostering risk-informed development. This entails a more integrated and mutually reinforcing planning and implementation approach among socio-economic development actors and a better understanding of the planning-development-risk nexus. Adopting a systems approach that encompasses urban systems, structures, services, resources, capacities and governance will be crucial in this regard.

Third, ensuring sustainability and resilience calls for “redundancy” or sufficient “bandwidth” in urban systems and services. The complex inter-play of urban needs, priorities and issues makes it imperative to invest in ensuring their continued functionality and enhanced absorptive capacity with attention to resilience building beyond urban areas, to include peri-urban areas and the hinterland.

Finally, urban planning must not only keep pace with increasing urban development needs, but anticipate the increasing exposure to vulnerabilities. There is a critical interdependence between susceptibility to hazards and socio-economic variables as access to social safety nets, livelihoods and eco-system services, which is accentuated by inequities as poverty and discrimination.

UNDP’s Strategic Plan (2018-2021) recognizes this emerging reality to ensure a sustainable urban development paradigm. It draws upon the US$260 million invested by UNDP to support 82 countries to shape their development pathways towards sustainability, inclusion and resilience between 2013-2016.

As the thematic lead for the urban risk management and resilience practice area, it is personally gratifying for me to see our policy and programmatic work supporting countries and cities in advancing evidence-based urban development, strengthening urban governance and systems, promoting livelihood resilience and implementing disaster and climate-resilient development solutions. The regional Arab Cities Resilience Project helped three municipal authorities identify actions and benchmarks to measure progress towards resilience building. Similarly, in the Europe and CIS Region, the ICT for Disaster Risk Reduction project helped cities develop ICT based solutions to manage disaster and climate risks as well as other emergencies.

Considering that the battle for sustainable development will increasingly be fought in cities, the center of gravity for action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will inevitably gravitate towards urban centres. Ensuring a resilient and sustainable urban development paradigm will necessitate a range of actions involving incremental steps such as improving efficiency within existing technological, governance and value systems, as well as transformational changes, accompanied by a cultural shift in governance contexts.

The facts that nearly two-thirds of the urban infrastructure is yet to be built and that secondary and tertiary cities are emerging as the fastest growing urban areas offer a great opportunity to work towards inclusive, resilient and sustainable cities. Our past experience and future projections testify to this need.

Organised by Temasek, the dialogue brought together over 100 students and student leaders who engaged in discussion with speaker of parliament Tan Chuan-Jin on how they envision living in a sustainable city. The main issues put forth by the students revolved around the trade-offs associated with rapid urban development, sparking questions about the importance of incorporating nature into the city, preserving historic sites and balancing economic growth with other social and environmental challenges.

“Biodiversity and urbanisation are often seen to be diametrically opposed,” said Jerrie Liao, an avid scuba diver and third year student who cultivated an interest in ocean conservation while studying at Singapore Management University’s School of Social Sciences. “However, we need to know that for cities to grow, for us to live, we require the ecosystem services provided to us by nature.”

“The question is: how can we better integrate nature into our cities and what factors do we have to consider?”

Singapore has one of the highest greenery densities in the world, despite its small land size. The country’s continual urban development to house a growing population has been done in parallel with careful management of the island’s green spaces, with gardens, parks and nature reserves taking up 10 per cent of its land.

“ “Sustainability is not just about environmental issues alone.” Tan Chuan-Jin, speaker of parliament

However, big governmental projects in recent years have triggered debate over the environmental impacts associated with their development. The Cross Island Line, slated to be completed by 2030, has received backlash from local environmentalists and nature groups that have expressed concern that the new MRT line would cause major disturbance to Singapore’s largest patch of primary rainforest.

Today, less than 0.5 per cent of the country’s original primary forest cover remains. Singapore dwindling natural spaces are generating worry that despite governmental efforts to provide opportunities for Singaporeans to appreciate nature in their urban environment, residents will feel increasingly cut off from nature as the country continues to urbanise.

According to Tan Chuan-Jin, the trade-offs linked to growth and urbanisation are “not clear-cut” and each issue has to be considered within the context of Singapore. He said: “Sustainability isn’t just about environmental issues alone,” adding that the costs saved from efficient development projects can be funnelled to support the healthcare and infrastructure needs of the country’s ageing population.

By 2030, the number of people aged 65 years and above in Singapore will grow almost twice in size to over 900,000. Coupled with Singapore’s tapering labour growth, the country will be stretched to maintain its economic growth and boost employment. Tan Chuan-Jin emphasised that for Singapore to be sustainable, policymakers have to take into account social factors such as changing demographics and social cohesion.

On that note, a student from the audience posed a question on how climate change considerations will affect Singapore’s economic growth in the future. In response to whether Singapore will have to embrace lower growth as it works to decrease its carbon emissions, Tan Chuan-Jin responded that the country has to focus on generating good quality growth that will attract foreign investors, increase people’s incomes and make sure different segments of the population are well taken care of.

“The more important question is: Will the growth you’re interested in be able to provide the quality of life we need in 2030 and the years ahead?”

Another issue raised by Hor Chor Kiat, a masters student from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, was the tension between urban development and the preservation of key heritage buildings. One example he brought up was the old National Library at Stamford Road that was demolished in 2004 in order to build a tunnel that would ease traffic congestion in the area. He noted that although the public was largely opposed to the move, the construction of the new National Library allowed Singaporeans to hold on to a symbol of national heritage and identity. On future urban redevelopment projects, he asked: “Can we still allow for development to happen but restore those memories?”

Reginald Goh, a second year student studying sustainable infrastructure at the Singapore Institute of Technology, said that his idea of a sustainable city was one where individuals believed in the importance of conserving nature and preserving heritage. He felt that Singaporeans have to take active steps to safeguard both the environment and local culture and cited a lack of public appreciation as a challenge to local initatives aimed at fostering sustainable development.

“My generation still has a lack of appreciation for these things [the environment and local culture] because of how privileged we are,” he said. “What’s the point of trying to conserve it if people don’t appreciate it?”","Organised by Temasek, the dialogue brought together over 100 students and student leaders who engaged in discussion with speaker of parliament Tan Chuan-Jin on how they envision living in a sustainable city.
According to Tan Chuan-Jin, the trade-offs linked to growth and urbanisation are “not clear-cut” and each issue has to be considered within the context of Singapore.
Coupled with Singapore’s tapering labour growth, the country will be stretched to maintain its economic growth and boost employment.
Tan Chuan-Jin emphasised that for Singapore to be sustainable, policymakers have to take into account social factors such as changing demographics and social cohesion.

Today, in an effort to address growing traffic congestion and air quality concerns, UPS and Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan announced the deployment of an innovative downtown delivery pilot project using pedal-assist cargo eBikes and customized, modular trailers. The cargo eBikes will operate in the historic Pike Place Market and downtown Seattle area on sidewalks and in designated bike lanes.

“While we have launched cycle logistic projects in other cities, this is the first one designed to meet a variety of urban challenges,” said Scott Phillippi, UPS’s senior director of maintenance and engineering, international operations. “The modular boxes and trailer allow us to expand our delivery capabilities and meet the unique needs of our Seattle customers. It’s exciting to return to our roots — UPS started in Seattle in 1907 as a bicycle messenger company. We’re looking forward to being able to offer these customizable urban delivery solutions to other cities nationwide.”

The UPS® cargo eBike is equipped with a battery-powered electric motor that can travel longer distances than traditional bikes, carry substantial loads and navigate hills and other terrain. The modular, detachable boxes on the trailer can hold up to 400 lbs. and have a 95-foot3 capacity. The bikes can be operated with human pedal power or battery power, providing drivers with energy efficiency and the flexibility they need to navigate changing terrain.

Developed in collaboration with Silver Eagle Manufacturing using Truck Trikes, the cargo eBike system will have removable cargo containers that are deployed via a specially designed trailer. This unique, “plug and play” design provides greater flexibility to meet varying delivery needs. It will also be able to make deliveries to areas conventional delivery trucks can’t access directly and currently require that trucks be parked on the periphery for long periods of time. This will reduce congestion in these areas by reducing truck dwell time, double parking and other issues associated with downtown deliveries.

UPS partnered with the Seattle Department of Transportation to develop plans for the new pilot program. If successful, UPS will expand the route and consider additional cargo eBike deliveries in other areas of the city. This is the first tailored urban delivery solution to address growing traffic congestion in Seattle’s downtown corridor, and is part of UPS’s Cycle Logistics Solutions that help reduce carbon emissions, noise and traffic.

“With a city population that’s growing every day, we are committed to this kind of public-private collaboration that helps develop groundbreaking solutions like the cargo eBike to improve Seattle’s quality of life,” Durkan said. “Partnerships like this will enhance our ‘One Center City’ initiatives, making it easier to get around Center City.”

UPS and the University of Washington’s Urban Freight Lab will evaluate the cargo eBike’s reliability, design and integration into Seattle’s infrastructure over the next year. The Urban Freight Lab is an initiative that brings together transportation engineers and urban planners who manage public spaces with retailers, freight carriers and technology companies supporting transportation solutions. UPS will share data and analyses from the pilot for assessment against two of the lab’s key objectives: improving first delivery attempts and reducing “dwell time,” both of which should reduce traffic congestion and pollution.

The success of the UPS eBike was first demonstrated in 2012 in Hamburg, Germany, and serves as a prototype for these newest cargo eBikes in Seattle. The company also operates inner-city delivery projects with delivery on foot and by bike in more than 30 major cities worldwide, including Leuven and Mechelen, Belgium; Paris and Toulouse, France; Frankfurt, Hamburg, Herne, Offenbach, Oldenburg and Munich, Germany; Dublin, Ireland; Rome and Verona, Italy; and London, UK; and in the US in Pittsburgh.

Using its “Rolling Laboratory” approach, UPS deploys roughly 9,300 low-emission vehicles worldwide to determine which alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles work best in various routes and duty cycles. This includes all-electric, hybrid electric, hydraulic hybrid, ethanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG) and propane. The cargo eBike is part of a broader UPS strategy to continue to electrify its delivery fleet.","“The modular boxes and trailer allow us to expand our delivery capabilities and meet the unique needs of our Seattle customers.

MORELOS, Mexico — Just 60 kilometers north of the epicenter, Hueyapan in Morelos, Mexico, was largely devastated by the Sept. 2017, 7.1-magnitude earthquake. The community of about 7,500 sits in the foothills of the great Popocatépetl volcano where trembling of the earth isn’t uncommon, but never before had such a powerful earthquake hit so close to the village. Hundreds of homes were damaged or destroyed, leaving many homeless.

Nearby Mexico City received most of the public attention, as news shot across the globe about people trapped in fallen high-rises in one of the Western Hemisphere’s largest cities. It took most relief groups at least a week, some a month, to reach Hueyapan, where conditions were worsened by the rainy season and high altitude.

A year on, two Mexico City-based groups are thinking ahead to the next quake. They've teamed up to build homes made of “superadobe” — a version of earthbag construction which adds lime and polypropylene bags to the mix, effectively making the structures tremor-proof when well-built.

Nonprofit Guadalupe Madre Tierra has funded the construction of five superadobe homes in Hueyapan, designed by Siembra Arquitectura. The firm hires local workers, not only to provide work, but also to impart the knowledge necessary to continue rebuilding communities and to maintain the tradition of working with adobe — in a more updated form.

“The idea is that the entire project of supporting and helping people rebuild their community becomes sustainable, so that we can maintain it without asking for donations from all over the place, which is very complicated,” said Claudia García Mendez, assistant to the president at Guadalupe Madre Tierra.

“It’s costing us blood. Even in the city, there are buildings that need to be torn down and others that need to be repaired,” she said.

Juan Manuel Espinoza Cortes, a native of Hueyapan and a beneficiary of Siembra Arquitectura’s first superadobe home in the village, is now the lead builder for other homes, having learned the ins and outs of superadobe and the architectural process. Espinoza Cortes said he is optimistic about superadobe as a durable construction material in Hueyapan, now that he is able to teach the method to others.

“There have been other earthquakes since ... And when people see these homes are unaffected, they are more willing to learn the methods. They are more willing to put in the work. There are younger people who are interested in this, too. That is what we need,” he said.

Espinoza Cortes’ superadobe home has three bedrooms and one bathroom, and cost about 180,000 Mexican pesos ($9,600) to construct, including labor. The Siembra Arquitectura team has built smaller homes that cost less; and larger, luxury homes that cost $50,000 in Mexico, all made using superadobe.

Both adobe and superadobe homes take about three months to construct, depending on size, weather, and available workforce.

While the government’s department of disaster relief, FONDEN, allocated money for properties damaged by the earthquake, the distribution has been marred by complications — including unequal payment, confusion over recipients, and difficulties obtaining funds when needed, according to locals. FONDEN did not respond to requests for comment.

“Lasting projects are a learning process for the people who are helping … It involves the organization seeing what’s really happening and sometimes that involves changing their initial plans or ideas.” __ Analiese Richard, sociocultural anthropologist and professor, Metropolitan Autonomous University

The shortfalls have made the charitable programs all the more necessary, and why groups are trying to ensure their rebuilding efforts can be sustainable and replicable — when another earthquake hits.

García Mendez said that of the five houses that Guadalupe Madre Tierra has funded, only one was given any money by FONDEN: 20,000 Mexcian pesos out of the 71,000 promised.

Her organization has plans to keep building in Hueyapan and also to create other jobs in the area, including a small marmalade factory that takes advantage of the region’s abundant fruit harvests — which right now often go to waste — as well as creating and selling fertilizer from livestock. They also plan to teach locals to build rainwater filtration devices, which can be constructed with materials that are sold in Hueyapan, as another means to ensure a sustainable future for the community.

Analiese Richard is a sociocultural anthropologist and professor at Mexico City’s Metropolitan Autonomous University, who has more than 15 years of research experience in rural development in Mexico. She said the long-term sustainability of projects such as superadobe housing in Hueyapan depend a lot on the initial approach in the community, as well as the ability to use local products and hire local workers rather than inputs from other places.

“Lasting projects are a learning process for the people who are helping,” Richard said. “It involves the organization seeing what’s really happening and sometimes that involves changing their initial plans or ideas.”

What interests Richard about the particular case in Hueyapan is that it appears there are multiple groups involved in a variety of sustainability efforts.

“There are a number of projects and ideas that are converging in the same town, that has the potential to have some synergy right now and that in itself is interesting … These efforts tend to bubble up following disasters when outsiders see an emergency, and then they see later that there are chronic problems of poverty that don’t have easy solutions,” Richard said.

“People arrive with projects that could function, but what stays in the community are the aspects of that project — that technology is there, and people can continue adapting it themselves to the point that it’s most useful to them ... and it can actually become part of a cultural repertoire.”

García Mendez believes that is the case in Hueyapan: “Our major idea is that the villagers can learn new skills in order to have a better quality of life.”

“We have no intention of being here forever. When we leave, we want to know they have all they need in order to continue. We want this to be something that grows, but also that is sustainable.","Juan Manuel Espinoza Cortes and a building made of earthquake-resistant superadobe under construction in Hueyapan, Mexico.

254,http://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/photos/citys-presents-environmental-infrastructure-plan-create-sustainable-greenspaces/,"Mon, 01 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Milwaukee Independent,City’s presents environmental infrastructure plan to create Sustainable Greenspaces,"Every generation has the opportunity to reshape its environment through decisions we make about development. We are experiencing a renaissance for Milwaukee, with a building boom that started in the heart of the downtown and is now extending into our neighborhoods. As we develop, one of the principles that has been important from the outset of my administration is environmental sustainability. Environmental sustainability is good for business now, and it is essential for long-term economic growth.

And as we redevelop and grow, we have to account for one of the greatest environmental challenges of our time, which is climate change. With climate change, we can expect more extreme weather events. With extreme weather comes large amounts of rain, more rain than our sewer systems were designed to handle. In 2008 and 2010, Milwaukee experienced extreme storms and flooding. In August of this year, large sections of Wisconsin including areas around Madison experienced record rain and flooding in what is supposed to be our driest month.

This problem is made worse by the volume of pavement that we have in our streets, parking lots, and school yards. With extreme rain and too much pavement, there’s no good place for the water to go. So we run the risk of basement backups, sewer overflows, and property damage. To help adapt to climate change, we have to chart a new course. We can’t continue to pave over green space. In fact, we need to remove excess pavement and hardscapes and replace it with functional greenspace, or green infrastructure.

Green infrastructure includes things like green roofs, bioswales in parking lots, and simply de-paving large parking lots and adding good soils with grass. This kind of green infrastructure is really important for Milwaukee for a lot of reasons. First, it can help us adapt to climate change and manage risks from storms. Second, greenspace creates better urban environments to walk and play in. In the last century, developers and cities devoted far too much of our urban landscape to black-top parking lots and school yards. Shopping centers often have parking lots that are far too large for the regular volume of traffic.

And because so much of our city and shopping centers are geared toward auto traffic with very little space devoted to greenspace and landscaping, the large parking lots make it daunting for pedestrians and cyclists. And schoolyards often have kids playing games on hot asphalt. This isn’t good for kids and it’s not good for the environment. We can do better. Some of our leading developments downtown are voluntarily including green infrastructure into their developments. The Northwestern Mutual Life building and new condominium projects by the Mandel group feature green roofs.

We are seeing some of that same leadership in our neighborhoods. We are here today at Brother Business Interiors where Peggy Coakley and her leadership team have redeveloped the property and included a new green parking lot. But we can’t rely solely on volunteer efforts. To address the risk of climate threats, we need to take policy action to accelerate the adoption of green infrastructure. That’s why I’m excited to announce that the Milwaukee Common Council has adopted our Green Infrastructure Plan.

Under the Plan, all large developments and redevelopments of one acre or more will be required to use green infrastructure to capture the first 1/2” or rainfall on the site. Under current law, these large projects would have been required to develop a stormwater management plan. Under the new law adopted yesterday, these stormwater management plans will require the use of green infrastructure. This will ensure that we get all of the community benefits of green infrastructure, including more attractive and healthier urban environment. With the City leading by example, we are also supporting MMSD’s efforts to develop regional green infrastructure standards.

Another key element of the plan is increased funding to support green infrastructure projects in our streets, schoolyards, and parking lots. Next year, MMSD is increasing the funding it makes available to communities to install green infrastructure. Milwaukee is expected to have $2 million dollars available from the District to invest in green infrastructure. We have already been adding green infrastructure to our street and alley reconstruction projects. As we thought about where to put additional funds, we thought it made sense to target MPS schoolyards.

Through the Green Schools Consortium of Milwaukee, we are working with MPS to convert black-top schoolyards to functional greenspace and outdoor learning environments. With our additional investment in MPS Schools, we hope to convert at four to five school yards per year. We will also work with willing commercial and non-profit property owners who wish to de-pave portions of their parking lots to add green infrastructure.","In fact, we need to remove excess pavement and hardscapes and replace it with functional greenspace, or green infrastructure.

On Sept. 24, numerous experts from diverse disciplines and areas of the world convened at MIT to discuss sustainable development in Africa. The conference was hosted by the Université Mohammed VI Polytechnique-MIT Research Program (UMRP), a collaboration with the Moroccan university (UM6P) led by MIT faculty director Elfatih A. B. Eltahir, the Breene M. Kerr Professor of Hydrology and Climate in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

UMRP, which launched in 2016, is comprised of six projects led by MIT faculty, which are each built around the dissertation research of an MIT graduate student. The UMRP researchers work closely with the faculty and student colleagues from UM6P, who engage in complementary research.

The African Sustainability Conference provided a showcase for these projects, featuring presentations from MIT and UM6P faculty, researchers, and international experts on climate and water, sustainable urbanization, precision agriculture, smart chemistry, and industrial optimization for the phosphate industry. Group discussions related to critical challenges and potential opportunities within each area followed each session.

Eltahir began the conference by highlighting the significance of Africa in terms of global sustainability, noting that the substantial yet uncertain effects of climate change are already noticeable in agricultural productivity and infrastructure throughout the continent. Projections show that by 2050, Africa’s population will double from 1 billion to 2 billion people, creating an influx of urbanization.

“We are forging an honest collaboration between MIT and a like-minded research and education partner in Africa with the mission of advancing sustainability goals, while also helping build UM6P’s institutional capacity to lead by example on the continent,” expressed Eltahir.

Eltahir brings his background in hydrology and climate to his own UMRP research project, that focuses on improving water management and agricultural productivity in one of Morocco’s major river basins, the Oum-Er-Rbia watershed.

“Climate change is a major challenge for the world, especially concerning Africa. Morocco is a country that suffers from interannual rainfall variability. We are focused on looking for ways to improve management for water resources and availability,” explained Eltahir.

Morocco is highly vulnerable to heat waves and low precipitation, and those extremes are expected to intensify due to climate change. Eltahir’s research addresses these issues through a three-level modeling approach geared toward climatology and forecasting, hydrology, and operations in terms of agricultural planning and infrastructure.

He hopes the program will continue to grow, allowing for further collaboration between MIT and UM6P, students, and faculty. Furthermore, some of the tools, models, and processes that are being utilized in Morocco and greater Africa, can be applied to other regions around the world who will face similar challenges due to climate change.

In addition to Eltahir, the workshop brought together MIT professors John Fernández of the Department of Architecture, Benedetto Marelli of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Paul Barton of the Department of Chemical Engineering, and Christopher Cummins and Yogesh Surendranath of the Department of Chemistry. Including UM6P colleagues, invited international experts, and MIT graduate students, the conference highlighted efforts to implement resilience, adaptability, and sustainability into the future of African cities.

John Fernández, director of MIT’s Environmental Solutions Initiative and professor of architecture, helped launch UMRP with the focus that there is an urgency needed for long-term sustainability, in the areas of society, economy, and climate.

Through comprehensive material accounting of the needs of Moroccan cities, Fernández will be developing specific technology and policy recommendations for UM6P, providing the country with a template for long term urban sustainability.

“One of our goals is to produce a UMRP urban resource tool that would allow Morocco and greater Africa to access data and reach informed decisions about urban sustainability,” said Fernández. The tool’s engine would be developed in partnership with UM6P and the tool itself would be offered online.

The strains of urban population growth, and a predicted threefold increase in urban energy and urban land area globally is a primary motivation of the project. In addition, it is likely that low-income urban areas in Africa will be most vulnerable to the consequences of climate change due to unreliable and limited access to energy sources, water, and shelter.

“With climate change, what happens in terms of the vulnerability of lower income segments of urban population, and at what point, with extreme heat, intense precipitation or climate-induced water shortage does urban vulnerability become urban survivability?” Fernández asked.

Securing resources for the future

In addition to climate concerns, agricultural production concerns were raised as well from both MIT and UM6P experts.

Benedetto Marelli, the Paul M Cook Career Development Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, shared that he is focused on developing new technologies that can increase agricultural production. He stated that with a growing population, a 70 percent increase in food production will be necessary by 2050.

Marelli is in the process of creating biofertilizers that can work with the plant, to boost germination and overcome environmental stressors such as pests, disease, heat waves, and drought.

Manal Mhada, a postdoc from UM6P, presented her research on precision agriculture, and the efficient use of seeds and fertilizers. Her work focuses on human-centered solutions for Moroccan communities, and includes local farmers in her research projects.

Mhada conducts close studies of the crop quinoa, with the intention of introducing it to Morocco in order to provide food and nutritional security. She acknowledges that climate change threatens agriculture, food security, and peace, but emphasizes that “big problems allow for immense opportunity.”

Resilience became a common thread throughout the conference. Hassan Radoine, director of the School of Architecture and Design at UM6P, urges for a paradigm shift, explaining how most people perceive Africa as poor.

“What is resilience? The responsiveness to risk and inventing new solutions. The reconstructing of a community or a place, is resilience,” Radoine said.

Echoing this, Remy Sietchiping, UN-Habitat leader of regional and metropolitan planning, outlined the urban agenda of creating smart cities that encompass adaptability and most importantly, resilience.

“You cannot buy sustainability,” Randoine said.

During the last session of the conference, gears shifted towards the “smart chemistry” projects, which work closely with Moroccan company, OCP, the leading supplier of phosphate rock in the world. Paul M Cook Career Development Assistant Professor Yogeth Surendranath of the MIT Department of Chemistry presented on the natural resource, phosphorous, which is abundant to Morocco.

However, the process of creating phosphate products demands an incredible amount of energy. Surendranath’s research is targeted at elucidating the process of electrochemical phosphate reduction in molten salts, in order to lower economic and environmental costs, and advance Morocco in the chemical markets.

Henry Dreyfus Professor of Chemistry Christopher Cummins’ project is also working with phosphate, and has successfully created a new method for the synthesis of phosphorous. The method utilizes a “wet process,” which enables the reduction of energy inputs, waste, and overall harm to the environment.

Following Cummins, Professor Paul Barton of the Department of Chemistry, discussed his project on optimal industrial symbiosis for the Jorf Lasfar platform, the phosphate mineral processing facility in Morocco. Barton is studying ways to optimize the phosphate resource, to generate returns on investment while also being mindful of energy and water consumption.

Throughout the afternoon, goals for the future were at the forefront of everyone’s mind. UMRP aims to continue to conduct impactful research, tackle developmental challenges, and build a strong foundation for UM6P.

“This conference provided a wonderful platform for UMRP to showcase their projects, build a community with UM6P and other colleagues, and help the growing institutional commitment of MIT to engage fruitfully in a future of sustainable development for Africa,” said UMRP Executive Director Kurt Sternlof.

It was evident that the MIT faculty-led research is results-driven and exhibits a strong vision of a sustainable future. The idea that UMRP research projects develop small solutions to make big impacts, became a recurring element of the conference.

“Whether discussing urban metabolism, industrial symbiosis, chemical processing or the hydrological cycle, the common theme of recognizing and optimizing closed loops of resource use — circular economies of production, consumption and renewal — was clear and compelling, and therein beats the heart of sustainability,” Sternlof said.","On Sept. 24, numerous experts from diverse disciplines and areas of the world convened at MIT to discuss sustainable development in Africa.

The Sustainable Favela Network (SFN) is a project of Catalytic Communities (CatComm)* designed to build solidarity networks, bring visibility, and develop joint actions to support the expansion of community-based initiatives that strengthen environmental sustainability and social resilience in favelas across the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region. The project began with the 2012 film Favela as a Sustainable Model, followed in 2017 by the mapping of 111 sustainability initiatives and the publication of a final report analyzing the results.

In 2018, the project organized on-site exchanges among eight of the oldest and most established organizations that were mapped in the Sustainable Favela Network (one of which is the subject of this article), followed by a full-day exchange with the entire network that took place on November 10. The eight participants in the on-site exchanges featured in this series include six community-based organizations: the Vale Encantado Cooperative in Alto da Boa Vista, EccoVida in Honório Gurgel, Verdejar in Engenho da Rainha and Complexo do Alemão, Quilombo do Camorim in Jacarepaguá, ReciclAção in Morro dos Prazeres, and Alfazendo’s Eco Network in City of God. In addition, the exchanges visited two broader initiatives focusing beyond favelas with extensive experience in sustainability: Onda Verde in Nova Iguaçu and the Sepetiba Ecomuseum. The program is supported by the Heinrich Böll Foundation Brazil.

The Morning of the Second Exchange: Vale Encantado

On the morning of September 8, the second Sustainable Favela Network (SFN) exchange began in the community of Vale Encantado—a small favela nestled in the Alto da Boa Vista neighborhood, located in the middle of the Tijuca National Forest, one of world’s largest urban forests. The exchange brought together representatives from community-based organizations that promote ecological sustainability and social resilience in City of God, Morro dos Prazeres, Quilombo do Camorim, and Sepetiba—along with Catalytic Communities team members and collaborators (including environmental engineers and public defenders). Originally founded by three families who worked on coffee plantations in the area in the 1800s, today, the community is comprised of 25 homes and 116 residents. Vale Encantado is best known for its work as a model of sustainability in favelas.

Otávio Barros, a fifth-generation resident and the president of the Vale Encantado Residents’ Association, launched the community’s sustainable tourism project in 2005. Since then, the project has grown into a cooperative that leads hikes and tours in the forest and manages a restaurant, employing residents who design and serve unique local dishes. In recent years, Vale Encantado has developed a biosystem—a sustainable sewerage system that treats the community’s sewage through an on-site biodigester and natural filtering system. Five homes are already connected to the system, and a separate biodigester uses food waste to provide biogas to fuel the cooperative restaurant’s kitchen.

Vale Encantado Presents Sustainable Solutions

Saturday’s meeting began with a tour of Vale Encantado along a nature trail in the forest that surrounds the community. The group paused at a lookout point to learn about eviction threats facing Vale Encantado in recent years. Barros discussed a lawsuit brought by the State Public Prosecutor’s Office against the City of Rio de Janeiro in 2006 that accused the city of harming the environment by allowing the “favelization” of protected areas bordering the Tijuca National Park. Over the years, favela residents in Alto da Boa Vista have mobilized to show that their communities do not pose a risk to the surrounding forest, and rather work to preserve the natural environment.

A key part of this mobilization is the development of a sustainable sewerage system in Vale Encantado. In the words of Barros, this project is “precisely to show that not all communities participate in the environmental degradation [process], as [the State Public Prosecutor’s Office] says is happening.” At the exchange, two environmental engineers and sanitation collaborators, Tito Cals and Leonardo Adler—who have worked with Vale Encantado to develop the biosystem since 2013 and now run the Environment in Motion Institute—joined Barros in showing the group the two biodigesters built to sustainably treat the community’s sewage. A previously-built smaller biodigester, which generates biogas for Vale Encantado’s kitchen using organic materials such as leftover food, was developed and donated to Vale Encantado by the NGO Solar CITIES and was what initially brought Cals and Adler to work as volunteers in its construction. This initial connection was made by CatComm prior to the establishment of the Sustainable Favela Network.

Adler described their excitement after completing the kitchen biodigester: “We said, ‘Awesome, we finished a really cool project… solving a real problem.’ That was why we returned to the Pontifical Catholic University (PUC-Rio), where we studied, and together with the civil engineering project, applied for project funding to develop [the larger sewage biodigester].” Referring to the eviction threats that Vale Encantado and other communities in the Tijuca Forest have faced in recent years, public defender Maria Lúcia Pontes of the Land and Housing Nucleus of the State Public Defenders’ Office (NUTH), also present at the exchange, noted: “These kinds of projects are so important when it comes time to legally defend the community. This is why community partners must understand that your work is of the highest importance for their defense, to demystify and deconstruct this idea of the community as a polluter.” In response to Pontes, Adler added: “We heard from one resident who, when she came to visit [the biodigester], said: ‘Now it’s the rich [from neighboring condominiums with no sewage treatment] who are polluting the forest—and the poor who are cleaning it up.’”

Ecological Sanitation: Drawing from Vale Encantado’s Example

Following the tour of Vale Encantado, Barros, Cals and Adler presented exchange participants with an overview of sustainable sanitation projects, describing sewage treatment as “one of the greatest challenges for the city of Rio and for the entire country.” In describing the massive treatment plants that the City has built to respond to this challenge, Cals and Adler explained, “It is not just delayed public policy, but also elitist public policy… Those without money are the last people to receive services according to the government’s logic.” While recognizing that some spaces require large, centralized sewage treatment plants, the engineers’ goal is to show that a centralized system is not the only available option. They believe that communities need to consider their own needs, costs, and capacity for maintenance in order to choose a sanitation system that best works for them. In the realm of ecological sanitation systems, this may mean using a biodigester, a vermifilter (which uses earthworms to replicate natural treatment processes), or a so-called ecological septic system that uses banana trees to treat waste. Cals and Adler presented examples of ongoing ecological sanitation projects, specifically describing the construction of the biodigesters in Vale Encantado and explaining how they function.

Describing ecological sanitation solutions as “a very large paradigm break,” Cals and Adler concluded their presentation with a story, emphasizing the importance of an “ecology of knowledge” that values traditional wisdom and grassroots, community knowledge. During the biodigester’s construction, they explained, the team knew that they would need concrete but could not figure out how to transport it into the middle of the forest. Neither the engineers nor the architects on the team arrived at the solution. Rather, it was Barros—a resident—who suggested making the concrete on-site, using the same technique that he had used to construct his own house. Community members play an integral role in the development of ecological sanitation solutions; Cals and Adler describe their own role as simply “sharing the message of sanitation and possible solutions.”

Challenges and Next Steps for Vale Encantado

Over lunch at Vale Encantado’s sustainable restaurant, SFN members discussed Vale Encantado’s plans for the future and major challenges. Currently, Barros says he is focused on completing the rest of the community’s biosystem, as well as increasing residents’ awareness of the system. To engage residents in separating their trash and bringing biodegradable waste to the restaurant’s biodigester, Barros came up with the idea of providing products from the kitchen, such as fresh bread, to those who deliver their food waste. To this end, Barros explained that the community needs to remodel the kitchen in order to meet the growing demand both for its products and for employment. If the kitchen is capable of producing food for up to fifty people at a time, it can remain open at regular times without requiring prior reservations (as must be done today) and ensure permanent employment for residents who currently travel long distances for work. “The renovation is crucial not only for developing the work we do, but also for generating jobs for women in the community,” Barros said.

The other major challenge currently facing Vale Encantado concerns the structure of the community cooperative, which they are considering restructuring into an NGO or a business—each of which has its advantages and disadvantages. This ignited a conversation among SFN exchange participants about the legal structures that best meet the needs of their respective organizations. The conversation grew into a brainstorming session for Vale Encantado. Carlos Alberto Oliveira from Alfazendo in City of God emphasized the importance of systematizing their knowledge and creating a strategic plan to forecast their actions, partnerships, and costs. Helio Vanderlei of Onda Verde in Nova Iguaçu—host of the first SFN exchange—suggested Barros and his neighbors partner with relevant departments at PUC-Rio, and local businesses that may be willing to contribute to ongoing projects. Ideas were also shared about effective signage that would support visitors in quickly understanding the project, its successes to date and plans for the future.

Full of new ideas, banana hearts and jackfruit stew, SFN participants traveled by bus for fifty minutes, all the while within the city of Rio de Janeiro and stopping at no traffic lights—through the massive urban Tijuca Forest—to Morro dos Prazeres, a favela located atop the historic Santa Teresa neighborhood near downtown Rio, to continue the day of exchange. Check back tomorrow to read about the second part of the day.

In The News

A growing number of investors recognise the value of sustainable business. The global challenge of climate change undeniably poses an immense threat, however clever entrepreneurs are finding ways to turn climate risk into business opportunities. At a recent event in Oslo, we spoke to some of the early movers among green investors, who extend an open invitation for others to follow suit.

The inevitability of climate change makes the case for tackling issues head-on compelling to early-mover businesses. However, a new breed of entrepreneurs is currently emerging – one that goes beyond “tackling”, but rather embraces climate change issues and risks to the extent that their value offering directly targets climate change adaptation or mitigation.

Many of these entrepreneurs have entered the EIT Climate-KIC start-up accelerator, where they receive first-class coaching, training and financial support to professionalise and scale their business. They moreover enter a European-wide community of change makers – people who collectively possess the means to make the required shift to increased sustainability happen across industry and national borders.

The pioneers

At a recent breakfast event during Oslo Innovation Week, investors and start-ups in the greentech, cleantech and sustainability space met. We spoke to Susanne Gløersen, who has been working within the field of sustainable investments for many years:

“Investing in cleantech and green capital is crucial to enable the necessary transition to a more sustainable low-carbon economy and society. Moreover, companies deliver solutions that directly or indirectly address global sustainability problems represent clear growth cases. Investors who want to make smart, profitable and resilient investments onwards need to look to investment cases that somehow tap into sustainability issues and -solutions.”

A call to investors

Several of the speakers at the Investor Breakfast called for the investor community to open their eyes to the many high potential investment prospects that emerge out of EU- and other publicly backed entrepreneurship programmes.

Jørn-Lein Mathisen from Business Angels Norway furthermore hailed the many positive aspects of being an active angel investor:

“Why become an angel investor? Because you learn a lot every day and it’s fun!”

Susanne Gløersen believes there is a need for more knowledge and a competence lift for investors to become more active in the cleantech and greentech areas:

“Some investors still carry the outdated view that all forms of investments linked to “green” are unprofitable and too volatile. We need to eradicate those misconceptions.”

Businesses cannot prosper in a world plagued with poverty, inequality, violence and environmental stress. Hence, for companies, doing well and doing good simultaneously is of paramount importance. To do so, they must align themselves with the global development priorities and ensure that they fuel and catalyse the global efforts towards achieving SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) within the stipulated time frame.

Speaking of global agenda for addressing challenges – such as poverty, gender inequality, public health and deteriorating environment – many endeavors have been planned and implemented. Most noteworthy of those was the Millennium Development Goals which were supposed to unite the hitherto fragmented efforts for development. These were eight goals pertaining to issues like poverty, education, maternal and child health. They were agreed upon by 191 United Nations members to be achieved by 2015.

However, to further strengthen this endeavor and emphasise on equity, human rights, non-discrimination and collaboration, SDGs were adopted for the next 15 years (from 2016 to 2030). SDGs are a set of 17 goals (broken down further into 169 targets) pertaining to social, economic, environmental and governance issues.

If SDGs must be achieved within the set time frame, all the agents of change need to be activated and should work in harmony – be it governments, companies, non-profits or communities themselves. This is a herculean task and can’t be thought about (and worked upon) in silos.

The countdown has begun. We are just 12 years away from the culmination of SDGs, and hence, it is important to take stock of where we stand owing to all the efforts previously undertaken. Since the turn of the century, the maternal mortality ratio in sub-Saharan Africa has declined by 35 percent and the under-five mortality rate has dropped by 50 percent. In South Asia, a girl’s risk of marrying in childhood has declined by over 40 percent. And, in the least developed countries, the proportion of the people with access to electricity has more than doubled. Globally, labour productivity has increased, and unemployment rate decreased. More than 100 countries have sustainable consumption and production policies and initiatives.

These statistics are encouraging but are only a part of the whole picture. Without undermining the importance of what has been successfully achieved, we must ponder on the issues where further interventions are required.

In 2015, 2.3 billion people still lacked even basic levels of sanitation service and 892 million people continued to practise open defecation. Close to one billion rural people still lack electricity. In sub-Saharan Africa, the HIV incidence among women of reproductive age is 10 times the global average. Nine out of 10 people living in cities breathe polluted air.

In such a scenario, corporate responsibility presents a unique opportunity to companies across the globe to contribute towards SDGs. Times have passed when social development was responsibility of the governments and the non-profits, while companies were thought of to be of profiteering nature. The lines have blurred and have provided companies a window to leverage their expertise, management proficiency and resources to address social and environmental challenges.

Companies should not ignore corporate responsibility, considering it as a cost center but must understand the vast potential it has to benefit the profit objectives by ensuring business sustainability and welfare of stakeholders. The SDGs promise significant economic rewards for companies that invest in delivering innovative solutions and transformative change. According to a flagship report from the Business Commission, achieving the SDGs could create 380 million jobs and help unlock at least $12 trillion in opportunities for business by 2030.

Despite the encouraging news that 81 percent of all disclosures show some level of sustainability disclosure, fewer than 24 percent of these disclosures contained metrics and more than 53 percent used “boilerplate” language – demonstrating that many companies still take an approach of minimal compliance to sustainability disclosure. Many companies fall prey to SDG washing – by choosing only to report on the positive impact of their actions on the SDGs, omitting any mentions of adverse impact created in the process. There is a two-fold challenge to mainstreaming the idea of companies adopting SDGs.

» The first one is, many companies are yet to explore the linkage between their business objectives and SDGs, and how the latter may benefit the former. Many companies are still at the beginning of their SDG journey. They need to work further to integrate SDGs in the business objectives and decide how to efficiently report on them. Companies still need to further integrate SDGs into their business objectives and performance matrices. Only then the intent of doing good will be formalised.

» Another challenge, that of effective impact tracking and reporting is faced by companies that have adopted SDGs in their corporate responsibility plans. António Guterres (Secretary-General, United Nations) outlines these issues – ‘there are challenges in collection, processing, analysis and dissemination of reliable, timely, accessible and sufficiently disaggregated data. Today’s technology makes it possible to collate the data we need, to keep the promise to leave no one behind.

Technology is the solution for most of the program management-related issues. The SDGs Report 2018 mentions, ‘reporting and dissemination platforms for SDGs are indispensable to policymakers and, indeed, to all stakeholders for understanding where progress is being made and informing future interventions.

Companies must leverage technology platforms that allow easy navigation, tracking and reporting of impact that their corporate responsibilities funds are driving on the ground. Technology will be the link between on-ground impact at micro level and its implications on the achievement of SDGs at the macro level. These platforms are the easiest and the most robust tools to organise and analyse the program related data and derive actionable insights for driving further strategies. If companies can consolidate their impact numbers, it will be very easy to plan resources to bridge the gap between the achieved and the desired.

259,https://www.multihousingnews.com/post/reframing-bostons-history-through-sustainable-design/,"Tue, 09 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Multi-Housing News,Reframing Boston’s History Through Sustainable Design,"The Distillery Project

This year in Boston, Urban Land Institute (ULI) brought together real estate professionals for its annual fall meeting. To open the conference, ULI members representing architects, developers, property managers and financiers toured two new communities in South and East Boston. In both The Distillery North apartments and Maverick Landing, innovative design solutions are impacting the way residents experience some of the city’s most historically rich neighborhoods.

Climate resiliency

Located at 526 E. 2nd St., The Distillery Project comprises a former distillery building, newly completed apartments called the Distillery North and a planned building called The Distillery West. It houses 28 apartment units, with zoning allowing up to 65 units. The rehabilitated distillery now houses artist live-work spaces.

Once completed, expanded sustainable features will include an expanded central lawn, greenhouses and 200 more solar PV panels, in addition to the existing 100. The development’s location places the community at high risk of flooding, due to rising sea levels and extreme weather impacts, making it ever more important to build to the highest sustainability protocols. For this reason, the community’s parking garages are sacrificial, meaning they contain no electrical or mechanical equipment that would be damaged by flooding.

Technical solutions

Luckily, Second Street Associates Principal Fred Gordon, who purchased the distillery in 1984, has always been passionate about environmentalism and the arts. “Most people in the environmentalist movement didn’t know how to drive a nail. My view was that, to tackle environmental problems, you need technical solutions,” Gordon said, referring to his initial goal of reducing the building’s energy use by 65 percent. These sentiments informed the vision behind the community, which meets the intensive Passive House standard. Such developments are meant to use around 10 percent as much energy as conventional buildings.

Fred Gordon, Nancy Ludwig

“This is Fred (Gordon’s) vision. He received no subsidies, and his firm is the equity partner,” noted Nancy Ludwig, president of ICON architecture, the company that built the apartments and will lead the development’s next phase. Among the obstacles in this undertaking was managing time- and cost-exhaustive zoning regulations, which are notably challenging in Boston, Ludwig added.

Public-private partnerships

The largest LEED-certified multifamily community in Boston, Maverick Landing is a redevelopment of a public housing project in East Boston. “Built in the 1940s, it’s essentially the ‘Exhibit A’ of public housing developments. It cut off (the neighborhood’s) access to the waterfront,” explained James Keefe, principal of Trinity Financial, the community’s sponsor. Keefe’s firm received a $35 million HOPE IV grant from HUD to demolish the buildings and rebuild them

Maverick Landing

“The key wasn’t just to build something new but to replicate something that was old,” said Keefe. To this end, the marketing took on a nautical theme as a nod to the area’s waterfront zone, which was once a hub of industrial activity. The redevelopment also did away with dumpsters, instead empowering neighbors to manage the housekeeping task on their own. Individual entry doors on the community’s townhouses are also meant to offer residents a sense of identity, security and price.

Maverick Landing

Community safety

Located at 31 Liverpool St. near the Maverick MBTA metro station, the 396-unit community enjoys quick access to downtown Boston. Maverick Landing also includes a park and a church, aimed at fostering a sense of community. Putting narrow, one-way streets throughout the community was particularly difficult, Ludwig recounted, involving lengthy negotiations with the Boston Fire Department.

Ultimately, Keefe explained, the narrower streets promote life safety and enable larger outdoor spaces, an added benefit for residents: “We put the one- and two-bedroom units into mid-rise buildings, which hadn’t been done before, so that we could put the larger units for families on their own lots.”","In both The Distillery North apartments and Maverick Landing, innovative design solutions are impacting the way residents experience some of the city’s most historically rich neighborhoods.

Guests of the recent Rose City Comic Con might even say it’s the most sustainable in the galaxy.

“OCC seeks to create a ‘green-star standard’ in event waste management. By requiring a waste diversion deposit, event and meeting planners are financially invested in minimizing their environmental impact and the refund provides a ‘leave-no-trace’ incentive,” said Craig Stroud, executive director.

OCC is the only U.S. convention center that attempts to educate its clients upfront about the many ways an event can impact the environment and benefit our community. The center’s Waste Diversion Policy calls out the roles and responsibilities each partner owns in making an event more sustainable including actions that can be taken before, during, and after an event.

Two years ago, OCC implemented the policy and today 94 percent of its events are in compliance. This encouraging response is largely a result of engaging each client at the beginning and then guiding them forward from wherever they stand on their path to sustainability.

OCC staff provide a roadmap for planning sustainable events, help vendors and guests practice green habits, and work with our community to support the environment. OCC has a long-term goal of reaching at least an 80 percent diversion rate, and this can only be achieved if staff ensure that the material brought into the building can be recycled, donated, or taken back by the company that produced it.

For contracted events taking 30,000 square feet or more of convention space, a deposit is required. One hundred percent of the deposit is credited to the master bill once the event organizer complies with the policy requirements.

To set clients up for success, they are provided a standard list of items that are not recyclable in the Pacific Northwest and therefore shouldn’t be brought into the building. Following an event, clients are asked to place all recyclable items into the sorting receptacles we offer. Because collecting, sorting, and processing everything requires a lot of coordination — and cooperation — the policy also specifies who is to complete each task.

“Sustainability is woven into the environmental ethos and social responsible operations of the center to such a level that clients who choose the Oregon Convention Center for their event can proclaim they are a green meeting,” said Ryan Harvey, sustainability coordinator.

Reaching the LEED Platinum designation, the highest level of certification from the U.S. Green Building Council, for an existing center is nearly unprecedented with only two convention centers receiving this designation. The Oregon Convention Center is also the first venue in the world to have earned the highest level of the APEX/ASTM green meeting standard by the Events Industry Council.

Energy efficiency in the center is accomplished with 6,500 rooftop solar panels generating 25 to 30 percent of the convention center's energy consumption, which is the approximate equivalent of 133 Portland homes on an annual basis. Through the Pacific Power’s Blue Sky program and NW Natural’s Smart Energy program, OCC offsets 100 percent of electrical and natural gas use in the facility. As a purchaser of many Renewable Energy Certificates, OCC was recently invited to participate in a new Pacific Power program called Blue Sky Select allowing the center to direct funds to support the incubation of a solar farm project in Utah. Because of the way the electrical grid works, energy from this solar farm isn't actually being used; yet the center is creating a more sustainable energy industry.

Re-use organizations like Habitat for Humanity have partnered with OCC on product donations, receiving more than 50,000 pounds of items that could be utilized in its projects. Additionally, Blanchet House received donations of nearly 34,000 meals to help address food scarcity last year.

Public transit is encouraged with discounted transit passes to reduce the carbon footprint and ease transportation to and from the airport and various destinations throughout the city with the MAX light rail, street car, bus line and electric scooters all in very close proximity to the center.

Since 2004 when OCC became the first convention center in the world to earn a LEED certification as an existing building, the team has been a catalyst for change. Their next paradigm shift will be through partnerships and collaboration to deepen the environmental impact by collaborating with the clients who rent the facility.","With hundreds of events and more than a half a million guests each year, the Oregon Convention Center’s sustainability is blazing the trail towards the most sustainable convention center in the world.

A high number of advertisements and promotional campaigns have been on the rise in Egypt to market gated high-end communities, yet their economic and architectural sustainability remains questionable.

Private real estate companies build 50,000 to 60,000 houses annually. However, most of these units do not get sold, according to a statement by the Chairman of the Real Estate Development Chamber told to Al Ahram.

In an effort to provide Egypt’s growing population with affordable but environment-friendly housing, several government and private organizations have been working on building sustainable architecture.

New path to sustainable projects

The Housing and Building National Research Center (HBRC) is building a new headquarter in New Cairo for the Ministry of Environment by end of 2018.

HBRC is a center affiliated to the Egyptian Housing Ministry and is known for developing architecture design methods and studies on potential eco-friendly projects, among other goals according to their official website.

Chairman of HBRC Khaled El Zahaby spoke with Egyptian Streets about the project that will be located in New Cairo, a city in the southeastern edge of Cairo.

He mentioned that the center received construction permits this month, whereas development will commence shortly.

“HBRC completed the designs for the building that will be built by otherdevelopment companies who will be required to apply for the construction bid offered by the Ministry of Environment,” El Zahaby told Egyptian Streets.

In May, the center launched a competition that ended in June, calling on architects to design a prototype of a temple- a mosque or a church or other houses of worship-adhering to sustainable standards.

The competition required contestants to tackle certain aspects concerning construction techniques for the building to be eco-friendly including ventilation, use of building materials from natural resources, and how the doors and windows are aligned to allow in sunlight.

HBRC is finalizing its latest rating system to serve the public; the system is comprised of a code that will assess whether communities, building, banks, roads, and hospitals are sustainably sufficient.

The code will be issued and operational after discussing green rating systems for roads on 29 July and deciding on suitable ones for hospitals.

“The newly updated green code includes assessing location, water, energy, transportation and, innovation. A committee is assigned to handle each category, producing an outlook of how the code should operate,” Khaled El Zahaby Chairman of HBRC tells Egyptian Streets.

These factors are assessed based on the information provided from developers of a certain project. Some of the grading techniques that HBRC carries out include rating whether a certain building method is innovated or traditional.

“Through certain technologies, we evaluate if a certain water system is developed right whether it is used for irrigation or drinking water and determine the amount of earth materials and natural resources used in construction,” he explains.

El Zahaby mentioned that despite the efforts, constructing an environmentally sustainable building remains halted by several reasons.

“Egypt suffers of a problem in energy and water which are the main focus of our rating systems,” he says.

Advisor for the Ministry of Environment Mohamed Salah has previously mentioned in May, during the inauguration of the first Environment Forum and “Earth- Stone” exhibition held in Cairo’s French University, that Egyptian developers should expand in implementing eco-friendly solutions and building sustainable cities, describing “these implications have become a primary demand today to reduce energy consumption.”

Egypt is currently paving the way to build 13 smart cities nationwide according to President Abdelfattah El Sisi announcement in 2017.

According to the State Information Service (SIS), the new cities are expected to achieve economic and sustainable development in the telecommunications and real estate sectors. Some of these smart cities that are underway include the new Administrative Capital City, New Alamein City, and East Port Said City.

Modern vs. old architecture

Architecture Professor at Misr International University Heba Safy El Din defines “sustainable architecture” as something to be built today that can adapt to tomorrow’s needs economically, socially, and culturally.

“Earlier in the 19th century in Egypt, architects used to implement several experiments before choosing a site for construction,” she tells Egyptian Streets.

She explains that these experiments were on air flow and configuration inside the house itself as well as site selection.

“Houses like El Sehemy house featured spacious spaces that not only allowed good air ventilation but also provided privacy for women who did not wish toexposed to neighbors,” she says.

El Sehemy is a house that was built in the Ottoman era during 1648 in Cairo. It remains a popular tourist site among international and local tourists alike.

Old Cairo buildings featured a heavy use of Earth’s resources which allowed tunnelling, shading, and minimal heat and sun exposure that created a cooler interior atmosphere.

“Houses that featured cooler interior atmosphere have managed to enhance homeowners’ experience in buildings and streets of old Cairo,” Mostafa Ascar, founder of Karm Build and Karm Solar sustainable architecture further clarifies to Egyptian Streets.

In applying a modern definition, architects should have a sole target to upgrade existing buildings and revamp traditional building methods, paving way to new building techniques, according to Ascar.

Several real-estate developers have taken steps into building eco-friendly and resource efficient projects.

Despite the attempt, the current projects can’t be properly defined as sustainable architecture, according to award- winning Architect Samer El Sayary.

El Sayary pointed out a number of challenges stalling sustainability in Egypt including scarcity in energy and water resources, high costs, rapidly increasing population, negative environmental impact, and lack of waste management.

He suggests that provisions of the Green Pyramid Rating System (GPRS), should be forced on developers as part of some practical solutions to tackle obstacles.

Other solutions he emphasizes include conducting more research and development, marketing real estate outside Egypt, and investing in industries specialized in prefabricated buildings.

“We should always ask why not develop the traditional techniques by using latest cutting-edge technologies? For example, applying the 3D printing technology on houses using the rammed earth construction is a widely used solution and is very successful,” El Sayary tells Egyptian Streets.

He elaborates that applying modern technology on traditional methods can help construct environmentally friendly high-rise structures with zero waste construction, while achieving a safe economic and sustainable outcome.

Despite Al-Sawary’s criticism, there are buildings in Egypt that meet the sustainability standards stipulated in a legislation called the Green Pyramid Rating System (GPRS).

Today’s sustainable architecture

GPRS, set in 2010, is considered the Egyptian version of the LEED certification. However it has been barely implemented.

“The Gate”, a 4.8 million square foot complex located in Cairo’s Heliopolis, has a GPRS certificate.

The project is being developed by Belgian firm Vincent Callebaut Architectures and commissioned by the Egyptian Abraj Misr. The Gate will be fully completed in 2019.

The ambitious project features 1,000 smart apartments with an interior comprised of “mega- trees”, and walls that provide natural ventilation.

Buildings on site are partially powered by solar and wind energies. Callebaut has previously mentioned to Business Insider that he sees the project as a “small” step towards a sustainable future.

Hand Over is another ambitious firm that implemented various projects in Siwa, El Ayat area, Old Cairo and Misr- Alexandria desert road.

“The projects included residential, public spaces, schools, community centers attributing a passive design using local resources that are 25% cheaper than traditional building materials,” Owner of Hand Over Radwa Rostom told Egyptian Streets.

Ascar believes that a cultural shift is necessary to appreciate the long term benefits of sustainable architecture on economy, society and environment.

“Clearer political initiatives from the government to regulate and enforce such changes are needed,” he told Egyptian Streets.

As Egypt continues to pave way for new residential communities, architects push forward to change conventional construction means for a sustainable eco-friendly future despite the lack of government regulations.

262,https://www.packagingdigest.com/sustainability/here-there-everywhere-global-differences-sustainable-packaging,"Wed, 08 Jul 2020 01:54:49 GMT",Packaging Digest,"Here, there, everywhere: Global differences in sustainable packaging","After two trips to Asia, North American-based sustainability expert Bob Lilienfeld draws interesting conclusions about the cultural and socio-economic aspects of sustainability and packaging in different areas of the world.

In February 2018, I wrote for Packaging Digest about my Indonesia trip, visiting Asia Pulp & Paper’s offices in Jakarta and paper mill on Sumatra. I’ve just returned from a similar visit to China, touring APP’s offices in Shanghai, along with its mills near the city of Ningbo and on the island of Hainan. I was told that the latter mill is the largest in the world, capable of turning pulp into 10-meter-wide, 90 ton rolls of paper in 45 minutes (see photo above).

While I was prepared to once again hear about the value of APP’s low-cost advantage through vertical integration and highly automated paperboard production, I was not prepared for the key piece of learning from the Chinese experience: Approaches to, and beliefs about, sustainability are fairly different in China than in Indonesia, and vastly different versus North America. The differences reflect the economic, social and environmental issues, and values, of each country’s cultures and communities.

Unlike Indonesia, which contains vast stretches of tropical rainforests and plantations, the economically accessible forests near China’s primary transportation and population centers have been largely depleted: Much of the pulp processed in APP’s China paper mills is trans-shipped from its Indonesian pulp mills, and woodchips used for pulp making are imported from other sources and locations. (I was told that the chips I saw offloaded via container ships at the Hainan mill were certified to be sustainably sourced in Vietnam.)



The small amount of available plantation land in China must therefore be carefully managed for sustainability. Here are two examples of APP’s approach to sustainable forestry:

To maximize economic efficiency and minimize the environmental impact of pulp production, APP practices coppicing, a method of woodland management that exploits the capacity of certain tree species (in this case acacia) to grow new shoots from stumps after cutting. The two or three strongest shoots are chosen, and the others trimmed off.

Note in the photo that all of the trees are actually two or three trees growing from a single stump. This practice at least doubles the yield per stump (and thus per hectare of land), which significantly enhances economics while reducing the need (or temptation) to increase plantation size.

From a social perspective, woodlands are shared with local farmers, who use them to provide food and shelter for themselves and their livestock—in this case, chickens! (I’m sure the poultry return the favor by helping to fertilize the trees.)

Here’s another example of a local approach to sustainability, and one that would not be considered as such here in the United States: When I asked APP personnel how much of their (and other producers’) paperboard and corrugated is being recycled, they proudly told me “100%.” Incredulous, I asked how that could be, and was told that in rural areas, it was collected and burned for fuel.

Even though this meant that individual families’ combined burning activities amounted to significant local air pollution, it was felt that this was a more sustainable strategy than chopping down even more trees for wood-fired heating and cooking. By the way, this practice was quite evident, as we saw multiple small fires burning in local fields and near homes when travelling between Shanghai and Ningbo, and throughout the rural areas of Hainan.

Even in big cities, much of the collection for recycling is handled by local entrepreneurs, rather than by government-funded collection programs. (In the photo, note the care in containing and protecting the recovered board, here on one of Shanghai’s privately owned and operated “collection trucks.”)

And, while we here in North America believe coal to be the fuel of last resort, APP was very proud of its coal-fired plants, which also powered local communities that might not otherwise have access to electricity. When I explained this difference in thinking to one of the plant managers, he said, “We constantly update these power stations to minimize greenhouse gas generation and pollution. And, we really don’t have other significant energy sources near many of our Chinese plants. It’s also the right thing to do for rural communities that would otherwise remain way behind in terms of living standards. Isn’t that a big part of sustainability?”

That’s a great question, and leads to the ultimate sustainability conundrum: Globally, what is it we’re all trying to accomplish via our various, and at times vastly different, approaches to waste prevention and remediation? Is it actually possible to enhance overall quality of life without creating massive environmental degradation in the air, on land and at sea?

Looked at from this perspective, packaging by itself isn’t that big of an environmental issue, is it? In fact, I’ll bet it’s primarily a symptom, and not the actual disease.

The disease, if you will, is the multiplicative effect of consumption and population growth. I would argue that packaging may facilitate this growth, but it certainly is not responsible for it. Thus, if we’re not willing to admit to and tackle the negative impacts of our basic human desires, we do not have the collective will to truly solve the problems they are creating.

Of course the packaging industry has a role to play, and work to do, when it comes to providing economic, environmental and social sustainability. But, let’s be honest with ourselves and start reminding regulators, lawmakers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the media and the public that it’s a supporting role, not a starring one. Bans on straws, bags and cups here in North America are not going to mitigate climate change, reduce food waste or clean up the oceans.

True sustainability must transcend cultural and socio-economic differences, with specific broad scale goals set over specific time periods designed to mitigate specific problems. It will require significant behavior change from each of us here in North America, as well as from all of us around the world.

264,https://www.greenbiz.com/article/10-minutes-josh-prigge-host-sustainable-nation,"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",GreenBiz,"10 Minutes with Josh Prigge, host of 'Sustainable Nation'","This column is about the ""how"" of sustainable business, featuring one significant change and how a leader (and team) made it happen. Josh Prigge is founder and CEO of sustainability consulting firm Sustridge and host of the Sustainable Nation podcast. He just completed his 50th episode. The podcast started earlier this year and features sustainability leaders across business, higher education and government. We discussed the cumulative learnings of these 50 leaders.

Bob Langert: What pops out first as most in common to all 50 interviewees?

Josh Prigge: Collaboration is probably the No. 1 theme that keeps coming up for successfully leading sustainability change initiatives, as well as the power of networks, both internally and externally, and cross-sector collaboration.

Most sustainability leaders have relatively small teams within large organizations. So, developing relationships really is crucial in having the ability to influence others and is what really drives change.

Langert: How does one really influence people?

Prigge: Being a good communicator and being open to other people's ideas. Empathy is a big thing. So, being able to put yourself in someone else’s shoes and understanding what's important to others. Being able to communicate how sustainability fits in there and how sustainability can be helpful to them in what they're trying to accomplish in their department.

I think it turns people off when, as a sustainability professional, you're trying to tell other people what to do or what needs to be done.

Langert: With all these interviews you've done with all these different sector people, it must be so fascinating. Has anything been unexpected?

Prigge: I've been somewhat surprised by a couple things. One is just the level of commitment that we're seeing in all of these sectors. The number of organizations and communities that are embracing things like the Sustainable Development Goals, science-based targets, the B Corp movement and the concept of regenerative development.

It's just been amazing to see all these sectors really embracing this next step in the evolution of sustainable development. Moving past sustainability, past the idea of merely reducing negative impacts, to embracing regenerative practices and a focus on positive impacts. So, I've seen universities that have goals of net-zero water use and climate-positive goals. Governments that are committing to regenerative agriculture and zero-waste futures. Businesses with net-positive corporate footprint goals.

What’s surprising me is the amount of optimism in all sectors and how excited everyone is, especially now more than ever in the absence of any federal leadership. Langert: Has anything surprised you?

Prigge: What’s surprising me is the amount of optimism in all sectors and how excited everyone is, especially now more than ever in the absence of any federal leadership. The optimism about our ability to make that change has been impressive.

It's been somewhat surprising to me because as sustainability professionals, we're also painfully aware of the trouble that we're in and the issues that we're facing as a planet and as a society. But at the same time, I guess we're surrounded by each other. We surround ourselves with some of the most passionate, brilliant, committed people in the world. So I think we give each other hope and I think we build that optimism within each other.

Langert: Since you hear leaders communicating on your podcasts, what are the best tips you've learned about how to best verbally communicate?

Prigge: I think both internally and externally, the No. 1 thing is being authentic. From my own experience and from all the interviews I've done, this is really the most important thing when communicating sustainability.

Langert: Translate that into, how does one be authentic?

Prigge: I guess there's so much greenwashing out there, and people are getting smart. Don't make sustainability a separate marketing and communication initiative.

How does sustainability fit into who you are as an organization? Communicate how sustainability ties into the core mission or purpose of the organization, whether it's how sustainability ties into the purpose of the business, or how it helps a university provide valuable education for its students or helps prepare students to become global citizens. Or how it helps to provide a safe, healthy, equitable environment for your community. Talk about how the core mission or purpose, what that is and then how sustainability is helping to realize that vision.

Langert: What have you observed with the sustainability leaders when it comes to things that are not working well?

Prigge: Be transparent about it. Be open about it. I’ve learned that people will give you the benefit of the doubt. And I think a lot of corporations are scared to take that leap, to make that announcement, to set those goals because they're afraid of falling short, but I think they need to understand that people maybe aren't as concerned about that part as they are of just knowing that you're making an effort and you're starting your journey.

Langert: You ask all your interviewees, ""What is one piece of advice you would give to other sustainability professionals that might help them in their careers?"" What comes up most?

Prigge: Well, broken record, but building relationships internally and externally is the most common response I get there. So, again, being very strategic and deliberate in understanding who you need to develop relationships with and who you need to maintain them with.

You can understand all of the sustainability frameworks and know everything about what is needed for an organization. But if you don't have strong relationships, you're not going to be able to implement much of that.

Another takeaway is to look outside your industry, even outside your sector. So, myself personally, I think it really helped that I worked in higher education for several years, and then moved to the corporate world, and I hear this from a lot of my guests as well. So, look at higher ed, look at business, look at government for ideas, for models, for strategies. Stay informed on sustainability issues in all these different areas because there's a lot of great things going on.","Josh Prigge is founder and CEO of sustainability consulting firm Sustridge and host of the Sustainable Nation podcast.

265,https://civileats.com/2018/10/23/high-school-students-run-this-dock-to-table-sustainable-seafood-program/,"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Civil Eats,High School Students Run This Dock-to-Table Sustainable Seafood Program,"On a late-spring Saturday, dock manager Stephen Bardsley held a monkfish high overhead at the Point Pleasant Fisherman’s Dock Co-Operative in New Jersey. Its mottled skin mimicked the color of the ocean floor, and a fishing-rod-shaped antenna dangled from its head. Its sharp teeth formed a gaping subaquatic grin as a group of visitors pushed in.

“Little fish swim up, and they can’t even see the difference in color,” explains Bardsley to his guests. Then the fishing-rod antenna becomes a hunting tool. He paused for effect. “When a smaller fish comes in to bite that rod…ROOF!” he barks.

Laughs erupted—though admittedly, this crowd was familiar with the fish. The dock tour that day was for student employees and members of Fishadelphia, a Philadelphia-based community-supported fishery (CSF) program that fosters connections between urban consumers and coastal harvesters.

Fishadelphia officially launched in February 2018, the brainchild of Talia Young, a Philadelphia science educator and Princeton University David H. Smith Conservation postdoc. It was made possible with a two-and-a-half-year, $265,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Farmers’ Market and Local Food Promotion Program and is designed to serve multiple constituencies.

Middle- and high-school students from the Mastery Charter School Thomas Campus in South Philly, who gain entrepreneurial skills and an education in regional foodways, are the “employees.” Customers include long-time city residents and recent immigrants, with whom students communicate in English, Spanish, Mandarin, and Tedim Chin, a language primarily spoken in Myanmar and India.

Operated as an after-school club, Fishadelphia is open to any student with an interest in seafood or business. On average, it attracts 10–15 students who commit roughly three hours weekly, with grant-funded stipends for student leaders who help guide the team. Many students have their favorite jobs; some like selling merchandise or greeting customers, others prefer prepping the biweekly shares of clams, black bass, and other Jersey-harvested seafood, which customers pick up at the school on alternate Thursdays during a 16-week season. Any leftovers get distributed to the students.

Both students and customers gain an education in the food system. Yet Fishadelphia has a deeper purpose. “The program mission is inherently related to justice—it’s about providing access to high-quality food for low-income people,” Young says.

With a record 90 percent of American seafood being imported, roughly 6 billion pounds in 2017, connecting coast and city is also smart business. While strategic fisheries management has reduced overfished stocks to 15 percent, the U.S. cannot compete on price when it comes to processing, which means species such as lobster are often harvested here, exported for processing, and then reimported. Demand also continues to outpace supply for popular fish such as salmon, tuna, and shrimp.

A cohort of four initial partners, including the Point Pleasant Co-Operative, provide Fishadelphia with its product. Young makes a point of seeking out small-scale, sustainable operations whenever possible, though she notes that docks and processors are an essential part of the Mid-Atlantic fisheries supply chain, offering a consistent sales outlet to independent harvesters. While deliveries to the CSF’s 60 members reflect a drop in the proverbial bucket, direct marketing secures premium pricing for the fishermen.

“If local, sustainable seafood off the boats isn’t promoted, I’m not going to have a job. Neither are all of the fisherman that I work with,” Bardsley says, although he notes that’s not his sole motive for getting involved: “When I found out about this program, I was like, ‘I’ve got to do it, because it’s all about the kids.’”

A Food System Education

Flash back to a few days before the trip to Point Pleasant, and in the shadow of Lincoln Financial Field—home to the Philadelphia Eagles football team—activity filled a canary-yellow classroom. Students set coolers on folding tables and put hairnets in place. They prepared shares of dayboat scallops for pick-up, which landed that morning at the co-op. Clad in aqua shirts bearing a butterfish floating above the Walt Whitman Bridge, their chatter echoed in waves.

“Are you interested in merchandise?” Young asks one student looking for an activity. “Lather for 15 seconds, which is as long as it takes to sing the alphabet song,” she guides another just beginning to wash hands.

As luck would have it, her energy matches theirs. “Sometimes I’m at Princeton, and we go around and talk about what we do. People are like, ‘I’m building a mathematical model to better understand game-theory choice’—and I’m like, ‘Well, today I shopped for plastic aprons on the internet,’” she laughs.","On a late-spring Saturday, dock manager Stephen Bardsley held a monkfish high overhead at the Point Pleasant Fisherman’s Dock Co-Operative in New Jersey.

266,https://www.greenbiz.com/article/can-asia-make-sustainable-palm-oil,"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",GreenBiz,Can Asia make sustainable palm oil?,"Palm oil is the most widely consumed, yet one of the most contentious, vegetable oils on the planet. This high-yielding and versatile food commodity pervades half the items on our supermarket shelves, but not without a cost: deforestation and degradation of critical ecosystems, climate change and abuses of labor and human rights.

As demand continues to grow amidst rising affluence, and with the agriculture and forestry, and land use sector already contributing to 24 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, how we use land for food must become a critical part of the climate solution rather than the problem.

Not enough progress

Current solutions to transform the way we use land for food, and palm oil in particular — despite seeing significant progress — will remain ineffective as long as Asian companies and banks continue to buy and finance unsustainable palm oil.

Solutions to transform the way we use land for food, and palm oil in particular, will remain ineffective as long as Asian companies and banks continue to buy and finance unsustainable palm oil.

Parts of the market are forging ahead. Many of the sector’s large brands have sustainable sourcing policies in place, albeit varying in strength. These at least require certification to the most widely adopted certification standard, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), which is being revised to account for its shortcomings, or go further to include No Deforestation, No Peat and No Exploitation (NDPE) (PDF) . Many international banks, too, go beyond RSPO to include NDPE commitments, and investors representing $6.7 trillion have called for the RSPO revisions to catch up to these leading market practices. Financial institutions representing over $81.7 trillion (PDF) are also backing Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) , which calls for the disclosure of forward-looking and science-based climate strategies and has recommendations for the food and beverages sector. Some banks are already rewarding more sustainable companies with loans that tie the cost of capital to ESG ratings — including companies in food supply chains.

While these developments are not without their challenges — for example, how to monitor and enforce NDPE commitments — the arguably bigger threat to the sector is continued leakage of unsustainable palm oil into a secondary market with slacker requirements.

Addressing challenges

There are at least three reasons behind this, which must be addressed if we want to transform the palm oil sector into a sustainable development success story.

First is the tendency of companies to ""clean up"" supply chains by buying from already sustainable suppliers. Rather than solving the problem, this merely displaces deforestation to surrounding landscapes and will persist as long as smallholders are excluded from more progressive companies’ programs. Given limited resources, technical capacity or incentives, smallholders will continue to grow through expansion — often on land that is critical to ecosystems and climate health — rather than through efficiency gains.

Second, the market will pick up what the pristine supply chains do not want. India is the world’s largest importer of palm oil, while growing demand from emerging markets for palm oil is a key driver of deforestation in Indonesia and Malaysia. In fact, the major growth markets for palm oil are exactly those markets with softer sustainability standards — not only in China and India, but also the Middle East and Eastern Europe.

Third, Asian banks continue to lend to those sourcing or producing unsustainable palm oil without requiring time-bound improvements on sustainability criteria as conditions for lending.

India is the world’s largest importer of palm oil, while growing demand from emerging markets for palm oil is a key driver of deforestation in Indonesia and Malaysia. A new report, ""Keep Palm"" (PDF) by WWF and CLSA, an Asian capital markets and investment group, outlines how companies, banks and investors can play a role in lifting the entire industry’s sustainability standards.

The report recommends that end buyers — the regions’ retailers, consumer goods companies, restaurants, and hotels — should commit to and disclose progress against time-bound plans for sourcing RSPO-certified and NDPE-compliant palm oil and to achieving 100 percent traceable (to the plantation) supply chains.

This ""clean up,"" however, should not merely displace the sector’s problems. At least a portion of procurement for sustainable supply chains should come from smallholders, preferably by helping smallholders to achieve RSPO certification. At the same time, the focus needs to go beyond individual plantations and projects to ensure the sustainability of wider landscapes and the communities that depend on them, finding multistakeholder solutions that simultaneously protect vital ecosystems and forests and uplift local communities.

The role of banks

The region’s financiers play a critical role in supporting these solutions. Banks can start by disclosing how issues of climate, deforestation, labor and human rights are managed in their lending portfolios; they can follow their international peers in requiring sustainable production practices by clients; and they can help smallholders improve their practices through innovative funding mechanisms. Investors, too, can continue to engage with portfolio companies across supply chains and sectors, including the banks financing them, to push for more ambitious adoption of best practices and more transparency around business practices.

Investors can continue to engage with portfolio companies across supply chains and sectors, including the banks financing them, to push for more ambitious adoption of best practices. According to data from Thomson Reuters, only a quarter of Asian-headquartered companies disclose emissions reduction targets. ""Transparency is key to the solution,"" said Elena Philipova, head of ESG Proposition at Thomson Reuters, as public reporting and commitments enforce accountability — and this is true for small and large corporations, investors and the public sector. The data shows that companies that disclose emissions reduction targets have a significantly higher ESG rating on average than companies that do not, and these ratings are starting to affect the cost of capital.

Home-grown initiatives such as the Singapore-based Southeast Asia Alliance for Sustainable Palm Oil and the China Sustainable Palm Oil Alliance indicate an emerging commitment to sustainable palm oil in the region. Facilitating collaboration among multinational brands, small- and medium-sized enterprises and civil society, these initiatives highlight the potential for multistakeholder solutions to drive the industry forward.

By building on this momentum and leveraging the impact of the region’s banks and investors, the sector’s stakeholders can go a long way in helping palm oil reach its potential to contribute to, rather than undermine, sustainable development. Palm oil can be and must be a critical part of the solution to food security, regional sustainable development and the global climate crisis.","Palm oil is the most widely consumed, yet one of the most contentious, vegetable oils on the planet.

267,https://earth911.com/living-well-being/pick-sustainable-music-festivals/,"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Earth911.com,Pick Sustainable Music Festivals,"It’s no secret that music festivals are big business these days, and big business often means big waste. Nationwide, festivals are beginning to pay closer attention to waste management, but most festivals have a long way to go.

Pickathon, a small, eclectic festival in the Pacific Northwest, may be North America’s first sustainable festival. If bigger festivals learn to scale up Pickathon’s sustainable practices, your music-focused travel could be as good for the planet as it is for your soul.

The Problem

When we party, we make a bigger mess than at home. Coachella produces 107 tons of waste per day. With roughly 100,000 attendees each day, Coachella is one of the biggest festivals in North America, but it is typical in its waste production. Other events held on the festival grounds in Indio, California, have similar disposal rates.

The Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Tennessee produces more than 679 tons of waste over four days. That’s 15 pounds of waste per attendee — nearly twice what the average American disposes at home.

Thinking ahead, choosing events with sustainability goals and waste reduction commitments is better for the planet. You may not hear the difference in the music, but you’ll feel the results after the show.

Baby Steps

A few sustainability measures have become common on the festival circuit. Most festivals now encourage recycling, even of the hard-to-recycle plastic water bottles that contribute significantly to the volume of festival waste. Where data is available, festivals seem to be reaching a 20 percent recycling rate. That is still well below the national average of 35 percent and woefully far from the almost 60 percent recycling rates achieved by America’s top recycling cities.

However, waste reduction is better than recycling at live events. Once discouraged by security, reusable water bottles are now encouraged almost everywhere, with filling stations at most festivals. The obvious step of reducing plastic cups in the beer garden by selling festival-branded metal pint glasses is now widespread, too. Often, reusable glasses are incentivized with $1 off refills for the duration of the festival.

Next-Level Recycling



A few festivals have taken the next steps. Outside Lands in San Francisco has banned plastic straws and converted to compostable dishes, giving them the highest waste diversion rate — 91 percent — of any festival in the U.S. They are as close as any large festival has come to replicating the gold standard of sustainability set by Portland’s plastic-free festival Pickathon.

Pickathon Sustainability

With attendance around 6,500 people (including volunteers, staff, and crew members) Pickathon is a fraction the size of festivals like Coachella and Bonnaroo, which has given them the flexibility to experiment. Since 2016, their recycling rate has been roughly 49 percent. That approaches some of the nation’s greenest cities. It’s much lower than Outside Lands’ recycling rate because there is so much less waste to recycle. Pickathon has eliminated the biggest waste streams generated by festivals — single-use plastics and disposable dishware.

Since 2010, Pickathon has eliminated disposable dishware and utensils by providing reusable dishware for rent. A $10 token can be exchanged for a set of dishes from any food vendor at the festival. Once used, dirty dishes can be returned to a dish station and exchanged for a new token. You can also bring your own dishes and wash them yourself.

The festival has also installed permanent solar arrays at the venue. Over the course of the year, they offset the energy used: at the indoor Galaxy stage; by all food and craft vendors; and along 3.5 miles of trail lights through the campground.

Pickathon also reuses the materials each year when constructing the Mountain main stage and two other outdoor stages. The remaining Treeline stage is produced in a partnership with the Portland State University School of Architecture using the “diversion design-build” concept. Each year, architecture students design an original, sculptural performance structure. They design the stage to convert into a new structure after the festival, leaving no waste. The most recent Treeline stage was used to build storage units for residents of a Portland women’s shelter.

Plan Your Musical Travel

The Sustainable Concerts Working Group has produced guidance for venues and festivals striving to be more environmentally responsible. When you are deciding which festivals to attend next summer, look for sustainability information on the festival website to see how many best practices they follow. And if what you find affects your decision to attend, don’t hesitate to communicate that fact to the organizers. When concert-goers value harmony with the planet as much as headliners, festival organizers will, too.

CANBERRA, Oct 29 2018 (IPS) - At the mouth of the Mataniko River, which winds its way through the vibrant coastal port town of Honiara to the sea, is the sprawling informal community of Lord Howe Settlement, which hugs the banks of the estuary and seafront. A walk from the nearby main road to the beach involves a meandering route through narrow alleys between crowded dwellings, homes to about 630 people, which are clustered among the trees and overhang the water.

An estimated 40 percent of Honiara’s population of about 67,000 live in at least 30 squatter settlements. Sanitation coverage is about 32 percent in the Solomon Islands and in this capital city the piped sewerage system, which does not extend to unplanned settlements, is dispersed into local waterways and along the coastline.

For centuries, coastal fishing has been central to the nutrition, food security and livelihoods of Pacific Islanders, as it will be in the twenty first century. But, as population growth in the region reaches 70 percent and cities and towns expand along island coastlines, waste, especially untreated sewage, has become a dire threat to coastal waters and their fisheries.

“Areas of high population density, such as cities and tourism areas, are associated with excess release of poorly treated wastewater onto reefs. Many coastal communities rely heavily on fishing for their subsistence and household income and endangering the lagoons and fishing areas will threaten their livelihoods,” is the personal view of Dr. Johann Poinapen, who also holds the position of director of the Institute of Applied Sciences at the University of the South Pacific in Fiji.

Subsistence fishing in near shore areas, typically of finfish, trochus, molluscs, clams, crabs and bêche-de-mer, accounts for 70 percent of all coastal catches in the Pacific Islands and 22 percent of the region’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

Sewage waste pollutes the oceans

Sewage waste is a global issue, accounting for about 75 percent of pollution in the world’s oceans, and every Pacific Island state has identified it as a cause of environmental and health problems, ranging from marine ‘dead zones’ and the loss of reefs to outbreaks of seafood poisoning.

Critically its discharge in coastal areas leads to the loss of habitats for marine life, according to Associate Professor Monique Gagnon, an expert in ecotoxicology at the School of Molecular and Life Sciences, Curtin University in Western Australia.

“Effluent, or nutrient pollution, produces eutrophication and the growth of algae can change marine habitats, threatening local fish populations and encouraging invasive species,” Gagnon told IPS.

Health and environmental issues

Human effluent generates the over-production of algae and cyanobacteria in waterways and the sea. Toxic algal blooms can infect all types of fish and shellfish and lead to the demise of coral reefs and their fish stocks. Sewage also depletes oxygen in aquatic ecosystems, leading to the condition of Hypoxia, which causes the death of fish through paralysis. And the consumption of fish contaminated by biotoxins can cause serious illnesses, such as paralytic shellfish poisoning and ciguatera.

A study of marine pollution in the Republic of the Marshall Islands in 2016 found that nine of ten ocean and lagoon sites surveyed were heavily polluted, particularly with disease carrying bacteria from human and animal waste. In Samoa, the Ministry of Health has connected typhoid cases with seafood collected near shore which has been spoiled by effluent from coastal villages.





The first global Blue Economy ConferenceThe first global Sustainable Blue Economy Conference will be held in Nairobi, Kenya from Nov. 26 to 28 and is being co-hosted with Canada and Japan. Over 4,000 participants from around the world are coming together to learn how to build a blue economy.

Lack of sewage treatment facilities and collection services for households in Pacific cities, together with mostly unimproved sanitation in rural areas, are leading to increasing amounts of effluent entering coastal waters or conveyed there from rivers and streams.

The problem is acute in urban areas where under-resourced civic services are struggling to cope with a high influx of people migrating from less developed rural areas. Urban centres are growing at a very high annual rate of 4.7 percent in the Solomon Islands, 3.5 percent in Vanuatu and 2.8 percent in Papua New Guinea.

The situation in Honiara in the Solomon Islands is typical of many other Melanesian towns and cities in the southwest Pacific.

“Upstream [of the Mataniko River] there are sewerage outlets which are coming directly into the river. Then, as you come down, you see these little houses on the riverbanks; these are toilets,” Josephine Teakeni, president of the local women’s civil society group, Vois Blong Mere, told IPS.

Lack of resources restricts improved sanitation

The Honiara City Council is involved in manufacturing affordable toilet hardware items, especially for people in settlements who are on low incomes, and provides a septic tank collection service. But lack of resources severely restricts their operations.

“We don’t have the capacity to do this for the whole city, but we can empty septic systems for anyone who can pay the fee of SB$400 (USD51),” George Titiulu in the Council’s Health and Environment Services told IPS.

He admits that there is an environmental problem.

“We have done some studies of the Mataniko River and there is a high level of E.coli in the water,” Titiulu elaborated.

The proportion of people in the Pacific Islands using improved sanitation rose by only 2 percent, from 29 percent to 31 percent, over the 25 year period from 1990 to 2015, reports the World Health Organization. This leaves a shortfall of 6.9 million people who lack this basic service across the region.

In the Solomon Islands, as in other developing Pacific Island states, the obstacles to better progress include lack of basic infrastructure, expertise, technical capacity and reliable funding. The challenges are even greater to extend basic services into informal settlements because of complex customary land rights and insecure tenure for residents, as well as their frequent location in natural hazard and disaster prone areas, such as flood plains.

Significant economic losses expected if pollution is not addressed

Yet the issue will have to be tackled with experts predicting that habitat destruction, together with climate change and over-exploitation of marine resources, will drive a continuing decline in coastal fisheries in the coming decades. For Pacific Islanders, this could lead to significant economic losses, a rise in the cost of fish and diminishing food. The regional development organisation, the Pacific Community, predicts that within 15 years an additional 115,000 tonnes of fish will be needed to manage the food gap.

“Tackling sewage pollution in the Pacific Island region is not an easy feat,” Poinapen told IPS. His personal view is that all stakeholders, not just governments, must be involved in developing and implementing appropriate solutions, as well as educational, policy and legislative approaches.

But, to begin with, he believes that “one of the biggest gaps related to sewage pollution is the lack of baseline data to inform the stakeholders on the severity of the issue.”

“We know there is sewage pollution in many receiving waterbodies, but we do not know the extent of this pollution as we have not conducted a robust and systematic quantification of the various contaminants and their effects,” Poinapen emphasised.","For centuries, coastal fishing has been central to the nutrition, food security and livelihoods of Pacific Islanders, as it will be in the twenty first century.

Livestock products generate about 15% of all greenhouse gases and take up two-thirds of agricultural land. There are 1.5 billion cows on the planet, generating 5.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. Research by the University of Michigan’s Center for Sustainable Systems shows that a plant-based burger generates 90% less greenhouse gases, 99% less impact on water scarcity, and 93% less impact on land than a quarter pound of American beef.

Citing such environmental credentials, some argue the future of the sustainable food industry is with plant-based foods.

Citing such environmental credentials, some argue the future of the sustainable food industry is with plant-based foods. According to a new report from Ecovia Intelligence, a research and consulting firm, the sustainability choice between meat and dairy products and plant-based foods is a false dichotomy.

The firm writes:

Animal-based products have many sustainability merits. Livestock brings many benefits to farms; for instance, ploughing fields and improving soil fertility. Livestock farming also sustains many rural communities, creating employment and maintaining agricultural economies. In this respect, meat and dairy products can have greater impacts than plant- based products. With plant-based foods continuing to grow at double digit levels, vegan products clearly have a future in the sustainable food industry. However, so do meat and dairy products, especially those made according to organic and sustainable farming methods.

More than Food

It’s not only plant-based foods that have garnered attention when it comes to environmental stewardship. For example, in March, Hasbro announced plans to begin using plant-based bio-polyethylene terephthalate for blister packs and plastic windows in its product packaging beginning next year.

The company says it will use bioPET plastic made with 30% plant-based material derived from agricultural by-products. This decision is part of Hasbro’s push to make its packaging less reliant on non-renewable resources.

Toy maker Lego also announced it will turn to plant-based plastic. The company says that the polyethylene for these botanical-themed elements will be sourced from sugarcane.

Polyethylene is a soft, flexible, and durable type of plastic that the Lego Group currently uses in 1 – 2 % of its elements. The new product range will be a soft, durable, and flexible polyethylene made from ethanol.

The sugarcane used is sourced in accordance with guidance from the Bioplastic Feedstock Alliance and is certified by the Bonsucro Chain of Custody standard for responsibly sourced sugarcane, the Lego Group says. All suppliers must comply with the company’s code of conduct, which has requirements for ethical, environmental, and health and safety standards based on top global guidelines.

Similarly, Toyota is using plant-based plastics developed by Denso in its car navigation systems, according to the automotive supplier.

Denso’s new plant-based plastics includes bio-polycarbonate (PC) made from starch and urethane resin extracted from castor oil. Denso’s starch-derived bio-PC, which the company says provides high hardness yet can be shaped into complex designs, is being used to make plastic bezels for Toyota’s navigation systems.

Denso says its goal in developing plant-derived plastics is to reduce its environmental impacts. The bio-materials also perform better, according to the company.","Citing such environmental credentials, some argue the future of the sustainable food industry is with plant-based foods.

The tiger-striped species, which is native to the Indo-Pacific region, is known for its voracious appetite: A single lionfish can reduce young reef populations by up to 90 percent in just five weeks.

In the Bahamas, Michelin-starred chef and all-around good guy José Andrés is helping to eradicate this beautiful destroyer by billing it as an island delicacy at Fish, his new restaurant at the Cove at Atlantis on Paradise Island. For Andrés, cooking up light and flaky lionfish—which he prepares simply fried, whole, with fresh herb oil and a side of tartar sauce—is a win-win.

“First of all, they are delicious,” Andrés says of the fish, which in the Bahamas have been estimated to consume roughly 1,000 pounds of prey per acre every year. “By serving this dish, we are helping the ecosystem of the Bahamas’ waters and supporting local fishermen.” A portion of sales from the dish is also donated to the Atlantis Blue Project Foundation, an organization dedicated to Bahamian marine conservation.

Not long ago, simply creating delicious food was enough for the culinary world. But today, Andrés and other chefs and restaurateurs are using their powers for a greater good. Jamie Oliver’s London restaurant Fifteen, which is owned by his charitable foundation, trains disadvantaged youth, the unemployed, and the homeless in the culinary arts. Alice Waters’s Edible Schoolyard Project educates children in public schools about food and nutrition. Tom Colicchio advocates for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to shine a light on the politics of hunger. The list goes on.

But perhaps nobody embraces the global good that can come from food quite like Andrés. In February, the owner of ThinkFoodGroup, which includes more than a dozen restaurants, was named the James Beard Foundation’s 2018 Humanitarian of the Year for his dedication to hunger issues around the world. In the wake of recent disasters, his nonprofit World Central Kitchen (WCK) activated chefs in Texas, California, Hawaii, Guatemala, and beyond. After Hurricane Maria, Andrés and WCK served more than 3.5 million meals in Puerto Rico alone.

“There is something deep in our DNA that centers around food, and chefs have both the power and the responsibility to be a part of that conversation,” says Andrés. “We have an amazing perspective on how we can support our communities, our cities, our countries. And to me, one of the most important ways to bring a community together is over a satisfying, comforting meal.”","This striking creature may be stunning to observe, but the red lionfish is the Caribbean’s most formidable hunter—a venomous and invasive exterminator of fragile coral-reef marine life.

271,https://www.greenbiz.com/article/can-big-data-hold-key-unlocking-sustainable-smallholder-farms,"Wed, 03 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",GreenBiz,Can big data hold the key to unlocking sustainable smallholder farms?,"Farming can be a gamble. Many variables can determine success and some, such as climate, are outside a farmer’s control. But an innovative approach to agricultural research may help tip the odds in the favor of smallholder farmers. Strategic foresight modeling is a research method that examines how farming systems interact with climate change and other factors.

The resulting data can help predict outcomes on farms — and help make agriculture less a game of chance for farmers.

Steven Prager is at the forefront of this research as a senior scientist for Integrated Modeling at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT). A research center within the CGIAR network, CIAT works to address hunger, poverty and nutrition through increased eco-efficiency in farming systems. Prager is a member of the Decision and Policy Analysis (DAPA) Research Area at CIAT as well as the co-leader of the Global Futures and Strategic Foresight initiative for CGIAR. His research is interdisciplinary and examines the interface of climate change and agriculture with economic development. ""I am a geographer by training,"" said Prager, ""and the DAPA modeling team is a group of talented folks that includes economists, statisticians, climate modelers, crop modelers, crop physiologists and agronomists.""

The modeling team develops strategic foresight scenarios by using a series of integrated models that consider the impact of climate, water resources, and technology on agriculture. The models apply these factors to future scenarios and make detailed predictions about their outcomes. ""Generally speaking, it is about trying to understand present conditions, future conditions and what would happen if certain assumptions were to hold true,"" according to Prager. These assumptions can include rates of adoption of technology, positive results from the application of technology, and climate shock, the tangible consequences of climate change.

""The whole idea behind foresight is to understand what we refer to as plausible scenarios,"" said Prager. ""We use mathematical results as a way to evaluate these different plausible scenarios and improve decision-making regarding investments in the agricultural development process."" Ultimately, these results can help reduce risk for farmers and improve their likelihood of success. These results can also help inform other research sectors with social implications, such as policy and investment.

Foresight modeling produces high volumes of new data that could be relevant to research outside of the agriculture sector and CGIAR. The CGIAR Platform for Big Data in Agriculture, an initiative that aims to capture and analyze large data sets to identify trends that can inform farmers and decisionmakers, could improve the impact of DAPA’s work by providing a clear channel for sharing information. ""Basically, the platform could improve the impact associated with the results of research,"" said Prager.

At present, there is no central platform for data discovery and methods discovery, but the platform may be a solution. ""I think the platform does have the potential to increase coordination across the CGIAR network, especially as it relates to shared methods and shared data,"" said Prager. ""Often times we have great ideas and someone’s already done something similar. We could accelerate the research process and more importantly, accelerate impact if we are clever about how we share data.""

There are important considerations and obstacles to enabling the tools of Big Data for agricultural development. One is privacy and the protection of sensitive data. Prager chairs the Institutional Review Board, which ensures compliance with the ethics of human subjects research at CIAT. Beyond foresight, Prager sees the Big Data Platform as an integral tool for ""managing and sharing potentially sensitive data in the most appropriate way, and in a way that is most consistent with our commitment to our various stakeholders.” When conducting research that involves human subjects, researchers must consider the implications of technology, confidentiality, consent and more. The platform is committed to responsible data sharing, and CGIAR is nearing completion of a set of guidelines based on the privacy and ethics standards of the individual partner centers.

Coordination across these centers, on privacy standards and otherwise, presents a separate set of obstacles. CGIAR is a network of 15 research centers, and each center is a unique organization with complex and differing approaches to agricultural research. ""Coordinating all these perspectives and encouraging others to adopt the philosophy and participate in the movement while doing something with visible impact is a challenge,"" said Prager. Building a cooperative network of this size takes time and patience but the mission at stake — to democratize agricultural data and solve major food system problems — can be unifying.

One goal of the Platform for Big Data in Agriculture is to convene partners, including the private sector that produces new innovations to solve development problems. ""Engagement in that sector is going to be a big milestone and a big win for CGIAR if the Platform for Big Data in Agriculture is successful,"" said Prager. IBM and Amazon are two external partners working with the platform and collaboration with the tech giants may help research data hit the ground as functional projects and products for consumers.

Encouraging participation and focusing on visible impact are key to the platform’s success. ""We need to understand where the intersections are and the real places where an organization like CGIAR can make the difference,"" said Prager. ""The next set of problems is making food systems more sustainable, making sure more people have access to healthy food, and including marginalized communities in the food system.""","The resulting data can help predict outcomes on farms — and help make agriculture less a game of chance for farmers.

272,https://www.environmentalleader.com/2018/10/coffee-sourcing-smucker/,"Fri, 26 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Environmental Leader,Using the Entire Toolbox for Sustainable Coffee Sourcing: Q&A with Smucker,"The J.M. Smucker Company started out with jams and jellies, but the American food and beverage manufacturer’s extensive brand portfolio has since expanded to product categories such as snacks, fruit juices, pet foods, and coffee.

Smucker brands including Folgers, Dunkin’ Donuts, Café Bustelo, and Café Pilon make the company one of the largest annual purchasers of coffee in the United States. Sourcing green coffee, which is the traded commodity coming from growing regions that hasn’t yet gone through the manufacturing process, means navigating a complex global supply chain.

This year, as part of Smucker’s new corporate responsibility report, the company outlines how they are working with suppliers on responsible sourcing. “Suppliers must operate transparently, responsibly, and sustainably in order to minimize social and environmental risks across our supply chain,” the report states.

To find out more about the company’s coffee sourcing strategy, we caught up with Julia Sabin, vice president of government relations and corporate sustainability, and Rebecca Ott, director of sustainability. As part of her responsibilities, Sabin oversees sustainability and has been with Smucker for 34 years. Ott, who has more than 17 years of experience in the coffee industry, joined the company a decade ago through the Folgers acquisition and works on strategic interventions at the origin.

How important is coffee sourcing for Smucker?

Julia Sabin: Coffee is a big part of our business. We are a market leader in the US coffee category, and one of the largest annual purchasers and roasters of coffee in the nation.

Rebecca Ott: We’re sourcing from nearly two dozen origins at any given time. Coffee grows at the equator between the tropics, so the countries we’re sourcing from are in those regions.

What are the company’s goals for coffee sourcing?

Ott: Since 2016, we achieved the goal of sourcing 10% of our retail coffee from certified green coffee sources, which does include Rainforest Alliance and UTZ. We have the goal to maintain that volume of certified coffee.

But I’d like to point out that certification is one of the tools in our toolbox. Certification is not always feasible for smallholders and, because of that, they’re the most vulnerable producers. We looked at our sustainability strategy, focusing on balancing certified coffee purchases with more direct strategic interventions. We make an effort to utilize the full toolbox to support sustainability.

What is the company’s approach to making coffee sourcing more sustainable?

Sabin: Our strategy built on three legs. The first focus is responsible sourcing. The second is smallholder support. We feel passionately about helping vulnerable small producers to be more successful with their farming practices, resulting in stronger yields. The third is integrated environmental efforts.

We have affected over 16,500 smallholder farmers, and provided over $3.6 million in loans. We also have goals around training, financing, climate change adaptations, addressing coffee rust, and capacity building.

Ott: It’s looking at how we take the complexity within the coffee supply chain and balance the activities — figuring out the ways we can improve productivity and have those positive effects within the communities in which we are working.

Have there been significant challenges as you’ve pursued this strategy?

Ott: Location is one of the challenges. In Indonesia there are a lot of remote villages, and it takes motorbike rides for hours through mountainous dirt roads to get to some of these producers. In places where you have very low yields, producers have never received or have very limited farming assistance. So when you bring opportunity to learn and improve agricultural practices, it improves the environmental, economic, and social conditions for them.

Also, a lot of the work we do with smallholders is through training modules. You have to gain the trust of producers, and explain the benefits of attending trainings and participating. In other models, there’s some incentive —providing them with fertilizer or inputs. We empower producers through access to knowledge.

How do you address these challenges?

Ott: Partners become very important because they are very familiar with the culture.

Sabin: Our public partners like USAID are working on projects to bring the best of development knowledge, which complements our commercial and supply chain expertise. On-the-ground partners include TechnoServe and the Neumann Foundation. They bring the depth of knowledge in the coffee sector and that training experience. We have worked with these organizations for a number of years.

Where does productivity and yield fit into sustainable coffee sourcing?

Ott: Productivity is critical to the long-term sustainability of these coffee farmers. Supporting them and achieving greater returns from coffee is that win-win. It starts with improved farming practices, and many are fairly straightforward — looking at their farms, understanding the age and quality of trees, which types of trees they are actually growing, the farm layout, the distance between trees. Then you can move to more advanced techniques like pruning, plant nutrition, and soil quality.

Measuring productivity is important in these projects, as is access to financing. We measured how much credit we’ve been able to facilitate. We also measure the adoption of practices. We look at the organizational development, and how many coffee farming groups we’ve built better governance structures and systems.

Sabin: When you think about a small producer, increasing nearly 40% of their yield economically changes their lives, their families, and their children. It has other downstream effects because once they are trained, there’s less likelihood that they’ll leave and build somewhere else. They can live on that farm for generations.

Are you optimistic about the future of sustainable coffee sourcing?

Ott: Coffee sustainability has gotten a lot of attention, and rightfully so. There is also interest in maintaining coffee livelihoods. The industry as a whole is looking at a lot of different models. I am optimistic that, as an industry, we can continue to find ways to empower producers and increase resiliency because there will always be fluctuations — climate, weather, markets. Building that resiliency is critical for these smallholder producers.

What’s next?

Ott: We continue to identify new opportunities to support coffee farmers. Our direct intervention work in Indonesia supporting smallholder growers continues through 2019, and we launched a five-year commitment in Honduras in 2017. We remain platinum sponsors of World Coffee Research, a critical organization globally. Their mission is to maintain supplies of quality coffee in a sustainable manner.

Sabin: We have worked hard to develop extensive internal processes and controls to ensure we’re able to purchase green coffee in a responsible manner. Our Master Agreement and Operating Guidelines, which all suppliers are required to sign, are designed to address human rights laws, environmental practices, and safety procedures.

Additionally, what’s amazing to me is the longevity and expertise of our coffee training team. They have years of experience in the industry and have been able to develop longstanding supplier relationships. Everything comes down to relationships and trust.","How important is coffee sourcing for Smucker?

Organized by the UNESCO Beijing Cluster Office and hosted by the Institute for Heritage Management, with the support of the German National Commission for UNESCO, the Chinese National Commission for UNESCO, the UNESCO World Heritage Centre, the German Ministry of Culture, and the German National Committee for Monument Protection, this meeting aimed to facilitate effective exchanges between policy makers, experts and practitioners from China, Germany and beyond, and to help them engage in sharing good practices in the field of heritage protection for sustainable development.

“Culture plays a crucial role in sustainable development. Yet integrating various aspects of culture is not an easy task. It calls for strong multi-stakeholder partnership across fields of expertise and across national boundaries,” emphasized Dr Feng Jing, Chief of the Asia-Pacific Unit of the UNESCO World Heritage Centre.

The concepts of World Heritage, Intangible Cultural Heritage and Diversity of Cultural Expressions, which were created by UNESCO, have made an enormous contribution in raising public awareness and promoting concrete actions in the field of culture. Their success is reflected in the 1,092 properties currently on the World Heritage List, the 470 elements listed on Lists of Intangible Cultural Heritage and the Register of Good Safeguarding Practices, and a thriving cultural sector, which accounts for 6.1% of the global economy, generates annual revenues of 2,250 billion USD and represents nearly 30 million jobs worldwide.

Since 2017, the UNESCO Beijing Cluster Office has been exploring the synergies between World Heritage conservation, ICH transmission, and the fostering of cultural creativity for the sustainable development of World Heritage sites, via multi-stakeholder partnerships. One of the successful examples of such partnerships is the UNESCO-China Youth Development Foundation Mercedes-Benz Star Fund project “Conservation and Management of World Heritage sites in China”. Highlighting the long-term and fruitful partnership between UNESCO and Mercedes-Benz, the Berlin meeting was organised as an outcome of this project and is expected to inspire more cooperation in the field of culture between Chinese and German government counterparts, universities and academics, as well as between individual World Heritage sites.

“China has always actively participated in UNESCO’s major programmes and projects. This workshop provided a great platform for us to connect with the German National Commission for UNESCO and other partners. We will continue to strengthen the cooperation with UNESCO and the National Commission for UNESCO of other UNESCO Member States,” stressed Mr QIAO Zhengshun, Responsible Officer for the Science and Culture Division of the Chinese National Commission for UNESCO.

Dr Lutz Möller, Deputy Secretary-General of the German National Commission for UNESCO, also highlighted that “Germany and China have all-round cooperation. In the future, we can strengthen our cooperation on cultural exchanges in UNESCO’s fields of action.”

A Chinese delegation consisting of representatives from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, the State Administration of Cultural Heritage (SACH), the Chinese National Commission for UNESCO, the Chinese Academy of Cultural Heritage participated in this exchange, along with heritage experts, site managers of World Heritage properties, and Intangible Cultural Heritage bearers. During the five-day event, exchanges were organised with the Berlin Monument Protection Office on World Heritage management practices, and participants engaged in discussions with representatives from the Federal Commission for Cultural and Media Affairs, as well as with the UNESCO Chair and students in the World Heritage Studies Programme at the Brandenburg University of Technology. The group also visited various UNESCO-designated sites, such as the Museum Island and the Palaces and Parks of Potsdam (both World Heritage properties), the Spreewald Man and Biosphere Reserve, and the Berlin “City of Design” UNESCO Creative Cities Network. This event provided an excellent platform for discussions between Chinese and German counterparts on heritage conservation, creativity and sustainable development. As part of the programme, a one-day workshop on “Heritage Conservation for Sustainable Development” was held and Mr Chen Ping, Counsellor for Culture of the Chinese Embassy in Germany, delivered the opening speech.

It is hoped that this UNESCO-led cultural exchange between China and Germany can inspire new reflections and partnerships on culture as an enabler of sustainable development. Together with other pilot activities within the framework of the project “Conservation and Management of World Heritage Sites in China”, the aim is to create a pool of well-documented good practice cases for the benefit of a wider international audience interested in the transmission of heritage to future generations.

This activity has been implemented in the framework of UNESCO/Mercedes-Benz Funds-In-Trust project on the Conservation and Management of World Heritage sites in China. Started in 2007, the strategic partnership with Mercedes-Benz has supported major activities at eight natural and mixed World Heritage sites in China, namely Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries, Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas, Lushan National Park, Mount Wuyi, South China Karst, Mount Qingcheng and the Dujiangyan Irrigation System, China Danxia. The key cooperation areas included capacity building; management effectiveness; World Heritage and sustainable livelihood and awareness-raising and public outreach. Phase III of the Mercedes Funds-In-Trust project will continue up to 2020.","Since 2017, the UNESCO Beijing Cluster Office has been exploring the synergies between World Heritage conservation, ICH transmission, and the fostering of cultural creativity for the sustainable development of World Heritage sites, via multi-stakeholder partnerships.

According to Wesgro, the Western Cape’s tourism, trade and investment promotion agency, the number of reservations at hotels in Cape Town for the period between April and September 2018 were 50% lower than last year, as its water woes trended on the web, creating a frightening scenario of there being no water to flush toilets, wash hands and clean public spaces. “Virtual travel studios” are springing up across the world with simulated experiences that allow armchair travellers to see the world virtually, without navigating crowds, suffering stinking toilets, ingesting bacteria-infested food and breathing polluted air.

While these might not be immediate threats to the booming tourism industry, they point towards the link between a country’s sanitation standards and its tourist inflows. Most global lists now cite sanitation as the top criterion to assess a country’s tourist-friendliness. While countries in the overpopulated developing world have more to worry about, even the West sees deteriorating levels of sanitation as a cause for concern. With India chasing an ambitious target of 20 million Foreign Tourist Arrivals (FTA) by 2020, the need to build a Swachh Bharat is more than ever.

The country’s attempts to address the sanitation challenge go back to pre-Independence when Mahatma Gandhi called upon fellow Indians to view sanitation through the lens of national pride. The Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) launched in 2014, translated that clarion call into a nationwide campaign for cleanliness. The efforts of the last four years under the prime minister’s personal supervision are now showing dramatic results with success stories emerging from the remotest parts of the country. International development agencies have acknowledged India’s SBM as the biggest sanitation movement in the world. From being a government-driven programme, it is fast turning into a people’s movement with the private sector, community, social activists, entertainment industry and celebrities joining to make sanitation a priority.

A massive push is being given to address the sanitation woes of our country. From over 60% of rural population not having access to a toilet at home in 2014 to SBM Grameen achieving a rural sanitation coverage of 95% with 507,369 villages achieving an open defecation free status in 2018, we have come a long way. According to national data, urban toilet coverage is now 87% and nearly three-fourths of the wards in the country have door-to-door collection of municipal waste. Not resting on its laurels, the government is working with agencies to conduct a close audit of the outcomes of these initiatives. Simultaneously, efforts are intensifying to eliminate manual scavenging and manual cleaning of septic tanks, and looking into safety protocols, safety gear and rehabilitation.

The issue of waste collection-disposal-recycling is being taken up on a war footing. Inter-departmental coordination is being seen in areas of infrastructure development that can support these announcements. But greater efforts have to be made at city and Panchayat level to deal with garbage. Our cities are not exactly the epitome of cleanliness. If Indore could do it, why can’t others? Local bodies need to take greater responsibility.

Globally, tourism-related economic losses from inadequate sanitation are estimated to be US$ 266 million. Even as India records remarkable successes in the field of sanitation, we have to move towards “sustainable sanitation” in tourism by creating zero emission tourist lodges and facilities, using native flora and fauna for toiletries, recycling waste to create toilet paper and attaching sprinklers to public taps to save water.

Each country must do its bit to step up awareness around sustainable sanitation and reward good Samaritans who lead the charge. Research shows a rising number of travellers today wanting to give back to the countries and communities they visit and reduce their impact on the environment. Campaigns like ‘Travel. Enjoy. Respect.’ are amplifying the potential of tourism while minimising damage to the environment, traditions, culture, heritage and local communities. While these may still be small steps, they are nonetheless heralding a culture of cleanliness. The Indian tourism sector, too, needs to focus on sustainable sanitation on both the demand and supply side. This will encourage more travellers to go clean and green as they play their part in being part of the Incredible India experience.

But according to scientists in South Africa, it turns out that the ubiquitous fluid contains a key ingredient that might help us in a variety of ways — including, oddly, a way to rebuild our cities once rising tides engulf coastal communities.

On Wednesday, a team at the University of Cape Town revealed that human urine can be manipulated into solid, brick-like forms they call “bio-bricks.” Unlike regular kiln-fired bricks, bio-bricks don’t require high heat, and producing them doesn’t spew out thousands of kilograms of greenhouse gases of carbon dioxide.

Water quality engineering lecturer Dyllon Randall, Ph.D., discovered urine’s potential after he began placing makeshift urinals around the university in an attempt to make fertilizer. The urinals contain builder’s lime, which reacts with the phosphorus in urine to produce fertilizer.

But even after the fertilizer was extracted, Randall soon realized that there was still some fluid left over. This, to use his words, was his “liquid gold.”

The bricks can be molded into any shape University of Cape Town

In the leftovers was an important compound called urea, which is found naturally in human urine. Randall discovered that the urea solution could be used to make a brick by mixing it with loose sand colonized by species of bacteria that produce the enzyme urease.

The urease secreted by the bacteria breaks down the urea, and as a bonus, it produces the compound calcium carbonate. This hard white compound, which makes up the bulk of eggshells and the shells of shellfish, solidifies the sand particles together in the bricks.

The more time the bacteria are given to work their magic, the stronger the bricks grow, the team says, suggesting that several different types of building materials could be created with this method.

“No-one’s looked at it in terms of that entire cycle and the potential to recover multiple valuable products. The next question is how to do that in an optimised way so that profit can be created from urine,” Randall said.

This process, known as microbial carbonate precipitation, isn’t exactly new. Previous research has shown that there are plenty of microorganisms capable of carrying out the process. What appears to be new here is that the team has finally found a use for a liquid that exists in boundless supply. This is fortunate, as the BBC estimates that it would take roughly 100 trips to the bathroom to produce one of these bricks.

The urine bricks require no burning procedures, but the team will have to massively speed up their process before they can be a real alternative. Right now it takes between two and six days to grow depending on desired strength, and the team has yet to try actually building with them.

But for now, Randall is bowled over by the reception of his product.

“I’m grateful for the open-mindedness of people and the acceptance of such novel technologies,” Randall said in a video interview. “Who would have thought of recovering fertilizer from urine or making bio bricks using that same urine? That kind of interest gives me a lot of hope for the future in terms of attaining a sustainable future and environment.”

Inclusiveness,



coopetition and innovation



Sustainable tourism is the concept of visiting a place as a tourist and trying to make a positive impact on the environment, society and economy. Tourism can involve primary transportation to the general location, local transportation, accommodations, entertainment, recreation, nourishment and shopping. It can be related to travel for leisure, business and visiting friends and relatives. Given its natural advantages, the tourism sector is viewed as one of the most important engines of growth and development in the economies in many countries.



The advantages of tourism include employment opportunity, growth of service sector, foreign exchange earnings, opportunity for recreation, economic growth, cultural exchange, better international relations, enjoyment, better health and wellness. It also has negative impacts such as damage to the landscape: litter, erosion, fires, disturbance to livestock, vandalism. Traffic congestion and pollution. Tourism industry has generated $ 7.6 trillion (10.2% of global GDP) and 292 million jobs in 2016, equivalent to ibe in 10 jobs in the global economy.



There is now broad consensus that tourism development should be sustainable; however, the question of how to achieve this remains a subject of debate. The concept of sustainable tourism is tightly linked to a concept of sustainable mobility.



During the 70th Session of the UN General Assembly, 154 heads of state or government adopted the bold and ambitious ‘2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,’ along with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that aim to, inter alia, end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all.



Based on this universal, integrated and transformative vision, UNWTO is placing its efforts and tireless work in contributing with its technical assistance and capacity-building to the achievement of these global goals. UNWTO is working with governments, public and private partners, development banks, international and regional finance institutions, the UN agencies and international organisations to help achieve the SDGs, placing an emphasis on Goals 8, 12 and 14, in which tourism is featured.



UNWTO developed the ‘Tourism for SDGs platform’ with the support of the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs of Switzerland – is aimed at policy makers, international organisations, academia, donors, companies and all tourism stakeholders and encourages them to engage in SDG implementation strategies. The platform’s three main features, Learn, Share and Act, are also calls for action, conversation and collaboration towards a sustainable tourism sector.





Goal 8



Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. Tourism is one of the driving forces of global economic growth and currently accounts for 1 in 10 jobs worldwide. By giving access to decent work opportunities in the tourism sector, society – particularly youth and women – can benefit from enhanced skills and professional development. The sector’s contribution to job creation is recognised in Target No.8.9 by 2030, devise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products.





Goal 12



Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. Tourism sector that adopts sustainable consumption and production practices can play a significant role in accelerating the global shift towards sustainability. To do so, as set in Target 12.b of Goal 12, it is imperative to develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism which creates jobs, promotes local culture and products.



The Sustainable Tourism Programme (STP) of the 10-Year Framework of Programme on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (10YFP) aims at developing such practices, including resource efficient initiatives that result in enhanced economic, social and environmental outcomes.





Goal 14



Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Coastal and maritime tourism, tourism’s biggest segments, particularly for Small Island Developing States’ (SIDS), rely on healthy marine ecosystems. Tourism development must be a part of integrated Coastal Zone Management in order to help conserve and preserve fragile ecosystems and serve as a vehicle to promote the blue economy, in line with target 14.7. By 2030 increase the economic benefits of the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism.





Sustainable tourism

Sustainable tourism is viewed by many as an oxymoron or metaphor since it seriously can’t change anything. There basically isn’t a way we can make tourism sustainable but if all stakeholders put their heads together and work hard it could possibly work in a viable world. It is a reality that many things done in the name of sustainability are actually masking the desire to allow extra profits. There is often alienation of local populations from the tourists.

Environmental sustainability focuses on the overall viability and health of ecological systems. Natural resource degradation, pollution and loss of biodiversity are detrimental because they increase vulnerability, undermine system health and reduce resilience. This aspect of sustainability has been the most often discussed subject.



Many coastal areas are experiencing particular pressure from growth in lifestyles and growing numbers of tourists. Coastal environments are limited in extent consisting of only a narrow strip along the edge of the ocean. Coastal areas are often the first environments to experience the detrimental impacts of tourism. The inevitable change is on the horizon as holiday destinations put more effort into sustainable tourism. Planning and management controls can reduce the impact on coastal environments and ensure that investment into tourism products supports sustainable coastal tourism.



Mount Everest attracts many tourist climbers wanting to summit the peak of the highest mountain in the world each year. Everest is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Over the years, carelessness and excessive consumption of resources by mountaineers, as well as overgrazing by livestock, have damaged the habitats of snow leopards, lesser pandas, Tibetan bears and scores of bird species. To counteract past abuses, various reforestation programs have been carried out by local communities and the Nepalese Government.



Third World countries are especially interested in international tourism and many believe it brings countries a large amount of economic benefits including employment opportunities, small business development and increased in payments of foreign exchange. Many assume that more money is gained through developing luxury goods and services in spite of the fact that this increases a countries dependency on imported products, foreign investments and expatriate skills. This classic ‘trickle down’ financial strategy rarely makes its way down to brings its benefits down to small businesses.



It has been said that the economic benefits of large-scale tourism are not doubted but that the backpacker or budget traveller sector is often neglected as a potential growth sector by Third World governments. This sector brings significant non-economic benefits which could help to empower and educate the communities involved in this sector. Aiming ‘low’ builds upon the skills of the local population, promotes self-reliance and develops the confidence of community members in dealing with outsiders, all signs of empowerment and all of which aid in the overall development of a nation.



There has been the promotion of sustainable tourism practices surrounding the management of tourist locations by locals or the community. This form of tourism is based on the premise that the people living next to a resource are the ones best suited to protecting it. This means that the tourism activities and businesses are developed and operated by local community members and certainly with their consent and support. Sustainable tourism typically involves the conservation of resources that are capitalised upon for tourism purposes. Locals run the businesses and are responsible for promoting the conservation messages to protect their environment.



Community-Based Sustainable Tourism



Community-Based Sustainable Tourism (CBST) associates the success of the sustainability of the ecotourism location to the management practices of the communities who are directly or indirectly dependent on the location for their livelihoods. A salient feature of CBST is that local knowledge is usually utilised alongside wide general frameworks of ecotourism business models. This allows the participation of locals at the management level and typically allows a more intimate understanding of the environment.



Environmentally sustainable development crucially depends on the presence of local support for a project. It has also been noted that in order for success projects must provide direct benefits for the local community.



It has also been said that partnerships between governments and tourism agencies with smaller communities is not particularly effective because of the disparity in aims between the two groups, i.e. true sustainability versus mass tourism for maximum profit.



Sri Lanka, the pearl of the Indian Ocean as it is widely known has attracted foreigners from early historical times. For centuries, Sri Lanka has been an important stop-over point for sailors, explorers and traders travelling between East Asia and Europe. In 1937, during the colonial era, British administrators set up the country’s first Government Tourist Bureau, primarily in an effort to facilitate the large volume of passengers sailing between west and east through the ports of Colombo. Sri Lanka has a rapidly growing tourism industry which contributes significantly to the economic growth of the country.



The Ceylon Tourist Board and the Ceylon Hotels Corporation were set in 1966. This helped in developing the Sri Lankan hospitality industry as well as a boost to the tourism industry. Tourism developed rapidly in Sri Lanka after 1966 with beach resorts and ancient cities like Kandy and Anuradhapura being the main attractions. The long ethnic conflict affected tourism industry in Sri Lanka adversely and tourists’ arrivals declined enormously but since the end of the conflict in 2009, tourist arrivals as well as revenue have increased sharply. Sri Lanka is currently in the midst of a tourism growth spurt, which has the potential to turn the small South Asian island nation into one of the world’s most popular tourist destinations in the years to come.





Heritage tourism



Heritage tourism has become a key area of focus. Sri Lanka has some 3,000 years of history on display in ancient palaces, Buddhist temples and townships carved into rock faces throughout the country’s interior. Most of them could be categorised according to their affiliations with Buddhism, the succession of ancient civilisations that inhabited the island, and its colonial legacy. Religious and pilgrimage tourism is also a key growth segment.



The country’s tourism industry has also worked to attract visitors interested in Ayurvedic medicine, ecotourism, adventure sports, arts and crafts, volunteering, spices, and food and shopping, for instance. The Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE) segment has also become a key area of focus in the industry in recent years.



Although Sri Lanka is a small island, we have a rich cultural heritage both tangible and intangible. We also have eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites, plus a bevy of natural, cultural and religious attractions. That consists of two natural sites; Sinharaja Forest Reserve and Central Highlands and six ancient cultural sites namely Ancient City of Polonnaruwa, Ancient City of Anuradhapura, Golden Temple of Dambulla, Ancient City of Sigiriya, Sacred City of Kandy and Old Town of Galle and its Fortification. Taken together with a huge number of planned and ongoing hotel construction projects, these assets have contributed to the country’s rising reputation as an attractive and good value destination for foreign tourists and investors alike.



The Central Cultural Fund established in 1980 for the purpose of preservation, conservation and restoration of those heritages plays a vital role towards the development of the tourism industry.



In 2005 the Government passed the Tourism Act which replacing 1966 law that had set the development agenda for the sector for the previous four decades. Under the new legislation, which came into effect in 2007, the SLTDA was established as the country’s primary tourism development entity, under the umbrella of the Ministry of Tourism. A handful of additional entities were also launched around the same period, including the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotions Bureau (SLTPB), the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management and the Sri Lanka Convention Bureau, all of which fall under the regulator.



The State has carried out a number of development initiatives in recent years. The SLTDA’s 2011-16 Tourism Development Strategy, which is currently drawing to a conclusion, laid out a series of ambitious goals for the sector, including increasing tourist arrivals from 650,000 in 2010 to 2.5m by 2018.





Challenges



Sri Lanka’s tourism industry currently faces a number of challenges. The nation’s road, rail and air links have been improved considerably over the past decade, and particularly since the end of the war in 2009. Nonetheless, it remains difficult to travel around the island due to traffic congestion and in inland areas in particular, because of poor transport infrastructure. The Government currently has a variety of development plans in place to address this issue.



Despite these and other issues, the tourism industry’s recent performance, plus the substantial amount of investment that is currently being spent in Sri Lanka, bode well for the future. Assuming this rate of year-on-year visitor growth continues to hold over the course the year, the country will be able to reach the Government-set goal for the sector of attracting 2.5 million tourists in total at the end of this year. Up to end of September 2018, tourist arrival is recorded as 1.73 million and it is an optimistic indication of reaching the expected goal.

KIGALI, Oct 12 2018 (IPS) - In a move to achieve its green growth aspirations by 2050, Rwanda has placed a major focus on promoting project proposals that shift away from “business as usual” and have a significant impact on curbing climate change while attracting private investment.

The latest report published by the Rwanda Environmental Management Authority (REMA) in 2015 states that the country needs to adapt – and keep adapting – so that Rwandans can become climate resilient and be assured that they can thrive under changing climate conditions.

Rwanda is one of a few nations in the world to develop its own climate-related domestic budget to finance mitigation and adaptation projects and leverage international climate finance. Since it was established in 2012, the National Fund for Climate and Environment, commonly known as “FONERWA”, has played a major role in this country’s climate resilient development by financing various green economy projects.

It is also the focal point for channeling international climate finance into projects in Rwanda, while offering technical assistance to project proponents to ensure the success of investments.

“Thanks to this expertise, much of the core funding has been allocated to projects on a grant basis, returns are being measured in impact,” Daniel Ogbonnaya, the acting country representative and lead, Rwanda programme coordinator of Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), in Kigali, tells IPS.

GGGI is an international organisation that has partnered with the Rwandan government to help the country access the Green Climate Fund (GCF). The GCF, established by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), assists developing countries in adaptation and mitigation to counter climate change.

For example, one of FONERWA’s major impacts during the implementation phase has seen over 130,000 green jobs created, nearly 25,000 families connected to clean energy, and approximately 20,000 hectares of land secured against erosion, according to official estimates.

Now the East African country which has faced challenges related to the pressures on natural resources from a growing population is relying on FONERWA to implement its national Green Growth and Climate Resilience Strategy, adopted in 2011, to achieve some of its national climate targets.

FONERWA, which is the sole vehicle through which environment and climate change finance is channeled, programmed, disbursed and monitored in the country, is also being used by the government as an instrument to facilitate direct access to international environment and climate finance.

Government departments and districts can access FONERWA funding. But the fund is also open to charitable and private entities, including businesses, civil society and research institutions. However, to be eligible for funding, proposals are required to meet standard criteria set out for achieving the country’s green growth.

GGGI is providing technical assistance to strengthen the capacity of FONERWA in designing world class climate resilience projects and to enhance the fund’s ability to mobilise more resources.

The institute has been focusing on providing demand-driven technical advisory services; the development of inclusive green growth plans that are gender sensitive; and the creation of an enabling environment to engage and foster public and private sector investment in green growth.

While a significant amount of money has been allocated by FONERWA toward efforts to help mitigate climate change, one of the key criteria for approval of funding proposals was taken into account in selecting public and private adaptation and mitigation projects and programmes to finance.

The director general of REMA and also the national focal person of the GCF, Coletha Ruhamya, explained that growth in Rwanda is only possible if the private sector is on board and plays a leading role.

“This is because business practice in the country has always been associated with environmental pollution and degradation,” she told IPS.

In April, FONERWA proposed a new approach dedicated to encouraging the private sector to take advantage of the existing opportunities in addressing environmental challenges, including climate change.

Since its inception in 2012, FONERWA has successfully funded 35 competitively-awarded, high-impact projects to the tune of 54 million dollars and has also received in 2018 another 33 million dollars of earmarked funding from the GCF as the accredited entity’s implementing partner for a new climate-resilience project in Rwanda.

However, some stakeholders in the private sector stress the need for serious sensitisation programmes meant for local investors to understand the opportunities that are in the industrial sector through leveraging on the green fund.

The chief executive officer of the Rwanda Private Sector Federation (PSF), Stephen Ruzibiza, told IPS that local private investors have a lot to access withinvthe green fund.

Currently the PSF is engaging with FONERWA and a limited number of local financial intermediaries to offer long-term loans to private businesses focusing on environmental sustainability with a low interest rate which is fixed at 11.5 percent.

The current average lending interest rate for commercial banks in Rwanda is 17.58 percent, according to the National Bank of Rwanda.

According to Jean Ntazinda, a consultant with the FONERWA Readiness Support Project, the private sector in Rwanda has so far been left behind when compared to government entities in accessing the GCF financing mechanism.

“Although at the national level some private sector projects relating to adaptation got financed, there is a long way to bring the private sector on board due to the lack of another entity accredited by GCF,” Ntazinda told IPS in an exclusive interview.

In 2015, Rwanda’s ministry of environment became accredited with the GCF and received a promise of 10 to 50 million dollars in climate finance. It was the country’s first national institution to receive GCF accreditation.

In March 2018, the government of Rwanda received an additional 32.8 million dollars from GCF to strengthen climate resilience in Gicumbi District, Northern Province.

The ‘Strengthening Climate Resilience of Rural Communities in Northern Rwanda’ project, that will run for six years, is expected to invest in climate-resilient settlements for families currently living in areas prone to landslides and floods, and support community-based adaptation planning and livelihoods diversification.

Currently FONERWA is in the process of developing several innovative funding mechanisms to finance pro-poor climate projects in Rwanda.

For instance, Result-Based Finance (RBF) is one of the approaches currently being used to fund renewable energy mini-grid projects in poor rural areas of Rwanda at a time when Rwandan officials are aiming to achieve 51 percent of electricity access by the end of 2019, from the current 45 percent.

RBF are payments that are disbursed at the end of the construction of the mini-grids, provided that pre-agreed conditions and milestones are met.

“This incentivises developers to look for private equity and debt to fund the construction costs. And it gives further certainty to the lenders that parts of the debt will be repaid,” Ogbonnaya told IPS.

However, Ogbonnaya is convinced that local commercial banks in Rwanda are willing to promote access to private finance for green initiatives, but don’t yet understand the process.

“This is because using government or local budget is key to showing country ownership and to showing that a specific project is part of a broader national strategy, but for adaptation funds, co-benefits such as social, environment, gender impacts and pro-poor impacts are so crucial,” he said.","Rwanda Leverages Green Climate Fund’s Opportunities to Fast-Track Sustainable DevelopmentKIGALI, Oct 12 2018 (IPS) - In a move to achieve its green growth aspirations by 2050, Rwanda has placed a major focus on promoting project proposals that shift away from “business as usual” and have a significant impact on curbing climate change while attracting private investment.

It is actually the state's policy to make sure that we enjoy our right to ""a balanced and healthful ecology in accord with the rhythm and harmony of nature."" To add to this, sustainable tourism has always been part of our country's development framework since the '90s. (And when you look at our tourist destinations, you just wonder what happened along the road.) All the way in Palawan, however, a local chain of island accommodation—El Nido Resorts—has been operating responsibly in an ecologically gifted area since the early 1980s.

""You're talking about the company that has been in El Nido for close to 40 years now. So in terms of track record, I think we have been able to successfully deliver the message that we can reconcile tourism within the context of a protected area, which is what El Nido is."" Mariglo Laririt, Director of Sustainability of Ten Knots Development Corporation, tells SPOT.ph. Each of the four properties of El Nido Resorts as well as Ten Knots' newest development, Lio Tourism Estate, has its own environmental officer who makes sure that the brand's strict sustainability policy is being implemented in every nook and cranny.

For starters, El Nido Resorts has its own sewage treatment plant with native reed bed filters so that murky water isn't discharged into the sea, a materials recovery facility that receives all recyclable and organic wastes from the resorts, a rainwater catchment system and a number of water-saving devices, a desalination plant to avoid depleting water sources in the mainland, and a set of solar panels. It also has a comprehensive program for nature conservation and protection, including monthly coastal cleanups, installation of eco-reefs and mooring buoys, safeguarding of giant clams and marine turtles, and active participation in El Nido's Maine Monitoring Task Force. Inside the rooms, shampoo and liquid soap dispensers are being used instead of small plastic bottles or sachets, treated and recycled water goes into toilet tanks, and there's an electricity shutdown at least one hour a day.

But of course, these fancy machineries and programs mean nothing if local communities as well as foreign guests carelessly throw their trash wherever, bring single-use plastic into the island, or pick up shells as souvenirs.

""What I would like to believe is this: When people choose El Nido as a destination, they know that it's a beautiful place, they know that it's naturally endowed. What should they do to be able to keep it that way? I think that's really important. Because I don't think that anyone comes here with a deliberate intention of ruining the place, I would really like to believe that. Abuse happens when people don't necessarily know what to do. So I think it also goes for several other destinations that may not be as spectacular as El Nido. I think people just need to know. So what we do is we try to inform them on various platforms, even before they come—meaning what we communicate to the greater public is important,"" Laririt continues.

El Nido Resorts has a training program called Be G.R.E.E.N. (Guard, Respect, Educate El Nido), which started in 2007. All staff members are taught about ecological waste management, conservation, and environmental laws. This is then extended to their guests—from actively reminding them that El Nido is a Protected Area to providing a copy of the company's Environmental Code of Conduct in every room.

""This orientation is something that everybody in the world can copy, but I'm wondering why they don't. It's so easy. Basically tell the people who come where they are: This is a protected area and there are certain behaviors that are allowed and not allowed,"" the sustainability director explains.

When asked why she thinks this environmentally friendly policy isn't followed by most hotels and resorts in the Philippines, Laririt can only assume: ""It's so much easier not to have standards, it's human nature perhaps."" And let's face it, business owners don't always see the long-term benefits of investing in expensive solar panels, for example.

Despite these challenges, El Nido Resorts continues to take the leadership role in sustainable tourism. ""Passivity wouldn't work, trash will never clean up itself, the second law of thermodynamics will always be at work where the likelihood of things getting messy is so much higher than things sorting themselves out. So who will go against that natural flow of things?""

Now that tourism secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat is actively pushing for sustainable tourism in the country, it’s high time that industry players follow the lead of El Nido Resorts.","""You're talking about the company that has been in El Nido for close to 40 years now.

In the search for sustainable materials, the day-to-day structures of plants could help replace polluting materials and plastics with ones that are less detrimental to our environment.

Plants produce walls on a daily basis and these walls support many essential aspects of life.

Our new discovery, published in Nature Plants, shows how plant walls could be manipulated in the future to change the way we produce biofuels, bioplastics and other biomaterials.

The building blocks of life

Each and every plant cell surrounds itself with wall structures, also known as cell walls. These are the building blocks for food, fuel and materials. As scientists we invest a lot of time and effort in understanding them, with the aim of being able to manipulate their content and structures.

In particular, understanding how to control the production of flexible primary walls, which support cell growth, has been an important goal for biologists.

The sugar-based polymers in these walls could be used for a range of applications—like converting them into biofuel, providing new types of green nano-materials or developing bioplastics.

However, much plant material comprises secondary walls, which are associated with wood. These structures have different characteristics than primary walls and are much more difficult to tease apart.

If we could substitute one wall for another, or perhaps even blend characteristics of the two wall types, it would be much easier to extract the sugars.

This is, however, easier said than done as an arsenal of protein activities contribute to the two-wall structures. A potential way around this problem is to find a way of 'turning on' the genes that control the full program of one or the other wall type.

Mid panel: Thale cress plant that has been changed to not produce secondary walls in its woody fibre cells - it has reduced stem strength. Right panel: Thale cress plant from mid panel that now has a master switch for thick primary wall production in its woody fibre cells.

Master switches

In our new study, we have identified 'master switches' that can turn on primary wall production. Astonishingly, these switches can make cells producing thick primary walls that can even be used to replace secondary walls.

The capacity to combine the ease of breaking primary wall sugar polymers apart, with the secondary walls' ability to grow thickly, means we can potentially completely change the content of the biomass of plants, from something that is strong but difficult to break apart to something that is more plastic and easy to dissolve.

We identified these master switches by expressing a large selection of something called transcription factors, which are proteins that can turn on the activity of other genes, in woody fibre cells of plants.

The crux here was to use plants that are not able to produce woody secondary walls as our starting material. To do this, we used plants from the Mitsuda lab at the National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Japan that had been modified so they could no longer make these sturdy secondary walls (the genes for these walls had been 'knocked out').

By driving the activity of the transcription factors only in the woody fibre cells, we could then screen for those plants that restored a thick wall structure around the cells. We chemically assessed those plants and found some that produced thick walls but with primary wall-like features.

Indeed, these walls were more similar to thick primary walls. While they are less strong than the typical secondary wall encased fibre cells, the amount of sugars released from them substantially increased.

By combining the activity of these genetic master switches with different secondary wall transcription factors, we may be able to tailor-make and engineer the biomass of plants in the future—leading to plants that can easily release their sugars for green fuel production or for new types of materials.

These materials could, for example, be used in the electronic and medical sectors, and perhaps for computer components like green nanomaterials. They may even have the potential to become an alternative to plastics, in some settings.

Plants can help us manufacture a greener future, and thanks to advances in genomics we are starting to understand them better than ever before. Our discoveries will help to engineer plants to produce new types of cell walls, providing for an exciting future in sustainable materials.

282,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/how-sustainable-is-your-cuppa/article25121935.ece,"Thu, 04 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Hindu,How sustainable is your cuppa?,"A look at the variety of factors that go into brewing a truly green cup, from direct trade to responsible single-estate players

Coffee is the most valuable legally-traded commodity in the world, second only to oil.

It is estimated that 2.25 billion cups of coffee are consumed each day, worldwide. Ironically, the poorest countries in the world (Guatemala, Ethiopia, Peru and Honduras are some of the top producers of coffee) are growing it, while it’s the richest who are drinking it (the top five coffee consumers are all European countries)… and at prices that get more absurd every day.

It is important to know that the coffee sold at retail is a different economic product from wholesale coffee, traded on the commodity exchange as green beans. And therein lies the rub. The money goes to those that process it. Coffee needs to be hulled, dried, roasted and ground before you can drink it. A big, shiny roaster inside your café means you can charge more than double what the farmer who grew the bean got for it. British charity Oxfam says the price of raw coffee exported from producer countries accounts for less than 7 % of the eventual cost of coffee to Western consumers.

The organic perspective

While certified organic coffee is sold at a premium, lower yields mean that farmers do not always profit in a meaningful way from obtaining certification, so most forgo it completely.

Fair Trade is a good option because the middlemen in coffee are so notorious. Coffee importers provide credit to certified farmers to help them stay out of debt with coffee buyers. But, the certification itself is expensive and there are several brands that practise fair trade without certification.

There are more than a few brands in India that make sustainable, fair trade, organic coffee nowadays. Black Baza is one of them. Founder Arshiya Bose, having done a PhD in the brew, believes a healthy ecosystem creates the best coffee. Black Baza supports their farmers with regular field research on healthy ecosystem indicators: spiders are the pest-control and butterflies, the pollinators. Not only is their coffee organic but the tree cover under which the coffee is grown also has to be 80% natural forest trees.

Organic coffee is mostly always shade-grown because of the large amounts of pesticide and fertilisers required to grow coffee under the sun. Indian coffee competes with large-scale, high-tech coffee estates in Central and South America, which were razed rainforests to begin with. They became so completely stripped of nutrients that in many areas of Brazil, the land could no longer be used for agriculture.

Little wonder that sun-grown coffee is the third most heavily sprayed crop in the world.

A constant struggle

I spoke to Kishore Cariappa of the famed Cariappa Coffee in Kodaikanal (with its own café). Their organic, single-estate, single-origin coffee, is easily one of the best in the country.

Kishore is a stickler for detail. Because the coffee is naturally rain-fed — with no artificial irrigation — the beans all ripen at different times. This means harvesting takes place several times to ensure only ripe berries are picked. It’s time-consuming and labour-intensive, but the only way you can compete with larger coffee companies.

His state-of-the-art roasting and processing machinery was bought to handle 200 acres of coffee. He had dreamt of starting a co-op of the farms in his village — tribal people that grew coffee organically under the shade of forest trees. He had even set up a system by which the farmers would get a monthly salary instead of the once-a-year bumper price that comes with the crop. But all the farmers in his village had already given their coffee out on five-10-year contracts to a clan of local coffee buyers.

“Educated farmers keep track of the prices in London and know what price to demand. But the average farmer doesn’t. They are not exposed to the Internet and their holdings are too small for export. Add to that the fact that they get an income only once a year, so they borrow money from this consortium of buyers and have their coffee locked on contract. This way, the international market prices don’t apply to them any more,” he says.

Kishore decided to go ahead with growing his own coffee and quickly realised that the only way to make money being a coffee farmer was to start his own café. It’s no dream job, though. “Growing sustainable coffee is hard. Organic coffee is so much more labour-intensive; which means expensive. To export, you need 20 tonnes per batch at least to fill a container. Coffee has to be fresh, even the green beans, so you have to send it in batches which is another added cost.”

Direct trade, where coffee roasters directly purchase from farmers, is also a socially sustainable choice. There’s no set standard, and there are no certifications. Roasters directly negotiate prices with the farmers, who typically earn a higher premium for their product. Blue Tokai coffee bags come with a detailed card on the farmer and the farm on which the coffee you ordered, was grown.

We are blessed to be growing some of the finest coffee in the world, and there are now plenty of brands that do it well. Keep it local, nourish our coffee traditions and support those that are making a difference.","There are more than a few brands in India that make sustainable, fair trade, organic coffee nowadays.

283,https://www.adirondackalmanack.com/2018/10/tony-goodwin-a-railroad-to-lake-placid-is-not-sustainable.html,"Mon, 01 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Adirondack Almanack,Tony Goodwin: A Railroad To Lake Placid Is Not Sustainable -,"To date, much of the rail vs. trail debate has touted the potential benefits of the possible uses of the Adirondack Rail Corridor. The supposed benefits of a trail include increased local recreational opportunities both summer and winter plus economic benefits from those who will travel to the area to use the trail with bicyclists and snowmobilers to be the greatest users.

Rail supporters question whether those benefits are greater than the benefits of a fully restored railroad that would supposedly bring greater economic benefits by transporting more visitors to the area.

Mostly left out of the debate is any discussion of just who and in what numbers would actually ride a restored railroad running 140 miles from Utica to Lake Placid.

The Adirondack Scenic Railroad (ASR) may have managed to survive so far offering short scenic rides, but 140 miles of railroad is true “transportation,” not just “scenery.” Individuals seeking actual transportation are most likely traveling to a destination where those travelers can then engage in another chosen activity. The ride in the train/plane/car is merely a means to the end and not the entire reason for the trip. When someone flies from the East Coast to Aspen, Colorado in February, they don’t fly for the 35,000-foot high view of the Great Plains. No, they fly because that is the most efficient and economical way to get there to ski. A train ride from Utica to Lake Placid (plus any connecting train ride to Utica) will never be as convenient and economical as driving, flying, or (if coming from the major markets of Albany or NYC) taking the more direct train to Westport and riding a shuttle to Lake Placid.

A cursory look at both the geography and the population very quickly indicates that there is no way a railroad could survive hauling passengers between those two locations. Utica is a city of approximately 70,000 with perhaps another 30,000 in the greater metro area. Lake Placid is clearly a major tourist destination, but only has a population of about 5,000 if those living in surrounding North Elba are counted. The total population of the towns in between is only about 10,000.

Rail supporters have countered this lack of immediate population with the fact that Utica is served by four daily Amtrak trains in each direction. Rail supporters thus say that riders, to/from Lake Placid could theoretically take the train to Utica from New York City, Albany, Syracuse, Buffalo, or other locations in between. The ASR’s business plan for expanded rail operations repeatedly touts the possibility of “cross-platform transfers” as a way of insuring a steady flow of passengers. Unfortunately, the operating schedule as proposed in the business plan does not include any ASR train that actually connects “across the platform” with an Amtrak train from New York and Albany. Specifically, as proposed the only daily ASR train leaves Utica at 8:40 am, but the first Amtrak train from that direction doesn’t arrive in Utica for another three hours. Thus, travel by train from New York or Albany would require an overnight stay. Assuming one was willing to board a train at 4:30 am in Buffalo, a wait of 40 minutes would actually allow a cross-platform transfer. But how many would be willing to do that?

An additional major problem with train travel to Lake Placid is the amount of time required – in part because of the additional 100 miles that must be covered when going via Utica. The current plan for track rehabilitation only envisions restoring the railroad to Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) Class II track. The speed limit for passenger trains on Class II track is only 30 mph. If a train could maintain that speed from start to finish, it would still be 4 hours, 40 minutes for the 140 miles from Utica to Lake Placid. But the grades out of Utica and the six likely station stops (Thendara, Big Moose, Beaver River, Tupper Lake, Lake Clear, and Saranac Lake) could easily stretch the trip to nearly six hours. Add to that the 4-1/2 hours needed to get from New York City to Utica, and it’s a long day of travel just to get there. The proposed schedule in the ASR’s business plan confirms the six hours to Lake Placid (8:40 am to 2:40 pm) with a change of trains required in Tupper Lake.

The prospects for a profitable, and therefore sustainable, train to Lake Placid are further diminished by the recent experience of the Saratoga and North Creek Railroad (SNCRR). With great high hopes, in 2011 the SNCRR inaugurated service on a two hour ride between Saratoga and North Creek. That service included a mid-day, round-trip tourist run plus two more runs to directly connect with both the northbound and the south bound runs of Amtrak’s Ethan Allen Express. Total travel time northbound from New York City to North Creek was 7-1/2 hours. Starting in 2012, the SNCRR added a third train that connected with both runs of Amtrak’s Adirondack running between New York City, Albany, and Montreal.

The SNCRR trains that connected with Amtrak never had many riders, and by 2015 the schedule was down to the one scenic train from Saratoga to North Creek. The SNCRR also tried “snow trains” to serve Gore Mt. The package deal the railroad offered included a lift ticket and was attractively priced. Skiers could also leave home quickly because breakfast was available on the train. However, the two hour train ride plus the van shuttle meant that, after arriving bright and early at the Saratoga station at 7 am, one likely didn’t start actually skiing until closer to 10 am. By contrast, a skier leaving Saratoga by car at 7 am could likely catch “first tracks” at the mountain.

Service on the SNCRR continued to diminish until there was a last run this past April with the season’s final snow train. Along the way, the railroad tried to stay afloat financially with the highly controversial plan to store unused oil tankers.

This was opposed by the State, the surrounding town, and environmental groups, causing the SNCRR to end all service.

Now I will have to admit that it would be a scenic ride from Utica to Lake Placid. Should service actually be restored there, I am sure that the first few trains would be close to sold out with business continuing to be brisk for a few more. Unfortunately, once all those who want to experience a six hour scenic ride have experienced it, those riders will either move on to some of the other great scenic train rides in North America, or they will use a more convenient way to get to Lake Placid.

This pattern of initial surge and then a steep decline would be consistent with the long-awaited extension to Big Moose. The first long train in 2013 was sold out, requiring two engines to get it up the grades. Soon, however, average ridership was down to the 25-50 passenger range per weekly run. This year, service is limited to only ten runs during foliage season. Ten runs a year does not seem to justify the $1.2 million expenditure of government funds required to rehabilitate the track to Big Moose.

As mentioned above, up to this point the ASR has been selling “scenic rides” lasting a day or far less. An expansion to Lake Placid moves into the vastly different category of “transportation” where the destination and what one will do once at the destination is more important than the scenery along the way. Even if the ASR were to alter their schedule so that one could make a cross platform transfer in Utica, a trip to Lake Placid (or even Albany) would require full day of travel each way. One would thus have to take a full three-day weekend just to have one full day for activities in Lake Placid. I believe that most observers would agree that there would never be enough travelers ever choosing that option to sustain rail operations between Utica and Lake Placid.

“Green banking encourages the adoption of environmentally friendly practices and contributes to reducing the negative impacts of climate change, which restores the balance of global growth and enhances the role of sustainability as a future concept that carries the potential for growth for society and the environment,” said Mohamed El-Etreby, chairperson of Banque Misr and deputy head of the Union of Arab Banks (UAB).

Among the lessons learned in the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2008 was the recognition of the importance of harmonising the banking industry with the social and environmental realities, and hence the need to apply the concept of green banking and promote the green economy and sustainable financing, he added.

During the forum held by the UAB recently on the green economy, El-Etreby spoke about the path to sustainable development.

Mainly, he explained that sustainable financing offers promising opportunities for the growth of financial institutions and provides a broader horizon for expansion and physical growth through financing clean energy projects and optimising energy use, as well as microfinance and microenterprise financing.

He said efforts were being made by the G-20, the Group of Seven, the United Nations and the Financial Stability Council to encourage efforts to establish a sustainable financial system and promote opportunities for growth of a green economy, that respects environmental controls.

Since the conclusion of the Paris Agreement in 2015; European financial regulators have stepped up their scrutiny over the banking sector to hedge against the risks of climate change and to prepare for shifting to a low-carbon energy system, he pointed out.

“Green bonds are the financing options available to organisations willing to support climate and environmental investments,” he said.

Moreover, the green bonds are called this name because their proceeds are used to finance green projects, such as clean energy projects or government transport projects that reduce emissions, he explained.

The World Bank Group, represented by the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), was one of the pioneers in developing the green bond market. The World Bank issued the first green bond in 2008. In 2013; the IFC was also the first to float a green bond worth $1bn, thus transforming the green bond market from niche markets to public markets.

According to the Climate Bond Initiative, a London-based non-profit organisation that relies on the green nature of bonds, green bond issues around the world hit a record high of $155.5bn in 2017, surpassing previous estimates, and may reach $250-300bn this year.

The United States, China, and France formed 56% of total green bond issues in 2017, and until September 2017; green bonds worth $1bn had been floated in the Middle East and North Africa.

Credit rating agencies like Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s have recently launched Green Assessment services, which are designed to classify green bonds, such as conventional credit ratings.

“Talking about the concept of green economy necessarily motivates us to talk about the concept of sustainable development, where they are two sides of a single coin. The green economy came as a proposal to help achieve the objectives of sustainable development,” according to El-Etreby.

The Federation of Egyptian Banks (FEB) is working to consolidate its institutional approach to sustainability, and to support the efforts of comprehensive development in the economic, social and environmental levels, based on its keenness to support the vision of Egypt 2030, he noted.

Meanwhile, El-Etreby highlighted that the efforts of the FEB in this regard are concentrated in the effective contribution to the achievement of sustainable development, and contribute to the development of slums and the development of unplanned communities and conservation of environmental resources, pointing out that the FEB established the Commission on Sustainable Development in 2014 to implement the vision of the FEB in this field and to adhere to the best international practices in this regard.

“The FEB launched an initiative to develop slums in 2014, in which banks contributed EGP 320m to develop the unplanned areas of priority in Helwan and Giza. The criteria for the classification of areas was set in accordance with international treaties, and to ensure the rights of the population and take into account their living conditions,” El-Etreby said.

He elaborated that the FEB’s initiative for the development of slums adopted the concept of comprehensive development, which is not limited to the structure, but extends the initiative to include human development, with special attention to the problems of health and education, as the pillars of development, noting that EGP 100m was allocated to establish a medical centre and a complex of model schools to serve the people of Helwan.

Moreover, he said that FEB’s initiative also aimed at the activities of financing clean energy, supporting environmental activities, training services, entrepreneurship, and supporting microenterprises, with particular attention to women living in these areas, in cooperation with all parties with a common interest in providing the best opportunities to secure the best chances of success and maximise the positive outcome of the initiative.

He pointed out that in this context, the FEB signed a cooperation agreement with the Ministry of Environment to contribute to improving the environmental conditions, developing garbage collection system from slums in Helwan, beautification, and landscaping of Helwan streets, and raising awareness among citizens to maintain the achievements of the initiative.

Meanwhile, he noted that the FEB supported the efforts of the Ministry of Electricity, which aims to adopt renewable energy projects, rationalise energy consumption, improve efficiency and preserve environmental resources, in line with Egypt’s Vision 2030 and its strategy to maximise Egypt’s regional role in world energy markets.

The FEB also supported the national initiative of the Ministry of Electricity, in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Global Environment Facility, to improve the efficiency of lighting systems in all sectors, including the banking sector, in order to switch to energy efficient lighting systems and expand the use of photovoltaic cells.

“Banks must incorporate financing and sustainable development plans into their future credit granting strategies and emphasise the importance of sustainable financing in diversifying banks’ portfolios and growth in a way that serves the current generations without compromising the rights and needs of future generations and the economy as a whole,” El-Etreby concluded.

According to vice-chairperson of the National Bank of Egypt (NBE), Yehia Aboul Fotouh, NBE pays great attention to the issues of sustainable development and compliance with environmental standards. He pointed out that the financing limits for major projects in the field of renewable energy and compliance with environmental standards amounted to EGP 4.8bn in June 2018.

The NBE signed an extension of a joint cooperation agreement between the bank, the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA), and the Federation of Egyptian Industries (FEI) worth EGP 120m in February 2018 for 20 years to implement environmental compliance projects and to assist small and medium enterprises in adjusting their environmental conditions, Aboul Fotouh added.

Additionally, he clarified that the bank has financed 400 projects to reconcile the environmental conditions with EGP 68m between 2005 and 2017. The NBE has also signed the pioneering services agreement with the Ministry of Environment to implement the third stage of the project on industrial pollution control, which is worth a total of €14.5m.

Aboul Fotouh affirmed that the NBE is transitioning to electronic activities through the development of the internet service for individuals and companies, where the number of e-portfolio clients at the bank has exceeded 1.5 million.

“The NBE supports efforts to reduce thermal emissions and deepen the concept of green banking. The bank has adopted a plan to transform dozens of its branches into solar energy, thereby saving 3 MW per year and cutting its CO2 emissions by 2,000 tonnes per year,” he said.

Meanwhile, Dalia Abdel Kader, head of Sustainability, Marketing and Communication Division at the Arab African International Bank (AAIB), pointed out that the bank has taken the first step towards achieving sustainable development through the Mostadam (Sustainable) programme. The bank also supported projects that serve the environment and has played a key role in training graduates able to achieve sustainable development.

She pointed out that Egypt has many elements to achieve sustainable development and to protect against any climatic or environmental changes. The AAIB is the first bank to finance solar energy. It financed Benban project in Aswan, which is considered the largest solar park.

She explained that the Egyptian banking sector has already taken serious steps to activate sustainable financing with its community and environment.

Abdel Kader added that the move by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) to incorporate financial inclusion into the policies and practices of banking institutions in Egypt and the issuance of legislation governing microcredit has had the greatest impact in supporting and applying the concept. She pointed out that this trend supports the existence of the CBE in international forums, such as the Alliance for Financial Inclusion and Financial Inclusion Global Initiative, which was launched by the World Bank.

She highlighted the FEB’s entry into the Sustainable Banking Network (SBN), which was approved by the FEB’s board on 13 November 2016.

In addition, Abdel Kader explained that this network is dedicated to spreading the culture, policies, and practices of sustainable financing within the banking sector of each country, which has gained importance in the scope of the work of financial institutions at the international level, in the light of mounting pressures by international institutions, governments, civil society organisations and investors, such as committing to the Paris Agreement.

“Egypt is distinguished by the banking institutions leading sustainable finance, such as the AAIB’s experience that started in 2003 that worked to link banking with environmental and social elements, crystallising into incorporating environment and society risks in the criteria of managing corporate risk funding, as well as sustainability reporting and carbon footprint measurement,” said Abdel Kader.

On the other hand, the Arab African International Bank arranged and marketed a number of the most prominent syndicated loans in the Egyptian banking market, including the arrangement of a loan for the construction of six solar PV plants in Egypt with Scatec Solar, she added.

In 2014, the Arab African International Bank launched the Mostadam Forum to train young bankers on the principles of sustainable finance, in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Egyptian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ECRC) becoming the first forum of its kind in Egypt and the Middle East.

According to Abdel Kader, this forum provides a comprehensive introduction to the concept of sustainable financing and demonstrates the positive interaction between the financial industry, environmental, and societal aspects and governance.","Banks operating in the Egyptian market have begun to feel their way towards financing environmentally friendly projects, or so-called green banking, to achieve a larger goal of sustainable development.

Sustainable tourism: is it even possible?

With hundreds of thousands of Chinese, Indian, Russian and other Southeast Asian visitors arriving every day at our beach resorts, historic towns and cities, managing these huge numbers seems like an impossible task.

In 2017, Southeast Asia saw 134 million tourist arrivals, up from 113 million in 2016, already higher than ASEAN’s 2020 projection of 123 million. Visitors from China constitute some 28 million of the total, the number one source of tourists to the region.

However, ASEAN tourism practitioners keep complaining about poor yields. Chinese tourists come in droves, but the perception is that economic benefits to local communities are limited.

Indeed, the costs sometimes outweigh the positives.

For instance, the region’s once pristine islands and beaches may well be close to an environmental apocalypse if the authorities don’t intervene to halt the degradation.

It is true that tourism represents a critical injection of cash into local communities. It also provides employment for millions of waiters, hotel-maids, taxi drivers, stall-keepers, pool attendants

and more. To be exact, tourism accounts for 14.4 million jobs.

But for Boracay, the Philippines’ fabled island getaway, decades of unchecked growth, poor supervision and almost non-existent infrastructure has turned the resort – In the words of President Rodrigo Duterte – into a “cesspool”.

Indeed, earlier this year, Duterte summarily closed down what Condé Nast Traveler in 2016 had dubbed the “world’s best island”.

The Filipinos aren’t alone. Thai authorities have also moved swiftly.

In March, the iconic Maya Bay on the island of Koh Phi Phi, a location made famous by Leonardo DiCaprio’s movie “The Beach”, was closed to the public – preventing an estimated 4,000 daily visitors from further ruining the surrounding coral reefs of which some 80% were already thought to be damaged. Realising the extent of the destruction, Thai authorities later extended the closure indefinitely.

Many observers are also deeply-concerned about Indonesia’s Raja Ampat islands. Located on the westernmost tip of Papua, its marine-protected area of some 9,100 square kilometers is vulnerable to unchecked tourism. Last year, a British cruise ship the “Caledonian Sky” accidentally destroyed over 13,000 square meters of coral reefs.

Last week, Team Ceritalah sat down with Philippine Secretary of Tourism Bernadette “Berna” Romulo-Puyat for Boracay’s ‘soft’ re-opening. The diminutive but punchy cabinet member, the scion of a prominent Philippine family (her father is Alberto Romulo, a much respected former Foreign Secretary) is firm and direct: “I have no regrets closing down the island. We needed six months of rehabilitation – closing more than 440 hotels and many of its 2,600 businesses.”

Has it been worth the effort?

“Look at these waters: they’re clear – and look at the white sand. This is how Boracay was thirty years ago. And I am determined to make sure other tourist destinations – Bohol and Cebu – follow suit.”

Tourism Secretary Bernadette “Berna” Romulo-Puyat says “We’ll be limiting Boracay’s carrying capacity to 19,000 tourists at any one time...Eco-friendly policies have been in place for a long time - this is nothing new....We need to change the mindset of the people.” ABS-CBN News file photo

Secretary “Berna” has an eye for detail, going on to explain:

“We’ll be limiting Boracay’s carrying capacity to 19,000 tourists at any one time, so that the island’s resources are not strained. Eco-friendly policies have been in place for a long time - this is nothing new. People just need to follow them. The environment is important. We need to change the mindset of the people.”

Richard Fabila, a Boracay-based environmental officer, is doing his part. “We test the waters three times a day, every day – and every morning locals participate in a beach cleanup”.

Regulations are being tightly enforced.

For example, tourists will be banned from setting up day beds, tables and chairs, beach umbrellas and the like anywhere within the newly-regulated 30-meter exclusion zone from the shoreline.

There will now also be rigorous rules on partying, which include no alcohol on the beaches. At the same time, water sports like jet skiing can only take place 200 meters away from the shoreline.

With the Philippines leading the charge for sustainable tourism in Southeast Asia, it is hoped that the region’s policy-makers will focus more on the yield rather than raw numbers.

So, while everyone deserves a getaway now and then, it is important to ensure that recreation does not lead to degradation of our region’s irreplaceable natural treasures.

286,https://dailytimes.com.pk/314439/pakistan-needs-to-form-a-sustainable-disaster-management-policy/,"Sun, 28 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Daily Times,Pakistan needs a sustainable disaster management policy,"The best disaster management practices lead to lasting solutions to natural calamities and create resilience among the communities. Unfortunately, in Pakistan, poor planning, inactiveness of institutions and poorly-trained disaster management officials make manageable circumstances into unmanageable ones.

Pakistan has experienced various huge disasters in history, be it the earthquake of October 8, 2005, that hit major parts of Azad Kashmir and Islamabad, killing hundreds of people and hundreds of people were injured. Hundreds became homeless since their houses turned into debris by the massive earthquake. This was the big ask for the fragile disaster management practices since there was no institute or body to mitigate such high-level destruction.

These grave circumstances prompted the government to establish the Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority. The ERRA contained professionals mainly from Pakistan Army since our nation always looks toward the army in times of disasters as our brave soldiers rush to rescue, relief, and rehabilitate the communities.

The army officers possess the high level of experience in disaster management and are always ready to help the government in extenuating disasters. The ERRA has done the marvellous job in rebuilding the demolished houses, roads and other structures. They also introduced various disaster-resistant technologies after researching the conditions for shelters and infrastructure.

The superfloods of 2010 also spread widespread destruction of crops, houses, industries and loss of hundreds of people. The superfloods affected various parts of Punjab such as Muzaffargarh, Raheem Yar Khan, Rajanpur, parts of Balochistan and major parts of Sindh including 18 districts of Sindh which were directly hit by the floods. The district Kashmore was severely hit as the Tori Embankment is situated in the district. The superfloods were caused due to overtopping of Indus river that caused a breach in the weak Tori dyke.

The River Indus inundated hundreds of acres of agricultural land. People stranded in the various places as the breach occurred in the late night when people were asleep, and they were not aware of such breaking of the dyke. The superfloods were caused by the heavy rains in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab that caused flash floods that engulfed Pakistan.

Pakistan Meteorological Department had issued flood warnings to people given the heavy rains recorded above 7.9 inches. The rainwater destroyed roads, bridges, communication, electric supply and uprooted trees.

The repercussions were very intense owing to being a hilly area and the water causing collateral damage to properties. The rains also hit parts of Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan, bringing misery in the areas.

The United Nations Secretary General, Ban Kay Moon, termed the flooding as the biggest disaster he had ever seen and submitted his appeal for relief and Rehabilitation to the UN member Countries as the damage was too big for Pakistan to mitigate.

That was the time when disaster Management services were felt. The Govt of Pakistan thought over the establishment of Disaster Management Authority to help Government Make the Contingency plans to fight existing and Future Disasters.

The rain floods of 2011, The frequent Rain floods in Balochistan due to monsoon rains, earthquake of Awaran Balochistan 2013 warrant to have proper disaster management policy to alleviate natural calamities in a proper way. There is a need of establishing Disaster Risk Management fund at the provincial level and District level to help provide relief to the affectees on time. Though, it has been established at National Level with the assistance of Asian Development Bank.

The National Disaster Management Authority was established after provision of National Disaster Act 2010 by the Parliament to mitigate the disasters and making contingency plans for catastrophes with the approval of National Management Council headed by PM.

The NDMA is headed by the chairman mostly from the army. It would be more effective if the chairman should be from the Development sector as they have great Training in Disaster Management and Other Field Level Activities. The development sector organizations express their reservations to interact with military leadership. The NDMA act must create room for a civilian chairman who can steer the goals of Apex Disaster Management Authority. The NDMA may be given the Financial Freedom to carry out rescue, relief, reconstruction and rehabilitation initiatives on its own and the Government should play the role of the Monitor or supervisor.

The establishment of NDMA is not sufficient but giving it financial freedom and proper Human resource is very necessary. NDMA must hold various Seminars at Federal Level to create awareness amongst the people and encourage them to strengthen their resilience in case of Natural Disasters especially those people who are frequently hit by natural disasters or prone to natural disasters such as the areas of KPK, Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan. Especially, Thar Desert of Sindh where drought, famine and Epidemics have engulfed the poor Tharies and so far, both the Federal and Provincial Governments have failed to assess the level of damage and mitigate such high level of Natural Calamity.

The Provincial Disaster Management Authorities of the provinces have no coordination among them in times of Disasters including NDMA that has created a great vacuum for intervention in the affected areas for both Government and Development partners.

The Development partners have the greater role as they had shown in the earthquake of 2005, Super Floods of 2010, rain floods of 2011 and Earthquake of 2013 resulting (80 percent of destruction in Awaran District ) of Balochistan.

Instead of shedding tears and clamouring for The help from International community, we need to develop a viable disaster Management Policy and Disaster Risk Reduction Policy so that that the damages may be minimised at a massive level.

There is a strong need of Restructuring Disaster Management Services at District Level. The District Disaster Management Authority is headed by District Council Chairman and Its Members include DCs/DCOs, SSP, District Head of Health Department. It is missing the key departments in case of flooding or rain emergency such as Irrigation, Agriculture, Works and Services Department, District Food Controllers, Social Welfare Department, Population Welfare and Information department.

The Deputy Director /Manager of grade 17/18 officer from the Civil Services, PMS or Other departments may be appointed on deputation or Permanent basis to head DDMA and carry out its work smoothly since DCs /DCOs are career Civil servants and they get overburdened in times of Disasters. The Proper DDMA chief will make detailed Contingency Plans for Rain or Flood Emergency plans and appraise the District and Provincial Governments to take necessary arrangements ahead of such happenings.

The DDMA must include INGOs/NGOs, CBOs, Philanthropists, Educators and others so that an effective Plan may be chalked out.

There is also need of establishing Taluka Disaster Management Committees, UC Disaster Management Committees and Cluster Village Committees with the inclusion of Local Government representatives and Village Heads so that Disaster Management network may be strengthened.

The establishment of Provincial Disaster Management Institutes (PDMI) in Every Provincial Head Quarter is imperative in order to impart disaster Management training to the Public Sector, Private Sector People of the respective province. The civil servants must have compulsory training in disaster management.

The NDMI (National Disaster Management Institute) is doing a great job in imparting Training to the Government officers, Private Sector and Development partners. It was also a welcome initiative to establish a National Disaster Risk Management Fund with Assistance from Asian Development.

It is imperative to devolve it at Provincial Level and District level so that the interventions in the disaster-affected areas may be initiated on time. It is accepted truth that disasters bring misery to the hustling-bustling cities and convert them into debris but with the proper disaster management policy, we may be able to mitigate the effects, create resilience and rehabilitate the affectees in a proper way.

The current PTI Government is well aware of the importance of disaster management and they need to frame the sustainable disaster management policy in consultation with policy think tanks such as SDPI, IPS.SPDC, PILER and NDMI so that future disasters can be prevented and professionally mitigated.","Unfortunately, in Pakistan, poor planning, inactiveness of institutions and poorly-trained disaster management officials make manageable circumstances into unmanageable ones.

287,https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2018/11/29/can-us-cities-help-the-world-achieve-the-sustainable-development-goals/,"Thu, 29 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Brookings Institution,Can US cities help the world achieve the Sustainable Development Goals?,"Despite a crisis of confidence at the national level, a significant majority of Americans still believe in the ability of their local governments to deliver. This is good news, because U.S. cities are increasingly responsible for taking on local challenges with global implications, such as pollution, violence, climate change, and economic opportunity and security.

Local actions, global lessons

As municipalities go about their business, they are increasingly turning to their peers, engaging in city-to-city networks and communities of practice (an estimated 300+ globally) to share best practices, experiment with innovations, and design new solutions. It reflects a problem-solving mentality that has earned many U.S. city leaders a reputation for pragmatism over politics.

This is the way American cities such as Los Angeles, New York City, and Pittsburgh come to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs, collectively agreed by the world’s nations in 2015, reflect national commitments to end poverty, achieve economic prosperity, and reduce inequality and injustice while promoting environmental sustainability and tackling climate change.

Yet cities worldwide and in the U.S. are taking on the SDGs themselves, viewing the goals as a planning tool for prioritizing, measuring, and mobilizing social, economic, and environmental progress. On November 29 at Brookings, leaders and experts from these three cities will explore the local value proposition of the SDGs to U.S. cities along several dimensions:

Common Language: As the SDGs have grown into the lingua franca of development globally, they give city officials, stakeholders, and even residents a common and immediate frame of reference when engaging counterparts. The globally accepted and vetted framework offers the potential for comparability, allowing cities to measure themselves against other communities using a holistic vision of sustainable development.

Clear Diagnosis: The SDGs help to view at once the multiple dimensions of development that administrators often pursue through separate offices and stand-alone initiatives. This offers the opportunity to integrate plans to improve—among other things—infrastructure, equity and inclusion, economic growth and jobs, resilience, and the environment. It can also help identify gaps and interdependencies that would otherwise go unnoticed or unexploited. New York City, which developed its OneNYC city strategy before the SDGs were adopted, recognized the overlap and mapped its local milestones to the global goals. This year it became the first city in the world to submit a review of its progress to the United Nations. This advance in accountability allowed city leadership to report on the city’s progress using a recognizable framework accessible to residents and other stakeholders.

Concrete Objectives: As a set of timebound, outcome-based targets, the SDGs give meaning to metrics. It is rare for elected city leaders and their communities to commit to the level of specificity contained in SDG targets. For example, while many communities might endorse a commitment to reducing poverty, it can be much more powerful—and motivating—to commit to reducing poverty by 50 percent by 2030 (SDG target 1.2). The ambition of the goals translates into a universal imperative to “leave no one behind,” forcing municipalities to focus on its most vulnerable residents. While the perception lingers that the SDGs have limited relevance for high-income countries, just the simple combination of target 1.2 with target 10.1, which commits to achieving and sustaining income growth of the bottom 40 percent at a rate higher than the national average, demonstrates that the agenda directly addresses the economic dynamics buffeting many communities in the U.S.

Concerted Action: This type of data-driven goal-setting is embodied in the commitment made in 2017 by Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti to decrease the number of unsheltered Angelenos by 50 percent in five years, and functionally end homelessness in 10 years. This predates the city’s commitment to the SDGs, but it demonstrates the mobilizing effect of aligning policy and budget against a publicly accountable goal: a county bond issued for $355 million annually for services and programs, a city bond issued for $1.2 billion for supportive housing, and a mayoral executive directive given to expedite the process of standing up temporary shelters. At the global level, the SDGs have been catalysts for new partnerships among government and the private sector, universities, civil society, and citizens. Investment managers such as PIMCO and Calpers are analyzing how the SDGs measure environmental, social, and governance factors critical to financial performance, while businesses are seeking ways to highlight their leadership.

Another way for America to lead

As cities cooperate through networks such as C40 to address climate change, 100 Resilient Cities to deal with shocks and stresses, and Strong Cities to end violent extremism, they have increasingly found a collective voice on tough global issues, separate from their national government. While the full implications of this political shift are unclear, it has provided an alternative path for American global leadership. One of the most compelling virtues of the SDGs reported by cities globally is their ability to excite and engage citizens, including youth and millennial leaders. This may help cities deal with the trickiest part of their global engagement: getting their residents to care about—or at least see the value of—their forays on the global stage.

Adopting the SDGs is quite easy; serious implementation is much harder. Cities will always need to find customized ways to manage and prioritize. But the SDGs offer a blueprint and useful metrics for city leaders to advance local economic, civic, and environmental imperatives. They give U.S. cities an incentive to play a prominent role in solving the world’s problems while solving their own. At a time when traditional forms of global cooperation are under pressure, this may be a good way for the U.S. to retain the mantle of leadership in development, both at home and globally.","It reflects a problem-solving mentality that has earned many U.S. city leaders a reputation for pragmatism over politics.
This is the way American cities such as Los Angeles, New York City, and Pittsburgh come to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

288,https://theconversation.com/cohousing-is-an-inclusive-approach-to-smart-sustainable-cities-105208,"Thu, 15 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",The Conversation CA,"Cohousing is an inclusive approach to smart, sustainable cities","The idea that technology will fix complex and systemic problems like climate change, poverty, the housing crisis or health care is simplistic to say the least. We need a radical shift in how we live, and designing for environmental and social sustainability cannot simply be about applying new technologies to our existing models of living.

We need to support models of living that can both improve our actual well-being and reduce material demands on the planet.

Existing models of urban development that can achieve these goals are taking hold across North America. One example is collaborative housing or cohousing.

As municipalities consider the development of smart cities, they have to consider how citizens contribute to the relative “intelligence” of a city. Cohousing is just one such model as it both a form and a process of design for co-operation that helps create vibrant and resilient communities.

Alphabet’s Sidewalk Labs is mapping out a new kind of neighbourhood that would redevelop a 12-acre waterfront district in Toronto called Quayside from “the internet up.”

This is just the beginning of the relationship, as all eyes are on the future development of the 750 acres neighbouring the site along the eastern waterfront.

It has been a year of scandals at Silicon Valley, from Google sharing emails with app developers to a joint investigation between the Justice Department, the FBI, the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission into data leaks by Facebook. A networked neighbourhood built “from the internet up,” may not be the selling feature Sidewalk Labs had hoped it would be. It should come as no surprise that many people are suspicious of this proposal.

Several paths to the Smart City

There are different paths that lead to smart cities. For example, we have techno-utopias that focus on the digital optimization of the city, with a particular focus on infrastructure. Or we might consider how social innovations can lead to a better quality of life for more people.

Of course, there are times when these approaches intersect, but I can’t help but notice the particular focus on the technological aspects of just about every critique of the Quayside project.

These critiques, by academics, technology writers and concerned citizens are warranted because so far, “smart city” approaches the world over have generally been related to top-down processes with a focus on new technologies. People who live in these cities are often excluded from meaningful participation in the planning process that later impacts their lives. Given the levels of engagement on this issue, it’s quite clear that the citizens of Toronto are hungry for the opportunity to truly participate in making their city better.

With this in mind, I want to draw attention to one element of the plan presented by the Quayside proposal: Cohousing.

A model of meaningful collaboration

There is an assumption that people understand what is meant by cohousing, but as a researcher in this field, I can assure you, most people don’t.

Some think it’s some kind of approach to affordable housing, which has yet to be the case in North America. There is little understanding of how the nature of this kind of intentional community represents a fairly radical, and positive, shift in modern living, where people learn through regular practice to build consensus with their neighbours on issues of sharing, co-caring and meaningful collaboration.

This is a model of design, development and management that when done properly, can contribute to a “bottom-up” approach to building the city. Yet in both the proposal itself and media coverage, cohousing isn’t clearly defined.

Cheryl Gladu , CC BY-NC

What is cohousing?

Cohousing includes participation in the project’s design, development and management by a self-organizing group or collective. It is one of a number of collective housing models that emerged in northern Europe in the late 1960s and 1970s.

Decisions are made by consensus and talking through differences is central to the creation of these communities. Residents own or rent complete private dwellings within the larger project (typically between 15 to 33 households), while also sharing common property, such as a common house, a large kitchen and dining area, guest suites and gardens.

The legal structure of these communities may vary: Some are co-operatives, while others are condominium associations.

Materially simple, relationally rich

One reason that this model is interesting is that it shows us that when members of an intentional community get together to design their own neighbourhood, they opt for less personal space and more shared resources; they opt for materially simple, yet rich relational lives.

These projects can also help “seed community” into a larger area. Despite the fact that most of these communities are not certified green buildings, research shows us that cohousing communities can outperform green buildings on environmental measures, and this is likely related to the governance structure rather than technological innovation. Smart, no?

A case study in Barcelona suggests there is much to gain from the pairing of top-down with bottom-up approaches in terms of smart city development, as partnerships between different stakeholders can reinforce collaboration.

Cohousing communities across Canada and the United States could benefit from the capacity of companies like Sidewalk Labs to mobilize people, politicians and resources.

However, in order for this to work for cohousing communities, there has to be a real opportunity to partner with the eventual occupants so that they have ownership of the process because cohousers themselves must be the driving force behind the process.

The sense of community that emerges from cohousing developments is not merely due to its physical design, nor is it a happy accident — it is the central aim of the development and management process, which starts prior to the design and development of these communities.","As municipalities consider the development of smart cities, they have to consider how citizens contribute to the relative “intelligence” of a city.

The SDGs include: ending poverty; ending hunger; encouraging good health and well-being; providing quality education; promoting gender equality; providing clean water and sanitation; promoting affordable and clean energy; providing decent work and economic growth; addressing industry, innovation and infrastructure; reducing inequalities; developing sustainable cities and communities; encouraging responsible consumption and production; taking action on climate change; promoting life below water; promoting life on land; working towards peace, justice and strong institutions; and creating partnerships to achieve SDG goals.



However, recent political changes in Europe and elsewhere put this hope at risk. To increase the likelihood of success for these 17 SDGs, higher education institutions worldwide must teach and train today’s students – tomorrow’s decision-makers – to think both critically and ethically, to learn to cope with ethical dilemmas and apply systems-thinking approaches to serious and complex societal problems.



Developing ethical leaders of the future



Students need to be aware of the local, regional and global contexts in which they live and make decisions. Many of today’s students do not grasp their role in and responsibility to the world and large numbers don’t seem to care.



A single course at college can only ever be a beginning. Families, media, religious bodies, primary and secondary schools and workplaces as well as higher education institutions must be educated and recruited to play their part.



The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development aims to promote the entire cluster of 17 SDGs and 169 targets. The critical-ethical analytical skills and systems-based approach outlined above are indispensable prerequisites to achieving this.



By ‘critical’ we refer to the application of careful, exact evaluation and judgement. By ‘ethical’ we refer to a set of principles about the right way to behave. By ‘systems’ we refer to a group of interacting, interrelated or interdependent elements forming a complex whole. Accordingly, systems-thinking is based on the recognition of interconnectedness and systems processes.



What needs to be done?



Universities need to start to become ethical leaders by looking first at themselves. The Council for Higher Education Accreditation/International Quality Group and UNESCO’s International Institute for Educational Planning have issued an advisory statement on combating ‘corruption’ in higher education internationally.



The statement, however, uses ‘corruption’ as a general term to designate a broad variety of malpractice in institutions of higher education, such as appropriation, bribery, cheating, corruption, deceit, embezzlement, extortion, favouritism, fraud, graft, harassment, nepotism, etc – an ABC of misconduct.



To deliver the badly needed SDGs and targets, we need trustworthy, ethical, honest and impartial government institutions that exercise public power, oversee policies fairly and take into account their range, complexity and occasional incompatibility. These institutions are much more likely to promote trust and social capital which in turn improves health and well-being. Tackling corruption is vital.



We also need higher education institutions that can teach the crucial necessary skills we have highlighted. These should be taught and implemented throughout people’s entire life span. It is crucially important that leading higher education institutions start leading by example to increase future decision-makers’ motivation and ability to act ethically.



Next steps



Recognising the university sector’s potential and responsibility to help shape the moral contours of society for the better and given the societal benefits from increased social capital, we ask universities and institutions of higher education to shoulder their role as key agents of change, as stated in the Compostela Group of Universities’ Poznan Declaration of 2014. They should:



• Endorse a cross-faculty approach to broaden the curricula to include components of critical-ethical analysis and systems thinking. To some extent, this is presently being considered by the European Commission in their endeavours to modernise European higher education.





• Appreciate the unique opportunity they have to shape professional identities. At universities, the norms and boundaries of acceptable behaviour are to a large extent set for a number of professions. Universities have a possibility as well as a responsibility to help shape the normative contours of society for the better.





• Teach the teachers through the provision of pedagogical resources and training to a wide range of faculty.





• Develop a web page for information dissemination of pedagogical material, discussion topics, case studies, e-learning tools etc.





• Organise conferences to exchange good practice as regards implementation of the 17 SDGs and 169 targets of the UN Agenda 2030. The Karolinska Institute, in collaboration with the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, is planning such a conference, to be held in Stockholm on 30 March 2019.





• Develop partnerships with other universities, networks, national authorities for higher education and civil society organisations championing the critical-ethical agenda.





• Commit for the long term. Changing norms and behaviour is an inherently slow process. While there may indeed be ripple effects from promoting critical-ethical behaviour and systems-thinking, it is likely that the ‘exposed’ generation will need to reach a critical mass and-or managerial positions before true and measurable change will occur.





• Coordinate with national education authorities and social partners with regard to fulfilling the state’s obligation under the UN Agenda 2030 SDGs.





• Encourage voluntary associations and participation in these.





• Talk the talk and walk the walk. In addition to teaching critical-ethical behaviour and promoting systems thinking, it is crucial that higher education institutions – as agents providing public goods – act accordingly, ensuring impartiality in teaching, student assessment and research and that matters regarding awards of degrees, employment and promotions are based on legitimate, transparent and objective criteria.



Low costs, high gain



Considering the relatively low costs of implementation and the possible societal gains if these proposals are implemented broadly, this initiative has the potential to be extremely cost efficient in the long term. More important, however, is that, ethically, it is the right thing to do.



This is why we propose additional high-level conferences on such issues, with a focus on the implementation of Agenda 2030 (what should be taught and how). Based on the outcomes of these, recommendations should be made regarding the necessary redesign of all higher education and for its subsequent implementation.

The World Economic Forum issues impressive annual reports on the major ‘Global Risks’ facing mankind. To counteract these risks – as well as the present mounting disaffection and disruption across the world, partly due to short-term and silo thinking by elites – the 193 member states of the United Nations have agreed on 17 very ambitious Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets.The SDGs include: ending poverty; ending hunger; encouraging good health and well-being; providing quality education; promoting gender equality; providing clean water and sanitation; promoting affordable and clean energy; providing decent work and economic growth; addressing industry, innovation and infrastructure; reducing inequalities; developing sustainable cities and communities; encouraging responsible consumption and production; taking action on climate change; promoting life below water; promoting life on land; working towards peace, justice and strong institutions; and creating partnerships to achieve SDG goals.However, recent political changes in Europe and elsewhere put this hope at risk.

NOIDA: The United Nations on Sunday selected Noida and Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh to participate in its Global Sustainable Cities 2025 initiative.

The twin-cities in Gautam Buddh Nagar district, adjoining the national capital, have been selected in the ""University City"" category as the only invitee from India, a senior UN official said.

Twenty-five cities from across the world have been selected in five categories by the UN Global Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) cities initiative, senior UN advisor and CEO, UN Global Sustainability Index Institute (UNGSII), Roland Schatz told reporters.

Schatz formally extended the invitation to Gautam Buddh Nagar District Magistrate Brajesh Narain Singh in the presence of Shubhro Sen, the principal advisor, India, SDG Initiative.

The SDGs are a collection of 17 global social and economic goals set by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015, including poverty reduction, elimination of hunger, greater gender equality and social justice, and environment-friendly practices to promote peace and prosperity.

""This is a proud moment for Noida and Greater Noida to be selected for this exciting global showcase. Now I will forward this invitation to the Uttar Pradesh government, which is very positive about development works,"" Singh said.

In the ""University City"" category, Noida-Greater Noida will be competing with elite university cities such as Cambridge, Palo Alto and Heidelberg.

The Organisation for International Economic Relations and UNGSII, in cooperation with the UN Office for Project Services and the UN Office for Partnerships are uniting 25 leading cities and five indigenous communities from around the world to prove that full SDG implementation by 2025 is possible when people come together and focus their efforts and resources on creating a sustainable future.

The ""Race to 2025"" will start in July in New York City when the programme is officially launched. The platform is formatted as a friendly competition with multiple activities, initiatives supported by SDG experts and industry partners with the common goal of illustrating that SDG implementation results in prosperity and quality-of-life for area citizens and business, while having no negative impact on the environment and reducing city operating expenses.","By Express News ServiceNOIDA: The United Nations on Sunday selected Noida and Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh to participate in its Global Sustainable Cities 2025 initiative.

Origin story: The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the ‘2030 Agenda,’ were adopted in 2015 unanimously by all 193 member states of the United Nations. It was launched at a ceremony following speeches from Pope Francis and Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai and performances from Shakira and Angelique Kidjo. The SDGs build on the eight Millennium Development Goals, which were in place from 2000 to 2015 and criticized for focusing only on developing countries. The SDGs apply to all countries.

The break-down: There are 17 SDGs with 169 targets therein, tracked by 232 indicators of progress. Goal 1 on ending poverty is the first and foremost, a thread that runs through every other goal. The 17 goals are:

1. No poverty

2. Zero hunger

3. Good health and well-being

4. Quality education

5. Gender equality

6. Clean water and sanitation

7. Affordable and clean energy

8. Decent work and economic growth

9. Industry, innovation and infrastructure

10. Reduced inequalities

11. Sustainable cities and communities

12. Responsible consumption and production

13. Climate action

14. Life below water

15. Life on land

16. Peace, justice and strong institutions

17. Partnerships for the goals

Among the other commitments: It is widely viewed that all other commitments tie into to the SDGs, explicitly or implicitly. Yet, while the SDGs are likely the most commonly referenced commitment, research has found that only 1 in 10 Europeans knows about the SDGs, and 1 in 100 across sample of 24 countries.

About the money: While the SDGs are indirectly supported through the funding of other commitments, the UN launched the Sustainable Development Goals Fund (SDG Fund) in 2014 to bring together donors and all types of institutions – from academia to business – to implement SDG programs. SDG Fund programs are currently operating in 23 countries.

Progress reports: The SDG Tracker was first launched in February 2018, followed by an updated version in June. It was developed by Oxford University’s Our World in Data program and is fed by regional, national and global data. A related chart also shows what data is and isn’t availability, to ensure the tracker’s full transparency.

Expert: Esteban Ortiz Ospina, Senior Researcher, Our World in Data

On successes so far

“SDG 1 aims to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030. Extreme poverty rates have fallen by more than half since 1990. While this is obviously a great achievement, it remains true that one-in-ten people globally still live in extreme poverty. The latest available estimates from the World Bank show that the decline in poverty rates has slowed – and this obviously raises concerns about achieving the goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.

“In general, the SDGs are very ambitious. For example, Target 5.5 is to ‘Ensure women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life.’ There has been an improvement in terms of the proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments; but there is still a long way to go to ensure full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership.

“Something similar happens with other goals where we have seen some progress. Consider for example indicator 4.5.1, which deals with disparities in educational access. We have seen a reduction in gender gaps in enrolment rates. But gaps along other dimensions remain significant.”

On challenges

“In terms of major challenges, the world is failing most miserably in the environmental targets. The global evidence shows that many key environmental indicators are stagnant or in many cases actually regressing. Global carbon dioxide emissions are still increasing. Global forest area continues its decline. Overexploitation of fish stocks remains high and may still be increasing. And the Red List Index concludes that ‘a substantial proportion of species in all taxonomic groups examined to date are declining overall in population and distribution.’ ”","Goal 1 on ending poverty is the first and foremost, a thread that runs through every other goal.

A new geography of power is emerging, made up of global city networks. All in all, the attractiveness of cities is based on the hope of higher purchasing power through greater opportunities, for a better quality of life. Megacities have the potential to effectively fight against poverty and enhance living conditions for a large proportion of the population – if they are managed correctly and make the most of their advantages. Nonetheless, there is a drastic need for new urban models to tackle the associated social, economic, and environmental pressures in a sustainable way.

Cities are the new engines of growth in the global economy, responsible for 80% of global GDP. It is no longer just countries that compete, but cities as well. Like there is great power competition, so will the world’s great cities increasingly compete. Every city will have to gain a competitive edge to differentiate itself from the rest. Flexible and agile cities that can diversify their resources and offer economic, social, and cultural opportunities to their citizens will not only survive but thrive. The cities that are best equipped to produce innovative, inclusive, and ethical solutions in the face of multiplying risks and threats will emerge as leaders. A clear picture emerges: cities will compete and collaborate globally as interdependent entities and will drive the future.

Speaking about megacities, let’s look for example at Mumbai, which is the financial capital of India and the second-most populated city in the world. It is not only the subcontinent’s city with the highest GDP but also ranks among the world’s top ten trade centers. The city contributes 25% of industrial output and 70% of capital transactions to India’s economy. Important financial organizations such as the Reserve Bank of India and the National Stock Exchange of India are in Mumbai. It houses the headquarters of various multinational companies and has thus become an influential commercial and entertainment center of India. It would be foolish to ignore such cities in tomorrow’s global economy.

City diplomacy could be considered a form of decentralization of international relations management, choosing cities as the key actors. In many cases, the representatives of cities involved in city diplomacy will be the mayors, given that they are often responsible for the international relations of their communities. On behalf of their cities, these key actors can engage in relations with other actors on the international stage through two-sided or multiple-sided interactions. There is a lot of room for city diplomacy to grow. It can be driven by image or investment interests, development and strategic communications complete each other.

A city relationship is formally created when the mayors or highest elected or designated leaders from two communities sign a memorandum of understanding establishing the partnership. Nevertheless, this is usually the result of a long process that involves the local city organizations along with the municipalities and other local institutions. It takes a lot of work to get to this stage, so, as in many other cases, sustained effort and clear vision pay off. So, time to shape up the in house mayoral or county staff and consolidate a stellar local talent team of global reach.

Competition matters but so does cooperation. Collaborating with neighboring or nearby cities enables cities to plan and implement actions to address emissions from energy infrastructure, public transport, food systems, waste management, and other services that often operate across municipal borders and to address cross-border climate risks. It also helps cities overcome regional or national climate-policy barriers, share the cost of staff and equipment, and secure better access to data, funding, and technical assistance – all of which can motivate other cities in the area to participate as well.

Image and Investment demand a third I in the 2020s: Innovation. The fastest way to connect cities and counties is using technology. The technological progress of recent decades has had not only a powerful but also a transformative influence on urban life. As technology progresses and becomes more affordable, the functionality and sustainability of urban practices undergo significant advancements as well. At the same time, increased access to information consolidates the role of knowledge as a powerful engine of economic growth. This enables the development of knowledge-based and connected societies. Under these continuously evolving conditions, many concepts about the organization and management of the new technological capabilities have become popular, including the smart city.

To establish an approach for the ideal future of an urban settlement that harnesses technology should be part of the integrated processes that connect cities at a regional level. In the best-case scenario, a city that aspires to become „smart‟ has an integrated, forward-looking plan that includes a vision and a methodology focused on benefiting from digital technologies to improve urban functions and develop knowledge ecosystems. Like any strategy, the plans for smart cities must be adapted to the needs, priorities, and constraints of their circumstances.

Funding for smart city projects is still carved out of overall city or department budgets, either through existing spending (e.g., IT, lighting contracts) or designated ‘smart city’ spending, which is typically relatively small. It is therefore difficult to identify the exact amount local authorities allocate to such projects. Even though a lot of the investment for smart city projects comes from the general city budget, cities have found it most beneficial to have earmarked funds for innovation initiatives. At the moment, what is clear is that the funding and budgeting has to match the ambitions of big cities and transform the smart city objective into reality.

National governments are also encouraging cities to increase funding by boosting the participation of the private sector in delivering smart city projects. Businesses’ experience with participating in the delivery of smart city projects has been dominated by pilot projects often utilizing public sector grant funding. There is room for much more. Local authorities need to make more strides towards scaling pilot projects and procuring large-scale solutions. The city must be able to articulate clearly the challenges it faces and develop a more open way for the market to respond. The sky is the limit, if the game is played well. An innovative image and investment diplomacy operation is an important way forward.","Nevertheless, this is usually the result of a long process that involves the local city organizations along with the municipalities and other local institutions.

The study of Arcadis Design and Consultancy, which had three sub-indices — people, planet and profit — is a “broad measure of sustainability, encompassing the social, environmental, and economic health of cities.”

Manila ranked 93rd in the people sub-index which factors in social mobility, quality and opportunity of life such as good health, education, public transport, work-life balance, crime and cultural offerings.

Edinburgh in Scotland topped the said sub-index because of its low crime rate, highly educated workforce and reasonably equally distributed income.

It was followed by smaller cities from Europe, developed cities in Asia and San Francisco in the United States.

Meanwhile, the bottom three are found in Africa, the report said.





In the study’s planet pillar, which accounted for green space and pollution, Manila was ranked 91st.

Stockholm in Sweden topped the planet sub-index because of “sustainable infrastructure, low emissions and good air quality.”

Manila was second to the last in the profit sub-index, which assesses the business environment and economic performance of the city.

The Europe-dominated ranking was led by London followed by Stockholm, Sweden and Edinburgh, Scotland.

Hong Kong (4th), Singapore (9th) and Seoul (13th) were on the Top 15 overall index rankings.

The report said that “14 [cities] in the bottom quartile, are facing significant challenges across all pillars.”

Residents in these cities reported discontentment because of “the disruption of tight-knit networks and communities when development finally occurs.”

“These factors are significant barriers to consistent sustainable development in cities,” the report said.

However, despite its low ranking, Manila was categorized as an “evolutionary city” in which opportunities to improve its sustainability are present.

“Evolutionary cities,” are described as “very diverse group that includes rapidly growing cities in emerging markets as well as cities in developed economies that are changing rapidly in response to new circumstances.”

The report said as risks of heavy damage from powerful typhoons continue to increase in the Asian region, the Philippine government should closely look at Manila’s sustainability and livability and enhance its transportation network and resiliency against natural disasters.

The report said cities in the bottom of the index need to focus on well-planned long-term resilience.

Ross McKenzie, country head of Arcadis Philippines, posted optimism on Manila’s capability to develop solutions that are resilient to future risks while remaining cost effective.

“With much of the progress being supported and driven by the private sector, city policy makers will play a key role by helping create long-term sustainable policies and embrace international best practice and lessons learnt,” McKenzie pointed out.

“Local businesses will need to adapt to manage the mobility and resiliency challenges in the next few years while development continues,” he added.

While incorporating resilience into infrastructure projects pushes costs up, this should be seen as an investment in the future, according to the report.","MANILA, the Philippines’ capital, was adjudged one of the least sustainable cities, having been ranked 95th out of the 100 cities included in the 2018 Sustainable Cities Index.

295,https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/blog/2018/innovative-finance-for-Maldives-sustainable-development.html,"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",UNDP,Innovative finance for the Maldives’ sustainable development,"The Maldives, which comprises 1,190 small islands in total, is a typical example of the ‘island paradox’ with multi-dimensional development challenges. On the one hand, the country has achieved relative prosperity; Gross National Income (GNI) increased by over 200% between 1990-2015, and human development indicators such as life expectancy at birth improved by 15.6 years. On the other hand, the country grapples with challenging macro-economic fundamentals: a high deficit (19.6% of GDP, 2016), high public debt levels (65.7% of GDP, 2016), a narrow economic and tax base, weak public financial management systems, vulnerability to external shocks due to a high dependence on fisheries and tourism sector (combined at over 30% of GDP), and increased environmental vulnerability due to climate change. The country’s graduation to middle-income status in 2011 has also resulted in a decline of development aid, of around 60% over a 10-year period since 2006.

In this context, how can the Maldives source the finance it needs to meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)? And what opportunities are offered by new innovative financing models?

UNDP’s work in the Maldives focuses on addressing democratic governance, gender and climate change challenges. The work also includes assisting the government in improving its access to finance through initiatives such as Tax Inspectors Without Borders which was recently launched in the country and helps tax administrations build their tax audit capacities. This, in turn, helps to mobilize domestic public resources. The recently elected new government's strong commitment to the SDGs will strengthen these efforts.

What can be done? One, as a Muslim country, Islamic financing instruments (Shariah law compliant financial products) like ‘Green Sukuk,’ have significant potential in the Maldives. Earlier this year, Indonesia launched the first sovereign ‘Green Sukuk’, which was oversubscribed, and indicative of the growing market demand for sustainable and responsible investments. Zakat funds (a form of philanthropy where followers of Islam are encouraged to donate at least 2.5% of their accumulated wealth) are another pool of resources that could be strategically tapped into. In May 2018, the Maldives began accepting Zakat proceeds, to support health and livelihoods programmes, however, much remains to be done.

Two, the country could seek to leverage additional finance from the private sector through blended finance (combining public and private investment) and impact investment (investing to generate impact alongside a financial return) in the major sectors of sustainable tourism and fisheries, as well as agriculture and renewable energy. The Maldives could tap into assistance from initiatives such as the SIDS-DOCK sustainable energy initiative for example, that help small island developing states to connect with the global market for finance to transform their national energy sectors into a catalyst for sustainable economic development. Additionally, UNDP is developing several social impact bonds worldwide, that bear potential for replication.

Three, the ‘Blue Economy’ is gaining momentum. The concept refers to a development approach in which ocean resources are harnessed for economic growth while preserving ocean and coastal ecosystem health. It includes economic activities such as marine renewable energy, sustainable fisheries, better management of ocean waste and ocean-related eco-tourism. To finance blue economy investments, new finance models can be explored, such as blue bonds (tapping into capital markets to fund ocean-related environmental projects). Other innovative ‘blue’ financing instruments include blue insurance, to co-finance and discount premia if marine economy protection measures are taken.

There are examples to learn from. Grenada is the first country to develop a vision for ‘Blue Growth’ and to articulate a national ‘Masterplan’ for blue economic development. The Seychelles also champion the blue economy model: It recently announced the issuance of a 10-year blue bond to finance fisheries projects, making it the world’s first country to utilize capital markets for funding the sustainable use of marine resources. Best practices are shared through international events, such as the high-level global conference on Sustainable Blue Economy (26-28 November 2018 in Nairobi, Kenya) organized by the Governments of Canada, Japan and Kenya.

Additionally, the government needs to create an environment that better facilitates sustainable investment such as, strengthening institutions, improving transparency and good governance, improving the ease-of-doing-business, and building a strong policy framework for managing coastal and ocean resources, amongst others.

UNDP as a trusted development partner is assisting the Maldives on a wide portfolio of activities across climate change and governance, through technical expertise, policy advice, advocacy, knowledge sharing, and dialogue. However, it is crucial for the country to explore new innovative financing mechanisms to be able to achieve its development aspirations. As a small island developing state, the country needs to be supported to build capacities in these new financing models and approaches, to enable them to pull in new resources and build new partnerships for sustainable development.","In this context, how can the Maldives source the finance it needs to meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?
The Maldives could tap into assistance from initiatives such as the SIDS-DOCK sustainable energy initiative for example, that help small island developing states to connect with the global market for finance to transform their national energy sectors into a catalyst for sustainable economic development.
To finance blue economy investments, new finance models can be explored, such as blue bonds (tapping into capital markets to fund ocean-related environmental projects).
Other innovative ‘blue’ financing instruments include blue insurance, to co-finance and discount premia if marine economy protection measures are taken.
Grenada is the first country to develop a vision for ‘Blue Growth’ and to articulate a national ‘Masterplan’ for blue economic development."

But is it enough? If you look out past the walls of our corporate gardens, it’s a different story. It’s a hot mess out there, with rising temperatures, social and political instability, fraying ecosystems and paralyzed governments. When it comes to sustainability, companies may be doing better, but the world is falling further behind.

The truth is that creating a sustainable society on a full planet is the hardest problem humans have ever faced, and in order to succeed, the world needs more from corporations than keeping their own doorsteps clean. It needs real creativity, problem-solving skills, and an ability to scale. It needs real leaders who can maximize their contribution to solutions and share those solutions with others. To be sure, it’s a very tall and challenging order, but it’s not impossible. Here are a few companies showing us the way.

Google

Google is a leader when it comes to establishing an environmental footprint, but it also looks for opportunities to use its talents and technologies to advance sustainable solutions for others. Google created Global Fishing Watch, which uses machine learning to transform fishery management by mapping global fishing activity. The company also recently launched the Environmental Insights Explorer, an online tool that makes it easier for cities to access climate-relevant data to set local policies and measure progress. And those ubiquitous Google Street View cars? They now collect neighborhood-level data on local air quality around the world.

Google’s approach is based on the recognition that it can’t go it alone.

“Global change requires a global response,” notes Kate Brandt, Google’s Sustainability Officer. “As we make progress at Google on our own sustainability goals, we share what we’ve learned — but we need to do more to empower more businesses, governments and policymakers to take action toward building a cleaner future.”

Nike

Nike was one of the first brands to recognize that there’s no corporate wall when it comes to sustainability. The company spent seven years developing a Sustainable Materials Index to guide its designers, and then decided to share the whole thing with the rest of the industry. It even developed a free app called Making, to make it easy for any designer to choose more sustainable materials. In the end, Nike decided that creating leverage on sustainability was more important than gaining leverage over competitors.

“It’s all part of a single strategy to change the palette of the world’s materials,” said Hannah Jones, Nike’s VP of Sustainable Business and Innovation. “If we could put information out there and empower our design community to make better choices, it would be an important lever we could pull.”

VMware

Sometimes the biggest impact you can have is helping your customers be more sustainable. VMware is a virtualization and cloud computing software provider that dramatically increases the efficiency of servers. The company has an extensive sustainability program, but its primary impact on the world is what its products enable customers to do. Customers using VMware have reduced their carbon output by 340 million metric tons — the equivalent of 43 percent of US households.

OK, so your company’s not a Google, a Nike or a VMware. That doesn’t prevent you from asking a question posed by Martin Luther King, Jr. in relation to your sustainability strategy: “Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, ‘What are you doing for others?’”

By all means, keep working toward carbon neutrality and zero waste and LEED-certified buildings. But also look around and see if you can find ways to bring others along with you — then, maybe we’ll all get there a bit sooner.","When it comes to sustainability, companies may be doing better, but the world is falling further behind.

A new geography of power is emerging, made up of global city networks. All in all, the attractiveness of cities is based on the hope of higher purchasing power through greater opportunities, for a better quality of life. Megacities have the potential to effectively fight against poverty and enhance living conditions for a large proportion of the population – if they are managed correctly and make the most of their advantages. Nonetheless, there is a drastic need for new urban models to tackle the associated social, economic, and environmental pressures in a sustainable way.

Cities are the new engines of growth in the global economy, responsible for 80% of global GDP. It is no longer just countries that compete, but cities as well. Like there is great power competition, so will the world’s great cities increasingly compete. Every city will have to gain a competitive edge to differentiate itself from the rest. Flexible and agile cities that can diversify their resources and offer economic, social, and cultural opportunities to their citizens will not only survive but thrive. The cities that are best equipped to produce innovative, inclusive, and ethical solutions in the face of multiplying risks and threats will emerge as leaders. A clear picture emerges: cities will compete and collaborate globally as interdependent entities and will drive the future.

Speaking about megacities, let’s look for example at Mumbai, which is the financial capital of India and the second-most populated city in the world. It is not only the subcontinent’s city with the highest GDP but also ranks among the world’s top ten trade centers. The city contributes 25% of industrial output and 70% of capital transactions to India’s economy. Important financial organizations such as the Reserve Bank of India and the National Stock Exchange of India are in Mumbai. It houses the headquarters of various multinational companies and has thus become an influential commercial and entertainment center of India. It would be foolish to ignore such cities in tomorrow’s global economy.

City diplomacy could be considered a form of decentralization of international relations management, choosing cities as the key actors. In many cases, the representatives of cities involved in city diplomacy will be the mayors, given that they are often responsible for the international relations of their communities. On behalf of their cities, these key actors can engage in relations with other actors on the international stage through two-sided or multiple-sided interactions. There is a lot of room for city diplomacy to grow. It can be driven by image or investment interests, development and strategic communications complete each other.

A city relationship is formally created when the mayors or highest elected or designated leaders from two communities sign a memorandum of understanding establishing the partnership. Nevertheless, this is usually the result of a long process that involves the local city organizations along with the municipalities and other local institutions. It takes a lot of work to get to this stage, so, as in many other cases, sustained effort and clear vision pay off. So, time to shape up the in house mayoral or county staff and consolidate a stellar local talent team of global reach.

Competition matters but so does cooperation. Collaborating with neighboring or nearby cities enables cities to plan and implement actions to address emissions from energy infrastructure, public transport, food systems, waste management, and other services that often operate across municipal borders and to address cross-border climate risks. It also helps cities overcome regional or national climate-policy barriers, share the cost of staff and equipment, and secure better access to data, funding, and technical assistance – all of which can motivate other cities in the area to participate as well.

Image and Investment demand a third I in the 2020s: Innovation. The fastest way to connect cities and counties is using technology. The technological progress of recent decades has had not only a powerful but also a transformative influence on urban life. As technology progresses and becomes more affordable, the functionality and sustainability of urban practices undergo significant advancements as well. At the same time, increased access to information consolidates the role of knowledge as a powerful engine of economic growth. This enables the development of knowledge-based and connected societies. Under these continuously evolving conditions, many concepts about the organization and management of the new technological capabilities have become popular, including the smart city.

To establish an approach for the ideal future of an urban settlement that harnesses technology should be part of the integrated processes that connect cities at a regional level. In the best-case scenario, a city that aspires to become „smart‟ has an integrated, forward-looking plan that includes a vision and a methodology focused on benefiting from digital technologies to improve urban functions and develop knowledge ecosystems. Like any strategy, the plans for smart cities must be adapted to the needs, priorities, and constraints of their circumstances.

Funding for smart city projects is still carved out of overall city or department budgets, either through existing spending (e.g., IT, lighting contracts) or designated ‘smart city’ spending, which is typically relatively small. It is therefore difficult to identify the exact amount local authorities allocate to such projects. Even though a lot of the investment for smart city projects comes from the general city budget, cities have found it most beneficial to have earmarked funds for innovation initiatives. At the moment, what is clear is that the funding and budgeting has to match the ambitions of big cities and transform the smart city objective into reality.

National governments are also encouraging cities to increase funding by boosting the participation of the private sector in delivering smart city projects. Businesses’ experience with participating in the delivery of smart city projects has been dominated by pilot projects often utilizing public sector grant funding. There is room for much more. Local authorities need to make more strides towards scaling pilot projects and procuring large-scale solutions. The city must be able to articulate clearly the challenges it faces and develop a more open way for the market to respond. The sky is the limit, if the game is played well. An innovative image and investment diplomacy operation is an important way forward.","A new geography of power is emerging, made up of global city networks.

Over 1,360 participants representing 143 of the 170 Parties to the Convention, as well as the International Organization Partners (IOPs) of the Ramsar Convention, UN agencies, intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) attended the meeting, which took place from 22-29 October 2018, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE).

The Global Wetland Outlook was released during COP13, and helped frame the discussions. In her opening statement, Ramsar Secretary General Martha Rojas Urrego expressed concern that wetlands are being lost three times faster than forests, and said the Global Wetland Outlook is a “distress signal and a wake-up call.”

The Global Wetland Outlook is a “distress signal and a wake-up call.”

The Earth Negotiations Bulletin (ENB) summary of COP13 reports that participants repeatedly highlighted the urgency of addressing the “immense pressures” that wetlands face. With this in mind, COP13 focused on “finding ways to increase the Convention’s reach, effectiveness, and efficiency by addressing its internal structure, its outward activities, and ways to mainstream wetland conservation and wise use in other domains.” The meeting concluded with “resolutions addressing the Convention’s governance, and its implementation, visibility, and synergies” with other multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) and providing clear links with climate change and the SDGs.

Topics addressed in the 25 resolutions adopted by the closing gavel included: gender; peatlands; blue carbon ecosystems; sustainable urbanization; agriculture; intertidal wetlands; wetlands in West Asia; and Arctic and sub-Arctic wetlands.

On the closing day of Ramsar COP13, Youth Engaged in Wetlands called on Parties and all stakeholders to empower youth to actively participate in wetland issues and proposed that the theme for COP14 be: ‘Youth in Wetlands.’ COP13 President Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi highlighted that UAE announced two new conservation areas during COP13, one of which will be submitted as a Ramsar Site.

299,https://sustainablebrands.com/read/leadership/how-lyft-drives-growth-through-purpose,"Fri, 16 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Sustainable Brands,How Lyft Drives Growth Through Purpose,"Brands that position themselves as purpose-driven activists dedicated to using profits to further their mission carve out a competitive advantage amongst today’s conscious consumers. Lyft is an excellent example of a company distinguishing itself by building a brand around values, as well as quality.

The rideshare company is the second-largest in the sector, controlling over one-third of US market share, with Uber driving the majority. While there is tough competition, Lyft stands out with its purpose, mission and activism, which recently lead the company to celebrate 1 billion rides.

Here’s how Lyft leads with purpose:

Mission-based values: Unlike Uber, which positions itself as a black car service, Lyft paved the road for a peer-to-peer ride-hailing experience. In the words of Melissa Waters, Lyft’s VP of Marketing, Lyft’s mission is to “improve people's lives through the world's best transportation. Our vision was to reinvent cities around people, not cars.” Community building: Lyft works to build an employee culture that fosters human connection and a feel-good experience. Lyft instills three values in the driver onboarding process: “Be yourself, uplift others and make it happen,” Waters explained. In turn, Lyft has earned the reputation as being more personable and community-oriented than its competitors. Environmental awareness: Lyft is also focusing on building a more environmentally and socially responsible business — in April, it announced it would now offset the carbon emissions from all rides globally; and in September, it did one better when it shared that it had purchased enough carbon offsets to neutralize the remainder of its emissions, making Lyft a fully carbon-neutral company and committed to powering its entire operations with renewable energy. While the lion’s share of revenue comes from automobiles, Lyft is positioning itself to expand to scooters, bicycles and other more environmentally friendly modes of transportation. The ridesharing company is also exploring the driverless car space. Social activism: From a social impact perspective, Lyft has built consumer goodwill by leading with consistent brand activism. In response to the Trump administration’s travel ban and Uber refusing to participate in a related strike at JFK Airport, Lyft donated $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union. Shortly after, Lyft downloads exceeded Uber’s for the first time on the Apple App Store.

Lyft exhibits its socially responsible business ethos with a roundup feature, which enables riders to donate to charity on each ride. What’s more, the company implemented the Ride Safe program to ensure riders get home safely after a night of drinking. Lyft also participates in relief rides for events such as March for Our Lives, to empower drivers and passengers to take a stand for what they believe in. Ultimately, Lyft’s dedication to operating an environmentally and socially responsible business while cultivating human-to-human connections has set the brand on a road to success.

The Road Ahead

It took Lyft 6 years to reach 1 billion rides, which was roughly the same for Uber. That said, it took Uber just 6 months longer to reach 2 billion rides and one year to hit 5 billion. Unlike Uber, which operates around the world, Lyft only offers rides in the United States and Canada. Both companies saw a slump in the number of rides and new riders in summer 2018. It follows that Lyft faces challenges in terms of revenue growth and may have to expand its business in innovative ways that open new markets. In response, the second-largest rideshare app has plans to go public in 2019, which will open up more capital and could lead to new growth opportunities.

Lyft has done an excellent job building its brand around purpose. On the other hand, steep competition and financial goals present challenges for the brand. Lyft’s competitive advantage stems from its purposeful brand story. If it holds true to its socially responsible foundation, increases profitability and expands transparency with drivers, that brand story will be the difference between who leads the future of ridesharing in our cities.","Lyft is an excellent example of a company distinguishing itself by building a brand around values, as well as quality.

300,https://sustainablebrands.com/read/waste-not/soap-recycling-creating-win-win-win-for-hotels-women-developing-communities,"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Sustainable Brands,"Soap Recycling Creating Win-Win-Win for Hotels, Women, Developing Communities","It was 2014 and social entrepreneur Samir Lakhani was working on sustainable aquaculture projects in the villages of Northern Cambodia. Watching a mother wash and bathe her new baby using laundry powder rather than soap is a vision that has stayed with him to this day.

It was also the inspiration for his next business venture.

“I noticed that nobody seemed in good overall health — whether it was an infection that wouldn’t go away or a child with diarrhea,” he told Sustainable Brands in a recent interview.

Asking around the village, he encountered many other families who could only afford laundry powder and many more who had no soap at all, saying it was too expensive.

On returning to his hotel one evening, Lakhani noticed the housekeeper had replaced a bar of soap he had barely used — and he realized that if he could begin saving hotel soap, he could start saving lives.

With that, Eco-Soap Bank was born; today, it has grown to a thriving non-profit operating throughout 10 countries and employing more than 150 women. They collect leftover hotel soap, recycle it, sterilise it and then distribute it into their villages for everyone to access.

Clinics, schools and individuals that could not previously afford soap can now get it from the organization at half the market rate. And since there is no prevailing culture of handwashing in many of the communities Lakhani and his team serve, every distributed bar of soap is accompanied by hygiene education to ensure beneficiaries understand how proper hygiene can prevent disease and helps families save money on healthcare.

It is a model that is “perfectly scalable,” according to Lakhani, requiring only a robust tourism industry in a single area and a local need for healthier hygiene practices: “We franchise our soap-recycling process to organizations, allowing us to scale efficiently and to rescue as much soap as quickly as we can.”

In the last three years the company, headquartered in the US, has provided soap to more than 730,000 people, with over 1 million positively impacted by end of 2018. Last year, more than 1,900 schools were able to get soap at an affordable price, too.

There is also a specific focus on supporting women — providing fair wages to women that commonly struggle to find a reliable source of income. As well as taking on roles as soap recyclers and hygiene educators, the company also helps women in remote areas start their own Eco-Soap-selling micro-enterprises, as a way of lifting themselves out of poverty.

“We employ women of various backgrounds, including widows, the disabled and HIV-positive individuals, where stigma, gender bias and domestic pressures prevent them from being able to lift their families out of poverty,” says Lakhani, whose parents came from poverty in East Africa. “As well as jobs, we provide free daily English and vocational classes to our 147 women for the day they wish to transition to the traditional economy and secure gainful employment.”

In Cambodia, one hygiene ambassador called Souey has been able to turn her life around with the company’s help. Her family had been living on the same land for generations when her two children fell sick with dengue fever.

“Fortunately, they recovered in a nearby hospital. But the medical bill was so high, Souey was faced with the impossible decision of whether to sell her land — her legacy — and lose everything. But then she heard about our hygiene ambassadors program,” Lakhani says.

Souey immediately enrolled and began travelling through villages selling soap. Villagers listened to her advocate for better hygiene and began buying her soap, one bar at a time. In six weeks, Soeuy had sold more than 3,000 Eco-Soap bars and earned enough to pay off her debts and save her home.

Of course, the enterprise is also supporting the hotel industry get to grips with its waste problem. Recycling soap is a carbon net-positive process, preventing the release of carbon dioxide and offering hotels a smart solution to their soap-waste problem. Currently, the 960 hotels that have partnered with Eco-Soap Bank to donate their soap are reducing their waste by almost 90,000 pounds a year.

“Together, this partnership saves lives,” Lakhani asserts. “We’re able to efficiently recycle soap, and in some instances, hotels buy it back for cheaper than other commercial products. It's a win-win-win situation between the environment, hotels and the people we serve.”","On returning to his hotel one evening, Lakhani noticed the housekeeper had replaced a bar of soap he had barely used — and he realized that if he could begin saving hotel soap, he could start saving lives.

The Greenhouse Initiative is a startup incubator co-created by SAMBAZON (“Sustainable Management of the Brazilian Amazon”) and The Ecology Center as a way to invest in the next generation of social entrepreneurs on college campuses and to foster purposeful business ideas working to create a sustainable future. Now through December 9, college students nationwide are encouraged to submit a short video on any sustainability initiative, new or existing, that they would like to implement or evolve on their college campus.

“We are excited to bring you The Greenhouse Initiative for a second year and open this incredible opportunity up to college students around the United States,” said Ryan Black, CEO + co-founder of SAMBAZON. “At SAMBAZON, we believe young social entrepreneurs have the power to change the world; and through The Greenhouse Initiative, we aim to inspire and encourage our future generation to act in a meaningful way. The best way to predict the future is to create it.”

In its inaugural year, The Greenhouse Initiative put out a call to student-led organizations working to create change at select universities where SAMBAZON products are served. The four winners included a vermicomposting (aka worm composting) project at the University of Riverside’s community garden, an Auburn University food recovery and distribution program that redistributes unserved dining hall food to local organizations fighting food insecurity, a Cal Poly San Luis Obispo Veggie Box Subscription program that increases access to local and ethically sourced food, and an organization at the University of Southern California that aims to solve gender inequality as a solution to global warming and other pressing issues.

This year, the initiative has expanded nationally so that any college student in the United States may enter. Four enterprising students or student groups will be chosen to receive a $4,000 stipend from SAMBAZON and a 2019 spring semester mentorship from The Ecology Center to scale their program or put it into action. The winners will also receive a trip to participate in the Sustainable Brands 2019 Detroit conference in June.

302,https://www.triplepundit.com/story/2018/colombia-embraces-sustainable-tourism/55376,"Sun, 25 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Triple Pundit,Colombia Embraces Sustainable Tourism,"It’s rich in biodiversity, containing over 1,500 species of orchids that can’t be found anywhere else on the planet – and while we’re discussing nature, this country, almost twice as large as France, also hosts over 1,900 species of birds. This South American country’s biodiversity in part can be explained by its varied landscapes, from its vast Amazonian rainforests to small deserts and remote Caribbean islands.

That biodiversity is one reason why travelers are increasingly finding their way to Colombia, whether they seek to trek up one of the few glaciers in a tropical zone, visit the lush Pacific coast or explore the country’s mountainous Zona Cafetera.

And what these 3 million annual visitors (more than triple the amount of travelers from a decade ago) are discovering is a country home to 50 million people that by and large is very welcoming to visitors. That is, Colombians are especially gracious to guests if they can see the country for what it is and what it could become in the coming years – and not focus on the country’s past struggles. After all, Pablo Escobar has been dead for a quarter of a century, and while many Colombians have doubts about the country’s peace process, this is a country moving forward. Jokes about Escobar or the country’s illegal drug trade will earn an eye-roll at the very least or at most, a burst of exasperation. “Let’s not forget that Bolivia and Peru are doing very well with the drug trade, yet don’t have the reputation,” grumbled one guesthouse employee during my recent trip to Colombia.

“Now, let’s talk about this trek you’re going to do tomorrow,” said the same employee a few seconds later, as she was eager to pivot and explain what Colombia offers its guests who decide to visit the country. Colombia's security, not to mention its relative economic stability when compared to several of its neighbors, are among the reason why the nation's hospitality sector is enjoying robust growth. Medellín, Colombia’s second largest city, had only five hostels a little over a decade ago. Now it is home to a few hundred. And international chains, such as Hilton, are also bullish on Colombia’s growth potential.

While Colombia’s government certainly welcomes this economic boost, the country’s commerce, industry and tourism says it is determined to see that this increase in tourism is sustainable. Community-based tourism is one important part of this plan; earlier this year, the government added new towns to a list of what it describes as official “sustainable tourism destinations.” These communities have gained certifications verifying that their tourism infrastructures are not only environmentally and socially responsible, but are also generating wealth and opportunities for all citizens who want to participate in the local tourism sector.

And therein lies another reason why travel across Colombia can be a sustainable, responsible and local experience – while it is clear more gringos are traveling across the Atlantic and Caribbean to experience Colombia, visiting towns and cities like Salento, Filandia, Guatapé and Cartagena will likely be surrounded by hordes of tourists – the majority of which are Colombian. After all, the country’s natural, cultural and architectural riches have hardly been a secret to its own citizens.

More travel agencies have realized the potential that Colombia promises visitors and offer trips that promise a singular travel experience while ensuring that local culture is respected and preserved.

Medellín-based and British-run Amakuna, for example, plans itineraries that promise authentic experiences with local guides and stays at locally-run accommodations. Out in Colombia Travel, led by an American expat, organizes customized tours tailored for the LGBTQ community.

Leading international tour operators have been investing in Colombia’s potential. Canada-based G Adventures partners with a social enterprise to offer a Lost City Trek tour that takes visitors to Tayrona National Park in the northeastern section of the country. For the past three years, G Adventures and its nonprofit partner, the Planeterra Foundation, have worked with the indigenous Wiwa people to help visitors explore the Ciudad Perdida and experience what was once a completely isolated way of life. Projects included funding the construction of a community dining and handicraft sales center in the remote village of Gotsezhi, which employs some of Wiwa women who sell food and artisan crafts to travelers. “The goal of the project is sustainable employment and responsible development, which honor the Wiwa people’s ancient, sacred culture while also bringing income to their remote community and creating jobs for their young people,” said a G Adventures spokesperson in an email to TriplePundit.

In the next few weeks, we’ll take a closer look at how Colombia is becoming a focal point for travelers who are focused on more responsible travel – including the role coffee has in promoting ecotourism, a visit to one of the leading global “smart cities” and how one of the country’s leading brands is undergoing a sustainable makeover.

More travel agencies have realized the potential that Colombia promises visitors and offer trips that promise a singular travel experience while ensuring that local culture is respected and preserved.

modern developed cities are up to 3 degrees hotter than rural areas because the green space is replaced by hard surfaces like roads which cannot absorb the solar energy — this is called the ‘heat island effect’. tony owen partners’ scheme tackles the problem by using the green roofs and giving 90% of the land surface over to parks, paddocks, and agriculture to supply 30% of the needs of the residents.

The distinctive kicks might just be the world’s most sustainable, according to CNN Business.

Sébastien Kopp and François-Ghislain Morillion started Veja in 2004. Their goal is to make sneakers from the most ecological materials and ethical suppliers possible, they told CNN Business journalist Andrea Lo. Paris-based Veja, Portuguese for “look,” sources materials from Brazil and manufactures sneakers at a plant in the country.

“This product is a symbol for our generation,” the co-founders say on their site. “It’s also a product that crystallizes the major issues of globalization through its production, dissemination, and usage.”

The duo call Veja their project, with one foot in design and the other in social responsibility. This means protecting the Amazon, upcycling materials, and being transparent about everything from chemical testing to wages.

“A lot of our clients are discovering what is behind Veja after they buy one or two pairs,” Kopp told Lo. He added that clients usually come back for more after learning the brand’s story. The sneakers, which retail from $95 to $195, have been donned by celebrities like Meghan Markle.

Raw Materials

The co-founders say purchase organic cotton directly from farmer associations in Brazil and Peru at a pre-set price, all while respecting fair trade principles.

Each sneaker sole is made from 30 – 40% natural rubber. “We buy rubber in the Amazon forest, directly from seringueiro communities,” the company’s leaders say. Since 2004, Veja has purchased 130 tons of wild rubber, preserving 120,000 hectares of the Amazon.

One Veja design out of four is 100% vegan. However, the leather used comes from southern Brazil. “We work with a tannery that was audited and certified Gold by the Leather Working Group,” according to the company. They also perform random checks throughout the year to monitor the level of chrome, making sure it meets REACH standards.

Upcycling

For the last five years, Veja has used “fish leather” from tilapia in their shoes. Usually discarded by freshwater fish farms, the skin gets upcycled through a handcrafted process involving vegetable dyeing.

Other examples of upcycling include B-Mesh fabric made entirely from recycled PET plastic and J-Mesh fabric from a combination of jute, recycled cotton, and recycled PET. On average, it takes three plastic bottles to make one pair of sneakers.

Transparency

“Every year, we perform a social audit to make sure our factories respect our values and meet our criteria, and to identify the areas where we could still improve and do better,” the co-founders say. They map their production and publish their fair trade documents, organic labeling certificates, and results of chemical tests carried out on the sneakers.

Kopp and Morillion are transparent about their limitations, too. For example, their shoelaces aren’t made from organic cotton and the eyelets don’t contain nickel, but come from metal the company didn’t source themselves. The two founders are also the sole shareholders because they believe that bringing in outside investors could undermine Veja’s integrity.

Although it costs five to seven times more for Veja to make sneakers than it does other companies, they’ve eschewed advertising, which allows them to stay competitive on retail price.

“We take longer to design our shoes than other big brands,” the co-founders say of their project. “We love designing sneakers that we’ll be proud to wear in 10 years.”","Paris-based Veja, Portuguese for “look,” sources materials from Brazil and manufactures sneakers at a plant in the country.

305,https://www.eco-business.com/opinion/putting-people-at-the-heart-of-sustainable-development/,"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Eco-Business,Putting people at the heart of sustainable development,"Ministers and senior policymakers across Asia and the Pacific are gathered in Bangkok this week to focus on population dynamics at a crucial time for the region. Their goal: to keep people and rights at the heart of the region’s push for sustainable development. They will be considering how successful we have been in balancing economic growth with social imperatives, underpinned by rights and choices for all as enshrined in the landmark Programme of Action stemming from the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development, or ICPD.

In the Programme of Action, diverse views on population, gender equality, sexual and reproductive health, and sustainable development merged into a remarkable global consensus that placed individual dignity and human rights at the heart of development.

Truly revolutionary at the time, ICPD remains all the more urgent and relevant a quarter-century later, in this era of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with its Sustainable Development Goals. Without ICPD we would not have the SDGs, and indeed they go hand in hand. The ICPD is a dedicated vehicle through which we can—and will—address, achieve and fulfill the SDGs.

How well have we responded to trends such as population ageing and international migration? How successful have we been in ensuring optimal sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights for all, including the right to choose when or whether to get married and when or whether to have children, and how many? How well have we done in strengthening gender equality and women’s empowerment, and upholding the rights of the most vulnerable among us? Where should our efforts be refocused to leave no one behind?

“ Yet for all this growth, considerable injustices remain.

Asia and the Pacific has much to celebrate. The region remains the engine of global growth and at the forefront of the global fight against poverty. It is now home to half the world’s middle class. The share of the population living in poverty has dropped considerably although it is still unacceptably high. People are living, longer healthier lives. Rights-based family planning has contributed to considerable economic success and women’s empowerment. And we are on track to achieve universal education by 2030.

Yet for all this growth, considerable injustices remain. On its current trajectory, the region will fall short of achieving the 2030 Agenda. In several areas we are heading in altogether the wrong direction. Inequalities within and between countries are widening. Some 1.2 billion people live in poverty of which 400 million live in extreme poverty. Lack of decent job opportunities and access to essential services are perpetuating injustice across generations.

At the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), we are keen to shine the spotlight on three key issues where regional commitment is vital.

First, we need to respond to the unprecedented population changes unfolding across the Asia-Pacific region. Many countries are facing a rapidly ageing population. The proportion of people above the age of sixty is expected to more than double by 2050. Effectively meeting the needs of an ageing society and ensuring healthy and productive lives must be a priority. This requires a life cycle approach—from pregnancy and childbirth, through adolescence and adulthood, to old age—ensuring that all people are allowed to fulfil their socioeconomic potential, underpinned by individual rights and choices.

Equally, there is a strong case for strengthening Asia-Pacific’s response to international migration. Migrants can, when allowed, contribute significantly to development. However, we know that migrants are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. So, our ambition is for discussions this week to build further momentum in support of safe, orderly and regular migration to fully harness its development benefits.

Second, there is clear evidence the region must spend more on social protection, as well as on health care and education. Today, social protection is the preserve of a few, rather than a right for all. As a result, 60 per cent of our population are at risk of being trapped in vulnerability or pushed into poverty by sickness, disability, unemployment or old age, often underpinned by gender inequality. The “Social Outlook for Asia and the Pacific: Poorly Protected”, which ESCAP will publish later this week, sets out why expanding social protection is the most effective means of reducing poverty, strengthening rights and making vulnerable groups less exposed. Many women, migrants, older persons and rural communities would also benefit. Our evidence suggests it could even end extreme poverty in several countries by 2030.

Third, we need to invest in generating disaggregated data to tell us who is being left behind to ensure our response to population dynamics is targeted and credible. Availability of data on social and demographic issues lag far behind anything related to the economy. Millions of births remain unregistered, leading to the denial of many basic rights, particularly to women and girls. Of the 43 countries which conducted a census between 2005 and 2014, only 16 have reliable data on international migration. With the 2020 round of censuses upon us, we will be redoubling our efforts to close these data gaps by strengthening new partnerships for data capacity and working with governments and other partners to translate data into policy and action.

The Midterm Review of the Asian and Pacific Ministerial Declaration on Population and Development as well as the Committee on Social Development provide the region with an opportunity to speak with one voice on population and development issues. ESCAP and UNFPA stand united in their commitment to supporting their Member States to build and strengthen a regional response to issues that will shape the future for generations to come.

We look to this week’s discussions to galvanize countries behind the ambition and vision that link ICPD and the SDGs and accelerate work to leave no one behind in Asia and the Pacific.

United by Blue (UBB), the sustainable outdoor apparel and lifestyle brand that removes a pound of trash from the world’s oceans and waterways with every product sold, has launched what it is calling “the Future of Sustainable Outerwear” with The Bison Puffer Jacket, insulated with North American bison fiber that is often considered waste and thrown away by the ranching industry.

“Winter is fast approaching. Most of us are pulling our coats from storage or shopping for a new one, guided by the question, ‘Will this jacket keep me warm?’ While warmth is vital, we’re challenging ourselves to consider an equally important factor: ‘What’s in my jacket?,’” says Brian Linton, UBB’s founder & CEO. “It should come as no surprise that the most important part of a jacket is what you can’t see: the insulation inside.

“We don’t use duck or goose down at United by Blue for this very reason. Despite progress in traceability, the down industry’s live-plucking practices remain too controversial to consider a viable option,” Linton adds. “We ventured into the world of synthetic insulation, but were never able to find something we could truly stand behind both technically and environmentally. Our only solution was to create something entirely new. Enter B100™: Our very own sustainable insulation.”

Joining UBB’s snap jackets, socks, hats, gloves and blankets made from the naturally temperature-regulating, hypoallergenic and lightweight fiber, the Bison Puffer Jacket is insulated with 190gsm B100™ Fill, United By Blue’s sustainable alternative to down or synthetic insulation, made with 50 percent North American bison fiber and 50 percent recycled polyester blend. The bison’s shaggy coat consists of a layer of hollow, compactable, resilient hairs that allow them to keep warm and dry in the harshest winter climates. Bison fiber is an often-discarded byproduct of the ranching industry. United by Blue has spent the past 5 years creating a supply chain to intercept and harness the power of this natural fiber and diverting it from a landfill.

“The Bison Puffer Jacket is the most sustainable down alternative jacket we have ever produced. Incorporating lighter-weight and higher-performance recycled and natural materials, the bison puffer raises the bar for not just bison-insulated outerwear, but sustainable outerwear.” says Brendan Rauth, Product Designer for United by Blue.

The jacket and vest can be purchased online at unitedbyblue.com/bison-puffer or REI.com, at select REI retailers, and at United By Blue retail locations in Philadelphia and Manhattan.

Meanwhile, launching on Monday, Knickey is a new, DTC women's underwear brand creating basic briefs from certified organic cotton — by women, for female-identifying humans. Aiming to make organic the everyday option through affordable; GOTS-, Oeko-Tex- and Fair Trade-certified intimates, Knickey is “for the woke woman who seeks comfort, versatility, durability, and certified sustainability.”

Beyond Knickey's offering of organic cotton undies in real hues, its recycled and sustainable packaging is thoughtfully designed to be reused — to send back your old underwear at the end of its useful life. Knickey's take-back program aims to improve system circularity for a seemingly disposable product; for convenience (and health), Knickey has a subscription service for recurring deliveries that runs in conjunction to its take-back program.

Founded by Cayla O'Connell Davis, who's held high-level positions in sustainability, supply chain and design at industry-shaping companies since graduating Parsons in 2014. O’Connell Davis says she founded Knickey in an effort to bring better basics to the mass market, and to prioritize customer and planetary health with a better product offering at an accessible price point.

“The Recycling program is an exciting offering that aims to address one of the most troubling aspects of the fashion industry to date: textile waste,” O’Connell Davis said via email. “The truth is, about 95% of textiles can be recycled — not just for reuse by other humans but for textile reuse in alternate forms. So we have created a Recycling program to encourage the thoughtful disposal of unwanted intimates for a another life. We hope that this program will contribute to the reeducation of consumer behavior around garment life cycles, textile waste, and recycling as it relates to consumer behavior.”

As O’Connell Davis points out, most people hold onto their worn-torn “laundry-day” undies for years — largely due to the fact that there is no safe way to dispose of them. You can't donate them to Goodwill, most textile recyclers [if you have access to them] will not accept them, and throwing them in the trash sends them straight to a landfill to leach toxic chemicals into the earth — if they break down at all. As a small incentive, Knickey offer a free pair of new undies every time a customer sends back a pair of old ones.

Knickey has partnered with a NYC-based nonprofit that then sorts the goods to determine their reuse and recycle streams by quality, material and wear, and then passes them onto those respective channels. The recycler then downcycles the materials into fiber lint and puts them to use in insulation, batting and industrial rags.

Knickey’s model addresses a number of issues:

Textile waste:

95 percent of consumers dispose of their old underwear in the trash

Consumer demand for natural, safe fibers, especially in undergarments:

According to Sourcing Journal , 83 percent of consumers say they mostly buy cotton-rich underwear, and 54 percent say they are ""very or somewhat concerned"" that their intimates may be made from manmade fibers.

Speaking of sustainable undies: Right now, 640,000 tons of discarded nylon fishing nets sit beneath the ocean’s surface. Sustainable basics brand Arvin Goods has just joined the cleanup team with its latest launch: a collection of boxer briefs made from ECONYL® regenerated nylon — made from recovered nylon waste, including abandoned fishing nets, fabric scraps from mills, and carpets destined for landfill.

Founded in 2017, Arvin Goods makes quality, design-led basics and works towards a closed-loop cycle that saves over 50 gallons of fresh water with each pair of socks or underwear.

“Our goal at Arvin Goods has long been to make the cleanest basics on the market,” says the brand’s co-founder and Managing Director, Dustin Winegardner. “When we discovered the ECONYL® fabric, we knew that we had to incorporate it into our products. With this new launch, we hope to offer customers two things — a breathable, light fabric option; and an easy, accessible way to lessen the impact consumers are making on the environment by incorporating regenerated nylon into something they wear every day.”","The global movement to end textile waste continues, with the release of outer- and undergarments from new and established brands alike.

307,https://www.wfla.com/8-on-your-side/new-affordable-sustainable-container-homes-arrive-in-tampa-bay/,"Mon, 05 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",WFLA,"New affordable, sustainable container homes arrive in Tampa Bay","The hottest trend in real estate across the U.S. is a 40-feet metal box.

Container homes are taking the country by storm, and now the trend has made its way to Tampa Bay.

In an effort to save money on a new home, more and more people are thinking outside the box and choosing to move into one instead.

Chances are, virtually everything you bought today came from a ship. More than 800,000 shipping containers carry goods into the U.S. each year. However, after that transoceanic journey, most of those containers sit idle. It’s cheaper for exporters to get a new container than to ship one back.

But Scott Myers and his wife Emily Cusmano looked at one and thought ‘I want to live in that!’

“My wife and I, we’re really into efficient living and small living,” said Myers.

The couple originally considered a tiny house, but they changed their minds after seeing how much bang for their buck they could get with a container home.

Theirs will be one of the first of its kind in Tampa.

“We got over [our concerns] pretty quickly when we realized how cool they were,” said Cusmano.

“We looked at custom builds, and it was almost double the price and it doesn’t give the look we’re gonna get from having this nice piece of house here,” said Myers.

The pair hired the Tampa firm, SUNDog structures. The company designs and builds container homes in a massive warehouse. They build anything from a 5,000-feet office building to a 320-square-feet cabin.

“It’s like a building block, they’re life-sized legos if you will. We can combine them to as many configurations as you want. Your imagination can run wild,” said President Wesley Osborne.

Container homes are considered sustainable. SUNDog structures obtains single use 40-feet cargo containers that otherwise would sit empty. Most of these containers carried items like TVs and dry goods. The company receives the containers from a broker who ensures that no hazardous materials were carried inside. Also, officials stress the materials used to construct the cargo container are not hazardous to humans.

“They’re in perfect condition. If we used old containers, it’s harder to rehab them, bring them up to code and what is necessary for building,” explained Osborne.

“It has a lot of attributes that really make it very favorable to typical construction,” said CEO Robert Cox.

They’re built with Cor-Ten steel, the same alloy used to build bridges.

“They’re extremely durable, they rust a millimeter every 100 years if left exposed. So even if you see rust on them, its usually superficial,” said Osborne. “With proper maintenance, and care, they can last indefinitely.”

“These things are meant to be at sea, so I think they can withstand some rain,” said Myers.

The containers exceed code requirements for wind resistance and seismic activity.

“The crush strength of a single container is about 105 tons,” Osborne added.

But the biggest thing about these pint-sized places is the attractive price.

Chet Rogofsky and his partner Hugo are building a one-bedroom container home with an upstairs office. They’re saving $70,000 compared to a similar traditional home. And after insulation is added, it should be more energy-efficient.

“I expect my electric bills to be under a $100 a month,” Rogofsky said excitedly. “For me, its architecturally attractive, its unique, its different. I like things that are different.”

At SUNDog Structures, container homes can be built roughly $15 a square foot cheaper compared to the construction costs of a traditional home.

“Fifteen-dollars may not sound like a whole lot but when it comes to multiplying it by 2,500 times, it really adds up quickly,” said Cox.

The homes can be built on land you own – and fast. So while a foundation is laid, SUNDog will complete the house indoors in less than 160 days.

By building the homes in a warehouse, the workers can focus on quality and avoid exposure to the elements.

Officials say durability is what truly sets container homes apart compared to prefabricated or manufactured homes.

“One of the things that we like to say is, ‘I’d like to see you drop a shoulder and run through a pre-manufactured wall and try to do that with a container home…they’re tough,'” said Osborne with a smile.

The paperwork behind a container home is virtually the same as any other house, but for now, you’ll need a little patience. While these houses are already found in cities like Miami, Tampa is new to the game.

“There have definitely been some hurdles,” said Myers.

“We’re still in the process,” added Cusmano.

“These projects get a little more reviews sometimes from the cities, so it sometimes does take a little bit longer so it may be in the homeowner’s best interest to check with the city and see what their impressions are,” said Cox.

But plans are moving along and these homeowners expect to move in within the next few months. These trailblazers can’t contain their excitement for the future.

“We’re gonna pave the way for other potential buyers to take this more serious and have a shipping container as an option for a new home,” said Rogofsky.

Municipalities across America are becoming more accepting of this new trend. Officials say soon it’ll be even easier and quicker to own a container home. That means you may soon find a home like this in a neighborhood near you.

SUNDog Structures provided this list of the pros and cons of container homes:

The Pros Of Container Homes

There are many reasons that the container home trend is the newest “poster child” for the tiny house revolution. Here are a few of the biggest advantages of container homes! Take a look now, and see why they’ve become so popular.

• They’re incredibly affordable – Building a container home is affordable, and it’s within reach of many Americans who may be priced out of the traditional housing market. Container homes usually cost around $117-$125 per square foot.In contrast, the construction of a traditional home usually costs about $200 per square foot – at a minimum. This means that building a shipping container home – whether it’s permanent or mobile – will be much less expensive than a traditional home.And this has other benefits. The more you save when building your home’s structure and purchasing appliances, the more money you can spend on luxury items. You can afford better furniture, appliances, and even other luxuries like a spa, swimming pool, solar panels, and so forth.

And not only are container homes affordable to buy, they’re affordable to live in. You can use solar panels and rainwater tanks to save on utility bills, and insulate your home to ensure that it does not consume too much power.

The more you save on construction and utilities, the more luxuries you can afford! And that’s a good thing.

• Eco-friendly and sustainable – This is a huge benefit for anyone who is concerned about their environmental footprint, and wants to think globally and act locally. The process of building a traditional home is quite resource-intensive, and requires a lot of supplies and materials that must be shipped from around the world, increasing your carbon footprint.Traditional homes also often require a large plot of land to be cleared of grass, plants, trees, and more, to prepare for construction and the pouring of a foundation, which means you’ll damage your local environment when you build one.In contrast, shipping container homes are built from recycled materials, making them more environmentally-friendly. And they can even be built in a factory, which means less transportation of materials, and a lower carbon footprint.

Their eco-friendly design extends further than just construction. You can build your home with solar water tanks and solar panels and other features that make you less reliant on local power, which means you’ll reduce the impact you have on your surrounding environment.

So if you’re interested in “going green”, a shipping container home is one of the best ways to do so. You can make the most out of a small space, and make sure that you don’t damage your environment.

• You can customize every part of your home – With a company like SUNDog Structures, you’re in complete control of how your home is built. Whether you’re interested in a mobile shipping container home, or a permanent structure, you can work with experienced designers to create a shipping container home that lives up to your vision of an ideal home.This means you’ll get exactly what you want – and you don’t have to just accept a pre-built home from a developer, which can’t be changed and modified. Whether you want a “green roof” which can support plants and grass, a window that takes up an entire side of your container, or home office underneath your loft bed, you can build the home you’ve always wanted.

• They can be built very quickly – Shipping container homes can be built in just a few weeks, especially if they are made from only one or two containers, and are designed to be mobile. The home can be built in a factory, and ready in less than a month.In contrast, it can often take a year or more for a traditional developer to complete the process of building a home, and even longer for it to be ready for habitation by you and your family.

These are just a few reasons that container homes are becoming so popular, especially among younger folks. They’re affordable, flexible, customizable, and environmentally friendly!

The Cons Of Container Homes

Container homes are great – but because they’re a relatively recent innovation, there are some drawbacks that you may need to be aware of, before you commit yourself to purchasing one. Let’s look at some of these disadvantages now.

• Zoning and building permit acquisition may be complex – Building permits, zoning codes, and other local municipal ordinances may make it hard to get permission to build a permanent home out of shipping containers – or bar you from placing a mobile container home on your property.Most local city councils and lawmakers don’t really know much about shipping container homes, and their outdated laws reflect this.Before you begin construction, you must research your local planning regulations. They may specify things like disallowed building materials, the minimum size of a home, and other such guidelines that your container home must abide by.

Building permits take time to be approved, and it may take longer for you to get approval when building a container home, compared to a traditional home. Be prepared for this, and make sure you double-check with all local zoning and inspection departments for approval – before construction begins.

• They’re small (if they’re mobile) – Shipping containers provide about 320 square feet of area, and this means that they are very small, particularly if you build a mobile home, and use just one container.If you have lived in small spaces before, you won’t have any issues – but if you’re used to more spacious living situations, this may be hard for you to get used to.We recommend you do some research, and visit some other tiny homes and mobile homes to make sure that you are up to the task of living in a small home.

• Offsite construction may be required – This could be a pro or a con, depending on your perspective. While it’s nice to have your home built offsite – because it’s fast and efficient – you can’t be very involved in the process, unless you live near the factory where your home is being built, which is unlikely. This is a potential drawback.However, if you don’t mind, and you trust your contractors to make your home look perfect even without your oversight, this could actually be a benefit! Your dream home will be delivered right to your property!

• It may be hard to find an experienced contractor – Again, this drawback is primarily related to how new container homes are. Most builders and developers have never worked with shipping containers, and they won’t really know how to build a home using shipping containers – which could mean you’ll have to settle for an inexperienced contractor.However, there are some contractors who have years of experience working with tiny homes and container homes all around America, such as SUNDog Structures. If you can find the right contractor, you don’t have to worry about this drawback!

While container homes have a number of advantages, there are some quirks and drawbacks associated with building one, so make sure you understand the disadvantages we’ve outlined above!","Container homes are taking the country by storm, and now the trend has made its way to Tampa Bay.

If you want people to care about the environment, educate them. Rethinking the purpose of education in environmentalism is just what the new book Sustainability, Human Well-being and the Future of Education suggests, bringing together the best global expertise in the field.

The open-access book focuses on how future education systems can help individuals and communities to promote well-being while addressing major sustainability challenges.

Until recently, education systems have mostly prepared students to perform certain social functions in a relatively predictable world. However, the world is changing and we can no longer expect the same old same old. Today’s students will soon need to deal with complex sustainability challenges, which requires totally new skills and attitudes to be developed.

Building on case studies from Finland and the US, scholars and practitioners provide an understanding of the transformation education system requires in the face of rapid environmental and societal changes. Crucially there is a shift from widespread anxiety over mounting environmental disasters towards positive approaches, full of actionable hope for a better world.

Among the effective methods to promote it is the development of a reflexive worldview, which constantly evolves awareness about factors shaping one’s thoughts, habits and ideas about how the world works, to which the chapter by Erkka Laitinen from the OKKA Foundation of Teaching from Finland is devoted.

In societies faced by injustices and inequalities, learning for social cohesion is a must. Only through creating stories of “us” that nourish communal spirit while acknowledging the inherent diversity can we hope for a peaceful run through this coming turbulent century. We are also living in a time when the development of soft skills like collaboration and communication is no less important than any practical skills acquired by students.

A particular focus of one of the chapters is on creativity, design-thinking and arts-based learning, explored by Linda Nathan, a lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Creative and systematic problem solving, critical thinking and empathy towards the natural world, she emphasizes, are invaluable skills that future education systems should sharpen as much much as possible.

Meanwhile, author Asta Raami develops this idea further into exploring the unique and far-reaching benefits of using intuitions for solving complex problems. While doing so, it is important to keep an eye on the real world – allowing students to deal with actual challenges in different societal contexts. The approach is practiced in some of the schools in California and explored by Robert Riordan from the High Tech High Graduate School of Education in San Diego.

Another example is the Developers of Sustainable Education, an experimental training program that brings together teachers, school principals and education professionals to discuss topics in the book and explore its suggestions in practice.

Finally, when it comes to the meaning and purpose of education, Justin Cooks, editor of the book from SITRA, points out that we currently have more questions than answers, but the key role of “deep understanding of our rapidly-changing society” is hard to dispute. “When there is a lot of information, also mutually conflicting information, those who can synthesise, or pick what is essential and combine information, will be most successful,” says Cook. We are “at the edge of history”, where “nothing is given, and everything is a frontier”.

And we’ll have to learn to live with this.","Rethinking the purpose of education in environmentalism is just what the new book Sustainability, Human Well-being and the Future of Education suggests, bringing together the best global expertise in the field.

The community is the second sonnenCommunity in the United States, following its 2,900 home installation in Arizona. The new installation in Manatee County, Florida takes the solution several steps forward in meaningful ways by partnering with the homebuilder from the outset to develop some of the most sustainable and energy efficient homes in the world.

The ‘Net-Zero-Plus and Climate-Positive’ community integrates sonnen’s energy storage products into 148 single family homes and 720 apartments for a combined solution that disrupts the way we have thought about in-home energy management by aggregating them into a unified community energy consumption, storage, and production unit. Combined, the units will have a storage capacity of 9 MWh and power of 7.2 MW.

This combined capacity is first utilized within the community as well as to the local utility. Discussions are underway to define the terms of the interconnect agreement and to define how the developer and utility will interact to maximize the benefits of the system to the environment, to those living in the community and to the utility.

We spoke with sonnen SVP and head of sonnen’s US operations Blake Richetta and President of Sarasota, Florida-based Pearl Homes Marshall Gobuty about the unique development and how they have partnered to break down barriers to design and build one of the most sustainable communities ever.

Energy Storage In Every Home

“Together with our partners at Pearl Homes and Google Home, we are effectively demonstrating the intersection between renewable energy, home automation and homebuilding, establishing a blueprint for the affordable clean energy home of the future,” Blake said in a statement about the community.

On the sonnen side of the equation, Blake said that sonnen’s team built a completely new offering that connects its sonnen eco energy storage unit with Google Home to offer up more home automation than a traditional energy storage solution does, but at a lower cost than its top of the line sonnen ecoLinx offering. “It’s the baby brother to ecoLinx. A broader marketplace will be served by this product,” Blake said.

The sonnenCommunity not only adds storage to each home in the development, it takes it a step further by letting them talk to each other, sharing power among themselves at rates that are lower than those at the local utility.

A Smarter Home

Adding connected intelligent storage isn’t all that this community has going for it but rather, it was a natural extension of the core ethos at Pearl Homes, which is pushing the envelope on building design to build the most sustainable homes ever. Marshall Gobuty shared with us that, “the world doesn’t need another block home builder,” and that he felt like the technologies available and the imperative to live more sustainably effectively mandated that he design better homes.

It took them four iterations of designing, testing and redesigning over the course of a few years to come up with the right design for Hunters Point, but they did it. The result is a development that goes “well beyond LEED platinum,” according to Marshall. To quantify it, the Green Building Council put in into, “a new level that they’re calling LEED platinum plus. It’s a new level where you’re trying to be net carbon neutral,” which is the objective for him at Hunters Point.

“The model really showcases a lot of the unique designs that no other homeowner has implemented,” starting with a smaller 750 square foot floor plan for some of the units. Marshall believes these will be attractive to retirees as well as Millennials looking to live an environmentally friendly, sustainable lifestyle. Going through multiple design iterations maximized the square footage for efficiency and functionality.

“In that 750 sq ft, it’s remarkable what you’re getting,” Marshall said. “The trade off is that you don’t mind that you’re getting a smaller footprint and the home builder can invest in other things.” Backup power, carbon neutral living, monthly savings on the energy bill from the solar plus storage solution, and more come to mind and resonate with their target customers.

Their desire for a carbon neutral home initially had them looking at rooftop solar, but after partnering with sonnen to assess the reality of the situation, they found that the heart of the solution was energy storage and management. Since then, the plan has been, “to harness the power, manage it and use it. Keep it on site.”

These homes are a different breed than anything else on the market. They represent a sustainable step-change into the future. The efficient, solar powered, self-sufficient home and neighborhoods of the future. They are much like the Tesla Model 3 that’s leading the electric transportation revolution compared to the BMW M3 that our parents enjoyed. Not only are they packed with more tech, and are more intuitive, more comfortable, and more fun, they’re also better for the planet.

Marshall is a dreamer, but one firmly grounded in the realities of business and technology. That combination led him to the realization that, “as humans, we’ve taken hundreds of years to damage the earth.” Unsatisfied with the inevitability of climate change unaddressed, he decided to take action. That action led him down the windy path of sustainable home building paired with clean tech solutions, much like the pairing of a fine wine and the right cheese or the recent fad of pairing beer with donuts.

He concluded that, “over the next 100 years, we can correct all the damage we’ve done,” and set out with a fierce determination to do his part, to do his best, to bring that dream into reality. “97% of the power you generate is yours. That’s an ownership question. That’s a pride question.” The inspirational words pour out of him as it overflowing from a never ending spring of positivity.

Looking To The Future

Experts agree that the future grid will be distributed, will be increasingly comprised of distributed renewable generation and supported by copious amounts of energy storage.

Developments like Hunters Point push the envelope as to what’s possible at the intersection of these technologies, and in the end, they support a more stable, cost effective grid for everyone. Blake shared that, “the main objective is to decarbonize the environment and the second objective is to reduce cost and optimize energy bills.”

Marshall showed off some of the early builds from the development to a large hotel builder and they were awestruck. “They stand there looking at the sonnen battery in amazement like a little pug dog looks at you with the twisted head,” Marshall said. “They’re like ‘this is amazing!'” I equate that to the EV smile.

It’s the time when people experience the convergence of so many of the technologies they hear about all working together at the same time. People are so used to being underwhelmed by products that are so overhyped by marketing and sales teams that when a product actually delivers – or exceeds – the claims, people are floored.

That’s how I felt when I first saw the sonnen ecoLinx at the Solar Power International show earlier this year. It is a product that stands by itself. Nothing else on the market comes close to matching the functionality it brings to the market in the home energy management space.

As you might expect, Marshall is not content to have just built a single world-changing home development. “We have aggressive plans over the next 6 years to make a material change in home building,” he said. The success of the Hunters Point development has stoked the flames of sustainable development in Marshall.

What’s perhaps the most impressive is that he is still filled with the child like wonder about the technologies and the innovations he and his team have rolled into the Hunters Point development. “In our lifetime, to see something like this happening is pretty shocking,” Marshall said. “It’s really something that the world hasn’t seen yet.”

Small Island Developing States Reiterate Commitment to Sustainable Development

By J Nastranis

NEW YORK (IDN) – Confronted with the increased effects of climate change, natural disasters, and the outsized impacts of global economic shocks on small economies, Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have resolved to strengthen their efforts to achieve sustainable development.

The 'Apia Outcome' – adopted at the conclusion of a three-day meeting that ended on November 1 in Apia, Samoa – will serve as the basis for the preparation of the inter-governmentally agreed Political Declaration of the High-level SIDS Midterm Review of the SAMOA Pathway, to be held in September 2019.

The Apia Outcome reaffirms that SAMOA Pathway is a standalone, overarching framework for guiding SIDS in their global, regional and national development efforts and is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

The Inter-regional Preparatory Meeting for the Midterm Review of the SAMOA Pathway, held from October 30 to November 1, in Apia saw countries recommit to key priority areas including climate change mitigation, disaster risk reduction, the sustainable management of oceans and improved connectivity between SIDS and between SIDS and other states.

They called for increased international support for the next five years of the SAMOA Pathway, the programme of action for small islands, especially with capacity-building, data collection and monitoring and review.

About 250 representatives from Small Island Developing States' governments, their partners, the private sector, civil society and the UN system participated in the meeting, organized by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), the UN Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (UN-OHRLLS), and the Government of Samoa.

Representatives from the Pacific, Caribbean and Africa, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean, and South China Seas presented regional experiences and progress.

Supported by UN-OHRLLS, they will facilitate coordination, information sharing and planning on the implementation of the SAMOA Pathway and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The meeting also included side events focused on opportunities for youth in SIDS, the sustainable ocean economy, and SIDS' marine heritage.

""Without a doubt, this Midterm review of the SAMOA Pathway – SIDS blueprint for sustainable development – presents a key opportunity to re-examine progress and gaps, to determine priorities ahead, and to reaffirm and reinforce partnerships,"" said Liu Zhenmin, UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, at the opening of the meeting in Apia.

The meeting in Apia was preceded by the Samoa Partnership Dialogue on October 29, where SIDS and their partners worked to increase the capacity of stakeholders in forging new, genuine and durable multi-stakeholder partnerships, and strengthen the monitoring and review process of partnerships in SIDS.

According to DESA, the Partnership Dialogue resulted in a set of SIDS Partnership Criteria and Norms, a SIDS Partnership Toolbox, a set of SIDS partnership case studies and an analysis of existing SIDS partnerships done by UN DESA.

""We're small, and we cannot make progress unless we co-op all the help that we can get,"" said Lois Young, Belize’s Ambassador to the UN and co-chair of the Partnership Dialogue. ""It has to be a win-win situation, both for us and for those who we partner with.""

Furthermore, representatives from small island developing States also met on October 29 to launch a network of focal points who be a vital link between the global and the national levels. This network will provide a vital link between work at the global and national levels, facilitating coordination, information sharing and planning for the implementation of the SAMOA Pathway and the SDGs.

As regards the SIDS, the Barbados Programme of Action (BPOA) adopted in 1994, further complemented by The Mauritius Strategy of Implementation (MSI) of 2005 and MSI+5 Outcome document, recognized that although they are afflicted by economic difficulties and confronted by development imperatives similar to those of developing countries generally, small island developing States have their own peculiar vulnerabilities and characteristics.

SIDS' unique and particular vulnerabilities are highlighted in 'The Future We Want', adopted at the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (also known as Rio+20) that took place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in June 2012 – their small size, remoteness, narrow resource and export base, and exposure to global environmental challenges and external economic shocks, including to a large range of impacts from climate change and potentially more frequent and intense natural disasters (para 178). SIDS continue to address those structural and external challenges to achieve their sustainable development.

The Third International Conference on SIDS was held in Apia, Samoa, in September 2014, with the overarching theme of 'The sustainable development of small island developing States through genuine and durable partnerships'. Nearly 300 partnerships were announced at the conference and monitored through the Partnership Platform. The SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway (Samoa Pathway) adopted at the Conference addresses priority areas for SIDS and calls for urgent actions and support for SIDS’ efforts to achieve their sustainable development.

UN-DESA leads inter-agency coordination within the United Nations system through the Executive Committee of Economic and Social Affairs Plus (ECESA Plus), and among UN and non-UN entities active on SIDS issues through the Inter-Agency Consultative Group (IACG) on SIDS, to monitor the implementation of the BPOA, MSI, and the Samoa Pathway, as well as the progress being made in the SIDS partnerships.

Moreover, UN-DESA, and particularly the SIDS Unit provides technical assistance and advice, supports intergovernmental processes and reports on progress made in the implementation of the BPOA, MSI, and the Samoa Pathway. [IDN-InDepthNews – 03 November 2018]

311,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/elon-musk-says-electric-scooters-lack-dignity-truly-sustainable-mobility-ncna940151,"Mon, 26 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",NBC News,"Elon Musk says electric scooters lack dignity, but truly sustainable mobility will require more than Tesla","As electric scooters roll out in more and more cities across the country, Elon Musk told Recode editor Kara Swisher recently that the electric scooter “lacks dignity.” The Tesla CEO noted that Swisher was “laboring under an illusion” if she really thought she looks great while riding one.

Musk’s reaction may come as a surprise to some observers, but let’s be honest: Musk is a car man. Sure, he wants us all to switch from using internal combustion engines to batteries, but at his core Musk believes that automobiles should continue to dominate the transportation system. That flies in the face of growing recognition that truly sustainable mobility — which will be necessary to avoid the worst-case climate-change scenarios — will require far more than simply switching to electric cars.

Truly sustainable mobility — which will be necessary to avoid the worst-case climate-change scenarios — will require far more than simply switching to electric cars.

Remember that Musk doesn’t like public transportation — he’s called it “painful” and said that other passengers could be serial killers — and wants to build a system of tunnels that could be “10, 20, 30 layers deep (or more)” below Los Angeles so people can keep using cars without getting stuck in traffic. There are a lot of questions about this proposal — the cost savings he promises only he can deliver have already been achieved in other developed countries and his proposed car elevators seem like they would create terrible bottlenecks — but what about the human cost of continuing on an auto-dominated path of development? We accept the status quo because, in most cases, it’s all we know, but it actually has terrible impacts on our health.

Between 1980 and 2014, the average commute increased nearly 20 percent to 26 minutes each way and the number of “megacommuters” — people who travel 60 to 90 minutes each way — has increased 64 percent since 1990. The longer the commute, the worse the health impacts. Driving more than ten miles each way has been associated with higher blood sugar, cholesterol and depression, according to a report in the American Journal of Preventative Medicine; while the U.K.’s Office of National Statistics linked commutes of more than 30 minutes each way to higher rates of anxiety, lower levels of happiness and less life satisfaction.

And that’s before we even start talking about the lethal outcomes. In 2017, more than 40,000 people were killed in collisions with cars — more than the number of Americans who were killed with guns in 2016 — and that doesn’t even count the additional 53,000 premature deaths attributed to tailpipe emissions. It’s shocking how little outrage there is about vehicle deaths when compared to the growing coalition for gun control.

Nevertheless, shifting away from automobile dominance in urban centers is becoming ever more realistic. Over the past year and a half, electric bikes and scooters (collectively part of the micro-mobility movement) were dumped on the sidewalks of cities across the country. In some places, there was backlash, and rightfully so. Few cities have dedicated lanes for bikes and scooters, yet all of a sudden there were far more people using them, usually in the very limited space allotted for pedestrians. Anger was to be expected, and government action soon followed.

But whereas Uber and Lyft fought local governments tooth and nail to escape regulation, dockless bike and scooter companies have been generally more cooperative — it’s a lot easier to send a municipal employee around in a truck to impound a bunch of scooters than to do the same to Uber drivers.

As a result, cities have been able to better regulate these new companies to limit the number of bikes and scooters on their streets, set speed limits, and demand trip data that they’ve had so much difficulty getting from ride-hailing companies. Cities have also been adapting to the new forms of mobility in their midst: Santa Monica installed special parking spaces for dockless bikes and scooters to ensure they aren’t cluttering sidewalks. Hopefully in the near future, cities will install more bike lanes.

Making streets safer for dockless bikes and scooters could also have benefits for underserved communities. Black residents of Washington, D.C. are far more likely to use dockless bikes than the city’s docked bike-share service, according to mobility data company Populus, which also found that women and people with low incomes may be more likely to use scooters in major U.S. cities. Electric bikes, which are often part of these dockless services, have also been shown to be particularly attractive to drivers in Australian, Canadian, and U.S. cities in a review of recent research by Elliott Fishman and Christopher Cherry, and switching from cars to e-bikes would result in significant health benefits.

It makes sense though. E-bikes require less work than a conventional bike, meaning fewer riders need a shower afterward, they make conquering hills much easier, and they’re faster than regular bikes (and cars stuck in traffic) so riders can use them for longer trips. Plus, the environmental footprint of a bike or scooter — electrified or not — is far smaller than a car, and when the City of Copenhagen measured the cost to society of transportation, including things like safety, tourism and health, it found that every kilometer (0.62 miles) of cycling produced a 26-cent economic gain for society, while each kilometer driven cost 14 cents. In the Netherlands, high rates of cycling prevent 6,500 premature deaths every year and save the country $23 billion, according to a study in the American Journal of Public Health.

The United States holds freedom as its highest value, but forcing people to use cars to get around isn’t freedom at all.

Of course, the Netherlands has both fewer people and higher rates of cycling than the United States, but that doesn’t mean U.S. cities can’t change. In the 1960s, the Dutch government razed neighborhoods in Amsterdam and other cities to make way for the automobile, following in the footsteps of their American counterparts. However, activism in the early 1970s forced the government to reconsider this strategy.

Let’s be clear: Cars aren’t going to be abandoned tomorrow. They’ll continue to have an important role, especially outside urban cores, for years to come. But improving city public transit systems, widening sidewalks and giving dedicated space to micro-mobility options would make our lives easier and build activity into our daily routines, to name just two immediate benefits. The United States holds freedom as its highest value, but forcing people to use cars to get around isn’t freedom at all. True mobility freedom would mean providing citizens a range of options to get around cities, with reliable public transit and safe micro-mobility as convenient, less costly alternatives to cars.

Instead of fighting against the influx of bikes and scooters — or deriding them as uncool or undignified — we should embrace them. And frankly, given the high cost of automobility and the pressing challenge of climate change, holding onto the status quo is the worst possible option.","That flies in the face of growing recognition that truly sustainable mobility — which will be necessary to avoid the worst-case climate-change scenarios — will require far more than simply switching to electric cars.

312,https://www.triplepundit.com/story/2018/digital-and-sustainable-development-goals-urgent-call-worlds-donor-countries/10416,"Sun, 04 Nov 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Triple Pundit,Digital and the Sustainable Development Goals: An Urgent Call to the World’s Donor Countries,"Charlotte Petri Gornitzka co-authored this story

In a meeting last month co-hosted by the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and the GSMA, it was revealed that only half of the world’s 30 major donor aid agencies have a public Digital for Development (D4D) strategy to integrate digital technologies into their development policies.

This is an extraordinary finding, given the world that we live in. The rapid spread of digital technologies, and mobile in particular, has been a phenomenal success story. Today, over 5 billion people on the planet have a mobile subscription, with 3.7 billion subscribers living in low- and middle-income countries.

Mobile technology provides core digital infrastructure around the world. In the agricultural sector, mobile provides information and access to markets—enabling farmers to increase their crop yields, reduce pesticide use and increase family income. Mobile technologies, including the Internet of Things, are enabling increased access to safe water, sanitation and energy. And mobile money is offering a transformative digital solution for the world's financially excluded; at the end of 2017, there were 690 million registered mobile money accounts worldwide, and mobile money providers are now processing over $1 billion a day.

Through the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the world has made an ambitious commitment to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030. While digitalization and mobile technology are not explicit targets within the SDGs, mobile connectivity and the services it enables hold great potential to accelerate all 17 goals. Indeed, the mobile industry was the first sector as a whole to commit to the SDGs.

That digital is an essential accelerator and delivery mechanism for the SDGs was reinforced when United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres created the High-Level Panel for Digital Cooperation in July of this year. Chaired by Melinda Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and Jack Ma, executive chairman of Alibaba Group, the Panel underscores that the scale, spread and speed of change brought about by digital technology is unprecedented—and, perhaps more importantly, that the current means and levels of international cooperation are unequal to the challenge.

We see several immediate opportunities. First, digital solutions can significantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of existing development programming. Secondly, it is critical that we increase digital inclusion by ensuring that underserved populations can make best use of available technology, in particular women, older people, those with disabilities and rural populations. Finally, we need to build stronger partnerships between the technology industry and the development community to bring digital inclusion to the fore.

Advancing the SDGs requires governments to recognize that mobile connectivity and innovative digital technologies offer the promise of social and economic progress for millions of people at a speed unimaginable without mobile networks.

As 2030 approaches, there is an ever-pressing need for the world’s major donor countries to adopt digital strategies, to boost impact on each individual reached and drive scale to reach all those most in need, across their collective annual spend of nearly US$150 billion for official development assistance. We are already witnessing leading examples of bold ambition in development cooperation with the transformative use of mobile technologies—but to deliver the SDGs, we must all work together to ensure that this transformation becomes reality.

THE Blue Economy holds the greatest promise in helping to promote social inclusion and gender equality across maritime and coastal communities.

With this, Fiji needs to bring together its fisheries, food technologies, banking, private sector together to make further and deeper progress.

This was highlighted by Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Dr Satyendra Prasad led a Fijian delegation to the Sustainable Blue Economy Conference, in Nairobi, Kenya this week from November 26 to 28.

The Blue Economy Conference, co-hosted by the Governments of Kenya, Japan and Canada is the first Conference on the Blue Economy focusing on Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 14 since the Oceans Conference which was co-hosted by Fiji and Sweden in 2017.

The Conference outlined nine (9) key areas of focus on sectoral implementations of the Blue Economy including climate change, food security, maritime transport, women, employment, fisheries, cities and infrastructure, sustainable energy and people, culture and communities.

Ambassador Prasad delivered a statement on behalf of the Fijian Government, outlining Fiji’s progress and achievements emanating out of the Oceans Conference commitments in 2017 and its commitment towards a Sustainable Blue Economy.

He also noted that Fiji was advancing the development of its blue economy through innovation, new technologies, innovative financing instruments and partnerships between communities and government.

Ambassador Prasad emphasised the importance of the Blue Economy Agenda in calling for greater multilateralism.

He also called on other countries to continue to work towards the achievement of all the targets under the Sustainable Development Goals.

Fiji’s Permanent Representative to United Nations, Dr Satyendra Prasad also said the full potential of Fiji’s blue economy would be realised through the energy, talent and commitment of our young people to embrace the responsibility as stewards of some one million square miles that make up our large ocean state of Fiji.

The conference was also an opportunity for the Fijian Delegation to hold bilateral dialogues with various development partners from the UK, Canada, Norway, and Kenya.

The Fijian Government remains focused on assisting its young people to enhance their skills in oceanography, marine science, resource economics, oceans data science, marine genetics, geospatial planning, frontier technologies to give us our ‘moon shot’ in driving forward our blue economy agenda.","Fiji’s Permanent Representative to the UN Dr Satyendra Prasad while delivering a statement on behalf of the Fijian Government at the First Sustainable Blue Economy Conference in Nairobi, Kenya.

315,https://www.resilience.org/stories/2018-11-14/a-fixed-meat-ration-is-not-the-path-to-sustainable-food-systems/,"Wed, 14 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Resilience,A Fixed Meat Ration is Not the Path to Sustainable Food Systems,"“We should eat less meat in order to save the planet”, has almost become a dogma. There is no doubt that industrial animal production is harmful for animals and nature. But the framing of the path to a sustainable agriculture system in terms of how many grams of potatoes, wheat and meat per day we should eat is to start in the wrong end of the stick. Instead we should focus our interest into the transition to a sustainable and regenerative food and agriculture system. Such a system would exclude or substantially reduce those foods which are wasteful regardless if those are eggs from caged hens or asparagus flown from one side of the globe to the other. With the right design animals, especially ruminants such as cattle, sheep and goats, can be companions in this transition rather than a problem.

The article Options for keeping the food system within environmental limits published in Nature 10 October 2018 has the following key messages according to the lead author, Marco Springmann:

Climate change cannot be sufficiently mitigated without dietary changes towards more plant-based diets. Adopting more plant-based “flexitarian” diets globally could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of the food system by more than half, and also reduce other environmental impacts, such as those from fertilizer application and the use of cropland and freshwater, by a tenth to a quarter.

In addition to dietary changes, improving management practices and technologies in agriculture is required to limit pressures on agricultural land, freshwater extraction, and fertilizer use.

Finally, halving food loss and waste is needed for keeping the food system within environmental limits.

Not surprising, media featured the ”eat less meat” message strongly. But, what does the article really tell us? The article is building scenarios to 2050. That is a nice method to visualize possible implications of trends and possible options. However, the food system is a very dynamic socio-ecological system where changes in one place will trigger a cascade of changes in other places. “Small” details such as the invention of the shipping container, a bird flu pandemic, antibiotic resistant bacteria, or a populist president in the White house can have enormous impact, even on people’s diets. It should be very clear that scenario building is not predicting the future.

The results are determined by the data put into the model and the assumptions made, and will not prove anything else than what is already determined by those, therefore it is essential that the assumptions are clearly expressed and communicated together with the results. The choice of assumptions, the model and the data put into the scenarios have some major flaws as follows (first the main points of criticism, which are expanded upon later).

The assumption for economic growth doesn’t seem very realistic. The projection for land use is to no extent based on a historical trend and disregards the enormous increase in productivity in the farm sector.

Their own data show that livestock products don’t have a disproportionally big environmental impact on four of the five impact categories compared with their contribution to human nutrition, but their conclusions are implying the opposite.

The allocation of all environmental impact associated with livestock to meat and milk omits that livestock has many other functions.

When calculating greenhouse gas emissions, Springmann et al do that only based on methane and nitrous oxide emissions, thus excluding carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas with the biggest impact of them all. This systematically misrepresents livestock and in particular ruminants.

The expression of methane emissions as carbon dioxide equivalents can be questioned, especially when used for making scenarios for many decades.

There is no mention of the enormous variations and uncertainties regarding nitrous oxide emissions, which potentially have a huge impact on the results.

The research is supposedly for the food system, but the results and comparisons between diets are about agriculture raw materials. There are massive emissions in the rest of the food chain which thus are neglected. Again, this systematically misrepresents livestock, and in particular ruminants.

Projections and assumptions

The article assumes that population will grow by 50% and global income will grow three times. Considering the strong link between GDP and the minor decoupling of growth from greenhouse gas emissions that can be observed, one could argue that we are doomed with such projections regardless if we fix the food system or not.

The researchers also assume that the demand for crop land will increase by a whopping 67 percent. Looking back, that assumption seems unsubstantiated. The gross output of global agriculture grew from 3,760 calories per capita to 5,740 calories per capita between 1960 and 2012 while the population more than doubled and consumption of animal products increased a lot. But during the same period global crop land just increased by around 15 percent. The authors don’t give any convincing explanation for this mismatch between their projection and historical trends.

Misrepresentation of animal products impact

This is not so much an error of the research, but an error with the conclusions as they are communicated by the lead author (see above). According to their own figures the proportion of livestock’s impact for the five categories are (2010):

Greenhouse gas emissions 72%

Cropland use 23 %

Bluewater use 10%

Nitrogen application 20%

Phosphorus application 20%

Animal products contributes 18 percent of all calories, 40 percent of all protein and 45 percent of all dietary fats (FAOSTAT). The environmental burden of livestock products is therefore not disproportionally high with the exception of greenhouse gases (see more below). Considering that protein and dietary fats are more limiting factors in the food system than calories or kilos are, one could clearly argue the opposite.

Livestock’s multiple functions are ignored

While it is true that in most developed countries the purpose of livestock keeping has, largely, been reduced to the production of meat and milk, that is not a fair representation of the real value of livestock. Increasingly, other functions of livestock are recognized, such as maintaining bio-diversity, circulation of nutrients, use of wastes, carbon sequestration etc. In many cultures where livestock keeping is still a way of life the main purpose of livestock can be for draught power, transport, insurance and savings and for cultural and religious reasons. In some cultures livestock provides housing (yurts, and manure/clay adobe) in others they are a source of cooking fuel. Livestock also provide clothing, shoes and leather. It is arrogant and culturally insensitive to brand animals primarily as commodities (do that to dogs or horses and see which reactions you get in the Sweden, UK or the USA!). If other functions and values of livestock are recognized, the costs and impacts of livestock also needs to be distributed across those categories instead of being seen as a result of diets.

Calculation of greenhouse gas emissions biased against ruminants

The authors base their calculation of greenhouse gas emissions only on methane and nitrous oxide, thus leaving carbon dioxide out of the equation. They don’t provide a reasonable explanation for why they do that. The reason is probably how the IPCC classify emissions. Most people would assume that for agriculture, emissions data would include pumping of water for irrigation and the production of artificial fertilizers, but they don’t. Production of artificial fertilizers is booked under “industry” and if you use an electric pump irrigation power falls under “power generation”. As a matter of fact not even the fuel for tractors or dryers or any other fuel used in a farm is booked under “agriculture” in the IPCC methodology. Essentially there are no CO 2 emissions at all as a result of farming according to this methodology. But of course there is in real life. Lifecycle analysis will include those emissions under agriculture, and they tell quite a different story. For most crop production systems, CO 2 emissions are much bigger than methane and nitrous oxide emissions. A recent study of Chinese agriculture shows that it is only in paddy rice production that methane and nitrous oxide emissions exceed CO 2 emissions. In most cropping systems, nitrogen fertilizer production was the main source of greenhouse gas emissions. Research from Australia shows that 65 % of the greenhouse gas emissions caused by the growing of vegetables comes from electricity for irrigation, cooling, washing etc.

By excluding CO 2 from the calculations the proportional contribution of ruminants to greenhouse gas emissions is grossly exaggerated. This can be seen in the values used in the calculations in the article (which are find in the extended data table 3). For beef, the authors use the figure 32 kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) per kg while for vegetables the figure is just 0.06 kg CO2e per kg. But lifecycle analyses of vegetable production mostly end up with 1 kg or more, twenty times the value used in this research. If vegetables are grown in heated greenhouses or air-freighted the emissions will be up to 100 times higher. Also for the other crops values are much lower than the results of LCAs, e.g. wheat in the study has 0.23 kg CO2e GHG intensity, while LCA analysis normally will rate it 0,5 kg to 1 kg. Intensive livestock systems based on cultivated crops, e.g. poultry and pigs, are also assigned proportionally very low emissions due to the methodology chosen. The researchers use 1.41 kg CO2e per kg of poultry, while the FAO estimates the global average to around 6 kg CO2e per kg.

The effects of methane emissions are misrepresented

The authors mechanistically express methane emissions as carbon dioxide equivalents. While this is common and follows an established standard, it is not appropriate in general and in particular not for such a long period of time. In the article New use of global warming potentials to compare cumulative and short-lived climate pollutants in Nature Climate Change, Myles Allen (one of the authors of various IPCC-reports) and colleagues demonstrate how the calculations for expressing methane in carbon dioxide equivalents misrepresent the real impact on climate. For short-lived greenhouse gases the comparison with carbon dioxide based on a pulse of emissions of both gases (which is the basis for the recalculation to carbon dioxide equivalent emissions) gives a reasonably correct result only in a time span of a few decades. In the longer term, the more correct comparison is between a pulse of carbon dioxide and a constant rate of methane emissions. Constant methane emissions do not cause any increase in global temperatures after a few decades, while constant carbon dioxide emissions lead to cumulative increases for thousands of years. The article should have based its calculations on the actual impact on global temperature (which is the real planetary boundary) instead of taking the detour via carbon dioxide equivalents.

Huge uncertainties regarding nitrous oxide

The data used in the calculations are based on fixed emission of methane and nitrous oxide per kg product. For methane the main problem is described above, but for nitrous oxide the problem is that the values used are so uncertain. Lifecycle analysis and the IPCC use emissions factors which are calculated as if there were linear relationship between the amount of manure applied and nitrous oxide emissions and the use of chemical nitrogen (N) fertilizer and the emissions. But research show that there is no such linear function, and in most cases low N-intensity leads to much less emissions per kg N than high N-intensity. Through the use of constant emission factors, nitrous oxide emissions for extensive production (e.g. pastured ruminants, or low yielding grain cropping) are grossly exaggerated, while emissions from intensive production such as industrial pork or poultry production or conventional vegetable farming are underestimated. How dubious the emission factors are best shown that when New Zealand recalculated its nitrous emissions based on actual measurements instead of the IPCC emissions factors, nitrous oxide emissions from its big dairy sector was reduced with 60 %. The uncertainties in the calculation of nitrous oxide emissions from soils puts into question if the kind of detailed calculations made by the authors is meaningful at all. In any case it would have been reasonable to declare and discuss the huge uncertainties regarding nitrous oxide emission, following good research practice.

Agriculture raw material vs food on the plate

The article talks about the “food system”, but ultimately, apart from the food waste, the article is about the agriculture production of raw materials. The rest of the food chain, however, has many impacts, use of water, effluents and emissions. In developed countries the greenhouse gas emissions post farm gate may well equal those at the farm gate. Those emissions are caused by transport, food processing, storage, cooling and cooking. There is no reason to believe that livestock products are overrepresented here. This means that if you are to replace meat products with more vegetables, fruits, vegetable oil and legumes, which is what the article suggests, there will be no big potential for savings in the post farm stage. By omitting the impact of post farm emissions, the relative impact of meat in general and ruminant meat in particular, for the emissions of the food system, is exaggerated.

Summing up – quite a different picture emerges

According to the article, emissions from animal products cause 77 % of the “food-related” greenhouse gas emissions. However, that is the projection for 2050. If we take the figure for 2010 they cause 72%. But is this really correct?

If we add CO 2 emissions in agriculture and emissions in the rest of the food chain we increase total emissions with 100-200 %. This is in line with global estimates by Vermeulen et al 2012. An assessment of the emissions in the EU food chain by Camanzi et al, concluded that CH4 and N20 contribute less than half of total emissions in the whole chain and that emissions post-farm are much higher than previously estimated. If we assume, rather conservatively, that emissions of CO 2 from agriculture and all greenhouse gases post farm gate corresponds to 150 % of the methane and nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture, around 40 % of the total emissions can be attributed to livestock (with all the reservations stated above) – coincidentally the same proportion as their contribution to global protein supply. If we skip animal products altogether the net “saving” of emissions will not be that high as livestock products have to be replaced by other products. The net saving will depend on which products that will replace animal products, but it likely to be in the range of 20%. It will be higher if animal products are replaced by pulses, root crops and grains, and lower if animal products are replaced by exotic fruits, soft vegetables and processed foods, i.e. the kind of non-animal foods that dominates in developed countries.

By phasing out fossil fuels, including its use for fertilizers and global transports but with no change in global diets, total emissions would be reduced by more than 50 % of the current emissions, according to my back-of-the-envelope calculations. It is strange that scenarios for our future food system don’t include the phasing out of fossil fuels, as that would have a huge impact.

As little as we can predict the real outcome of a phase-out of animals from the food system can we predict the outcome of a total de-carbonization. Food and agriculture are very dynamic systems where you can’t change just one thing. In reality, phasing out fossil fuels would also change diets a lot, as it would change both availability and relative prices of food. Poultry and pork would become much more expensive. Pasture raised animals would be less costly. Global competition in foods would be much less intensive and prices will go up, which would stimulate local production and it would reduce waste etc. Use of artificial fertilizers would fall dramatically. They could still be produced with non-fossil fuel processes, but they would be considerably more expensive, which in turn would reduce nitrous oxide emissions considerably.

Conclusion

The assumptions and limitations of the article Options for keeping the food system within environmental limits give it a very strong bias against ruminants. The conclusions of the article as communicated by the lead author are not supported by their own research.

I have no problem with ”eating less meat” as such. But it is the wrong entry point for an intelligent analysis of our food system. Increase in meat consumption is primarily caused by a massive overproduction of staple crops driven by the use of artificial fertilizers and pesticides. Those cheap staple crops form the basis for the industrialization of meat production and a production model where animals have been separated from the land and the land has been put into monocultures. That kind of livestock system is wasteful and unethical, and “we” should not eat its products – at all. But livestock which is properly integrated into an ecologically sound agriculture system is not wasteful. It can clearly increase productivity of the whole system, it can vitalize the soil and sequester carbon at the same time. Even the last IPCC report concludes that: “Overall, there is high agreement that farm strategies that integrate mixed crop – livestock systems can improve farm productivity and have positive sustainability outcomes.”

1.3 billion people depend on livestock for their livelihoods and some 200 million are agro-pastoralists. In arid and semi-arid lands, mountainous areas, non-arable land and natural rangelands, pastoralism is the only possible production system that allows to transform non-edible plants and marginal lands into nutritious food (meat and milk). These lands cannot be used in any other way for human consumption if not grazed by animals. Many of the pastoralists consume very high levels of animal products.

The environmental impact of the food chain is too high. The main driver of destruction is the globalized fossil fuel economy and industrial agriculture of plants and animals. Once we redesign agriculture into sustainable and regenerative systems where land, people and food are “re-coupled”, diets will be diverse and adapted to the local ecological conditions, population densities, etc. The notion of some kind of globally averaged diet is flawed. The share of animal products in peoples’ diets will vary from very high to very low depending on the conditions, in the same way it has always done.

“They think it’s about thrill-seeking and cheating death,” he says. “But for me it’s the opposite; it’s about being out in nature, living life to its fullest, and making sure that everything is done with meticulous preparation and safety.”

Those habits got him elected vice regent, or Vice Bupati, for the administrative district of Musi Banyuasin, in South Sumatra, Indonesia, where he developed his current passion: sustainable development.

It’s a calling he received during the 2015 wildfires that left swathes of his district in cinders and filled the lungs of people as far away as Singapore and Malaysia—where, ironically, many of the companies responsible for the devastation were located.

“These fires started because our farmers were clearing forest to grow palm oil,” he says. “But our farmers were selling to companies in Singapore, and sometimes working for them directly, and it hit me that we have a shared responsibility to address this.”

Indonesian attorney Gita Syahrani agreed, and today the two are among the leading force of something called the Sustainable Districts Association (Lingkar Temu Kabupaten Lestari in Indonesian, or “LTKL”), which unites administrative districts that are scattered across Indonesia in a coordinated effort to better manage their forests, farms, and fields. Research shows that these activities can get the world 37 per cent of the way to meeting the Paris Climate targets, but they attract just 3 per cent of climate finance.

The LTKL aims to bridge the funding gap by creating districts that can attract investment capital—in part by establishing long-term uptake agreements with companies that want to comply with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which the United Nations created in 2015 to drive finance into clean development.

2015: The great confluence

The 193 countries of the United Nations General Assembly adopted the SDGs three years ago—on September 25, 2015—three months after the wildfires had begun engulfing Southeast Asia and two weeks after South Sumatra had declared a state of emergency.

It was the lead-up to the year-end climate talks in Paris, and Indonesia had already pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by slowing deforestation—a pledge that was formalised in its climate action plan, or Nationally-Determined Contribution (NDC) to the climate challenge when the Paris Agreement was adopted in December.

“All of this stuff was happening at once,” says Hernedi. “The national government had its NDC, which we wanted to support, and it has also adopted the SDGs, which seemed like a way to get finance flowing into the district to support sustainability, and the wildfires were a real wake-up call, so I started looking for entry points into these processes.”

That’s when he learned of another initiative that had begun one year earlier—the New York Declaration on Forests (NYDF), which is a non-binding agreement to cut the global rate of deforestation in half by 2020 and end it by 2030. The NYDF focuses on four commodities responsible for most of the world’s deforestation—namely, beef, soy, palm oil and pulp & paper.

“In my district, palm oil was the big problem,” he says. “And most of the signatories were active here.”

Indeed, three of the NYDF signatories—Golden Agri, Musim Mas, and Wilmar—were located in Singapore, while one was in Malaysia (Sime Darby), one was in Indonesia (Asian Agri), and all had interests in or near his district.

More importantly, all five of these regional players were members of a global sustainability network called the Tropical Forest Alliance 2020 (TFA2020), which was created to help businesses, governments, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) meet the 2020 targets.

Hernedi started attending regional meetings, where he learned that TFA 2020 had scheduled its first General Assembly for March, 2016, in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.

There, he found other Bupatis who shared the same goals—and faced many of the same challenges.

“ Sustainable development is a long-term endeavor, but Bupatis only serve for five years. Beni Hernedi, Vice Bupati, administrative district of Musi Banyuasin, South Sumatra, Indonesia

The challenge

Indonesia’s Bupatis often get blamed for the country’s rapid deforestation, which kicked in after the fall of President Suharto in 1998. Authority over forests was then decentralised, so Bupatis started granting forest-development concessions to fund their local economies and, sometimes, line their own pockets.

The 2015 fires, coupled with the advent of the SDGs and the Paris Agreement, may have sparked an awakening among some, but sustainability-oriented Bupatis found themselves in a quandary.

“Sustainable development is a long-term endeavor, but Bupatis only serve for five years,” says Hernedi. “Also, any budgetary allocation for forest conservation is handled by federal or provincial authorities who don’t always understand what’s needed on the ground.”

In a forested rural economy, the challenge of sustainable development becomes a challenge of sustainable agriculture and forest management—which requires changing practices and managing expectations.

“We can talk about getting certified under, say, the Indonesia Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) standard or the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), but that requires up-front investment and education,” says Hernedi. “We need help with that, and I need to be able to offer my people, the smallholders in particular, some sort of assurances that their efforts will be rewarded.”

Coming together

When Hernedi met Syahrani in 2016, she was working as the World Resources Institute’s (WRI) Sustainable Commodity & Business Manager for Indonesia—a position she’d taken after acting as the private-sector liaison for the National REDD+ Agency, which was a body tasked with helping the country dock with international climate agreements around forestry.

“I’d been working with the districts to develop their green growth vision, and that gave me a chance to see how committed they were,” says Syahrani. “That was part of a program that wound down in 2016, and the Bupatis invited me out for a goodbye dinner.”

It didn’t, however, feel like goodbye, as the conversation swirled around the endless possible linkages between district green growth plans, the country’s climate change strategy, and global demand for deforestation-free commodities.

The next day, Syahrani got a call from Hernedi asking if they could keep the conversation going.

“Up to then, we’d been focused on palm oil, because so many companies had commitments in that commodity,” says Hernedi. “We realised, however, that we could cooperate on other commodities as well, but that it’s also strategic to have a caretaker help put this together, and Gita seemed like the perfect person for that.”

Syahrani floated the idea with three organisations: the Sustainable Trade Initiative (IDH), the Indonesia Palm Oil Smallholders Association (SPKS), and the Indonesian Association of District Governments (APKASI) and found enough support to arrange a two-day workshop in December, 2016.

“We were all working pro-bono, but had enough money to get some meeting rooms,” she says. “Then we invited 15 districts to participate, and eight of them sent delegations.”

The districts, it turned out, had well-developed but extremely varied development programs.

“We had a rigorous discussion around core principles, and agreed that balance was key—that growth and environmental conservation and social welfare should all have equal footing.”

Indonesians have a word for that kind of balance: “lestari”, which means “keeping things as they are” but implies balance, preservation, and sustainability. They quickly settled on a name: Lingkar Temu Kabupaten Lestari.

“It’s new kind of jurisdictional program—one that’s spread across eight founding districts that are themselves spread across the country,” says Syahrani. “LTKL is important because it’s being developed from the bottom up, at the most basic level of Indonesian government, rather than from the top down.”

LTKL was formally incorporated in partnership with APKASI by July 2017 and Syahrani formally switched gear to head the LTKL Secretariat. By September 2017, LTKL participated in its first TFA 2020 Implementation Dialogue. There, Hernedi was one of the key speakers, providing an opportunity to learn directly from global trading groups what companies need from—and can offer—the districts.

That dialogue has since led to trial purchases from smallholders, and a subsequent meeting led to cooperation on fire prevention in peatlands.

Meanwhile, his district has found synergies with several other districts—most notably the district of Sigi in Central Sulawesi, 70 per cent of which is protected forest that must be conserved.

“They were having trouble developing a business case for forest management, and we offered to help them make their case to at the national level through LTKL,” says Hernedi. “They have a competitive edge from the beginning with their strong commitment on agrarian reform and agrarian conflict resolution.”

Learning from Sigi, Hernedi has also set up a specific task force to help his district deal with agrarian reform and agrarian conflict resolution—a critical building block before any investment to further support sustainable development can start flowing. In parallel, LTKL has also helped Sigi and other members get involved in national discussions on better fiscal policy to support sustainable districts.

LTKL is hardly alone. Malaysia’s Sabah Province is well on the way to becoming a sustainable jurisdiction, and IDH is working with several other provinces across Indonesia, while Brazil’s Green Municipalities are striving to attract international companies that have pledged to purge deforestation from their supply chains.

In each case, local people and authorities have bet on those companies keeping their promises, and now the question is: will they?

The NYDF focuses on four commodities responsible for most of the world’s deforestation—namely, beef, soy, palm oil and pulp & paper.
“In my district, palm oil was the big problem,” he says.
“We can talk about getting certified under, say, the Indonesia Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) standard or the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), but that requires up-front investment and education,” says Hernedi.
In parallel, LTKL has also helped Sigi and other members get involved in national discussions on better fiscal policy to support sustainable districts."

Entrepreneurship refers a process adopted by an individual or group of individuals coming together to design, launch and run a new business, in an innovative and more sustainable way. The business opportunity may starts with a small set-up but has potential to grow and expand through technical and managerial inputs. Individuals who create and run these businesses are called entrepreneurs, while those who bring money for these new ideas are termed as investors. In other words, it is a process of identifying new opportunities in a given set of possibilities proportionate with risk and its return as identified by an individual or group of people.

Individuals, institutions, and policymakers use different definition of Entrepreneurship depending upon context, reference, experience, and usability. Entrepreneurship includes various tangible and non-tangible aspects of growth like economic activity, market establishment, innovativeness, sustainability, risk management, social development, employment creation, and local asset creation.

Although the idea of entrepreneurship starts with wealth creation for self or the promoter, during its complete life cycle of innovation and resource optimization its benefits sprinkle to various strata of engaged individuals as well as the society where it is conceived, piloted and implemented. During this whole process, the final market where product or service is launched also gets some strength to develop further and engage new consumers. Entrepreneurs use available resources and play within set rules of compliances. On one hand their idea needs to be innovative, while on other side it should be economically and environmentally sustainable with fair to good alienation from political and legal clutches. Entrepreneurship within its scope stores a possibility to create, prosper and grow local economy at large extent; this further can be supported by the policy of state and capacity building of overall enterprise.

The current state of growth in India is facing critical challenges at different facets like unemployment, value chain strengthening, local asset creation, inclusivity and convergence of various schemes for resurgence of communities facing exclusion to various human development parameters as set by Sustainable Development Goals (suggested by UN). New enterprises possess the capability of adding value to national income and churn the local economic development and finally add value to national growth. Any enterprise adds value to its employees, producers and then the market players; this full cycle of value addition increases the economic cycle of resource and share value additions with all those who participate in this cyclic function of growth.

Entrepreneurship while giving benefits to promoters, creates a competitive environment among promoters, investors, and policymakers for their own interest; but in all permutations, it benefits stakeholders and finally the consumers. The point here is; Entrepreneur supported in a rural area can create value for society at the level where it is needed the most. Vulnerable communities dwelling in rural areas do not have access to various basic needs, but certainly, some communities do have the potential to foster and have business ideas/activities which can be developed into successful enterprises. Enterprises supported in rural areas can deliver long-awaited results of attaining inclusive growth, where all section of society can participate in contribution as well as utilize the benefits of economic growth. Other parameters associated with enterprise development like default options and exit strategy for small enterprise in rural or semi-urban outset can be controlled in a more strategic way with minimal to no loss. Although, the potential for growth is high but the loss is limited; this creates an opportunity for an investor to fund selected innovations in these areas.

Entrepreneurship sphere is changing very fast due to changing enabling factors; certainly for the good of communities and investors, with an underlying possibility of technology infusion wherever possible. Modern-day entrepreneurship is a bit different from its older versions where it took time to replicate the innovations and data was limited. In today’s world where technology is the driver, innovations are fluid, data is immense, replication is easy and monitoring of remote enterprise within an analytical framework is quite easy yet affordable.

Women entrepreneurship – A multidimensional approach to development

While entrepreneurship and its related benefits were discussed, it adds entirely new dimensions if we talk about women entrepreneurs or women-owned/run enterprises. Various international institutions in their approach to development have accepted that women is a building block to any household and hence community and can be seen or treated as development enablers. The parallel system of civil society and Panchayati Raj System have helped to create self-help groups, many of those are now matured enough to take up certain economic activity to the next level of institutionalization. Women as an entrepreneur can add value to her own household and then to society in a more effective and sustainable way. On one hand, they can add value to nutrition, health, education, and other basic requirements through increased income; while on the other hand their (those who are part of SHGs for a long time) sense of community growth through enterprise promotion is better than rest.

Many research studies have shown that economic development of the country can take place only when women are brought in the mainstream of economic development, the same is realized by the Government of India. For realizing inclusive development, it is important that the community and its members at grass root level should involve in development programmes designed for economic growth. This among other things, call for a need of women centered entrepreneurship development programmes to enable them in starting an enterprise. Recent policies look up at women as change agents rather than welfare recipients; lot of awareness creation and capacity building has been done. This step helped brought women to the center of the stage, as change enabler rather than peripheral counterparts to accept economic or social benefits; they are now considered as value creator for economic development of society.

It is estimated that – over the past few years, India has record growth in women entrepreneurship and more women are pursuing their career in this direction. At a global level, about 126 million women have started or are running their businesses and whereas in India, there are about 8 million women have started or are running their businesses. Apart from that, women have 24% share in corporate senior management positions and in India it’s 30% for the same. Not only that, round about 37% of formal enterprises owned by women around the globe whereas 10% of formal enterprises in India are being operated by women.[1] These figures look promising, but another fact should also be presented here – most of these enterprises are prevalent in large metropolitan cities or places which are accessible to knowledge, finance, market, and technical expertise is high.

In my view, women entrepreneurship can address various critical issues if promoted among SHG members and other women-led enterprises in rural and semi-urban geographies. Development policies are already available in raw form, this gives an opportunity of convergence among private sector CSR activity and government-sponsored social development schemes. Along with technical support women entrepreneur also need motivation for taking their income generating activity to next level of formal entrepreneurship, to add value to a large part of the community. A good blend of awareness, mentorship, linkage and handhold support can certainly change the way policymakers look at rural development participation in the overall economic growth of the country.

SBI is the largest commercial bank in India with a market share of 20 per cent of the country’s total deposits, advances, customers and branches while the UK government’s Department for International Development (DFID) works towards building a safer, healthier, more prosperous world for people in developing countries by providing developmental capital.

The investment was made by Neev Fund, an infrastructure-focused private equity fund that was created as a partnership between SBI and the DFID.

The investment was made to further the mandate of the fund, which aims to provide capital to portfolio entities to achieve long-term capital appreciation while promoting sustainable development.

The fund is managed by SBICAP Ventures, an alternative asset manager and a wholly owned subsidiary of SBI Capital Markets, which was ranked number 1 Global Bookrunner by Thomson Reuters with a volume of USD 7.7 billion.

With an objective to invest in the low income and developing states of India, Neev provides financial assistance for infrastructure sectors that directly relate to sustainable development including renewable energy, healthcare, education and urban solutions.

Blue Planet is one of the few players in the region which is focused on a technology-driven integrated solution to waste management in India, offering services spanning from waste collection to resource recovery and upcycling.

“We are delighted to be associated with the Neev Fund, who have a good understanding of this space and are backed by impactful investors such as State Bank of India and the Department For International Development of the United Kingdom,” said Prashant Singh, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blue Planet Environmental Solutions.

He added: “We believe that our partnership with the Neev Fund will give us additional impetus as we aggressively scale up the business in the waste management space.”

Making waste sustainable

Given the accelerating rate of urbanisation and growing waste volumes in India and in wider Asia, there is an urgent need to develop capacities in waste management to achieve responsible and sustainable economic growth.

The waste management industry in India is currently highly fragmented and inefficient, and lacks the capacity to handle the ever-growing volumes of waste. This, in turn, results in social exclusion, environmental degradation and resource wastage, amid other societal issues.

With a vision to consolidate the waste management industry, Blue Planet will expand its operations in the region by deploying innovative technologies that enable maximum resource recovery in several waste streams.

Blue Planet’s mission and solutions are also catered to create net positive social and environmental impact aligned with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.

The company adopts the Triple Bottom Line ethos of ‘People, Planet, Profit’ throughout its operations and is focused on the integration of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) aspects in its core business strategy and reporting processes.

By practising equal opportunity and providing employment to vulnerable groups of society, the company hopes to address urban deprivation and empower women and other marginalised communities.

Technology-driven execution

Blue Planet holds and continues to acquire scalable technologies to manage a variety of waste streams that can be customised based on the region’s requirement. Ranging from processing thin-film plastic waste to processing organic waste, the company provides a wide spectrum of solutions to achieve Blue Planet’s ‘zero waste to landfill’ policy.

Blue Planet’s solutions are catered to optimise resource recovery by employing innovative solutions like smart bins and high-efficiency segregation.

Manav Bansal, Chief Executive Officer of the Neev Fund said: “Blue Planet has demonstrated a unique advantage in the waste management business by successfully introducing global waste management technologies in India.”

“Moreover, the strategic vision of creating an on-ground impact for communities and environment aligns with Neev’s vision of creating an impact and we are proud to partner with Blue Planet,” he added.

It’s almost 2019, and the time has arrived to make resolutions. This year has been…something. There have been highs, like the collective uprising of women against sexual harassment and patriarchy, galvanizing change in the form of the #MeToo movement. And there have been lows. To me, the most sobering news came in October, when the UN’s Climate Change report basically gave us twelve years to limit global warming to a maximum of 1.5C. Beyond this, the report warns that a rise of even half a degree will significantly worsen risks of poverty, drought, floods, and extreme heat for millions of people. It’s almost too late.

Climate change will spare no one–especially the poor–but the truth is that women – as historically oppressed and discriminated against – will be disproportionately affected. UN studies have shown that 80% of people displaced due to climate change are women, that their roles as primary caregivers and providers of food make them more vulnerable when droughts and flooding occurs. Globally, women are poorer than men, making it difficult for them to recover from disasters.

A subgenre of feminism – ‘ecofeminism’ – explores the underlying connection between the exploitation of the environment and the oppression of women in society. The term is said to be coined by Françoise d’Eaubonne, in her book Le Féminisme ou la Mort (1974). She relates the oppression/domination of subordinate groups (women, people of colour, the poor) to the oppression/domination of nature (animals, resources).

UN studies have shown that 80% of people displaced due to climate change are women

Delhi-based feminist Vandana Shiva argues that “the marginalization of women and the destruction of biodiversity go hand in hand.” She posits that women have a special connection to the environment through their daily interactions, allowing them to generate wealth in partnership with nature. The (masculine, Western) capitalist reductionist paradigm ignores how nature, women’s lives, work, and knowledge are tied to the creation of wealth. Ecofeminism examines environmental exploitation through the eyes of the most marginalized, and recognizes the catastrophic ways in which environmental degradation will disproportionately affect women.

As feminists, then, sustainability should be at the center of our existence. There are several areas in our own lives where we can begin to make small changes. Our wardrobes are a good place to start. With brands such as Forever 21 and H&M popping up in every mall across the country, it is worth reminding ourselves of the “dark side of fashion” and its connection to feminism. 80% of garment workers are women, often working in inhumane conditions. Recall the Rana Plaza Factory collapse in Bangladesh, where over a thousand died making T-shirts that often languish at the back of closets of the privileged.

Fashion is the second-largest polluting industry after oil. Let that sink in for a moment. One key reason is the industry’s use of synthetic fibers. Because they are the cheapest to manufacture, they are found in 60% of garments in stores – 21.3 million tons of polyester. Synthetic fibers are non-biodegradable, meaning that clothes made of this plastic stay in landfills forever. Natural fibers such as cotton – though degradable – also contribute to agricultural pollution. Cotton is the ‘dirtiest crop’ in the world, using about 16% of the world’s pesticides, carcinogens that can affect the health of field workers and the ecosystem.

Delhi-based feminist Vandana Shiva argues that the marginalization of women and the destruction of biodiversity go hand in hand

If you want to curate a sustainable wardrobe, the key is to not set yourself up to unrealistic standards. Being aware of the environmental impacts of your consumerist choices is a good place to start. Make small, incremental changes to your closet. Have a wardrobe plan for the future – this is so much fun, and also makes the things you do buy so much more valuable and worth cherishing. Here are seven tips and resources to help get you started.

1. The 30-time-wear-rule

Sustainable fashion doesn’t have to be an elitist idea. The cardinal rule of sustainable fashion is the question ‘Will I wear this at least 30 times?’ The next time you reach for something in a shop, ask yourself this. This is especially crucial if you are shopping a sale, or somewhere with low prices, and you feel bad about leaving a potential ‘steal’ on the shelf. Trust me – no one cares if you repeat outfits. They really don’t. If you have friends giving you a hard time for doing so, ditch them.

2. Clean out your wardrobe

You don’t have to throw out and replace everything you own, including all the fast fashion stuff. That’s not sustainable. A sustainable wardrobe is a curation of pieces you love and wear often. Here’s what I did. I divided each item of clothing (T-shirts, pants, dresses, kurtas) into three piles: one with the things I wear often/all the time, the second with the pieces I wear sometimes/occasionally, and the third with stuff I rarely (if ever) wear. I was shocked at how much bigger this third pile was than I thought it would be.

Most of the cotton used in the fashion industry is grown in the USA, China, and India. The average white cotton T-shirt takes about 2700 liters of water to make. Growing demand for water for agriculture has contributed to the depletion of India’s groundwater reserves, leaving about half the country without access to clean drinking water. There were about 12 T-shirts in my hardly-been-worn pile, meaning that over 30,000 liters of water had been used to feed my impulse purchases – in vain. I felt like a criminal. Watch this TED video to get a deeper understanding into the lifespan of a t-shirt.

3. Donate/Sell

Here’s where the hard stuff happens – parting with your clothes. If you love them as much as I do, you’ll find yourself struggling emotionally with that third pile. But if you haven’t worn something in a year, chances are you’ll fall short of the 30-times rule. So, help your clothes find a willing wearer. Often, when stores accept returns, the article ends up in landfills anyway, so look for places that will accept gently worn or secondhand clothing.

Here’s a list of places where you can sell secondhand clothes online. Red Empress is a great brand bringing affordable, gorgeous vintage shopping culture to India. If you live in New Delhi, you can buy from and donate your clothes to Sisters of the People – a completely women-run thrift store. You can feel even better about your decision knowing that the revenue they generate is used for running schools and senior citizens’ homes. Shared Wardrobe is a great fashion blog and consignment store that will accept your preloved clothes.

4. Recycle/Upcycle

Give your old and worn T-shirts a new life by reusing them as night clothes, or gym wear. I practice yoga almost daily, and cute gym clothes are my biggest vice. Lycra – used extensively in sports clothing – can take up to 200 years to decompose in a landfill, so I just cannot justify my Nike shopping habit anymore. Happily, I haven’t purchased a single workout T-shirt in my life, and have been using old ganjis for the longest time. When these T-shirts get too old for the gym, I recycle them into night clothes. Nothing is more comfortable than an old, soft shirt. 100% of my night clothes are either hand-me-downs of soft cotton pants, my own old salwars, and tees, or my husband’s massive T-shirts and boxers. I remember wearing my favourite night shirt for my 12th standard Pol Sci board exam, which makes it almost 13-years-old.

Upcycling is using a product intended for one purpose as something else. Saris are perfect for upcycling. They make beautiful and one of a kind curtains, bedspreads, or cushion covers. They also make gorgeous blouses, dresses, and skirts. Other old clothes can be reused as cleaning rags.

5. Shop Consciously

Shop secondhand. Buy versatile pieces in neutral shades. Nothing says style like a crisp white shirt, and I bet this will be true ten years hence. I continue to wear many of my white shirts from law school, several of which are about 8-10 years old. These closet staples are beautiful canvases you layer clothing on. By adding scarves, jackets, statement jewelry, or make up, you can create a look that’s quintessentially you. If you’re buying cotton, try to buy organic, which don’t use pesticides. Seek out brands that are ecofriendly, and sweatshop free. Here’s a list of ecofriendly Indian fashion labels to get you started. Shop locally.

India is the land of glorious textiles and exquisite craftsmanship, so unique clothing is accessible. If you see a dress or a skirt you like in a fashion mag or a catalogue, buy your own fabric and ask your local tailor to make it for you. Not only will you have bespoke clothes, but this is cost-effective, and enables small businesses and artisans to thrive. When you travel abroad, make a beeline for thrift stores instead of the usual department stores. The thrill in finding an authentic Moschino vest for about 1000 rupees is unmatched. Take hand-me-downs from your family and friends. Vintage is lovely, and your clothes will be rich with stories and memories.

6. Look after your clothes

Wear the things you have without buying anything new, until they are old. Then go out, and shop with intent. Treat your clothes with love and care. Wash them according to the label instructions, make best friends with your iron. Use moth balls in your cupboards. Remove the pilling (the small, annoying balls of fluff) from your sweaters with a pair of scissors to keep them looking fresh and brand new.

7. Beyond your closet

Remember that even tampons and sanitary napkins are things you “wear” and use. Your menstrual waste will outlive you. Consider switching to a reusable menstrual cup and investing in period panties or reusable cloth pads. Explore jute bags and when buying cosmetics, look for brands that are ecofriendly, cruelty free, and natural and organic. Good luck in 2019; may it be your most sustainable year yet!

With a mission to empower the youth to take ownership of creatinga sustainable future for themselves, TERI School of Advanced Studies (TERI SAS) and Dalmia Cement on 1 November jointly kicked off‘ Climate Jamboree’ - a major youth mobilization engagement at the Thyagraj Stadium, New Delhi. The three-day movement started today in the presence of around 10,000 youth, 100 plus experts and 50 plus partners and other relevant stakeholders from India and across the world. The mission of Climate Jamboree is to unveil the power of the youth to make a difference towards achieving a climate neutral lifestyle and showcase sustainability in all its facets to create an empathy with the issue of climate change, further encouraging them to take ownership of the solutions.

The three-day event aims to connect youth to relevant stakeholders to drive climate action and empower them to achieve sustainable development goals. The aim is to create ‘Youth Voices’ that will lead to commitments, innovative solutions, and create a multiplier effect for low carbon sustainable development, and through focussed deliberations. This will lead to a holistic declaration document feeding into COP 24 to be held in Poland December 2018.

Lauding TERI SAS and Dalmia Cement for organizing Climate Jamboree Sh. Suresh Prabhu, Union Minister for Commerce and Industry, Govt. of India said, “Climate Change is a great leveller and will impact everyone in the world. Those who have no capacity to cope with it will be the worst sufferers. Today India is in a situation where like the rest of the world, we are facing its impact too. But unlike rich countries, we do not have the resources to cope with it. The droughts, floods, natural disasters, water scarcity, heat waves and many more impacts that we see are a symptom of a deep malaise called climate change.”

Puneet Dalmia, Managing Director, Dalmia Bharat Group said, “Tackling climate change is the need of the hour. Unfortunately, we all play some role in contributing to this change and it is imperative for us to act on it now. In India, Nature has always been treated as Mother and it is meant to provide and nurture and not to exploit. I strongly believe that our children should be educated about our ancient values that underline the relationship between humans and nature and the importance to maintain a balance between our needs and capacity of Mother Nature to sustain them.”

At the event, individuals from senior secondary school students, to under graduates, post graduates, researchers, young entrepreneurs and professionals between the age group 15 – 25 years will be able to learn, ideate, innovate and collaborate so as to become actors themselves in climate solutions.

Commenting further on the imperative of engaging youth, Dr. Leena Srivastava, Vice Chancellor, TERI School of Advanced Studies remarked: “India’s consumption choices, social empathy and work ethic will shape the future sustainability of not just India, but the world! Our youth must see the reflection of sustainability in all their choices, no matter which discipline of study or field they choose. Our vision at TERI School of Advanced Studies (TERI SAS) is to start a mission and an engagement process for youth to step forward and liberate ourselves from indifference towards our environment by adopting practices that ensure sustainability for all. Through Climate Jamboree we want to create platform to voice ideas on climate change and sustainability, to engage youth with thought-leaders and change-makers, to contribute to the shaping of the global sustainable development agenda.”","The three-day event aims to connect youth to relevant stakeholders to drive climate action and empower them to achieve sustainable development goals.
The aim is to create ‘Youth Voices’ that will lead to commitments, innovative solutions, and create a multiplier effect for low carbon sustainable development, and through focussed deliberations.
Lauding TERI SAS and Dalmia Cement for organizing Climate Jamboree Sh.
of India said, “Climate Change is a great leveller and will impact everyone in the world.
Through Climate Jamboree we want to create platform to voice ideas on climate change and sustainability, to engage youth with thought-leaders and change-makers, to contribute to the shaping of the global sustainable development agenda.”"

He’s 6’4 and routinely smiling, a wiry and energetic Boulder resident who for years has been a common sight hobnobbing with locals, hanging out in restaurants, driving a Tesla or riding a bike.

His name is Kimbal, and he’s an amicable, ambitious father-of-three well-known in the 300,000-population city. He’s not as recognizable in other parts of the world, despite his significant philanthropic efforts; he’s certainly not as recognizable as his older brother.

Because Kimbal’s last name is Musk, and he’s the year-younger sibling of Tesla billionaire Elon.

While he may not have as high (or, indeed, controversial) a profile in the public consciousness, however, Kimbal’s life has been just as remarkable as Elon’s. Not only has the 46-year-old become fabulously wealthy through ventures with Elon, but Kimbal also committed himself eight years ago to a mission promoting sustainable, healthy food after breaking his neck in a mountain accident and narrowly avoiding lifetime paralysis.

His injury and recovery were simply more twists in the always colorful lives of the Musk family, whose members have a mutual knack for making headlines despite their varied endeavors and passions. Elon has certainly been living up to that reputation, given the recent Twitter and pot-smoking fiascos which saw him step down as chairman of Tesla; his brother remains on the board amid the shakeup, fiercely loyal as the company is plunged into bureaucratic uncertainty.

The Musk family grew up in Pretoria, South Africa, before becoming household names in America; pictured from left to right are Elon, mother Maye, Kimbal and Tosca

Kimbal Musk earlier this year married environmental activist and heiress Christiana Wyly; they held two celebrations, one in her native Texas and another in Spain

Kimbal transferred his interests from the tech and business sector to the restaurant business and later sustainable, healthy, community-focused food; he has opened restaurants rooted in his ethos - such as Next Door in Boulder, Colorado where he is posing with his Tesla - in locations across the country

Elon and Kimbal were raised together in Pretoria, South Africa with their sister Tosca, the children of engineering consultant Errol and model/dietician mother Maye.

‘We called him the perfect child,’ his mother told Wired for a 2015 profile. ‘Kind and considerate and generous – exactly as he comes across today.’

Their parents divorced, however, and their mother moved to Canada – where all of the children would eventually follow.

Kimbal moved to Toronto at the age of 18 and graduated from Queen’s University with a degree in business, initially nursing dreams of working on Wall Street – before he actually secured a job in finance and realized he hated corporate culture. Instead, he began looking into starting his own businesses – though it was ‘quite intimidating to do my first venture,’ he told Forbes two years ago.

‘I did a business in a box called College Pro Painters,’ he said. ‘They taught you how to paint houses, how to hire and fire, how to sell, how to deal with customers. You got a one-year franchise. It was the hardest year of my life in terms of hard work. I won manager of the year. It was very successful.’

His next successful venture, however, would be with Elon, older by a year – and would launch him into the annals of US tech history as they embarked on an ambitious nationwide project.

‘Zip2 came next,’ Kimbal told Forbes. ‘Elon and I did it together. We did a road trip around the country in 1994, and we decided to do maps and door to door directions over the Internet. We were the first guys to ever do what you see on Google today.’

The startup began on a shoestring, with the pair reportedly sleeping in the office and showering in the YMCA – but it grew and grew, with clients coming to include major newspapers and chains, which utilized the information for local content.

‘He’s the techy genius,’ Kimbal told Forbes. ‘I was more on the product side. I focused on building the business, on sales, marketing, raising money. We were a good team back then.’

The brothers sold the business in 1999 for a whopping $307million – ‘the biggest cash transaction in the history of tech,’ Musk said.

‘I owned a relatively small percentage by then but it was enough for me never to have to work again. As a 26-year-old kid, I had more money than I knew what to do with. So I moved to New York and bought a really nice apartment where the elevator opened up on the floor.’

One of the main lures of New York was his future wife, Jen Lewin, who was in an NYU arts program. With his newfound leisure time and fortune, he decided to pursue another passion: cooking. He enrolled at New York’s world-renowned – and demanding – French Culinary Institute. At the time, he was on his way to making more money as an investor in Elon’s company X.com, which in 2000 was renamed PayPal and was sold two years later to eBay for $1.5billion.

Kimbal, center, opened his first restaurant in Boulder in 2004 with his then-wife, Jen Lewin, left, and English chef Hugo Matheson - a man he met by chance in the Colorado city

Kimbal says he decided to forego tech completely after surviving a 2010 accident that nearly left him paralyzed; he broke his neck on a family trip on Valentine's Day that year

‘I am not super materialistic,’ Kimbal told the Denver Business Journal. ‘I have a nice house in Boulder, but nothing fancy. I have one car, one bike.’ Pictured here is his Victorian residence downtown, which was last listed as having five bedrooms and six bathrooms

Kimbal, wearing his trademark cowboy hat, poses with his team of farmers from The Kitchen, one of his food/restaurant projects committed to serving America's 'heartland'

‘It was a class of 18, and only six would graduate because the other twelve would quit because they couldn’t handle the screaming,’ Kimbal told Wired in 2015. ‘But I really wanted to do it.’

The younger Musk brother graduated in 2001, before the September 11 attacks; when the World Trade Center collapsed, he began plying his cooking skills to help responders at Ground Zero.

‘My intent had been to go back to tech at some point,’ he told The Guardian. ‘Cooking for the firefighters, it was this just overwhelming sense of community that was created. It’s impossible to describe how intense and awesome it was to see everyone doing that. It was simultaneously the best and worst thing that had ever happened to me – to see 9/11 and be part of helping bring people together.

‘Doing that every day for 10-12 hours a day, six days a week, my brain couldn’t go back to tech. I determined right there and then to open a restaurant.’

So Kimbal and his wife set off on yet another cross-country trip with the goal of identifying the proper location for their dream restaurant, settling on Boulder, Colorado for its culture and weather, among other attributes.

There the couple met an English chef, Hugo Matheson, and the three of them opened their own restaurant in a prime location within the 300,000-person city, naming it simply The Kitchen.

‘My brother was an investor and Hugo put a little in but I was the primary financier,’ Kimbal told Forbes. ‘It cost about $600,000.’

The Kitchen, he continued, ‘was instantly profitable.’

‘The scale isn’t as big as the other businesses I’ve been a part of, but it’s more successful than any other business I’ve been involved in.’

He also became involved in a non-profit school program to teach children about food – though he did return to the tech world again while that and The Kitchen continued operating, taking on the CEO position at Internet ad business OneRiot.

The a family trip over Valentine’s Day, 2010 changed his life.

Kimball was in Wyoming with his family – he and Lewin have three children together – and he went out in the snow with his four-year-old, flying down a ski hill on an inner tube.

‘I got to the bottom of the run, the tube flipped, and I broke my neck,’ he told Forbes. ‘I was paralyzed, horizontally, for two months, and I just decided that I wasn’t going to do technology anymore. I said, I don’t care if it’s hard. I’m going to do food.’

‘I sort of got a new lease on life,’ he explained further to The Guardian. ‘I said now I have every excuse in the world to do what I want. And you know what? I’m going to work on food culture and help food become fun and part of people’s lives again. The traditional restaurant is more commercial-oriented. But I want community through food.’

Kimbal, posing between his now-wife Christiana and brother Elon, posted this Thanksgiving photo to his Facebook page; he has an active social media presence

Kimbal started non-profit Big Green which, according to its website, ‘builds permanent, outdoor Learning Garden classrooms in hundreds of underserved schools across America reaching over 250,000 students everyday (sic)'

Kimbal poses with his mother, Maye, who has worked as a dietician and model; she and her then-husband, Errol, raised the family in South Africa before the couple divorced - after which she moved to Canada, where Kimbal followed at the age of 18

Kimbal also began urban farming company Square Roots, which ' brings real, local food to people in major cities by empowering next-gen farmers to grow food in indoor, modular, hydroponic farms’

Breaking his neck, he told Denver Business Journal, gave him ‘an incredible opportunity to restart everything.’

He began looking at sustainable, sociable, healthy food production, investigating how to apply that to the American ‘heartland,’ schools and underprivileged or traditionally unhealthy communities. Through a nonprofit, he began helping to establish outdoor gardens combining play space and hands-on classroom experiences.

The first Learning Garden opened in 2011; there are now hundreds across the US, from Colorado to Chicago and Los Angeles and Memphis.

‘We opened the first Learning Garden in 2011. And we opened the first Kitchen Next Door, which was more affordable, more fun, a faster experience,’ he told the journal.

Today, his non-profit Big Green, according to its website, ‘builds permanent, outdoor Learning Garden classrooms in hundreds of underserved schools across America reaching over 250,000 students everyday (sic).

‘His urban farming company, Square Roots, brings real, local food to people in major cities by empowering next-gen farmers to grow food in indoor, modular, hydroponic farms.’

His brush with paralysis, however, also led him to another life decision – and he divorced Lewin, though the pair remain amicable and frequent collaborators. She is based in New York, where she’s a successful artist, while Musk resides in downtown Boulder.

‘I am not super materialistic,’ he told the Denver Business Journal. ‘I have a nice house in Boulder, but nothing fancy. I have one car, one bike.’

The car he mentioned, unsurprisingly, was a Tesla - which Kimbal redesigned ‘from the inside out.’ Further demonstrating his commitment to his food mission, however, Kimbal auctioned off a personal Tesla earlier this year at $10 a ticket – with the winner a 31-year-old Coloradoan. The profits went to Big Green and raised $2.1million.

And Kimbal’s loyalty to Tesla is only fitting; he serves on the board of not only the car company but Elon’s SpaceX, and Kimbal chose him as trustee of both enterprises – meaning that, should something happen to his older brother, Kimbal would make the business decisions.

Although a recent SEC settlement required Elon to step down as Chairman of Tesla - and will prevent him from holding the position for three years - the older Musk remains CEO and Kimbal continues to serve on the board, which has been thrown into tumult.

On top of his involvement with his brother’s companies, Kimbal also serves on the board of Anschutz Health and Wellness Center and Chipotle Mexican Grill.

Despite his considerable influence and national presence – and his gregarious personality - however, Kimbal has avoided the same level of fame as his billionaire brother.

Elon, left, and Kimbal, right, went on a cross-country road trip in 1994 to map content for a company called Zip2, which they later sold for $307million

Then brothers' father, Errol, pictured, has been a controversial figure in the family for years and is estranged from Elon; Errol last year fathered a child with his own step-daughter - who is 42 years his junior and was just four years old when he married her mother (now his ex-wife)

Kimbal, right, poses with Elon and his ex-wife, Talulah: their mother Maye; and Stephen Colbert; the younger Musk says of Elon: 'I have watched my brother become quite famous and it's definitely a two-edged sword. It's by no means a blessing. I mean going out to dinner with my brother is really tough. The better known he gets, the harder it gets.'

A family thrown into chaos - by its patriarch Controversy exploded earlier this year when it was revealed that Errol Musk, the father of Elon and Kimbal, had conceived a son with his own stepdaughter - whom he'd known since she was a young girl. Errol, 72, admitted that he fathered the child with Jana Bezuidenhout, 42 years his junior. He'd married her mother, Heide, when Jana was four years old, helping to raise the child and her two other siblings. Errol and Heide went on to have two biological children, as well. Elon reportedly went 'berserk' when he found out about the baby boy, Elliot Rush Musk, and Heide told a South African newspaper that her ex-husband had 'brought shame on the family' and 'ruined everything.' Errol was far more flippant in an interview with Rapport newspaper that the baby had been conceived 'in the heat of the moment.' 'I do not want to call it a mistake because no child wants to hear that they were a mistake,' said Errol, who is estranged from Elon. 'It happened one evening when Jana's boyfriend threw her out of the house and she had slept over at my house. You have to understand – I've been single for 20 years and I'm just a man who makes mistakes.' Elon, in an interview with Rolling Stone, called his father 'a terrible human being,' adding: 'Almost every crime you can possibly think of, he has done. Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done. It's so terrible, you can't believe it.' Advertisement

‘I have watched my brother become quite famous and it’s definitely a two-edged sword,’ he told the Denver Business Journal in 2015. ‘It’s by no means a blessing. I mean going out to dinner with my brother is really tough. The better known he gets, the harder it gets.’

That being said, Kimbal has his fair share of celebrity friends – whose names stretch across nearly every international area of influence, from the tech sector, politics, the arts and business.

That was glaringly evident over the summer, when Kimbal celebrated his second marriage, wedding environmental activist and heiress Christiana Wyly. Among the guests at the lavish reception – which took place in July in the picture-perfect Spanish town of Sant Marti d’Empuries – were Salma Hayek and her fabulously wealthy French husband Francoi-Henri Pinault. Barack and Michelle Obama were also rumored to have attended, along with Will Smith – and of course Elon himself.

Kimbal, of course, wore his trademark cowboy hat, and the bride wore a cream bridal gown with an embroidered bodice and tulle skirt paired with flat sandals and a crown of flowers for her hair.

The celebration followed a formal ceremony in April in the bride’s native Dallas; she is the daughter of Texas billionaire Sam Wyly and was previously married to Skunk Anansie singer Skin, real name Deborah Anna Dyer – though the couple split in 2015.

Guests at the reception – held in trendy Dallas restaurant Cedars Social – were rumored to include actor Val Kilmer and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper.

It’s unclear whether attendees included his father, Errol, from whom Elon has been estranged for years. The Musk patriarch recently sparked a rift in the family after fathering a baby with his step-daughter, who is 42 years his junior and was only four years old when he married her mother.

Elon has branded Errol ‘evil’ and a ‘terrible human being,’ saying: ‘He’s good at making life miserable – that’s for sure.

‘He’s not a happy man. I don’t know how someone becomes like he is.’

Kimbal, conversely, looked radiantly happy on his Spanish wedding day, and he’s invariably grinning in pictures as he promotes his food mission around the US. His bride clearly shares his passion for the environment and sustainability, and his commitment appears unwavering (though he did admit in one interview that he’ll sometimes ‘eat a Big Mac if I l feel like it.’

He told The Guardian: ‘For me, I like to think in terms of three months out and 50 years out. Three months out is what to do now, 50 years out is what I’d like to do before I’m dead.

‘If I look back and see specific communities where I made a difference using food, I will pass very peacefully.’

He and Elon, he said, 'have similar views ... [though] his are stratospheric, while mine are more in the ground.'","His injury and recovery were simply more twists in the always colorful lives of the Musk family, whose members have a mutual knack for making headlines despite their varied endeavors and passions.

324,https://therevelator.org/urban-ecology-sustainable-cities/,"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",The Revelator,Urban Ecology: A Bright Future for Sustainable Cities • The Revelator,"People often think of urban landscapes as concrete dystopias, but the future may reside in cities that can sustain both people and nature.

As much as we love and need nature, the human population is growing and moving to cities. In 1950 just 30 percent of the world’s population was urban, but that number is projected to rise to 68 percent by 2050. This phenomenon is giving rise to megacities — cities with populations of 10 million or more. In 1990 there were 10 megacities, but by 2030 there are expected to be 41. Ninety percent of this growth is occurring in Asia and Africa.

This rapid rate of urbanization, combined with the overall growth of the world’s population, will challenge our social systems, the way we manage natural resources, and the way we organize and build our cities. The question is, will the impact be negative or positive? The general perception is negative, but as someone who specializes in urban ecology I’m optimistic. Here’s why.

Perception of Cities

Urban areas have a bad rep when it comes to their relationship the environment. So much so that people generally consider cities to be the opposite of nature.

This isn’t without good reasoning. Since the Industrial Revolution, cities have been a place of concrete, glass, factories and office buildings. The first step in creating a new urban area was (and often still is) to remove all the natural environment’s features to make way for our rigid lines of zoning.

But our perception of urban life is changing. Over the past 50 years, environmental awareness has become more mainstream. From the first Earth Day in 1970 and creation of the Environmental Protection Agency to the rise of environmental advocates like Rachel Carson, David Suzuki, Sylvia Earle and David Attenborough, much has been done to educate and engage the greater public. In turn we’ve been able see cities in a new light.

Cities have adopted policies to incentivize LEED building certifications, urban forestry, brownfield site regulations, renewable energy, natural heritage, carbon offsetting, floodplain development restrictions, reduction of air pollutant output, stormwater management, open-space provisions in development, and most recently green roofs. These policies have led to greener, healthier cities that are more enjoyable to live in. With the implementation of these changes, we see fewer lawns and more tree plantings, fewer concrete channels and more naturalized watercourses, fewer water discharge and more constructed wetlands, fewer shingles and more green roofs, and more LEED-certified buildings.

It’s not just the public sector squeezing industries to go green — so is the private market. The demand from investors and residents to have access to parks, green buildings and a healthy living environment has created a lucrative market. According to the National Real Estate Investor, “Renters are willing to pay an extra $27.21 a month in rent to live in buildings that have green certifications — that works out to more than $300 a year per apartment in extra income.” Planting trees alone has demonstrated to raise property value from 5 to 18 percent in the United States. Roger Platt, the former president of the U.S. Green Building Council, has pointed out that “Investors now require green buildings as an international benchmark for their global portfolios.”

These government initiatives and the private market’s demand, coupled with technological advancements, are pushing a new potential for cities.

Potential of Cities

If government initiatives and private-market demand catch up and keep up with the rate of urbanization, we may just see our cities turn from concrete jungles to green paradises. Singapore is a shining example of how this could be accomplished. Between 1986 and 2007, the Singapore population grew by 68 percent, yet green cover grew from 35.7 to 46.5 percent. Certified green buildings account for more than a fifth of the floor area in the island city-state and aims to achieve a 35 percent reduction in the energy intensity of its economy by 2030 and have 80 percent green buildings.

By amplifying the blueprint of Singapore and other cities’ initiatives and bringing these models to the cities of developing nations, plant and animal communities may not only be able to survive but thrive alongside us. If this is achieved, it will be not as the result of limiting our abilities to develop but as a natural economic path to ensure cities stay livable.

Ecology and the Built Environment

Green roofs, urban forestry, green buildings, stormwater ponds, bioswales, living walls, parks, meadows and beaches will never replace the structure, quality and complexity of the ecosystems that existed before urbanization. But research has demonstrated the ability for cities to support significant levels of biodiversity (Aronson et al. 2014, Ives et al. 2015). As noted by Rosenzweig and Youngsteadt:

“Although cities are centers of consumption and land-use change, they represent a considerable opportunity for forwarding global sustainability and environmental goals. For example, cities are at the forefront in planning for climate-change adaptation and mitigation (Rosenzweig et al. 2010), and research into urban-ecosystems dynamics are revealing the potential for managing local and large-scale environmental change.” (Youngsteadt et al 2014).

Recognizing the limitations of urban ecology, there are several metrics that warrant optimism — for example, leaf-surface area. As buildings get taller and possibly more infused with vegetation, leaf-surface area may equal or exceed what’s estimated to have been present in the ecosystem that existed before disturbance on the site. To me this is an incredibly exciting prospect, as it could create a net gain of ecological services. The Bosco Verticale in Milan, Italy, is a good precedent for building that has succeeded in accommodating vegetation. This development has inspired a new generation of vegetation-infused buildings.

Species diversity is another possible optimistic metric. As we manipulate plant communities that we use, we have the ability to tweak those communities based on scientific recommendation to help support more diversity in biotic communities. A short communication by Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University on Promoting and preserving biodiversity in the urban forest notes:

“As our world becomes more and more urbanized, the urban forest will increasingly become an important reserve of biodiversity. We need to recognize the potential of urban areas to contain important amounts of biodiversity and work to promote that diversity.”

Species preservation is also a key potential product of urban ecology. We must remember that Ginkgo biloba went extinct in the wild but was able to survive due to human intervention. This could be expanded to species beyond trees with monitoring, habitat creation and protection. Other metrics may include greater volume of habitat, increased transpiration rates and increased biomass production, which could be achieved via vertical development.

The key benefit comes from vertical development’s ability to create more surface area, with the potential to generate more ecological productivity.

Future Cities

So will we allow cities to turn into concrete dystopias? Or will we create the green paradises that we deserve? By embracing urban ecology in the form of green infrastructure and biophilic design, we allow ourselves to work with nature, not against it.

We’re always learning about the benefits that natural features bring to the built environment, but we’re also learning more about plants and animals. Can we tailor the built environment to their needs? Can we couple our need of natural services with the needs of native ecosystems? Can we generate a net gain of ecological productivity?

Sustainability is the only way forward, and that’s why I’m excited about the future of cities for people, plants and animals. I’m grateful for all the unsung heroes who have created a foundation for green cities through science, education and implementation. I’m encouraged to be playing a part in facilitating it by working with governments, developers, architects and builders to implement green infrastructure and create green strategies. The future of urban ecology is not dark but bright.

The insights come as global consultants Arcadis release its 2018 Sustainable Cities Index which puts the UK capital above competitors including Stockholm, Frankfurt, Singapore, New York and Paris against three pillars of sustainability.

In producing the league table, 100 global cities were ranked on social (people – reflecting quality of life); environmental (planet - capturing green factors, including energy, pollution and emission;) and economic (profit - reflecting the business environment and economic health) factors.

The research also features new work on city archetypes and clusters aimed at explaining the implications of the rankings on the evolving relationship between the city and the citizen.

Sitting at the top, London ranked second on the ‘Profit’ index of economic performance, beaten only by Singapore. The city’s ease of doing business, top tourist attractions and multi-culturalism all combined to contribute to its success. As one of the greenest capitals in the world, with over 3,000 parks and green spaces, it reached 11th globally for environmental sustainability. It also performed particularly well for ‘quality of life’, taking the number two spot in the ‘People’ rankings.

""London's economic diversity, multi-cultaralism, world class education system and abundance of good quality green space has propelled the capital to the top spot.""

Peter Hogg, Arcadis UK cities director.

While the research makes for good reading, a word of warning has been issued to policymakers in London. With the population set to soar to over 10 million in the next decade, average house prices fast approaching £0.5 million and its transport system struggling to cope at peak times, Arcadis is calling for greater financial autonomy to plan for future growth and a commitment to vital infrastructure like Crossrail 2 and further tube upgrades.

The new data also provides welcome reading for the city of Edinburgh which has been highlighted as the “most liveable city in the world” thanks to its very low crime rate, high levels of education and the overall health of its workforce.

The city’s lively arts and entertainment culture, the Old and the New Town, both of which are World Heritage Sites, and tourism combine to make it a desirable place to live, according to researchers.

Peter Hogg, UK cities director at Arcadis, said: “London’s economic diversity, multi-culturalism, world class education system and abundance of good quality green space has propelled the capital to the top spot in the Arcadis Cities Index. With headlines dominated by Brexit and growing political and economic uncertainty, this is very encouraging news, but we can’t be complacent. Other cities will be vying for our position and we need to address our shortcomings.”

Jasmine Whitbread, chief executive of London First, added: “London’s top ranking is a welcome tonic to help banish the Brexit blues. To stay there we now need to redouble our efforts to increase housing supply, tackle transport congestion and remain open to talented people from around the world.”

When the United Nations replaced its Millennium Development Goals of 2000-2015 with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the list of outcomes grew from eight to 17. A better future went from one focused on bringing along developing countries to one bringing along everyone.

Seeking to combat “all forms of poverty, fight inequalities and tackle climate change”, the goals also brought into view the importance of engineers in achieving a brighter future.

A look at the list for the period 2015 to 2030 quickly calls up implications for the profession. Goals 6 (clean water and sanitation), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and 11 (sustainable cities and communities) have obvious engineering requirements associated with them.

According to the UN Development Programme, 40 per cent of the global population is affected by water scarcity. The demand for energy is growing, yet the need to mitigate growth in greenhouse gas emissions is clear. The planet is increasingly connected, yet four billion people have no internet access. And more than half of humanity is in cities, with this number set to become two-thirds by 2050, creating many new ‘megacities’.

There are other goals on the list that have a definite, if not immediately obvious, need for engineering. Number 12 — responsible consumption and production — will need improved methods of recycling and processing if things like food waste are to be reduced.

Then consider number 2: zero hunger. The production of more – and more nutritious – food will be aided by factors that include pest outbreak and climate modelling, safe and sustainable herbicides and fertilisers, and the development of different strains of crops and animals. All of this will require expertise from the relevant engineering disciplines.

Answering the call

The profession’s leadership is keenly aware of the need for its contribution. The global peak body, the World Federation of Engineering Organizations (WFEO), has a strategic goal of advancing the SDGs through engineering. Dr Marlene Kanga, a past President of Engineers Australia and the current President of the WFEO, tells us that “every one of the SDGs requires engineering”.

This even includes goal 16: peace, justice and strong institutions. Corruption is a huge waste for developing countries. The WFEO, said Kanga, “has a focus on anti-corruption in engineering, in infrastructure development … and we will certainly have a focus on this at the World Engineers Convention 2019”.

Bringing everyone on the planet along through the SDGs will require a noticeable beefing up of engineering muscle. As an example, it’s predicted that Africa, if it’s to meet the goals, will need a minimum of 2.5 million new engineers to create the necessary economic and social infrastructure.

Building the future

We also asked the Green Building Council of Australia, which has worked as part of the National Sustainable Development Council, about the goals’ relevance to the built environment. The GBCA, which launched the nation’s Green Star sustainability rating system, represents more than 600 companies and is “the nation’s authority on sustainable buildings, communities and cities”.

Sandra Qian, Senior Advisor of Policy and Government Relations at the organisation, said the SDGs are influencing the way its members think about sustainability issues, with “a sharper focus in our sector on getting the balance right in our cities, communities and buildings”.

Furthermore, engineers, according to the GBCA, had a “clear line of sight to the ways that SDGs can be achieved in their line of work, through those elements of the SDGs which are material, and also by influencing outcomes”, citing a program that linked with Goal 11.

“Our work with rail authorities in Victoria to develop Green Star — Design and As Built railway stations, was a great example of how engineers are using their market power to improve regular business practices by ensuring the principles of environmental, social and economic sustainability were included in their projects,” Qian said.

The SDGs offer a framework for sustainability, peace and prosperity. Engineers have an important part to play in achieving these admirable goals.

328,https://news.uchicago.edu/story/how-mapping-galapagos-could-create-more-sustainable-cities,"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",UChicago News,How mapping the Galápagos could create more sustainable cities,"Collaborating with an architectural studio hosted by Universidad San Francisco de Quito, the UChicago researchers hope their new map will serve as a baseline for tracking how neighborhoods develop over time. Because construction in the Galápagos is often the result of individuals augmenting their own homes to cater to tourists, cities are growing with minimal organized engineering and urban planning.

“People talk about sustainability in terms of climate change, urbanization or human development,” said Prof. Luís Bettencourt, the Pritzker Director of the Mansueto Institute and a leading researcher in urban science and complex systems. “But these things need to happen together, and be understood in a way that creates outcomes which are good for both people and the environment.”

“We all want to live better in the future, which means there’s going to be continued economic growth,” he added. “Does that mean that we need to consume more in ways that are detrimental to ecosystems? That’s the dilemma.”

Bettencourt knows the allure of the Galápagos well. Trained as a theoretical physicist, he remembers reading Darwin’s The Voyage of the Beagle for the first time as a teenager. When Bettencourt first glimpsed several years ago the same bay that Darwin visited, he couldn’t help but tear up.

Bettencourt joined UChicago in February 2017 as the inaugural director of the Mansueto Institute. The following spring, the organization selected a pair of scholars to accompany him to the Galápagos for four weeks: Daniel Zünd—a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute—and Andrew Mao, who was then studying computational analysis at the Harris School of Public Policy.

Universidad San Francisco de Quito and the Melbourne School of Design had already laid a foundation of research with the architectural studio started in 2015, combining architecture with data modeling systems to examine the built environment. What UChicago provided was technical expertise in computing and mapping, as well as a perspective on social sciences and policy research.

Mao, AB’17, became the project’s cyclist—a role that came with its own unique hazards. While collecting street-view images with the GoPro-outfitted helmet, he found that certain blocks were patrolled by several dogs. They didn’t take well to interlopers. On one journey, a dog broke its leash, forcing Mao to use his bicycle as a shield.

“You have to have a little bit of grit,” said Mao, now a product analyst at PayPal.

The Mansueto Institute researchers also encountered other obstacles. Internet service on the islands was often slow, forcing them to wait until residents and tourists had gone to sleep to upload photos and videos. Their drone also crashed toward the end of the trip after being carried off course by high winds.

“The lucky thing is, that was really the last flight,” Zünd said.

Added Bettencourt: “There are fundamental constraints there, which allow you to see that technology is not a magic bullet. It enables you to do certain things, but you have to use it in the right ways.”

The UChicago scholars stored the street-view images on Mapillary, a crowd-sourced service for sharing geotagged photos. That software also identifies physical elements of the landscape, producing additional data layers for everything from water and vegetation to fences and trash cans.","Because construction in the Galápagos is often the result of individuals augmenting their own homes to cater to tourists, cities are growing with minimal organized engineering and urban planning.

To fill an obvious need of urban citizens — to stay connected and charged — the startup launched the Soofa Bench, a solar-powered phone charging bench equipped with a sensor to detect pedestrian activity.

As time has passed, Soofa’s focus has remained on citizen engagement and forward-thinking innovation — though its product development has evolved the company into a competitive leader in smart infrastructure. In 2016, Soofa unveiled the Soofa Sign, a digital display that acts as a bulletin board for information on public transit, community events and local business offerings.

The Soofa Sign has become a staple for community engagement in Boston, Atlanta and Las Vegas, and the Miami-Dade region will soon welcome Soofa Signs as early as March 2019, thanks to support from Ford’s City of Tomorrow Challenge.

Edward Krafcik Soofa

“In true Soofa fashion, we built the software in a way that is fully democratized so that it's not only for cities to communicate with citizens but it really is for everybody to have a dialogue in neighborhoods ... And ultimately that's how it's financed — through the local business advertising dollars,” explained Edward Krafcik, Soofa’s Vice President of City Development.

Smart Cities Dive caught up with Krafcik to learn more about Soofa’s developments in Miami-Dade, its strategies for separating itself from digital kiosk competitors, and the pros and cons of ad-funded infrastructure.

This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.

SMART CITIES DIVE: How does Soofa Sign differentiate from kiosks like Intersection's LinkNYC, and how do you compete with those companies?

EDWARD KRAFCIK: I think fundamentally what makes us different is the fact that the platform is completely open and we're really leaning pretty strongly into this idea of the digital bulletin board. If you look at all the other kiosks, whether it's LinkNYC or there's a number of advertising companies that are creating a kiosk, at the end of the day it's about providing information to people. The way that we do it is that it's not just pushing information out, but it's really giving everyone an opportunity to respond and create their own information. So that idea of complete openness and democratization of communication is where we really fundamentally differ from a lot of the other kiosk companies.

We are fully solar-powered and wirelessly connected. The unit to install only takes four bolts on the ground — there's no need to excavate the sidewalk, there's no need to run power to it, it's completely sustainable and self-sufficient. So ultimately the unit cost is a fraction of the unit cost of something like a big kiosk, and perhaps more importantly, the time on the costs associated to install it is no more than 30 minutes.

The conversation shifted to equity, which was a topic highlighted in a recent TechCrunch article regarding ad-based infrastructure, referenced in this interview.

We've been able to deploy these in very, very livable neighborhoods, very transformative and emerging neighborhoods ... Then you go just a few miles away and we're in [neighborhoods] where there's a lot in transition, there's a lot of energy but it's not a rich neighborhood. Not a place where maybe you would see some of these bigger kiosks being able to survive because the business model doesn't enable that kind of a system to actually operate in the type of a neighborhood where there's not crazy foot traffic and there's not big brands willing to spend money to be there.

What we're doing is focusing on a deployment strategy that lets us go into all neighborhoods, whether they are very wealthy or they're emerging. So from the city's perspective, they now have a real communication platform that is equitably distributed ... We're not going to throw any competitor under the bus and say our technology is superior, but what is different is the ability to do this in the first place with a sustainable business model because we go into a neighborhood where you'll see people advertising on the sign that run a local business.

Installation of a Soofa Sign. Soofa

How is Soofa utilizing its prize money from the Ford City of Tomorrow Challenge?

KRAFCIK: So that $50,000 will fund the part of the capital and operating costs through for the first year of the signs [in Miami-Dade]. So that helps us with a pretty heavy lift ... We're still a startup so it's a pretty sizable amount of capital to go and deploy new signs.

Ford is helping with that, and they're also a title sponsor ... The sign has not only the electronic paper displays on the digital side but it also has vinyl decals ... Ford, as a title sponsor, ultimately will have their logo on that back vinyl so it's up for a year throughout the pilot, everybody knows that Ford Motors and Ford Smart Mobility is powering this communication platform and that's a strategy actually that's starting to resonate. We've done something similar in Las Vegas with T-Mobile.

We call these kind of larger companies ""underwriting sponsors,"" so it's not that dissimilar to a bike-share where someone would come in — like Citibank to sponsor Citi Bikes in New York — and they're essentially paying to have their name associated with a very beneficial public service. The only difference for us in the way that we really tell the story to a sponsor like a T-Mobile or a Ford is, instead of the bike-share where you help get people from Point A to Point B, really the goal for the sign is to help them more fully connect once they get to Point B from Point A. And I think for a brand, to be part of a conversation with the neighborhood in a city they care about in a way like this is so much more authentic than just putting a billboard up.

Can you talk me through your data collection process? What type of data is Soofa collecting, how are you protecting it and who are you offering data to?

KRAFCIK: I mentioned the bench had a sensor inside of it. So the sensor is the same sensor that we include in the sign. What this does is it measures pedestrian activity by listening for anyone with a Wi-Fi enabled device that walks by. What we get is a timestamp and an encrypted MAC address associated with the Wi-Fi enabled device.

We take that data and when we deliver it back to, let's say the City of Atlanta or the City of Las Vegas or the City of Boston, and what is returned is basically a very high-level aggregation of a time period, being a time of day split into hours with an estimated number of people that walks by. So what we then deliver is insights into the public realm usage and the public realm levels of activation, so it's quite high level. And it's all anonymized so we don't have any personal identifiable information.

When you look at the privacy policy now on our website — which we've always had, we've just made it a little more prominent — we built this privacy policy almost two years ago when we worked with the Parks Department from New York City, who at that time wanted to buy a bench. ... It had a sensor which didn't seem like a big deal, but it was a very big deal for procurement in New York. They said there's no way the Parks Department would buy a bench with the sensor unless it goes through [the city's] privacy guidelines, which at that time were just a draft. So it was pretty amazing, we actually co-wrote the New York City IoT guidelines with the City of New York Mayor's Office of Tech and Innovation, because they needed a case study to use, which was the parks project.

So there's no personally identifiable information collected. The insights are largely around understanding just how public spaces — whether it's a plaza, it's a sidewalk on a street, it's a park — how they get used, not only the number of people per time period but also the repeat visitation rate. We can look at, over a period of time, how many people are coming back to this particular space and we can look at that as a percentage of total. Then we're also doing things like dwell time to see how long somebody actually stays in a particular location.

Soofa

What does 'smart city' mean to you, or the company at large?

KRAFCIK: Ever since we started the company, the reason we started with the bench was that it was something that was ubiquitous. It was the need that everybody had which to stay connected by staying charged. I think it is helpful for the public to see a technology and keep on thinking about this term ""smart city"" and see technologies that manifest that theme as a real product.

From where I sit in particular, so much of my work is with city council members, with mayors, with real estate developers and public private partnerships, where at the end of the day there sort of needs to be this phrase that brings together a group of stakeholders. So in a lot of ways, the idea for us is that ""smart city"" is that phrase that helps connect a lot of very diverse groups and people to achieve a common theme, which is to improve the citizen experience using technology.

For us, ""smart city"" goes into being not just smart but really social — and using technology to improve citizen experience therefore means using technology to bring people together to do a lot of what was being done on the internet through social network. Replicating that, but in the real world. Not forgetting that people co-exist in neighborhoods. ... The smart city will use technology in a way that brings people outside of the apartment together in cool programs, cool events, cool neighborhood gatherings. At least how we define it, the smart city is really a sustainable and social city, with ""social"" being one of the key words.

What are you most excited for moving forward?

KRAFCIK: The phrase ""ad-supported city infrastructure"" I think is very, very scary ... In some cases, the infrastructure that's being deployed is costly in a way that really can only be recovered and be sustainably funded through large advertising dollars. And there's really no other way around it.

Advertising has become a little bit scary because, what you don't want to have happen as an elected official is put in a kiosk that is supported by advertising — and maybe you have the citizens' best interests in mind, and the kiosks will provide Wi-Fi, the kiosks will provide city services and announcements and dynamic digital wayfinding — but the problem now is, as we're seeing more of these being deployed, a lot of the advertising that needs to be shown to fund those amenities is irrelevant. It's part of a broader DMA strategy for a brand.

And then you have all the citizens saying, ""I don't really care this much about these services that are being offered because I don't want to see the advertisements. I'd rather do without the services entirely because the advertising is not relevant to me.""

""The idea for us is that 'smart city' is that phrase that helps connect a lot of very diverse groups and people to achieve a common theme, which is to improve the citizen experience using technology."" Edward Krafcik VP City Development, Soofa

I think what I'm most excited for and, as a company, what we're super excited to see is that there is a path forward where an advertisement-supported amenity like a Soofa Sign or particular community bulletin board can be funded sustainably ... In a way where the city can can get a revenue share, and that money can be reinvested into the public realm.

This is all possible. I think we're seeing a change happen. ... We can work with with larger companies to transform how they're messaging so that it's relevant to the local audience that it's being shown to, so that content is paired with relevant community content that's user generated, that's generated by local businesses, that's generated by neighborhood associations in the city.

So what you end up with is an advertising-funded asset and amenity that feels a little bit more like Instagram where you see companies really being more creative [and] thoughtful because they want to feel like they're natively part of someone's feed. That's what we're starting to see with the advertising-supported model that we have in neighborhoods.","In 2016, Soofa unveiled the Soofa Sign, a digital display that acts as a bulletin board for information on public transit, community events and local business offerings.

A new geography of power is emerging, made up of global city networks. All in all, the attractiveness of cities is based on the hope of higher purchasing power through greater opportunities, for a better quality of life. Megacities have the potential to effectively fight against poverty and enhance living conditions for a large proportion of the population – if they are managed correctly and make the most of their advantages. Nonetheless, there is a drastic need for new urban models to tackle the associated social, economic, and environmental pressures in a sustainable way.

Cities are the new engines of growth in the global economy, responsible for 80% of global GDP. It is no longer just countries that compete, but cities as well. Like there is great power competition, so will the world’s great cities increasingly compete. Every city will have to gain a competitive edge to differentiate itself from the rest. Flexible and agile cities that can diversify their resources and offer economic, social, and cultural opportunities to their citizens will not only survive but thrive. The cities that are best equipped to produce innovative, inclusive, and ethical solutions in the face of multiplying risks and threats will emerge as leaders. A clear picture emerges: cities will compete and collaborate globally as interdependent entities and will drive the future.

Speaking about megacities, let’s look for example at Mumbai, which is the financial capital of India and the second-most populated city in the world. It is not only the subcontinent’s city with the highest GDP but also ranks among the world’s top ten trade centers. The city contributes 25% of industrial output and 70% of capital transactions to India’s economy. Important financial organizations such as the Reserve Bank of India and the National Stock Exchange of India are in Mumbai. It houses the headquarters of various multinational companies and has thus become an influential commercial and entertainment center of India. It would be foolish to ignore such cities in tomorrow’s global economy.

City diplomacy could be considered a form of decentralization of international relations management, choosing cities as the key actors. In many cases, the representatives of cities involved in city diplomacy will be the mayors, given that they are often responsible for the international relations of their communities. On behalf of their cities, these key actors can engage in relations with other actors on the international stage through two-sided or multiple-sided interactions. There is a lot of room for city diplomacy to grow. It can be driven by image or investment interests, development and strategic communications complete each other.

A city relationship is formally created when the mayors or highest elected or designated leaders from two communities sign a memorandum of understanding establishing the partnership. Nevertheless, this is usually the result of a long process that involves the local city organizations along with the municipalities and other local institutions. It takes a lot of work to get to this stage, so, as in many other cases, sustained effort and clear vision pay off. So, time to shape up the in house mayoral or county staff and consolidate a stellar local talent team of global reach.

Competition matters but so does cooperation. Collaborating with neighboring or nearby cities enables cities to plan and implement actions to address emissions from energy infrastructure, public transport, food systems, waste management, and other services that often operate across municipal borders and to address cross-border climate risks. It also helps cities overcome regional or national climate-policy barriers, share the cost of staff and equipment, and secure better access to data, funding, and technical assistance – all of which can motivate other cities in the area to participate as well.

Image and Investment demand a third I in the 2020s: Innovation. The fastest way to connect cities and counties is using technology. The technological progress of recent decades has had not only a powerful but also a transformative influence on urban life. As technology progresses and becomes more affordable, the functionality and sustainability of urban practices undergo significant advancements as well. At the same time, increased access to information consolidates the role of knowledge as a powerful engine of economic growth. This enables the development of knowledge-based and connected societies. Under these continuously evolving conditions, many concepts about the organization and management of the new technological capabilities have become popular, including the smart city.

To establish an approach for the ideal future of an urban settlement that harnesses technology should be part of the integrated processes that connect cities at a regional level. In the best-case scenario, a city that aspires to become „smart‟ has an integrated, forward-looking plan that includes a vision and a methodology focused on benefiting from digital technologies to improve urban functions and develop knowledge ecosystems. Like any strategy, the plans for smart cities must be adapted to the needs, priorities, and constraints of their circumstances.

Funding for smart city projects is still carved out of overall city or department budgets, either through existing spending (e.g., IT, lighting contracts) or designated ‘smart city’ spending, which is typically relatively small. It is therefore difficult to identify the exact amount local authorities allocate to such projects. Even though a lot of the investment for smart city projects comes from the general city budget, cities have found it most beneficial to have earmarked funds for innovation initiatives. At the moment, what is clear is that the funding and budgeting has to match the ambitions of big cities and transform the smart city objective into reality.

National governments are also encouraging cities to increase funding by boosting the participation of the private sector in delivering smart city projects. Businesses’ experience with participating in the delivery of smart city projects has been dominated by pilot projects often utilizing public sector grant funding. There is room for much more. Local authorities need to make more strides towards scaling pilot projects and procuring large-scale solutions. The city must be able to articulate clearly the challenges it faces and develop a more open way for the market to respond. The sky is the limit, if the game is played well. An innovative image and investment diplomacy operation is an important way forward.","Nevertheless, this is usually the result of a long process that involves the local city organizations along with the municipalities and other local institutions.

Bogotá, Bucaramanga, Cali, Montería, Tshwane, Quito, Curitiba, Quezon City, and Dar es Salaam will receive support in implementing sustainable projects.

Bogotá

It has been announced that nine cities will receive specialist financial advice and bespoke support from global experts to develop sustainable infrastructure projects from plans to fully financed reality.

The Colombian cities of Bogotá, Bucaramanga, Cali, Montería, along with Tshwane, South Africa; Quito, Ecuador; Curitiba, Brazil; Quezon City, the Philippines; and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, will receive support over the next two years from the C40 Cities Finance Facility.

This support will allow the cities to prepare a financially-sound business proposal for projects that have been identified as priorities to meet their ambitious visions of being world leaders in delivering sustainable and inclusive climate action.

The support provided by a host of national and international experts will enable each city to develop high-quality infrastructure projects which fit the needs of its citizens. The initiative will also ensure the cities retain the skills and structures to produce a pipeline of sustainable infrastructure projects throughout the city.

The C40 Cities Finance Facility selected nine cities following a rigorous and competitive process including a call for applications in early 2018, and a competitive process to select suitable projects. Support has been offered to cities in the sectors of transportation, energy and adaptation.

“The mayors of the world’s great cities know what needs to be done to create the healthy, prosperous and sustainable cities of the future. Investors and global financial institutions need to step up and match the bold ambition being displayed by mayors,” said Anne Hidalgo, Mayor of Paris and Chair of C40. “I’m delighted that, with support from the C40 Cities Finance Facility, these nine cities will deliver the transformation that citizens are demanding for their communities.”

Bogotá, Bucaramanga, Cali and Montería are going to receive help in creating public bike-share systems. The project will make cycling more accessible and affordable, providing a healthy and safe mode of transport.

The C40 Cities Finance Facility are going to help Quito electrify the Ecovía Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor, which will improve air quality and provide greener, healthier streets for the citizens of Quito.

Tshwane will be assisted in building a 17km bicycle spine through the city, alongside the construction of a combined heat and power biogas plant.

Curitiba is going to receive help with installing solar panels on four bus terminals, and similarly Quezon City will get help installing solar panels on 50 schools to provide reliable and undisrupted power supply to support disaster risk management for Quezon City. The C40 Cities Finance Facility will help reduce the vulnerability of the Msimbazi floodplain in Dar es Salaam.

“The scientific evidence is now absolutely clear that we need urgent and radical transformations in our cities to prevent climate breakdown,” said Mark Watts, C40 Executive Director. “The C40 Cities Finance Facility is so valuable because it helps unlock the finance needed to make great ideas on paper, a reality on city streets.

Yet, it is an important debate, as valuation is key in estimating the benefits and costs of different management options. An effective valuation supports better informed decision-making in the allocation and use of the resource, as well as in the implementation of SDG6, i.e. to “ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.” For cities to qualify as water-smart and sustainable, utilities must identify the values of different benefits, explore potential trade-offs between diverse values, and include them in the decision-making processes to address efficiency, equity and sustainability concerns. This brief analyses the management of water in Kolkata and argues that, so far, the desired outcomes are yet to be met.

Introduction

In many cities across the world, rapid urbanisation and population growth have led to scarcity and rising costs of water. Today, 55 percent of the world’s population lives in urban areas, and the proportion is expected to increase to 68 percent by 2050.[1] Scientists predict that water demand will exceed supply by 40 percent by 2030, due to the combined threat of climate change and population growth.[2] Moreover, water scarcity will likely worsen due to inefficient water management and treatment systems, resulting in water loss through a network of leaking distribution pipes and dilapidated infrastructure. These challenges demand a systemic change in urban planning and urban water management.

In India, urban piped-water supply is over 70 percent, while rural piped-water supply is around 30 percent. The Government of India (GoI) aims to cover the increasing number of habitations with uninterrupted 24×7 water supply: piped-water supply with all metered household connections (designed for 70 LPCD or more). The campaign seeks to ensure that at least 90 percent of households in India have access to piped-water supply; at least 80 percent households have piped-water connection; less than 10 percent use public taps; and other 10 percent use hand pumps or other safe and adequate private water sources.[3]

With these and other more ambitious targets, the GoI initiated the “100 Smart Cities Mission” in 2015 to integrate city functions, utilise scarce resources more efficiently and, overall, improve the quality of life of citizens. Water is a crucial element in these efforts. A ‘smart city’ is envisioned to improve safety and security as well as efficiency of municipal services by linking multiple systems within a network to facilitate data-sharing across platforms. The use of information and communications technology (ICT) is at the core of enhancing a city’s liveability, workability and sustainability.[4]

The Ministry of Urban Development has identified 24 key areas that cities must address in their ‘smart cities’ plan. Of these, three are directly related to water and seven are indirectly related to it. These include: smart-metre management, leakage identification, preventive maintenance and water-quality modelling.[5] More recently, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have also being incorporated in cities’ development plans. Water and sanitation (SDG6) are at the core of sustainable development and the range of services they provide are key to poverty alleviation, economic growth and environmental sustainability.[6]

In September 2015, Indian government made a commitment at the UN General Assembly to implement the SDGs. The commitment was to make cities smart, sustainable and engines of progress by 2030, building on earlier goals of ending poverty, and providing housing and basic services to all by the early 2020s. The Smart Cities Mission is one of the many mechanisms that will help operationalise the nationwide implementation of the SDG priorities— ­ poverty, employment, and basic services (including provision of safe drinking water for all).[7]

Water-smart and sustainable city: Core ideas

A water-smart city must integrate urban planning and urban water management to create a green and resilient infrastructure that can cope with the challenges related to supplying freshwater, resource-use efficiency and energy transition, preserving freshwater sources, obtaining climate resilience, draining rainwater and waste water outside the city limits, importing water from rivers far outside the city, and minimising environmental degradation. A water-smart system is designed to gather meaningful and actionable data on flow, pressure and distribution of a city’s water.

For a city to qualify as ‘smart’ in terms of water provision, it must build a “smart and sustainable water network,” which is conditional on how well municipal water utilities manage distribution networks with available resources, create awareness regarding efficient use, provide safe water, manage leak-loss, and generate revenue. At the same time, customers need data to understand their own consumption and manage their water-use behaviour. Universal access to safe water and sanitation requires huge investments, and an appreciation of the value of water can go a long way in creating awareness among users regarding efficiency in resource use and combining economic benefits with environmental aspects, while at the same time stimulating innovation and investment.[8] While SDG6 does not specifically refer to valuing water, many desirable outcomes, including those related to SDG6, can be achieved by valuing water: universal access, adequate sanitation and hygiene, improved water quality, increased water-use efficiency, and ecosystem protection. India’s ability to value water is inadequate. The 2017 UN/World Bank High-Level Panel on Water has launched a new initiative for charting principles and pathways for valuing water. The general consensus is that valuing water goes beyond monetary considerations and future policies and investment must view valuing water as a governance challenge.[9]

The provision of water for domestic use in cities often entails huge costs, mainly related to construction and maintenance of water-treatment infrastructure and fresh and wastewater pipelines. By valuing water, governments and utilities are able to better understand the benefits delivered by these services and weigh them against the costs. Such an approach ensures that varying preferences are taken into account in the decision-making process.[10] Moreover, valuation can also indicate whether operation and maintenance recovery is possible through pricing water services, given the budgetary constraints of the utility. For the pricing to be sustainable to support the management of water resources for present and future generations, it must take into account the value assigned to the resource by its consumers for diverse uses.[11]

Robust water management, modelling and accounting are the foundations of water valuation. Smart and sustainable solutions to development of water resources require utilities to identify and value benefits associated with water at multiple temporal and spatial scales—including environmental, socio-cultural and economic—and resolve trade-offs between different values of water, incorporating them in decision-making processes.[12] A holistic valuation of water will help in its conservation, much-needed infrastructure investment, setting of water quality standards, water pricing and water allocation.

The case of Kolkata

This brief attempts to put in perspective the variability of piped-water supply in Kolkata, along with the policy of not pricing water supplied to households without bulk metres. In 2002–03, Ashok Bhattacharya, the then urban development minister of West Bengal, announced a water tax to be introduced by all municipal bodies in the state—ranging from INR 30 to 120 per month and depending upon the household’s property tax—for maintaining the financial viability of the utilities. Domestic households with bulk metred connections were to be charged INR 3/kilolitre (kl), whereas for residents of multi-storeyed complexes, the charge was fixed at INR 4/kl of water and for commercial and industrial establishments, it was INR15/kl. It was also decided that unmetered households would have to pay 30 percent of their property tax, payable quarterly to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) as water tax.[13] The move faced stiff opposition and was eventually dropped. However, the municipal body reduced the tax eligible property valuation from INR 10,000 to INR 4,600, as a result of which households with ferule size of 15 mm also came under the ambit of taxation.[14] Currently, the KMC levies a volumetric water-usage charge on commercial enterprises and any other establishment using bulk metred connections. The civic body is in a poor fiscal condition to sustain its operations, much less to achieve its target of providing 24×7 water supply to the city’s residents by 2020.

Kolkata currently faces a dilemma of whether to choose the right path of valuing water and then deciding on the pricing policy or the popular path of not imposing a price. The city, surrounded by wetlands on the east and the Ganga on the west, suffers from high variation in water availability. The dwindling supply has left most of its residents water-poor. The KMC is embroiled in a vicious circle of poor service delivery, as demonstrated by the highly unequal distribution of water in many parts of the city.[15] This can be blamed on the lack of required infrastructure, which in turn can be ascribed to the weak financial condition of the civic authority.

The lack of financial independence of the KMC is a direct result of the Government of West Bengal’s stated policy of non-imposition of water charge on domestic households that do not use a bulk metre. The genesis of the state’s policy lies in its definition of water as a “human right” to be provided free of cost for domestic consumption. By defining water in this manner, the state ignores the discrepancy between the necessity of the resource and the finiteness of it. At the 1992 International Conference on Water and Environment (ICWE) in Dublin, freshwater was declared an “economic good,” as well as a “finite and vulnerable resource.” The recognition of water as an economic commodity means water has value in competing uses. In other words, water must be allocated across competing uses in a way that maximises net benefit from the available amount of water.[16]

In actual use, water is both a social good as well as an economic one. Water satisfies various human needs and services essential for supporting basic life functions. At the same time, water also has definite uses as a market good, which have a bearing on the competitive allocation of the resource. However, water-allocation decisions through the market may be suboptimal, given the special nature of the resource. Managing water purely as an economic good hinders the socially equitable allocation of the resource for basic human needs and can also disturb the environmental flows that are essential for the sustenance of the ecological system.[17]

In practice, decisions about allocation are based on two approaches. One considers water as a free good of unlimited supply essential for basic human survival, ignoring the costs at the point of supply. This approach exempts water from allocations based on competitive market pricing, as is the case with Kolkata. The other approach favours allocation through competitive markets based on the value of pricing. The core idea underlying price-based allocation for water rests on the premise that an appreciation of the true value of water encourages wise and responsible use. Appropriately designed water tariffs will discourage or prevent waste and encourage water-saving.[18]

The concept of valuing water

The value of water exists in its ability to provide benefits in the form of flows of services over time. ‘Value’ is a broad concept that covers all people and all alternative uses, including the benefits that people will receive in the future. These benefits relate to economic, environmental, social and religious considerations. Water has value in all these facets and the existence of opportunity costs in different uses challenges the ‘free good’ status of water (making it an ‘economic good’) and requires prioritisation of water use.[19]

Valuation refers to monetisation, since the purpose of any valuation exercise is to assign a monetary value to a change in the provision of commodity or service.[20] Could this mean that a resource—in this case, water—is of less value to the poor since they have less capacity to pay for it?

Efforts to value water have advanced over the last 30 years to deal with such issues of wealth and income. There are a variety of ‘valuation methods’ that are used to collect and interpret water valuation evidence and their potential role for informing water management decisions.[21] The methods range from willingness to pay for drinking water and ecosystem services, to participatory processes that capture water’s diverse benefits. A useful classification for understanding water valuation and who may be affected by changes in water availability and supply is that of total economic value (TEV) (Figure 1). TEV provides a systematic approach for assessing the combined economic values of a variety of goods and services (benefits) provided by natural resource systems. An additional dimension in economic valuation is the concept of “stocks” and “flows.” Considering flows and stocks in valuation requires a process of discounting.

Figure 1: Total economic value of water (Adapted from CCME 2010)

The TEV framework distinguishes between use and non-use values. Option value is about not using water resources at present but preserving it for future use. Use values arise from either a direct or indirect interaction with a resource and non-use value from altruistic motives (for others’ well-being), bequest motives (for the wellbeing of future generations) and/or for the sake of the resource itself (existence). Thus, the TEV of water can be defined as:

TEV = Use Value + Non-use Value

There are two main approaches to reveal the value of water (use and non-use) depending on the benefits to people: administrative and market-driven.[22] An administrative approach implies that decisions are made by a central authority on the basis of available information. For instance: water-resource planning, deciding on competing users and jurisdictions, assessing options for investment in urban water supply and sanitation, benefits people obtain from access to water and observing their water-use behaviour. On the other hand, under a market approach, decisions are made by water users on the basis of the benefits they receive from water. Atapattu notes that market valuation of a good (or a resource) is based on the principle of marginal costs and benefits as the basis of determining optimum allocation and welfare is maximised when water is priced at “marginal cost” and is used until the marginal cost equals marginal benefit.[23]

In practice, however, one can find elements of both administrative and market approaches (hybrid model) in revealing and taking into account the value of water. The hybrid model mainly applies, among others, to pricing of water-related services and infrastructure, pricing of pollution, and securing tradable water rights.[24]

Decision-making contexts and water valuation

Though water valuation is not a necessary pre-condition for making decisions concerning any of the water-resource management or decision-making contexts, valuation outcomes can help in establishing tariffs or charges associated with the use of water or any other policy instrument and improve decision-making. Valuation can be useful in providing a monetary estimate of the full cost of water abstraction, which can guide the setting up of tariffs. Outcomes of valuation can reflect the social and environmental costs (in terms of estimating the value of damages).

A variety of decision-making frameworks and tools exist that can guide policy and could be used in project analyses:[25]

Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) relates the costs of alternative ways of producing the same or similar outcomes to a measure of these resulting outcomes. Water valuation can be an input to CEA to determine the least expensive option for water supply. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is concerned with economic efficiency, which focuses on ensuring that (scarce) resources are put to the best use. CBA allows decision-making to consider whether a project or policy should be implemented at all. Multi-criteria analysis (MCA) facilitates decision-making by combining both quantitative (including monetary) and qualitative assessments of alternative policy and project outcomes, in terms of economic, social and environmental impacts. MCA can also be applied to establish priorities for investment and appraise the relative merits of projects and policies. Bio-economic models can help link changes in natural resources and the environment to outcomes in terms of expected changes in well-being. These models are data intensive and require specifications of how changes in ecological functions relate to natural processes. Water-valuation evidence can provide an input to models for valuing changes in the provision of market and non-market goods.

There are three broad sets of economic valuation methods that can be applied to water-management issues. Market price and production input methods are mainly applied to value market goods and services associated with water resources. Revealed preference and stated preference approaches are applied to value non-market goods and services associated with water resources. An alternative approach based on secondary evidence is the benefits transfer approach. Benefits transfer makes use of valuation evidence provided by any of the earlier approaches and can be used to estimate all components of TEV. To make informed decisions, combinations of methods may be required.

To decide which method to apply and how realistic the valuation exercise is, considerations relating to data availability are important. Valuation exercises require some form of quantitative, physical or spatial (e.g. GIS) data on the change in provision of the resource (e.g. quantity of water, biochemical quality, size of user population affected and so on). The lack of such data can preclude water valuation. Moreover, since water valuation studies are usually expensive, budget constraints may also determine their feasibility.[26]

Thus, economic instruments such as abstraction and pricing play an important role in water-resources management. Assessing the value users place on water against the cost of accessing it, these instruments promote an understanding of the underlying costs involved in water provision. For investments in water infrastructure to be sustainable over a long period of time, appropriate valuation of water is crucial. In regions that face water scarcity, high variability of supply or lack of infrastructure for water storage, flood management is critical to achieve universal access to clean water.[27]

Water provisioning service of the KMC: Some facts

The KMC claims to generate 402 million gallons of water daily (MGD) and supplies 134 litres per capita per day (LPCD) to 141 wards with an average availability of eight hours, thus covering 82.7 percent of households. In addition to these, there are 9,138 tubewells that provide groundwater to another 10 percent of the households, increasing the total coverage to 92.7 percent. Compared to other tier-1 cities, i.e. Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad, Kolkata has the highest per-capita consumption of water (116 LPCD). While these statistics fare rather well, a closer examination reveals an alarming scenario. According to an Asian Development Bank (ADB) report in 2017, supply of water is highly “uneven,” ranging from 310 LPCD to 40 LPCD. Kolkata is also estimated to have the greatest variation in water consumption (64.9 LPCD) amongst the aforementioned cities.[28] The presence of high inequality in distribution of water is also evident from the fact that wards one to six (i.e. northern areas of the city) receive municipal water almost all through the day and at a much superior quality, whereas wards such as 58, 108, 109 and 127 (southern and especially south-eastern fringes of the city) have to depend mainly on groundwater, which has been found to be contaminated by arsenic.[29] The slums of the city fare even poorer. A 2016 survey, carried out by scientists from the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, revealed that 100 out of 141 wards have arsenic deposits in their groundwater, which is higher than the WHO prescribed limits of 10 µg/l. Half of these 100 wards were found to have deposits even higher than the Indian standard of 50 µg/l. Repeated studies have also shown that the presence of faecal contamination and heavy metals in the municipal piped-water supply greatly lowers the quality of drinking water.[30] In addition, lack of water metering and non-imposition of tariffs has caused the municipal corporation to incur huge subsidy costs, thus reducing the rate of improvement of physical infrastructure. The rusting in pipes and leakages result in intermittent water supply and wastage of almost 35 percent of the total water produced. It is thus quite evident that the water supply situation in Kolkata is disconcerting and drastic measures need to be adopted and implemented.

Fiscal debacle of KMC and a case for pricing water

In 2012, the Controller of Municipal Finance and Accounts (CMFA) expressed serious concerns to the Municipal Commissioner of KMC regarding the critical fiscal health of the municipal body. Later in 2017, the CMFA reiterated its concerns and suggested drastic measures to boost revenue and curtail mounting expenses. The CMFA was worried that the huge deficit would negatively affect the expansion and modernisation plans of the city’s essential services, especially water supply and sanitation. Various budget statements of the KMC reveal rising deficit with stagnated revenue at least for the last five years.

The opening balance of the KMC, as presented in the mayor’s budget statement of 2012–13, stood at INR –197.07 crore, which burgeoned to INR –1,087.22 crore for 2017–18, effectively creating a 451.7 percent hike in budgetary deficit. In the year 2017–18, only 13 percent of the proposed expenditures of the water-supply department could be funded by its own revenue. The fiscal situation improved marginally in 2014–15, when there was a 10 percent rise in revenue. However, it has been declining since. Almost half of the KMC’s revenue comes from grants provided by the state and central governments, and the majority of its infrastructural improvement projects are funded by loans from ADB and the World Bank. The KMC has been receiving financial support from the ADB for multiple projects since 2000. The latest is the US$400-million loan sanctioned in 2016 for providing 24×7 water supply to Kolkata’s residents, rehabilitating 700 km of dilapidated water-supply pipes and treatment plants in peripheral areas of the city where the need is greatest, installing metres, and for other infrastructure development. Thus, the municipal body clearly lacks the financial independence necessary to expedite the process of infrastructural development, which is the main contributing factor for the inequitable distribution of water.

In a study conducted by Arcadis in partnership with the Centre for Economics and Business Research[31] on the sustainability of cities with respect to their water profile and systems, it was found that Copenhagen and Rotterdam ranked at the top in terms of efficiency, quality and resilience of water utilities, whereas Mumbai and Delhi featured at the bottom.[32] The former two had a healthy water-tariff regime, negligible water leakage and a high incidence of water metering. The other cities lacked infrastructural development due to their low-price water regime.

The erstwhile Soviet Union—where ultra-subsidisation of resources led to a fiscal fiasco—is a study in the consequences of treating water as a ‘free good’. Under the communist regime, water was provided for free, causing macroeconomic distortions, since the economy was unable to meet such unfunded liabilities and was pushed towards insolvency. The municipal body transferred resources from other sectors of the economy, which was not in accordance with consumer preferences. Moreover, the lack of a pricing mechanism meant that the resource was not valued by the consumers, who had neither an availability constraint nor a budget constraint. This abundance resulted in wastage of the resource. Thus, the move clearly violated the principle of economic efficiency, wherein resources are optimally allocated to minimise waste.

The example of communist Russia bears an uncanny resemblance to present-day Kolkata, where over-subsidisation of water supply and hapless performance on parameters of water metering, cost recovery and unaccounted-for water have undermined the credibility of the KMC. The public infrastructure is in such shambles that the current funding agency of KMC, the ADB, claims that 65 percent of the water supplied to the pilot area did not reach the end users.[33],[34] The World Bank, too, claims that almost half of the water supplied through stand posts, i.e. 45 MLD, is being wasted due to running taps.

A tariff regime is expected to impart an economic signal to the consumers, based on which a household can decide upon its optimal level of water usage. Additionally, a water tariff, coupled with smart water metres, will help determine the city’s actual water demand schedule, allowing the KMC to supply water optimally and enabling the civic authority to upgrade its water-distribution network.

Contingent valuation studies carried out in the KMC area reveal that people are willing to pay for an improved service. For example, Majumdar & Gupta[35] found that on an average, people are willing to pay INR 3.18/kl for an average monthly usage of 12.59 kl. Roy et. al.[36] found that out of their 240 sampled households, 77 percent were willing to pay, since they were already employing some form of water-purification techniques.

Conclusion

Smart cities in India will benefit from round-the-clock supply of potable water at a cost people can afford and are willing to pay. As Hanemann[37] states, this has been difficult to accomplish for various institutional reasons, including problems of governance. The capital intensity and longevity of surface water supply infrastructure necessitate collective action in financing water supply, a need that is not relevant for most other commodities.

In Kolkata, there is a lack of piped-water availability not because of financial or physical shortage, but due mainly to issues of governance and politics. The city is in the midst of a classic problem of cost allocation, for which no satisfactory technical solution is yet in sight. Thus, there are increasing challenges to provide financially sustainable water and sanitation services.

For Kolkata to become a water-smart and -sustainable city, its leaders must realise the relevance and importance of economic instruments in financing huge infrastructure costs, e.g. abstraction and pollution charges or water pricing. In addition to these instruments, there are other options for financing water infrastructure, such as transfers, capital contributions and self-financing from users. Tariffs and taxes can help users understand the costs involved in water provision or accessing water, allowing them to better value water.

Additionally, appropriate and effective ICT solutions in the form of smart-water management (SWM) must also be adopted to address water issues. SWM can alleviate urban water management and sanitation challenges if it is integrated with ICT products, solutions and systems. Since such technologies are designed to continuously monitor water resources and identify problems in the urban water sector, their adoption will allow for better management of maintenance issues. It will also facilitate collation of complex data on the city’s water-management system and information disbursement to the residents and civic authority.

Effective valuation of water resources, coupled with appropriate ICT solutions, can play a critical role in improving the sustainable, equitable and efficient management of water. Decision-making frameworks that factor in evidence from multiple values and are inclusive are more likely to fill up investment deficits and sustainably manage water resources for a better water future for all.

Is it presented in abundance? Are people taking more than they can eat? Is the hotel staff replenishing the buffet even as the party is winding down? How much food is going back to the kitchen? Can you tell if the hotel is donating edible food or composting its scraps?

The holidays are a great time for each of us to take a moment to reflect on food — and what’s wasted. This simple act can spark a shift in thinking about the need to protect the planet and minimize our footprint. It all starts with simple observations and small steps — perfect for a New Year’s resolution.

National U.S. estimates show that the largest portion of waste occurs at home, in supermarkets, and at restaurants and hotels, which serve food to millions of guests each year — often at buffets, where a lot of food goes to waste. To conserve these resources, World Wildlife Fund has been working with Hilton to identify where food goes to waste and what steps can be taken to stop it.

The Hotel | Kitchen platform, developed with generous support from The Rockefeller Foundation and with the help of the American Hotel and Lodging Association, now gives every hotel on the planet the means to develop and execute a food waste-reduction strategy. Major hotel brands are taking this challenge seriously, and Hilton has set the ambitious goal to reduce food waste to landfill by 50 percent by 2030, as part of its Travel with Purpose campaign to redefine sustainable travel and tourism. Hilton will also establish food donation programs at its hotels, where legal.

Hilton is already achieving impressive impacts through its food waste program. In a 10-week waste-reduction pilot project, nine Hilton hotels in the U.S. and South America were able to donate over 6,000 pounds of prepared food leftover from meetings and events — enough to feed nearly 4,200 people. The hotels also implemented organics diversion programs that kept nearly 260,000 pounds of inedible food waste out of the landfill, preventing the equivalent of 200,000 pounds of carbon emissions. Hilton is now rolling out its food donation and waste diversion program across its 250 managed hotels in the Americas, with the goal of positively impacting local communities and the environment. If every hotel that serves food starts making these types of change, the environmental benefits will be monumental.

While Hilton and others are taking concrete steps to reduce food waste in their operations, there’s still a huge barrier to overcome: Customer expectation. In buffet lines, abundance sells and food is often wasted because it is over-ordered or because there is a belief that the buffet will be kept stocked even at the end of the event.

We, the customer, must recognize the influence we have and use it for good. This means only ordering the amount of food that is necessary for a meeting or event, and confirming any last-minute cancellations so that the chef can adjust orders accordingly. It also means asking the hotel or restaurant to ensure that any leftover food from your meeting or holiday party is donated to the needy in the local community. Each one of us can do our part by only taking the food that we will eat and coming back for seconds, rather than overloading a plate with food that will go to waste. And you can also make a difference by continuing to demand change from the companies that you patronize.

Hotel brands such as Hilton have properties in hundreds of countries around the world, which means that when they take on a challenge, it can quickly scale globally. Reducing food waste can become the new norm at every hotel around the world; imagine the impact of the hospitality industry and customers coming together to redefine the importance of food and showing how wasting food should be a cultural taboo.

And when the vacation is over, you can follow the hospitality industry’s lead and start taking steps in your own kitchen to curb waste. It won’t just be good for the planet, it’ll probably put a few hundred more dollars in your pocket — to save for your next trip.","Hilton is already achieving impressive impacts through its food waste program.

These focus on addressing education, energy, the environment, health, hunger, poverty, decent work and economic growth.

The SDGs form part of Special Economic Zones' (SEZs') developmental framework in Jamaica, and are thought to be pivotal to fulfilling the SEZs' mandate.

This mandate focuses on developing a regime and environment in which globally competitive firms thrive while driving unprecedented growth and development for all stakeholders/interests in a logistics-centred economy, as articulated in the Government's SEZ Policy.

The SDGs deemed directly aligned with the SEZ mandate are Goals 7 – affordable and clean energy; 8 – decent work and economic growth; 9 – industry, innovation and infrastructure; 11 – sustainable cities and communities; 12 – responsible consumption and production; and 17 – partnerships for the goals.

Director of Investor Relations and Communications at JSEZA, Kelli-Dawn Hamilton, notes that the Authority needs to be in a positon to determine whether a potential investment is consistent with the SEZ regime's overall developmental objectives.

To this end, the entity must weigh the economic, environmental and social sustainability of proposed projects, by considering their potential to contribute to Jamaica achieving targets in the SEZ Policy, Vision 2030 Jamaica National Development Plan, Logistics Hub Initiative Master Plan and Industry Analysis, and SDGs.

“So, we are talking about ensuring that the projects which we are facilitating… will help to alleviate poverty, positively impact the environment, and ensure the safety and security of our workers… Jamaicans in general,” Hamilton told JIS News.

She pointed out that the manner in which the JSEZA is pursuing and attracting investments and facilitating entities within the SEZ framework is quite meaningful and is also in keeping with international standards.

“We are not doing this haphazardly… we are doing this responsibly, in order to achieve an overarching goal, which is the economic development of the country and helping to achieve Vision 2030 – making Jamaica the place of choice to live, work, raise families and do business,” Hamilton said.

One aspect of the SEZ buildout where this will be significantly manifested, is in the development of two major zones in Nain, St Elizabeth, and Caymanas Estate, St Catherine.

The JSEZA Chairman, Metry Seaga, who noted that the authority is “intimately involved” in the work to develop these areas, reiterated that they will entail commercial, industrial, educational, recreational and residential components, all being streamlined into developing new townships.

Hamilton also argued that the JSEZA is intent on being “true to the word 'Zone', where you are looking at the development of townships that will have research facilities, as well as the natural resources required for inputs into the productive sectors operating within that zone”.

“So, when we say we are going about things in a holistic way… when we talk about connecting the dots… we are talking about putting all the moving parts into one location,” she added.","KINGSTON, Jamaica — The Jamaica Special Economic Zone Authority (JSEZA) has adopted the United Nations (UN) 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are being targeted for attainment within 12 years in relation to a wide range of social and economic development issues.

In this voyage, both Peace Boat and 1LL are set on crossing borders to spread awareness about their causes, which includes promoting peace, human rights, equal and sustainable development and respect for the environment, with 1LL focusing on addressing energy poverty. The journey will start in Yokohama, Japan on December 26 and will circumnavigate the world for a hundred days.

One of the journey’s highlights are workshops from 1LL Executive Director Illac Diaz. Passengers on board will learn about making sustainable solar lights, and the finished products will be donated to communities accessible from the ports where Peace Boat will dock.

The organisations started talking about a collaboration during the World Future Energy Summit held in Abu Dhabi in January 2016. The idea of working together on a joint project came up immediately, with Peace Boat being an active campaigner for the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This collaboration between the two agencies will help create awareness about SDGs, with 1LL focusing on renewable energy.

Getting ready for the voyage

Last month, 1LL traveled to Japan to meet with Peace Boat founder and director Yoshioka Tatsuya to officially kick off the partnership with Peace Boat. They trained youth Peace Boat volunteers to build simple, community-built solar lighting solutions in a workshop, with the volunteers building over 30 kits that will be brought and distributed during the voyage.

“Liter of Light believes in the power of youth to solve the greatest challenges to our planet and community,” said Diaz. “We are excited to continue our journey of light with Peace Boat, where we will have the incredible opportunity to teach, learn, and share sustainable solutions to energy poverty and other development challenges globally.”

Tatsuya believes in the impact that this partnership can create. “The combination of Liter of Light and Peace Boat voyages will bring real visibility and concrete results to promote SDG 7 and renewable energy around the world. This partnership will be a game changer by showcasing how organizations can join their forces and multiply their impact. ” Tatsuya said.

Partnering for the UN SDGs

The trip not only serves as an avenue for both organisations to widen their reach and impact, but it also gives both a chance to share their humble beginnings. Peace Boat started out with four students who were curious about Japan’s role during World War II. In 1983, they chartered a ship and went around Asia and the Pacific to reach out to different countries and hear people’s stories about their experiences during the war.

Since then, Peace Boat has organized voyages to spread awareness about sustainability, building meaningful partnerships while educating passengers and different communities. Peace Boat is also a member of the steering committee for the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), recipients of the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize.

Having supported the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) Campaign since 2009, Peace Boat has renewed its commitment to building a more equitable and sustainable world by pledging its support for the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, otherwise known as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

When Liter of Light started in 2011, its mission and focus was simple: to provide solar lighting that is accessible and sustainable for grassroots communities. Redesigning solar lighting for the developing world, 1LL’s simple, two-step technology creates local jobs, teaches green skills, and empowers energy-poor communities. Rather than depending on imported, patented, and expensive technologies, this grassroots green lighting movement makes it possible for anyone to become a solar engineer.

Making this an open-source technology and sharing all the information on the internet, social media and teaching caravans has helped Liter of Light to expand to over 30 countries, light up almost one million households around the world, help reduce carbon emissions by a bottom-up approach and spread the idea of green and sustainable technology.

From Yokohama, Japan, the voyage will cover a southern hemisphere route, docking in 19 ports around Asia, Africa, and South America, including Madagascar, South Africa, Brazil and Patagonia. They will also visit Mauritius, Rapa Nui, Tahiti and Samoa, where participants will learn about the issues faced by the indigenous people of these islands.

The joint activities with Liter of Light will constitute one of the main themes of this voyage, alongside the celebration of the 35th anniversary of Peace Boat. The voyage is going to be the first Filipino global campaign under the UN SDGs, with 1LL focusing on SDG 7 or renewable energy.

Michael Grimm

The Harvard Center for Green Buildings and Cities (CGBC) at the Harvard Graduate School of Design (GSD) has completed an ambitious effort to retrofit a 1924 home in Cambridge, Mass., into a living laboratory that will serve as the organization's headquarters. Dubbed HouseZero, the energy-positive prototype for ultra-efficient architecture aims to demonstrate how existing structures can be modified to consume less energy.

Designed by renowned Norewegian firm Snøhetta as lead architect in collaboration with engineer Skanska Teknikk Norway, HouseZero's concepts are driven by radical performance goals, including nearly zero energy for heating and cooling, zero electric lighting during daytime, operating with 100% natural ventilation, and producing zero carbon emissions. Over its lifetime, the structure is intended to produce more energy than was used to renovate and operate it.

Michael Grimm

CGBC will also leverage HouseZero as a research tool, drawing data from hundreds of sensors embedded within each component of the home that monitor its performance. According to the university, this sensory data will also provide Harvard’s researchers with an unprecedented understanding of complex building behavior. In turn, the data will fuel research involving computational simulation, helping the CGBC develop new systems and data-driven learning algorithms that promote energy-efficiency, health, and sustainability.

Michael Grimm

“HouseZero’s flexible, data-driven infrastructure will allow us to further research that demystifies building behavior, and design the next generation of ultra-efficient structures,” says Ali Malkawi, founding director of the Harvard Center for Green Buildings and Cities and the creator and leader of the HouseZero project. “By creating both a prototype and an infrastructure for long-term research, we hope to raise interest in ultra-efficient retrofits and inspire substantial shifts in the design and operation of buildings.”

Michael Grimm

HouseZero's big-picture, prototype goal is to address one of the biggest energy problems in the world today—inefficient existing buildings. Harvard research has found that the U.S. building stock is responsible for around 40% of energy consumption, with housing claiming nearly a quarter of that use. Annually, property owners spend upwards of $230 billion to heat, cool, and power some 113.6 million homes. Addressing the inefficiencies locked into this problematic building stock offers opportunity for curbing its impact on climate change, and HouseZero's strategies could potentially create the blueprint for reducing the average American household's footprint.

Michael Grimm

The building is designed to continuously adjust itself to reach thermal comfort for its occupants. It combines innovative technologies such as software and sensor arrays with established architectural solutions, such as solar vents, concrete slabs that store thermal energy, and natural ventilation to automatically open and close windows to maintain a quality internal environment throughout the year. Rather than tightly sealing the building, the envelope and the materials that make up HouseZero were designed to interact with the seasons and the exterior environment in a more natural way.

Michael Grimm

“Harvard HouseZero is an extraordinary physical example of efficiency and transformative design,” says Mohsen Mostafavi, Dean of Harvard GSD and the Alexander and Victoria Wiley Professor of Design. “As a living laboratory, it equips Harvard students and researchers with an unparalleled, innovative infrastructure for exploration and research as they design the next generation of sustainable buildings and cities around the world.”

337,https://egyptianstreets.com/2018/12/09/could-hand-over-be-egypts-next-environmentally-sustainable-urban-planning-solution/,"Sun, 09 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Egyptian Streets,Could ‘Hand Over’ Be Egypt’s Next Environmentally Sustainable Urban Planning Solution?,"Could ‘Hand Over’ Be Egypt’s Next Environmentally Sustainable Urban Planning Solution?

Founded by construction engineer Radwa Rostom officially in 2016, Hand Over is a social enterprise based in Cairo. The enterprise designs and builds spaces out of natural and locally sourced material. The material used for construction is both cost-effective and environment friendly rendering its end products, houses and buildings, a sustainable solution to the real estate market’s endless needs.

Hand Over revolutionizes the construction industry by introducing a durable, environment friendly and cost effective solution to construction.

Egypt’s construction industry is notorious for its rigidity when in comes to creativity and innovation. Hand Over is utilizing two discipline, environmental sustainability and construction, in one framework to bring a new and fresh flavor to the market and industry as a whole.

“When I graduated with a degree in construction engineering, I decided to see what is happening around me,” Rostom starts,”I was always interested in environmental solutions but I wasn’t ready to leave the construction sector completely. Instead, I started learning about other solutions people are doing across the world.”

The 30-year-old construction engineer noticed that solution-providers are always targeting the same upper-class urbanized segment in Egypt’s society. After spotting the gap in the market, Rostom created a social enterprise model that caters to this demand in the various segments while remaining environmentally sustainable.

The urban planning projects are constructed for two different projects: commercial and community development. Commercial projects are specifically catered towards individuals and real estate development companies where clients are interested in creating an environmentally sustainable project for private use. The Hand Over team then handles all the planning, design and construction independently.

Where as in the case of community development, Hand Over often collaborates with a local non-profit organizations (NGOs) and initiatives, as well as the local community itself.

“We always involve them [the locals] in the design and implementation because we want them to learn the techniques so that they are able to use these techniques on their own afterwards for other projects,” Rostom highlights. This becomes a great opportunity for the locale to come together and contribute to the enhancement of their neighborhood and city.

The enterprise achieves that goal by collaborating with universities and schools to host workshops in order to introduce this innovative construction approach. Participants not only attend the sessions but also have the opportunity to put their skills in action by building an infrastructure from the provided material.

“We felt that we needed to do more awareness especially for students and the younger generation, because we felt like it was our responsibility to introduce these techniques to the local industry,” Rostom highlights.

From social housing units in Cairo and healthcare unit in St. Cathrine to administration building for commercial use and educational facility in Al ‘Ayat, Hand Over has a wide portfolio of construction projects using sustainable construction material and collaborated with entities like the UNDP and the local NGO ‘Man Ahyaha’, to name a few.

However, because their technique is unconventional to the region, Hand Over faced some resistance from the local real-estate market, consumers and participants. Nonetheless, Rostom persisted to shed light on the economic and environmental benefits of her projects.

“We were introducing something that people had many misconceptions about in terms of sustainability and durability. Some questioned if it would be a long term solution as well as the accessibility to the different social and economic class, which is why we are constantly doing campaigns, talk, and info-sessions with people,” she explains.

As of 2016, Egypt’s Ministry of Housing Utilities and Urban Development estimated that around 500,00 new urban projects are built annually to keep up with the countries growing population. However, these facilities are often at an unaffordable price range to the mass population as a result of the recent price hikes in construction materials in 2017. Instead, many Egyptians opt for housing, educational or medical facilities outside of main cities.

This is when Hand Over plays a part. One of the major economic benefits of environmentally sustainable construction material is its feasibility and cost-effectiveness. The construction material needed to build sustainable facilities are economic because they are locally sourced.

The enterprise also creates new job opportunities for the people in the communities Hand Over works with. When the participants gain these new skill sets, this means they can provide this service on their own in the future or join the Hand Over team like many do, ultimately improving the economic income of those involved.

“We are also trying to broaden the prospective job opportunities for the youth. They do not have to follow the traditional footsteps of every other civil engineer in the market,” Rostom emphasizes, “but they have a wide scope of potential opportunities they could pursue.”

Hand Over is one of over 240 startups participating in this year’s Rise Up Summit, the region’s leading entrepreneurship event. The three-day annual event consists of workshops, talks, exhibitions, competitions and panels about the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Egypt and the Middle East region inviting international, regional and local speakers.

The summit helps rising entrepreneurs like Rostom not only learn about the ecosystem, but also network with potential investors, mentors, partners, and many more giving them the opportunity to potentially leverage these relationships towards their ventures .

For its sixth edition, Rise Up chose the theme ‘Stay Grounded’.

“When we were planning the summit we realized something very special which is this year, finally, we started to realize that the local startup ecosystem and the innovation community has grown and developed,” Sami Awa, Rise Up spokesperson highlights. This year, Rise Up integrated these local success stories into their program allowing entrepreneurs the opportunity to learn from their successors’ experiences.

The U.S. is in the midst of an increasingly sophisticated and urgent conversation about environmental damage from single-use plastics and containers. Restaurant operators and food distributors, in particular, are thinking more about how sustainable packaging can help to address food-related social and environmental issues while delivering a positive brand impact.

While plastics and plastic packaging are an integral part of the global economy and provide it with many benefits, their typically linear value chains entail significant drawbacks that are becoming more apparent by the day. In a business-as-usual scenario, projected growth in plastics production could lead by 2050 to the oceans' containing more plastics than fish, and the entire plastics industry could consume 20 percent of total oil production and 15 percent of the annual carbon budget.

Sustainable food packaging and brand identity

Sustana aims to be a part of the solution. We promote and apply sustainable manufacturing and business practices to deliver premium, eco-friendly recycled fibers to customers across North America. One such product is EnviroLife, the only 100 percent post-consumer recycled fiber in North America that is FDA-compliant for use in direct food contact packaging under all conditions of use.

For restaurants looking to differentiate their brand and attract environmentally conscious consumers, packaging is an excellent way to demonstrate concern for the earth while materially reducing environmental impact. Sustana recognizes that food packaging is becoming another way to articulate a company’s values, and to show its commitment to the environment and to the communities in which it operates.

Projected growth in plastics production could lead by 2050 to the oceans' containing more plastics than fish.

As we dialogue with end users, we see how successful food and beverage companies know that customers develop a relationship with their product packaging. A customer will have half an hour with that coffee cup, for instance. It might have their name on it with logos and design. This provides a tangible way for a customer to look at that and feel good about the choice they made. They’ll notice that it’s not disposable, it’s reusable. This object transmits the company’s values in a very real way. The customer will feel good about having contributed.

McDonald’s recent announcement that it will source all packaging from recycled, renewable or certified sources by 2025 highlights the significant shift underway in the market. Starbucks’ announcement earlier this year that it aims to launch a fully recyclable and compostable coffee cup within three years further emphasizes the transition.

Packaging for a circular economy

According to a third-party Life Cycle Analysis, EnviroLife’s environmental impact is much lower than that of generic North American virgin fiber. Our patented manufacturing process eliminates optical brightening agents, resulting in a product that is suitable for food contact with no need for a barrier or coating. Because of this treatment, EnviroLife is free from contaminants that are present in most other post-consumer fibers.

Straight from production, EnviroLife is ready to be used in all food packaging applications, including takeaway containers, soup containers, coffee and tea cups, coffee bags, cheese-and-meat interleaving paper and bread bags. EnviroLife is also certified by the Forest Stewardship Council.

EnviroLife is free from contaminants that are present in most other post-consumer fibers. Sustana’s Chairman and CEO, Fabian de Armas, speaks to EnviroLife’s unique environmental benefits: “EnviroLife is the only 100 percent recycled fiber in North America that provides a zero-fluorescence solution and meets FDA requirements for direct food contact without the need for a barrier. Sustana provides its clients with premium products and environmentally sustainable solutions whose impacts are measurable. We conduct a third-party-verified analysis of the impact of using our products on the environment in terms of overall carbon footprint; it’s an entire life cycle analysis for our products. Sustana is the only producer that does this, and we’re proud of that.”

Shrinking environmental footprint

Sustana transforms post-consumer waste paper into premium recycled fiber, with state-of-the-art recycling mills in De Pere, Wisconsin, and Lévis, Quebec. Every day, 2.2 million pounds of waste paper converge on Sustana recycling mills, where we sort and process it into more than 230,000 tons of post-consumer recycled fiber per year. By recycling waste paper, the mills save enough energy to power 85,000 average U.S. homes for one year.

EnviroLife’s low environmental impact helps food-serving brands meet their sustainability goals, and answer the growing consumer demand for environmentally friendly products. We recognize that when it comes to packaging, how it’s created and where it originates have become just as important as looks and function.","Sustainable food packaging and brand identitySustana aims to be a part of the solution.
One such product is EnviroLife, the only 100 percent post-consumer recycled fiber in North America that is FDA-compliant for use in direct food contact packaging under all conditions of use.
Sustana recognizes that food packaging is becoming another way to articulate a company’s values, and to show its commitment to the environment and to the communities in which it operates.
As we dialogue with end users, we see how successful food and beverage companies know that customers develop a relationship with their product packaging.
Straight from production, EnviroLife is ready to be used in all food packaging applications, including takeaway containers, soup containers, coffee and tea cups, coffee bags, cheese-and-meat interleaving paper and bread bags."

The Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative leverages Amazon Web Services’ technology and scalable infrastructure to stage, analyze, and distribute data, and is a joint effort between the AWS Open Data and Amazon Sustainability teams. The AWS Open Data program already makes numerous datasets available for public use through its Registry of Open Data on AWS. Amazon’s Sustainability Team began collaborating with AWS last year to start warehousing the vast amounts of public data that describe our planet. The initiative identifies foundational data for sustainability and works closely with data providers like NOAA to stage their data in the AWS Cloud by giving them complete ownership and control over how their data is shared.

While these datasets have always been freely available, they aren’t always easily accessible, and researchers may not have the compute power necessary to take advantage of these resources through their own on-premises data centers. Examples of datasets already available through the initiative include weather observations and forecast data, climate projections data, satellite imagery, hydrological data, air quality data, and ocean forecast data. Amazon has maintained that providing easier access to massive datasets (i.e. petabyte-scale) in the cloud will help researchers and innovators address a wide range of sustainability challenges, such as the impacts of climate change and weather extremes.

By removing the burden of data acquisition, the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative enables faster research at lower cost. To encourage application development, researchers can apply for AWS Promotional Credits through the AWS Cloud Credits for Research program. Offsetting these costs will encourage experimentation and promote innovative solutions. For example, AWS is collaborating with the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) to provide up to $1.5 million in cloud credits for projects to improve the understanding of our planet. The new GEO-AWS collaboration will offer GEO member agencies and research organizations in developing countries access to cloud services for hosting, processing, and analysis of Earth observation data to inform decisions for sustainable development.

Sharing data in the cloud enables anyone to easily access large datasets to perform modeling and analysis at a scale that was previously limited to institutions with access to super computers and dedicated data centers. To encourage the exchange of technical knowledge, the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative works with users to document and share lessons learned through blog posts, tutorials, and open source code, all of which can be found on the Registry of Open Data on AWS.

AWS has millions of active customers around the world and many of those customers are already doing innovative work by leveraging open data and AWS capabilities. For example, Element84 is exploring the use of AWS open satellite imagery and machine learning algorithms by using Amazon SageMaker to provide timely and critical information (e.g., location of buildings) during disaster response efforts.

NASA is working with Development Seed to create a deep learning-based hurricane intensity estimator, and a tool to accurately assess a tropical cyclone’s intensity. GREENSPIN uses data from the European Union’s Copernicus program to improve agricultural practices. Projects like Temperate, CalAdapt, and StormSense are providing cloud-based tools to help communities better understand and prepare for the impacts of climate change. A group of researchers at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the American Bird Conservancy recently published a paper about bird migration patterns based on NOAA’s NEXRAD weather data that is freely available on AWS.

AWS “allows us to do things at scale that have not been done at scale before,” says Josh Hacker, Co-founder of Jupiter Intel, which helps organizations prepare for climate change and weather risks. AWS customers, such as Sinergise, Intertrust, and OpenAQ, are increasing access to data by developing tools that help others access and use the open data on AWS.

According to Amazon, the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative will support AWS customers in their sustainability work so that innovators and researchers are supported with the data, tools, and technical expertise they need to move sustainability to the next level.

Embedding a sustainability strategy in warehouses and distribution centers ranges from reducing waste to installing alternative energy sources and even to deciding where to locate facilities. But balancing a cutting-edge environmental plan with a solid economic strategy is a tightrope walk many business and supply chain leaders find difficult to navigate. However, they agree it’s an important balancing act to perfect because warehousing, logistics and transportation touch just about every segment of the economy.

At the core of a sustainability strategy in warehousing and distribution is an economic equation, explains Jim Frazer, vice president of smart cities at ARC Advisory Group. The three pillars of sustainability, he says, are:

Enhancing or preserving the physical environment Enhancing or preserving the societal quality of life (safety, human capital) Performing the first two in an economically reasonable manner.

While the third pillar is sometimes forgotten, Frazer notes, it’s at the heart of sustainability because, in the business world, the ROI of sustainable practices and innovations are always top of mind.

“Often companies will say if we can’t do this project with an ROI of two or three years, it’s not going to get done,” he adds.

A Business Case for Sustainability

The ROI hurdle in sustainable warehousing and distribution is a tough one for many companies to clear. That presents a dilemma for supply chain organizations that use a 3PL for logistics, warehousing and distribution, because they often rely on that third-party to help them meet their sustainability goals.

For Minneapolis-based Murphy Warehouse Company, the ROI challenge of sustainability is one the 114-year-old firm is willing to tackle. Richard T. Murphy Jr., FASLA, president and CEO of the full-service supply chain logistics company, says the company’s environmental strategy addresses energy savings and power generation, carbon sequestration, pollution abatement, recycling and resource management.

“The business case for sustainability in our company is that a truly sustainable organization balances economic and environmental factors,” says Murphy.

It’s a business case the company backs up with a five-part plan focusing on leadership, strategic business strategy, independent certifications, a financial strategy, and marketing and branding.

Murphy explains that the company’s commitment to independent certifications helps its clients reach their sustainability goals. “I know they can’t do it alone, they have to rely on their supply chain partners,” he explains.

For example, the company’s annual corporate sustainability report is prepared following the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which Murphy says “provides our clients a tool to use in their sustainability efforts.”

Making a Commitment to Sustainability

For Ventura, California-based Patagonia, its sustainability commitment is rooted in the company’s mission statement: “Build the best product, cause no unnecessary harm, use business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental crisis.” Logan Duran, senior manager of environmental responsibility, metrics and reporting, says the statement is the lens the company looks through in all it does.

Patagonia grew out of a company that made tools for climbers and into an international brand that sells clothing and products for outdoor enthusiasts. Its environmental commitment has always been strong, Duran says, pointing to the company’s Reno Service Center, originally built in 1996 with the latest green innovations at the time. Those early innovations paid for themselves within three to eight years with energy savings of 30 percent to 35 percent.

In 2006, the center’s size doubled, and newer sustainable strategies earned it a gold level LEED certification. Some of the sustainable measures in the building include:

Skylights that track the sun and translucent roof-mounted smoke vents that reflect natural light

A night-flush vent system that replaces the hot day air with cool, night-time air, eliminating the need for an air conditioning system

Complex metering equipment that ensures the center is always operating at peak energy levels.

Value in Certifications

Murphy says LEED certification and Energy Star are measures supply chain partners understand and can be a key step in getting the attention of clients. Frazer of ARC Advisory Group points out that certifications are expensive, however, and companies need to weigh them as part of their “economic equation.”

Murphy adds that LEED certification is not only expensive, it’s “extremely complicated,” often requiring the help of an outside consultant. “But, one of the things that LEED and Energy Star has done for us is provide tools and systems to manage various sources of information,” he says. “It has helped us develop measurable targets to focus on.”

He notes that the company has achieved LEED Gold certification for the four buildings it owns and is exploring certification for buildings it leases. Leased buildings present more of a challenge because the leases have to be long term, and the landlord must be willing work with the company as part of the certification process.

Murphy says it’s important to understand the work required to obtain LEED and Energy Star. He suggests considering the following information before embarking on your journey to sustainability:

Show me the data. Gathering and managing the data required for LEED certification can be difficult because some of the necessary data may reside with utility and supply chain partners. Murphy Warehouse has relied on a consultant to help with this aspect of the process.

Not one and done. LEED certification is for five years, and recertification is about a yearlong process that requires continual data collection and verification. “You just don’t do this once and keep the flag up for the next 40 years,” says Murphy. All Murphy facilities have been recertified.

Certification changes. Organizations must keep up-to-date with changes to LEED certification. “I would say, overall, LEED has gotten better organized, but the bottom line is you have to keep up with changes.”

Taking the first step. Because Energy Star looks at energy efficiency, it is more focused and straightforward, Murphy says. It’s a good first step for a company beginning a sustainable journey.

Looking at the Big Picture

It’s clear there’s a variety of sustainable solutions to make warehouses and distribution centers more energy efficient and environmentally friendly. And because the buildings are basically “giant boxes” with minimal staff, they also offer a good place to start.

Duran says Patagonia is committed to embedding practices from recycling to energy efficiency in its distribution center but is taking a more holistic view of sustainability by again looking at the issue through the lens of its mission statement.

“We are taking a deep dive into how we pack and prepare items for shipment, and how we ship products around the world with the goal of reducing our carbon footprint,” he explains. “We work with our supply chain partners to improve planning and provide more accurate forecasts so we can reduce or eliminate air shipments.”

He says a key sustainability issue in distribution and warehousing is where to locate facilities. In other words, it’s not only about environmental efficiency in the building, it’s where the building is located–and it’s a lifetime challenge.

Conquering the ROI Challenge

As for the ROI in sustainability, Murphy Warehouse Company’s financial strategy focuses on “green practices that show financial payback and positive ROI.” CEO Murphy says the company works hard to meet a reasonable period for ROI, something public companies often don’t have the luxury to do. He recalls a warehouse project where perseverance to find an acceptable ROI paid off.

The company purchased a building that needed upgrading, and as part of the work, Murphy wanted to include solar, something it had installed on other buildings it owns. The building’s utility provider was a small co-op that was not required by the state to offer the same incentives as Minnesota’s larger utilities. “So my ROI for solar, which normally for us is four years max, was going to be 11 years,” Murphy says.

However, that didn’t stop Murphy from looking at other avenues. While talking with the bank about financing, he was encouraged to talk to the Small Business Administration (SBA). “We filed a loan application with the SBA and put on our application that we wanted to install solar energy on the building,” he recalls. “When the SBA saw we were installing renewable energy, we automatically became eligible for a loan where we only had to put 5 percent down, making the solar project financially viable. Sometimes being sustainable pays off.”

Finding Sustainable Solutions

Embedding sustainable practices in the warehouse sometimes takes out-of-the-box thinking. Many companies have harvested the low-hanging fruit such as recycling and LED light replacement, but now must look deeper to find strategies that benefit the company and its supply chain.

Murphy Warehouse Company found such a strategy when it became frustrated with the storm water fees it was paying. Communities charge fees for storm water runoff in order to control the volume and quality of runoff that goes into their system. Murphy says at one logistics campus, the fees started at about $58,000 a year but quickly began climbing to more than $81,000.

Knowing he didn’t want to raise rates for the buildings’ tenants, Murphy, who is a landscape architect, worked with an engineer to design retention basins, a complex piping system and the planting of native prairie to control water runoff. As originally designed, it was estimated the credit for controlling runoff would be 78 percent, but with a project cost of almost $600,000, Murphy was unsure whether to move forward.

However, the “as-built” drawing came back with a 102-percent storm water fee credit on the 22-acre site. Plus, it received a 50-percent federal depreciation deduction, which all together translated to an ROI of seven years, which was acceptable to the company.

The planting of colorful native prairie on the property had an added benefit that came as a surprise, even to Murphy. “We run 33,000 trucks a year out of that facility, but the number one thing I hear when I go to the city is, ‘Oh, you’re the guys with the pretty flowers along Main Street,’” Murphy says. “They talk about the flowers, not the trucks. That to me is branding.”

Looking to the Future

Sustainability in warehousing, or any other part of a business, should be looked at in the long term, Duran emphasizes. “Our founder said that what we do today sets us up for the future. That is why we look at everything from a lifecycle and total cost of ownership perspective.”

He also understands the hurdle public companies have to clear when it comes to the ROI of sustainability measures, but believes many now are looking at sustainability measures to “de-risk their companies in light of rising sea levels, wildfires and more destructive hurricanes.”

In the future, business and sustainability leaders believe there will be a greater emphasis on solar energy use, especially for battery storage; a greater push for environmental progress from supply chain partners; and a demand for greater transparency throughout the supply chain from customers.

She recently spoke as part of Cisco’s Women Rock-IT series.

We explore Mars for many reasons, be it the risk minimization of distributing our species across multiple planets or the fact that our population is growing at a rate that is unsustainable for our Earth’s resources.

For me, it is the insatiable spirit of exploration. It is all the inventions we will create to help Earth as a result of pushing our skills to their most extreme, and it is the fact that aiming for a goal this grand has the power to draw together people from every background.

When I was young, I used to dream of one day exploring the Amazon rainforest in search of medicinal plants I could create new cures from. I was enchanted with the idea of facing the unknown, with all its danger, to create something that would help as many people as I could.

With that in mind, ever impatient, I left school at 16 to begin studying Biomedical Sciences. As my studies went on, I specialized in neuroscience and ultimately completed a Ph.D. in Neuroscience, in which I focused on using machine learning to predict voluntary decisions.

However, I had become disenchanted with academia over time, feeling that it was not allowing me to achieve the impact I wanted. So, I gravitated towards the technology scene, with its wilder ideas and faster pace.

AI and the Final Frontier

The crux moment came when attending an emerging technology conference in San Diego, for which a significant focus was artificial intelligence (AI). AI represented the wonders of information combined with the ability to transform everything around us, from agriculture to healthcare.

This, to me, seemed like a field that would soon impact all of society. The only problem was that apparently nobody knew about it. Arriving back in Brisbane, I searched for public events on AI and, finding nothing, promptly started the Meetup community Brisbane.AI with a friend. That decision led to a group that is now over 2,000 strong and led me to a role working on AI strategy for the Office of the Queensland Chief Entrepreneur.

This past year has been a whirlwind and, through my role, I have been very fortunate to win support to create a multi-millionaire dollar project to build our own Queensland AI Centre.

Still, I found myself searching for that childhood taste for exploration and, while the pieces had been falling into place for a few years, my brain hadn’t quite put them together. There had been a moment watching the National Geographic Mars series where the idea of an astronaut risking everything for the advancement of human knowledge struck me so profoundly I started crying uncontrollably.

Then, there was the fact card on Mars that I had found myself carrying with me for the past year.

Finally, in February this year, SpaceX successfully launched the Falcon Heavy rocket and, seeing Starman in space, the puzzle clicked into place. It occurred to me then that Mars was not just a fictional dream of engineers and sci-fi nerds, but a place our generation could make a real home someday. By doing so, we would be opening the path to explore and inhabit the rest of our solar system, and then maybe even beyond. It would be the biggest goal we had ever conquered as a species.

Sustainable life in space

I knew that SpaceX was building the BFR to transport humans to Mars one day, but I had no idea what else was being done for the other vital bit — keeping us alive. A frantic few months of heavy reading followed, looking into SpaceX and NASA plans, human psychology in space books, and research articles on everything from automation in the ISS to radiation protection materials.

What I discovered was that most everything in space is trying to kill you. There is almost no oxygen or atmosphere on Mars, and it has one-third the gravity of Earth, which wreaks havoc on the human body. Exposure to cosmic radiation also significantly increases the risk of cancer. Furthermore, most of the processes on the ISS are led by mission control, while in emergencies astronauts are sent back to Earth. On Mars, where the communication lag is between 4-24 minutes, we would need to automate all these processes, and there would be no going back.

The more I read, the more challenges I found. Yet, according to plans, the first crewed mission was set for within the decade. If we were going to make it, we needed to get working not in a few years, but now.

With no time to lose, I launched Spaceport AI. The company’s mission is to build AI technologies that will enable sustainable human life in space. Currently, we are preparing our first projects in the fields of human life support, autonomous systems, and habitat sustainability, using AI for its power to automate operations and assist astronauts.

We envision exploration where, rather than receiving medical support from mission control, astronauts can use wearables that monitor and predict health in real-time. Where greenhouses could sense conditions and adapt to optimize plant growth. Where, with strong advancements, we could even have autonomous robots completing tasks and heading off for scientific exploration.

We are also running AI courses, both to help the community at large but also to teach our own crew. I have already come across so many young, passionate individuals that dream of helping mankind reach the stars, and that matters far more to us than the five years’ technical experience many larger organizations demand.

Founding Spaceport AI, I never stopped to think whether I was the person to do it or not, with my three months’ experience in space, but just that it was a hugely important problem to solve and working on it was more likely to solve the problem than not working on it at all.

However, if we are going to make the mission to Mars successful, which we must, then we will need the passion and work of many thousands of people, from all across the globe. It will truly be a feat of mankind.

I may look back at this all one day and wonder at how naive I was but, as I stand, I have this wondrous sense of conviction in the goal I am working towards. Like my childhood dream of the Amazon, I finally get to reach for unknown territories in order to help humanity.

But with Chinese money pouring into the region and sunny seaside resorts developing into worthy digital hubs they offer fertile ground for big returns.</p> <p>In Cambodia, secondary markets have grabbed international headlines in the past year. Sihanoukville, on the southern coast, has been the poster-child for Chinese investment. Also growing in appeal is Poipet, a lesser-known city bordering Thailand.</p> <p>Speak to any tourist or expat who has at some point crossed the border into Poipet, and they’ll rarely have anything good to say about the place. In the absence of any real industry, Poipet has long been synonymous with rip-off merchants, scammers, gamblers, and other unsavoury sorts—a place where visitors cannot wait to leave and where respectable businesses fear to tread.</p> <p>But things appear to be changing.</p> <p>Since economic zones were launched, and a railway line linking Bangkok to Poipet and Phnom Penh completed last July, the city’s property market has taken a surprising turn. “Many investors from the outside are eyeing Poipet as a great investment destination,” says Hor Kunthea, CEO of Sokha Residences Group.</p> <p>Poipet, with its 30 odd casinos and a growing manufacturing industry, is seeing an expanding Chinese and Korean expat community, mirroring the early rumblings of Sihanoukville’s growth spurt. Sixteen real estate projects were completed in 2017, putting more than 1,500 units onto the market. Adding to this, Poipet governor San Sean Ho has announced the government will build a golf course, an artificial river, a giant garden, and floating market.</p> <div class=""pull-quotes-container"">In Sihanoukville, the market continues to ride its own investment boom. The sleepy town has undergone immense transformation from a faded backwater to a town jacked up on Chinese cash</div> <p>In more established Sihanoukville, the market continues to ride its own investment boom. The sleepy town has undergone immense transformation from a faded backwater to a town jacked up on Chinese cash.</p> <p>Sotharoth Som, managing director of KHCN Investment and Development Co., Ltd, the developer of the 43-storey Seagate Suite project in Sihanoukville, reports rental prices across the board have gone up five to 10 times, with those closer to the city centre being most expensive. Som says foreign investors, mainly from China, are driving the boom, as they “seek the opportunity to obtain higher rental yields than what is offered in their home countries, along with capital appreciation and low barriers to entry.”</p> <p><img alt=""Sihanoukville’s Best Residential Development, according to the PropertyGuru Cambodia Property Awards 2018, is The Seagate Suite"" src=""/documents/10204/0/The-Seagate-Suite-by-KHCN-Investment-and-Development-Co-Ltd-won-Best-Residential-Development-%28Sihanoukville%29-at-the-Cambodia-Property-Awards-2018-for-web-151-compressor.jpg/140feb7c-54d2-4699-b8b8-c9545624ce84?t=1546416006849"" /></p> <p>“The Sihanoukville market has emerged as an alternative condominium hub to the Phnom Penh market,” adds Som, pointing out, however, that compared to Phnom Penh, it is still in its infancy.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Asia, secondary cities are similarly enjoying Chinese-powered boosts as ties with the country strengthen.</p> <p>In the Philippines, warmer relations with China have seen developers benefit from rising demand from Chinese employees and investors, while partnerships between Filipino and foreign developers are expected to increase.</p> <p><img alt=""Artist’s impression of The Courtyard at the Residences at The Sheraton Cebu Mactan Resort by Appleone Mactan Inc.

The president’s former mayoral city once had a reputation for gun crime; today, property prices are rising. Units on Davao’s Dahican Beach, for example, now sell for PHP10,000 (USD185) to PHP12,000 per square metre compared with PHP1,000 and PHP1,500 per square metre in 2015. </p> <p>“They know that locators from outside are scrambling for any available space here in the city, not only because the President is from here, but because movement of businesses into Davao City has been going on for several years now,” Adrian Tamayo, a Mindanao expert, told the Business Mirror.</p> <p>Meanwhile in Da Nang, Vietnam, holiday homes and tourism-related properties are in high demand. The city’s latest attraction, a 150-metre golden bridge cradled by two enormous stone hands jutting out of the rocky highlands, has become a social media sensation. </p> <p><a href=""http://www.property-report.com/detail/-/blogs/rising-dragon-boom-times-continue-in-vietnam-real-esta-3"" target=""_blank""><strong>More: Boom times continue in Vietnam real estate</strong></a></p> <p>“The main supply [in Da Nang] is in the hospitality and tourism segment,” according to Peter Frieske, founder and managing director of Central Vietnam Realty. Tourism, he says, is rising sharply and analysts predict it will continue to do so. </p> <p>Currently one of the top destinations for Chinese and South Korean visitors in Vietnam, Da Nang received more than five million visitors in the first seven months of 2018—up 30 percent over the same period in 2017, according to the Da Nang tourism department. Of this figure, more than 1.8 million were foreign arrivals, which are up by 54 percent.</p> <p>“The majority of developers are building resorts, with property for sale or condotel villas that are in some way offered with management programmes focusing on returns on investment rather than lifestyle residential properties. When it comes to quality residential projects, the supply is very low,” points out Frieske, adding this is due to the lack of industry in such places.</p> <p>In Phuket where the market has languished in recent years—year-on-year sales dropped 36 percent in 2017—analysts are optimistic 2018 might yield better results.</p> <p><img alt=""The Botanica Luxury Villas won the highly competitive Best Villa Development (Phuket) category at the 2018 Propertyguru Thailand Property Awards"" src=""/documents/10204/0/Best-Villa-Development-%28Phuket%29-winner-for-2018-is-Botanica-Luxury-Villas-by-Botanica-Luxury-Phuket-Co.%2C-Ltd-for-web-151-compressor.jpg/0d1c6751-6bf3-4c63-8430-4b92cde23c40?t=1546415949403"" /></p> <p>Knight Frank’s Lalita Siriboon, associate director of research, says Phuket’s condominium market is expected to improve in line with Thailand’s economy and as the expat population on the island grows. “Demand across the market will continue to be driven upwards by international homebuyers, investors, and expatriates, especially those from Mainland China, Russia, and Australia. Besides, we expected to see a larger portion of buyers from South Korea,” she says, adding there are also government efforts to raise the profile of Phuket as a digital hub and “Smart City,” which is forecast to boost real estate in Phuket by 2020 when the project is to be completed.</p> <p>Unlike capital cities where business and industry will always give people a reason to live there, the jury is still out on Asia’s secondary markets. As it is, investors need to carefully decide whether these “capital contenders” really are a place to call home, or just precariously thriving off clever marketing.</p> <p><em>This article originally appeared in <a href=""https://magzter.com/TH/PropertyGuru-International-(Thailand)-Co.,Ltd/Property-Report/Business/"" target=""_blank"">Issue No. 151</a> of PropertyGuru Property Report Magazine</em></p> 2018: the year in secondary property markets

Today, these cities are seeing the rise of world-class projects displaying green credentials, enticing middle-class apartment-seekers who are forming an increasingly sizeable tranche of society in Vietnam and the Philippines.</p> <p>By 2020, Vietnam’s average annual per capita income is predicted to almost double, from USD1,735 in 2016 to USD3,400. With its large population of citizens under 35 transitioning from a primarily rural economy to an urban one, Vietnam’s property market is proving a lucrative environment for developers, tenants, and both local and foreign buyers, with investors from China, South Korea, Singapore and Malaysia pumping huge sums into the building sector.</p> <p>In Ho Chi Minh City, two companies are paving the way for sustainable real estate. Gamuda Land, the property development arm of Malaysia’s leading engineering and construction group, started building its 82-hectare Celadon City in 2010, making it the first nature-inspired enclave within this traffic-choked megalopolis. </p> <p>Prioritising sustainable living from the outset, Gamuda introduced such innovations as a rain harvesting system that utilises energy-efficient water tanks to collect rainfall around the property and transfer water to irrigation areas. The integrated township in Tan Phu district, home to 7,300 apartments across four precincts that can accommodate 25,000 people, won the Best Mixed Use Landscape Architectural Design gong at the PropertyGuru Vietnam awards this year.</p> <p><a href=""http://property-report.com/detail/-/blogs/can-green-buildings-turn-the-tide-in-climate-acti-10"" target=""_blank""><strong>More: Can green buildings turn the tide in climate action?</strong></a></p> <p>“Celadon City has more than 16 hectares dedicated to lush parklands [that afford] residents the privilege of enjoying nature,” says communications executive Tran Nam Phuong, adding that the Cultural Village, Central Park, the Celadon Sports & Resort Club, and other gathering places within the property offer a sense of community. It’s a concept that’s proven influential, as demand for green living spaces are increasing. </p> <p>A similar success story is Gamuda City, another landmark project in Southern Hanoi, which confronted the Yen So lake area’s chronic water pollution, garbage disposal, and sewage issues head on. Far beyond building a condo, the development effected the complete rehabilitation of a polluted suburban wasteland, leading to significant public health benefits.</p> <p>Making major inroads into HCMC’s sustainable building boom is CapitaLand Vietnam, whose luxurious, 102-room D1MENSION development in Cau Kho is the first boutique housing development in Saigon—one among CapitaLand’s 13 green estates in the city. Themed projects including De La Sol, D2eight, and d’Edge Thao Dien offer new condominium alternatives to young professionals.</p> <p>“CapitaLand remains committed to building a greener future for Vietnam,” says CEO Chen Lian Pang. “Lowering our environmental footprint creates value for our stakeholders. We incorporate environmental sustainability in all stages of a project, [from] design and construction to operations.” A key wealth creator in the country, the Singapore-headquartered company—which scooped 13 PropertyGuru Vietnam awards this year, including Best Developer, Best Condo, and Special Recognition for Sustainable Development—has built almost 5,000 apartments across six other cities, from Halong to Nha Trang.</p> <p><img alt=""Winner of Best Green Development at this year’s Propertyguru Asia Property Awards (Sri Lanka), Clearpoint Residencies Rajagiriya come with self-sustaining gardens instead of ordinary balconies"" src=""/documents/10204/0/Clearpoint-Residencies%2C-Rajagiriya%2C-Sri-Lanka-by-Maga-Engineering-%28Pvt%29-Ltd-%26-Milroy-Perera-Associates-%28Pvt%29-Ltd.-won-Best-Green-Development-%282%29-compressor.jpg/98d681e9-5b00-41ed-9632-44756bcba7ae?t=1545891791227"" /></p> <p>In Metro Manila—another densely populated Southeast Asian city with a burgeoning middle- and affluent class—Taguig-based ArthaLand is a home-grown leader in marrying sustainable credentials with cutting-edge architecture. The property arm of the Century Pacific group has carved a niche in the Philippine market by exclusively focusing on properties that adhere to global and national standards in green buildings.</p> <p>Being the only development in the Philippines to have received the coveted gold certification in the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program, its flagship dual-towered Arya Residences in Bonifacio Global City is a milestone in the country for its design and eco-friendly features. Arya Residences’ construction naturally channels the breeze, its balconies and ledges lending natural shade into the units, adding meaningful outdoor space even as daylight reaches 75 percent into the indoors. Interiors are decorated using paints and resins with low volatile organic compound emissions, while built-in fixtures and appliances deploy advanced technology to reduce environmental impact and usage cost.</p> <p>Winning this year’s “Special Recognition in Sustainable Development” at the PropertyGuru Philippines Property Awards, ArthaLand emphasises human advantages. Arya Residences encourages its residents to live a more environmentally conscious, cost-efficient, and healthy lifestyle. Their advertising tagline, “Green is the new luxury”, is echoed by Raymond Rufino, chairman of the Philippine Green Building Council. “[Sustainability should be more than just achieving efficiency and cost-effectiveness for your property,” says Rufino. “The new frontier for green buildings is improving the health and wellbeing of the people who live, work and play [within your property]. This is a more powerful argument to support going green.”</p> <p>Angie de Villa-Lacson, ArthaLand president and CEO, stresses sustainable architecture has a ripple effect not just for residents, but the property sector at large. “Standardising green measures is a major step in encouraging developers to take sustainability seriously,” she says. “Greening should go beyond landscape and waste management. To fully reap the benefit of sustainability, developers should be able to measure the inputs and outputs of our buildings’ eco-friendly features.”</p> <div class=""pull-quotes-container"">There has never been a better time for investors to go green.

Citraraja Ampat Canning, Sorong Pole and Line Skipjack and Yellowfin Tuna (PT CRAC) has become the first fishery in Indonesia, and the second in Southeast Asia, to be certified to the internationally recognised Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) standard for sustainable fishing.

PT CRAC voluntarily approached independent assessors, DNV GL, to review the sustainability of their fishery against the MSC Fisheries Standard. The MSC does not certify fisheries itself, instead they set a Standard for fisheries to be assessed against. These assessments are carried out by independent, third party certification bodies who determine whether a fishery fails or passes. DNV GL’s assessment of the PT CRAC fishery took 18 months to complete and included an analysis of all available science and data, stakeholder consultation, site visits and peer review by independent experts.

As the world’s second largest seafood producer1, Indonesia has a vital role to play in safeguarding global oceans and seafood supplies. This certification required the fishery meet widely agreed international measures for sustainable fish stocks, minimise environmental impacts and demonstrate effective management. The Indonesian government has committed to new measures to maintain this certification, showing leadership in tackling the challenge of unsustainable fishing.

“PT. Citraraja Ampat Canning is leading the way in sustainable fishing in Indonesia and Southeast Asia” said Patrick Caleo, Asia Pacific Director at the Marine Stewardship Council. “The efforts made by the fishery to achieve MSC certification will help safeguard livelihoods, seafood supplies and healthy oceans for future generations. We hope to see other fisheries follow their lead by joining the global movement for seafood sustainability.”

Small-scale, low-impact fishing

The PT CRAC Sorong Pole and Line Skipjack and Yellowfin Tuna fishery includes 35 pole and line fishing vessels that employ 750 local fishers. It has been operating since 1975 using tethered rafts, known as anchored fish aggregating devices (FADs), for attracting fish. The fishing technique – catching one fish at a time using a pole and line – is highly selective and has a small footprint on the local ecosystem.

Ongoing improvement

The assessor, DNV GL, determined that the fishery meets the high bar of sustainability defined by the MSC Fisheries Standard but set six conditions of certification to be delivered over the next five years. These conditions require improvements to harvest strategies and harvest control rules, ensuring international collaboration on maintaining healthy tuna stocks.

The Indonesian Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) has agreed to work with the fishery to take forward the actions required to address the conditions of certification. This will involve collaboration with other member states of the Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) to promote effective harvest strategies for skipjack and yellowfin tuna. Together, these states are responsible for oversight of 60% of the world’s tuna catch.

Mr. Zulficar Mochtar, Director General of Capture Fisheries, MMAF welcomed the MSC certification for PT. Citraraja Ampat Canning because it will strengthen the fisheries management in Indonesia. Mr. Zulficar stated “MSC certification will show that Indonesian fisheries have achieved the principles and international standards for sustainability. Hopefully, more Indonesian fisheries and industries will achieve MSC certification in the future”.

From the fishery, Mr. Pak Ali Wibisono, Chief Executive Officer of PT. Citraraja Ampat Canning, added: “PT Citraraja Ampat Canning and the Sorong Pole and Line fishery have always had sustainable fishing as our core value and we are very grateful to be the first Indonesian MSC certified fishery.

He continued: “This certification runs parallel with the push by Indonesia’s Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries for the implementation of more sustainable fisheries in the country. We hope this certification will inspire other Indonesian one-by-one tuna fisheries to follow up with sustainable fishing and certification. This is very important for our fishermen and fishing communities in Sorong and will help ensure that the fish and a healthy ocean will be there for future generations.”

PT CRAC processes tuna from the fishery in Sorong, Indonesia before exporting it to Singapore, Malaysia and Europe. Skipjack tuna is also an important source of protein for the local population, with the Government of Indonesia promoting seafood consumption as part of the region’s food security agenda. In recognition of this certification, tuna from the fishery can now be sold with the MSC blue fish label.

The full assessment and certification report is available on msc.org.

Sustainable fishing in the Global South

UN Sustainable Development Goal 14, “Life below the water” sets ambitious targets to reverse trends in unsustainable fishing by 2030. The MSC has committed to supporting governments and fishing organisations in the Global South to deliver on this target through tools and funding that will help develop the knowledge, capacity and data needed to manage fisheries sustainably.

About the MSC

The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) is an international non-profit organisation. Our vision is for the world’s oceans to be teeming with life, and seafood supplies safeguarded for this and future generations. Our ecolabel and certification program recognises and rewards sustainable fishing practices and is helping create a more sustainable seafood market.

The MSC ecolabel on a seafood product means that:

It comes from a wild-catch fishery which has been independently certified to the MSC’s science-based standard for environmentally sustainable fishing.

It’s fully traceable to a sustainable source.

More than 300 fisheries in over 34 countries are certified to the MSC’s Standard. These fisheries have a combined annual seafood production of almost nine million metric tonnes, representing 12% of global marine catch. More than 30,000 seafood products worldwide carry the MSC label. For more information visitwww.msc.org

The MSC program could not exist without the many fishers around the world who work to safeguard stocks, ecosystems and their own livelihoods. Read stories about fishers working hard to safeguard our oceans.

346,https://sustainablebrands.com/read/collaboration-cocreation/how-businesses-are-stepping-up-to-reforest-california,"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Sustainable Brands,How Businesses Are Stepping Up to Reforest California,"California is still reeling from the series of devastating wildfires that gutted its landscape — again — in the past few months.

The bureaucracy and logistics involved for helping the state recover might be complicated, but the facts for business owners and sustainability directors are simple: If you want to help California, you can!

Several big brands have already stepped up and One Tree Planted is making it easy to get involved through the Million Tree Challenge — an initiative to plant 1 million trees in California in 2019. The easy part is the $1/1 tree model. For every dollar donated, one tree will be planted. So if 500 companies commit to just $2,000 each, that’s 1 million trees that can and will be planted to support much-needed environmental restoration in the state.

California Reforestation 101

It’s not just the US Forest Service that plants trees and does environmental restoration, and it’s not just public lands that need support. At least 40 percent of California’s lands are managed by private landowners, and trees don’t really care about private/public divides when it comes to giving much-needed ecological benefit.

There are six regions and 85 seed zones in California, consisting of areas with similar climates and soils. That’s how we’re looking at what’s needed where.

How to define and build a regenerative business How can we start building truly regenerative systems? Download our new report, The Road to Regeneration, to understand the principles of regenerative business and learn how to put regeneration into practice. Tell me more!

While many envision restoration efforts starting immediately after a wildfire is contained, that’s not really how it works. As the land begins recovering, local experts make assessments to determine what kind of restoration is needed where, and how soon it can be done. They’ll also place orders for seedlings far in advance of when they’ll actually be planted, because hundreds of thousands of seedlings of the right native tree varieties can’t materialize overnight!

The average time between forest fires and initiation of reforestation is roughly two years, depending on a variety of ecological and logistical details. Reforestation done in 2019 will be on the sites of forest fires that occurred within the past five years, and we’ve got our shovels ready.

Why trees?

Trees provide ecosystem services — including absorbing and sequestering carbon, cooling the temperature, creating healthy soil and oxygen, filtering water, and providing habitats for biodiversity — that are literally priceless; we are just beginning to understand them in terms of non-monetary value.

But the trees in California are disappearing fast, and not just due to wildfires. CalFire estimates mortality of 129 million trees between 2010-2017 from a combination of wildfires and infestations, a number that will greatly increase after this year. And while decades of fire suppression did result in an abundance of seedlings, shrubs and other “fuel” that makes fires more severe when combined with drought and strong winds, the answer to California’s overall tree challenge is not fewer trees, it’s more — native species of stronger and more resilient stock, planted in fire-smart ways, in appropriate locations, as soon as the land can retain water and before invasive species and weeds can set in. In essence, sensible reforestation.

Where business comes in

Companies can help by supporting reforestation projects where they’re needed and can be done at a reasonable timescale — minus the bureaucracy.

And it makes for a good CSR story, just saying.

Business partnerships have already helped to fund global reforestation projects through One Tree Planted. These include agroforestry projects in Africa, with the support of the World Resources Institute; forest fire restoration on the site of British Columbia’s Elephant Hill Wildfire of 2017; and even urban reforestation in cities such as Miami. Now, we’re focusing on California — and you have an easy in.

“Business partnerships represent a significant part of how we’re getting trees in the ground, and there’s potential to do so much more in California,” says Matt Hill, Chief Environmental Evangelist at One Tree Planted. “Some see it as Corporate Social Responsibility, but when I’m on the phone with founders and directors, I can tell they’re doing it because they care and they just want to be part of the solution.”

How we do it

The advantage of working with a network of on-the-ground partners is having the ability to plant in specific locations through many small- to medium-scale projects scattered throughout the state.

It also matters that the people involved are focusing on California’s air, water, habitats and long-term sustainability in a changing climate. And the trees aren’t just planted anywhere — it’s a thoughtful process full of planning, backed by research.

As a fast-growing 501(c)(3) non-profit with minimal overhead, One Tree Planted is agile. By being flexible to the needs of both business partners and planting partners, quickly able to allocate funds to the projects that need it most, One Tree Planted is able to fund many micro-reforestation projects that add up to create a big environmental impact.

Not only do these reforestation projects restore degraded land and habitats for an ecological benefit, but many also have direct involvement by local communities. Schools, families, local businesses, and other groups join the efforts. This helps to raise awareness about environmental issues, the complexities of California’s landscapes, and the importance of sustainability.

Together, we can plant 1 million trees

It’s going to take significant commitment, networks and funding to reforest California’s landscapes, but the movement is already in motion. Several big names have signed on to One Tree Planted’s Million Tree Challenge, including adidas, BlackRock, CIT and Facebook, along with many other dedicated partners.

There’s also a coalition of reforestation planting partners in order to get the trees in the ground. These include all of California’s Resource Conservation Districts (RCDs), CalFire, the California Native Plant Society, and many local watershed organizations that generally have the ecological wisdom and staff or volunteer support to complete projects, but simply need funding to make it happen.

The California Association of Resource Conservation Districts includes 98 RCDs that focus on supporting private landowners, who manage a significant 40 percent of California’s lands. This knowledgeable network works on conservation, restoration, education and funding for a variety of programs that focus on the health and resilience of California’s natural resources. One Tree Planted has already funded 320,000 trees planted and distributed to landowners through the RCDs in 2017 — including in El Dorado County, as part of the King Fire and Sand Fire restoration efforts.

Looking ahead to 2019, One Tree Planted has already committed to planting 100,000 trees on the site of the Mendocino Complex Fire, which burned close to a half-million acres earlier in 2018, in addition to many other projects throughout the state.

California wildfires have already consumed over 1.5 million acres in 2018, resulting in significant loss of life, property and habitats, in addition to releasing countless tons of CO2 into the atmosphere at a time when we should be sequestering it. California’s air and water quality are also compromised, which not only affects local residents but any of the rest of us who depend upon California’s vast food production capacity.

When looking at the environmental impact, we can approach the challenge in one of two ways: by debating climate change and forest management, or by focusing on restoration in the quickest and most fire-smart ways possible.

We’re going with option two — join us!

When nature thrives, we all live better and have a stronger economy. And while the immediate humanitarian needs are being met, this is the time to plan for the future. The earlier you get on board, the sooner we can make an impact together.

With the support of the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and in collaboration with National Geographic, the project focuses on three World Heritage sites in South Asia including Lumbini, the Birthplace of the Lord Buddha (Nepal), Buddhist Monuments at Sanchi (India), and Ruins of the Buddhist Vihara at Paharpur (Bangladesh). The goal is to create an online platform to encourage sustainable tourism and a deeper understanding and appreciation of the three sites.

The workshop brought together tourism and heritage representatives from the three countries to discuss marketing and promotion strategies for the World Heritage Journeys: Buddha platform and for their respective sites. A beta version of the web platform provided the delegates with a presentation of the online content and features of the website. Workshop participants also undertook a site visit to Sanchi, the stupa built by Emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE. It is one of the best-preserved monuments from the era and has detailed artworks carved into rocks, telling the story of the early years of Buddhism.

There was also an opportunity to visit another World Heritage site near Bhopal, the Bhimbetka rock shelters. Hundreds of paintings on the rock faces at Bhimbetka depict the lives of early humans, including scenes of hunting, warfare, and domestic duties. Some of the paintings are more than 10,000 years old, while others are as recent as the medieval period.

Organized with the support from the Tourism Department of Madhya Pradesh and in conjunction with the Buddhist Circuit initiative of the World Bank, the event in Bhopal was the second workshop of the project, after a successful gathering in Kathmandu, Nepal, in July.

With this acquisition, Blue Planet now offers an innovative solution to process organic waste through decentralised containerised technology to solve Asia's growing urban waste problem.

Yasasu's self-contained and compact digesters can process one to five tonnes of organic waste such as leftover food, vegetable and fruit peels, garden waste and sludge, making it ideal for locations that require decentralised processing solutions.

""By thoughtful integration and finding avenues for meaningful synergies with collection and transportation technologies, Blue Planet Environmental Solutions will be able to expand and bring Yasasu's unique solution to the forefront of waste management technology in the region,"" remarked Madhujeet Chimni, Founder and Chairman of Blue Planet Environmental Solutions.

He added, ""Generation of energy from waste would have significant social and economic benefits, across most Asian countries.""

Containing the waste problem

Waste management infrastructure contributes directly in achieving sustainable development and smart urban living. Forty-one per cent of waste generated in India is organic waste, majority of which is left untreated causing a myriad of social and environmental problems.

To find a solution to this growing challenge, Yasasu Green's dedicated team of technical experts and thought leaders designed a small scale containerized product to treat waste at source based on DRYCO-ADTM technology.

Suhas Bhand, Chairman of Yasasu Green, said, ""After nine years of experience, we have a deep understanding of what are the requirements of urban centres in the country. The main problem faced by cities is land availability, which makes it difficult to set up a large centralized plant for waste processing. Therefore, we have developed this decentralized system to optimize waste management at the precinct level in urban areas.""

Using an advanced biological process based on the proven high solid thermophilic biomethanation process for treating MSW, the unit generates biogas and high-quality compost.

The recovered biogas can be used directly for cooking (as a fuel) or converted into electricity which gets channelled back to power the Yasasu Green unit, making it self-sufficient, while also providing electricity to the local communities.

One containerised processing unit of 2/1 (mixed/segregated) ton of waste per day is capable of producing 250 kg of bio-compost and 120 Nm3 of biogas per day. Yasasu Green is a swift and simple solution ideal for the urban and semi-urban market in cities in the region for decentralized processing of organic municipal solid waste.

Current Installations

A 1 TPD feed capacity plant has been installed and is successfully operating in Mumbai, India in agreement with the Greater Mumbai Municipal Corporation & Pali Hill Resident Welfare Association.

One of the largest public sector undertakings in India has awarded Yasasu Green a contract to install three containerised unit to segregate and process 10 TPD of mixed waste in Varanasi, India. Along with this project, Yasasu units are also being deployed at multiple sites across the country for efficient processing of organic waste.

Sustainable Waste Management

As the Swachh Bharat Mission, India 's nation-wide campaign to achieve improved urban and rural sanitation standards gathers pace, demand for innovative models like Yasasu to process waste by creating scalable and practical solutions is steadily rising.

""Yasasu 's distributed waste-to-energy solution would dramatically reduce disposal to landfill and generate clean, reliable energy from a renewable fuel source. We are excited about its unique offering as it is highly scalable and will meaningfully contribute to Blue Planet 's rapid growth plans"" said Prashant Singh, Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Blue Planet Environmental Solutions.

""Waste management is a responsibility and that has been our philosophy in creating technological solutions for maximising resource recovery. With the given growth strategy and shared vision of Blue Planet, we look forward to expanding our product portfolio and taking our products to global markets,"" said Yashas Bhand, Chief Executive Officer of Yasasu Green.

If you’ve spent some time on the road in the past few months (and well, who hasn’t?), bright orange signs cheekily advising to ‘seek alternative routes’ couldn’t have escaped you. These alternative routes are meant as a solution to avoiding the many road closures, blockages, and general havoc caused by a massive road widening exercise brought about by the government in a feeble attempt to solve disastrous gridlock on our islands’ roads.

This gridlock takes a toll on our health. More often than not, the air pollution in the areas around the harbours is palpable. According to the European Environmental Agency’s latest report on air quality, the emissions of particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and ozone have increased in Malta in the past few years, largely due to road transport, and that contributes to premature deaths as a result of heart and lung disease. The Environment and Resources Authority (ERA) recently published the State of the Environment report which confirms that students in classrooms facing roads suffer from a higher rate of respiratory conditions. The irony is that children are being taken to school by car because it would be too dangerous to walk, scoot or cycle.

Why do we need to move away from car dependence?

Promoting only one mode of transport, and improving infrastructure solely for the car, deepens our car dependence and excludes everyone else outside the car. It is becoming increasingly difficult to live without a car, with road space being taken away from more sustainable modes (through the removal of dedicated bus, cycle lanes and even pavements). The growing network of busy roads makes crossing them a challenge and severs communities. A car-dependent society effectively excludes those who cannot afford a car, or cannot drive one due to age, disability, choice or affordability. Thus, a fair and equitable transport system should serve everyone, not just those in a position to own and drive a car.

In a country where space is at a premium, how can we accept the occupation of so much public space by private property? As Donald Shoup, professor in urban planning, states in his book ‘The High Cost of Free Parking’, cars are parked over 95% of the time. Because of omnipresent and haphazard parking, soft modes of transport, such as walking and cycling, become increasingly difficult and unpleasant.

Millions upon millions of euros are being spent on widening the roads: €17 million for additional road space in Marsa, Żebbuġ and Luqa, among others. Add to that €7 million for the upgrading and widening of Regional Road, and a projected €55 million for the Central Link project. The list goes on.

The Ministry for Transport and Infrastructure, and the newly established agency Infrastructure Malta, are proudly throwing these numbers around as if they were confetti. All the while, we know that this strategy will not be effective in the long run: with the number of cars on the roads steadily increasing at the rate of 33 vehicles per day, they will soon fill up the additional created space and get stuck in further bottlenecks. This concern was also raised by the Ombudsman’s Environment Commissioner a few weeks ago in his reaction to the publication of the latest State of the Environment Report.

Before the public even gets a chance to discuss whether these projects would truly improve our quality of life, the fresh tarmac is already laid.

The road works at Tal-Balal are taking place without a PA permit, let alone a public consultation process. Strategic planning documents – the Malta Transport Plan 2025, the Malta Transport Strategy 2050, and the Strategic Plan for Environment and Development (SPED) – that are supposed to guide infrastructural projects of this scale, are blatantly ignored. In addition, we are paying (a comparatively meagre, but not insignificant sum) near €200,000 a year for not meeting our emission reduction targets. At the same time, the government announced that phasing out of diesel and petrol cars in order to meet greenhouse gas emission reductions, as per the Paris climate agreement, is in the pipeline, with a study on different scenarios underway. This begs a question: why therefore spend all those public funds on further fuelling our car dependence?

While many of us often think of Malta as a special place, with respect to transport it isn’t special. Every western city, even those now renowned for their public transport systems and pedestrian and cycling infrastructures, once grappled with the same issues: streets clogged with cars, illegal parking on sidewalks and air pollution… Sounds familiar, right?

While the context behind the models adopted by Copenhagen and Amsterdam may be different to that of Malta, there are also admirable examples closer to home.

In Seville, for example, the number of trips by cyclists grew five-fold in three years, following the introduction of a bicycle-sharing system and the creation of dedicated cycling infrastructure. In an effort to reduce pollution and emissions from cars, Bologna opted for the innovative approach which rewards citizens for choosing green travel modes—walking, cycling or using public transport—with free beer, ice-cream or cinema tickets. The Spanish town Pontevedra successfully removed most of the cars from the city centre, turning it into a pedestrian haven with cleaner air, reduced emissions, and a thriving hub for small, local businesses.

Examples from these cities show that investing in public and active transport can achieve three goals simultaneously: first, it can move more people more efficiently; second – free the road space for more socially and environmentally beneficial modes of transport; and third, it can lower local health and environment concerns.



Suggestions: transport for everyone

Why not use public funds to invest in an alternative transport future? Rather than short-term non-solutions like road-widening measures, we need to imagine an alternative pathway; a route to sustainable mobility that will serve everyone. There are plenty of potential solutions out there.

In many countries, the backbone of public transport, the bus, has been reinvented in recent years. Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems, which have been popularised in north and south America, are high capacity, fast and frequent bus services that operate using dedicated bus lanes and boarding platforms, off-board fare collection, smartcard payments, and sleek design and marketing campaigns. The most famous BRT system is probably the TransMilenio in Bogotá, Colombia, which transports tens of thousands of passengers per hour in each direction on its busiest corridor. Together with the investment in a city-wide cycling network, Bogotá’s BRT is hailed as a shining example of how integrated transport solutions can transform the urban environment and make the bus appeal to the masses again.

The creation of a light rail or metro system has sparked the imagination of many. A London style Tube Map of Malta by Jonathan Galea, on display during the Malta Design Week 2014, was in the author’s words “in no way a proposal, but rather a social commentary and piece of graphic art”. However, a few years later the discussion about a mass transit system for the Maltese Islands has taken on a more serious tone, and has been put forward as a potential long-term solution by different political and business figures on the islands, from influential entrepreneurs and architects to the former Opposition party leader.

Overground and underground are not the only options available when it comes to public transport for the Maltese islands.

The harbour ferries linking Valletta to Sliema and the Three Cities have been re-introduced with success in the past years. There are plans to extend the ferry services to other localities on the eastern coast of the island: from the harbour area to the north (St Julian’s, Buġibba, and all the way up to Gozo) and southwards towards Smart City and Marsaskala.

Even the sky need not be a limit. A proposal putting forward the idea for an urban cable car network for Malta deserves due consideration. Such a model could provide an efficient public transport service at 10-30% of the cost of a metro system, while not putting further pressure on scarce land. Cable car services have been introduced in other European cities such as Porto and Dubrovnik.

Going up in the air is also the premise of the proposal for “the (real) alternative grid”, a solution put forward by a local architectural firm to create a separate network of pedestrian and cycling paths, levelling off elevation differences between towns by crossing valleys on raised flyovers, as well as through the use of existing and new tunnels.

Independent, smaller initiatives can also make a difference. Earlier this year, the Żejtun primary school in collaboration with the local council, organised a bike-to-school day, and the Safi local council has just been awarded funding to start operating a ‘walking bus’ to school, in which kids are picked up along a route and under the guidance of adults, can walk to school safely. For walking and cycling to become daily accepted modes of transport again, safe, direct and attractive infrastructure is needed, as well as a legal framework that defends these most vulnerable road users.

Shared mobility solutions, such as bicycle, scooter and car-sharing, as well as ride-sharing (carpooling) and ride-hailing services have also been introduced in recent years, and add further mobility options to a modern, multi-modal transport landscape. Perhaps less innovative, but nonetheless effective, are organised forms of shared transport, such as scheduled minivans and buses for schoolchildren and workers in employment hubs.



Mobility as a basic human right

While a mass-transit network can deliver on some strategic axes where demand is high, experiences from across Europe show that in many cases, there has been too strong a focus on expensive mass-transit projects with limited scope, serving only a sub-section of the population, while ignoring the mobility needs of those living outside of the mass-transit corridor. In addition, the required large capital investments have often meant a transfer of public to private ownership, in an attempt to let ‘the market’ dictate the appropriate price for an efficient service, and ameliorate the losses experienced by public transport services across Europe in the past decades. These developments have eroded the level of service of public transport, and its initial promise to provide transport for all.

Mobility is a basic human need. We all need access to education, work, healthcare, goods and services. We should therefore look at designing a transport system that provides equitable, affordable and efficient mobility options—truly a public transport.

No single silver bullet solution will magically solve the transport conundrum we have on our hands. We need to look at this problem from a long-term and holistic perspective.

Large scale mass-transit options may have a place in our future transport system, but, while studying the feasibility of those potential models, we should focus in the short term on picking the low-hanging fruits and make use of the assets we already own: improve the reliability, speed and frequency of bus services through the creation of dedicated lanes, fast boarding platforms, and integrated payment solutions, extend the ferry network and introduce further fast ferry links; and prioritise pedestrian movement within village cores and town centres, and safe cycling routes between localities.

While the transport landscape on the Maltese islands is modernising and diversifying, what is needed is the full integration of these modes, not only physically, but also financially, so that they can become desirable alternatives and can be used in a multi-modal mix. This is the premise of the newest buzzwords in the transport sector: Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS), a subscription approach to mobility which builds on seamless integration of transport networks, real-time mobility information and integrated payment options. It is important however to ensure that Mobility-as-a-Service is designed and executed not just to provide the hypermobile younger middle- and upper-classes with even more mobility, but that such a model actually caters for all members of society. In other words, it must offer an affordable transport service for everyone.

Ultimately, for any combination of transport modes to become a true alternative to the privately-owned car, it has to offer a real alternative in terms of costs, comfort and convenience. The required modal shift to alternative modes of transport will not happen only by providing ‘carrots’, but will require ‘sticks’ to curb the excessive freedoms and claims on public space of private cars, too.

These genetically homogeneous varieties were more susceptible to pests and diseases, with the potential for widespread failure. It was already known that chemical inputs exert deleterious effects on soil and water (the major components of the ecological foundations of sustainable agriculture).

***

Keshav Kranthi (former Director of Central Institute for Cotton Research, Nagpur, and currently with the International Cotton Advisory Committee, Washington DC, USA) notes that from 2008 onwards, Bt-cotton yield stagnated at around 500 kg/ha and currently remains at this level or perhaps even lower, despite the substantial increase in area under Bt-cotton cultivation.

Pest resistance to Bollgard II was already evident as early as 2008 and the onset of secondary pests became a serious concern. Kranthi concludes: ‘Bt cotton was supposed to have conferred two major benefits to cotton production: (a) high yields due to effective protection of bolls from bollworm damage and (b) reduction in insecticides recommended on bollworm control. Official data show that none of these promises was kept in the past ten years in India’. The pertinent records are available in the public domain.

It is interesting that the Union of India in its counter affidavit in the Delhi High Court (in WPCC) No. 12069 of 2015, has correlated farmer suicides with the failure of Bt-cotton. At the same time, leading American cotton scientists, Gutierrez and coworkers14 have shown that farmers’ annual suicide rates in rainfed areas are directly related to increases in Bt-cotton adoption (i.e. costs). The lack of irrigation, onset of pest resistance and emergence of secondary pests necessitating application of chemical pesticides and the cost thereof, have significantly added to farmers’ woes.

Growing a refuge crop delays onset of resistance. But in India ‘refuges’ are not viable given our small-holder farming. The data points conclusively to the failure of Bt-cotton due to rising resistance, the hybrid policy and secondary pests. Many cotton scientists have acknowledged the huge socio-economic cost borne by cotton farmers as a result of deploying hybrids in Bt-cotton; that it was a clever ploy for a ‘valuecapture mechanism’ by Monsanto. Its role in the failure of Bt-cotton in India and the resulting indebtedness of our farmers is significant.

There is no doubt that GE Bt-cotton has failed in India: it has failed as a sustainable agriculture technology and has therefore also failed to provide livelihood security of cotton farmers who are mainly resource-poor, small and marginal farmers. That a plea has recently been made to Bt-cotton farmers to adopt the time-honoured traditional integrated pest management (IPM) system to sustain Bollgard II cotton points to the relative effectiveness of a traditional vis-à-vis modern technology.

It is unethical to ask farmers to first adopt the highly expensive technology of Bt-cotton and when it subsequently failed, to then introduce an inexpensive traditional technology to protect Bollgard II cotton. Both Bt- and herbicide-tolerant (HT) crops are now proven to be unsustainable agricultural technologies. They have not decreased the need for toxic chemical pesticides, which was the reason for them in the first place.

The Green Revolution (christened by the late William Gaud of the US Agency for International Development), was a farming technology. This revolution requiring high-level chemical intensification (i.e. high cost), therefore, largely excluded resource-poor small and marginal farmers. Scientific integrity demands that society is kept informed of the deficiencies and negative impacts of products of technology and innovation.Swaminathan did just this. As early as January 1968, months before the ‘Wheat Yield Revolution’ stamp was released by the Government of India, he elaborated as follows:Since we are at a stage of rapid advances in science and technology, it may be worthwhile discussing their impact on food and nutrition security. Only a few examples are taken up for discussion. The research programmes adopted at the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF), Chennai, fall under the categories of anticipatory, participatory and translational research. This is essential for ensuring that the technologies are ecologically, socially and economically sustainable.As had been foreseen and forewarned by Swaminathan, the Green Revolution started showing ‘yield fatigue’ by the late 1980s, and reached a peak decline by the mid- 1990s. By then, Swaminathan had developed strategies to transform the unsustainable Green Revolution into an Evergreen Revolution. Unlike the former, which focused mainly on the genetic modification of the plant type, the latter was designed on ‘systems approach’ to ensure concurrent attention to environmental and social dimensions as well. It is emphasized that the Green Revolution, which was not designed to fight the famine of rural livelihoods, could establish food security only at the national level, but not at the individual household level of millions of the rural poor.On the other hand, the Evergreen Revolution combined ‘ecoagriculture’ to produce food (i.e. ensuring availability of food) with ‘ecotechnologies-led ecoenterprises’ consisting of onfarm and non-farm rural livelihoods in order to enhance ‘access’ (i.e. purchasing power) of rural communities to food.Hunger in India is largely due to lack of purchasing power especially in rural areas, than a lack of availability of food. The paradigm ‘mountains of grains on one hand, and millions of hungry people on the other’ well described the national hunger paradox following the Green Revolution. The lessons learnt are that any technology, modern or traditional, ought to be eco-friendly and relevant to the weakest among the poor.It is claimed by some that hybrid Bt-cotton has led to an unprecedented increase in India’s cotton production. These claims, however, are not based on analyses by experts or authorities on cotton in India. To set the record straight, we cite two of the world’s most recognized authorities on the science and production of cotton.","Its role in the failure of Bt-cotton in India and the resulting indebtedness of our farmers is significant.

In association with Samhita – a social enterprise specialising in developing CSR initiatives; ACF hosted a participatory dialogue on ‘Investing in Water for Today and the Future’ here today in order to address and mitigate the growing water scarcity issues. The activity has brought together different players working or interested in the water sector to communicate the extent of the crisis, provide pathways for investment and facilitate collaborations across the country. ACF held similar activities earlier too.

Sharing her views on this occasion Ambuja Cement Foundation Head Pearl Tiwari said, “India is facing serious water crisis and going by the NITI Aayog report, the situation is expected to get worse by 2030. The already scarce water resource has been further compromised in quality and availability by inefficiency, mismanagement and climate change. The goal of this program is to bring together various stakeholders across the spectrum to share learnings, discuss existing challenges and opportunities; and take corrective steps towards ensuring water security for the future through partnerships.”

At the event, ACF and Samhita also unveiled Making a Case for Corporate Action in Water, a report that showcased existing interventions in water across various themes such as drinking water, water for agriculture, water conservation and management, water treatment and more. The report identifies commonalities and key insights from the various case studies; and provides a broad landscape of the stakeholders and their interventions within the cause areas. “The idea is to explore, analyse and replicate programmatic excellence in water management, through effective collaborations” adds Ms Tiwari.

Through its flagship ‘Water Resource Management’ program, ACF has been working on ensuring all-year-round access to water in the core villages it is operating in. The innovative and consistent endeavours have not only addressed drinking water needs, but at the same time increased water-use efficiency. By partnering with the government and other developmental agencies, ACF has over the years completed and implemented large-scale projects including 408 check dams, 6751 Roof Rainwater Harvesting Structures, 72 km of canal linkage, thereby creating 55 million cubic meter of water storage capacity.

Marking its Silver Jubilee year recently, ACF has stepped up its efforts through partnerships – between communities, Government and other like-minded corporates and NGOs – to help solve pressing community problems and foster prosperity. Its ongoing water resource management model focuses on three areas – Water Harvesting (check dams, interlinking rivers and watershed development etc.), Drinking Water (Roof Rainwater Harvesting Structures, pond deepening, in-village distribution system and water quality surveillance etc.) and Water Conservation (Water User Association, Participatory Irrigation Management and Promotion of Micro Irrigation).

ACF played a key role in Ambuja Cement earning 5.5 times water positive status – the highest in the industry. Over the last 25 years, ACF has been working with a vision to achieve drinking water sufficiency for all villages in its operational areas by 2020 and has invested over Rs.160 crore so far in its water management initiative.","Ambuja Cement Foundation (ACF), the CSR arm of leading cement manufacturer Ambuja Cements Ltd., has called for a greater emphasis on cohesive and collaborative efforts to inspire sustainable water management and build water sufficient, progressive and prosperous communities across India.
“The idea is to explore, analyse and replicate programmatic excellence in water management, through effective collaborations” adds Ms Tiwari.
The innovative and consistent endeavours have not only addressed drinking water needs, but at the same time increased water-use efficiency.
Its ongoing water resource management model focuses on three areas – Water Harvesting (check dams, interlinking rivers and watershed development etc.
), Drinking Water (Roof Rainwater Harvesting Structures, pond deepening, in-village distribution system and water quality surveillance etc.)"

Nasser Kakembo, MD, is a pediatric surgeon—one of just four among the 200 surgeons who serve more than 40 million people in Uganda. He gets up at 5 a.m. every weekday and drives 40 minutes to the hospital in Kampala, the capital city.

He recently treated a young orphan who had been born with a vestibular fistula (an abnormal connection between the female genitalia and rectum). In the U.S., doctors would have repaired this in infancy. But this girl was 12 years old and had never seen a surgeon. Dr. Kakembo performed a temporary colostomy, a procedure to temporarily divert the large intestine so that she could pass stool into a bag outside of her abdomen, then later performed a more complex surgery to correct the vestibular fistula.

""This is a child who had never gone to school,"" Dr. Kakembo says. He didn't know her parents' story, but he says Ugandans have such a negative perception of colostomies that families may split up when a child has one. Fortunately, the mother of another hospitalized child took an interest in the girl and taught her to sew. ""So, now this girl is a tailor. She has a livelihood. She came to the hospital with a medical problem that we were able to fix, and now she is living her life,"" Dr. Kakembo says.

But the problem is that ""there are so many stories like this,"" he says. ""And many patients are never treated or even diagnosed.""

Helping surgeons help themselves

This is a situation Yale Medicine pediatric surgeon Doruk Ozgediz, MD, MSc, wants to fix. An assistant professor at Yale School of Medicine, Dr. Ozgediz has a master's degree in public health in developing countries and has been regularly visiting Uganda for 15 years.

Uganda is a country known for its lush forests and misty mountains. It was once described by Winston Churchill as the ""pearl of Africa."" But many of its people don't get proper medical care. When Dr. Ozgediz first traveled there in 2003, most visiting doctors were helping to manage such problems as HIV and malaria. ""Little had been done to tackle surgical diseases,"" he says. ""There were major challenges as far as infrastructure, poverty, and just human resources, not enough workforce—not enough of just about everything. The question was, what could we do?""

Dr. Ozgediz was especially drawn to caring for the children, partly because 50 percent of the population in Uganda is 14 and younger, and 85 percent of children in low-income countries are likely to need surgery by age 15, he says.

Although there is no fee for surgery in Uganda, patients must pay for the hospital stay, the imaging tests, even the bed linens. Some sell off cattle—and sometimes their house—to pay for needed care, Dr. Kakembo says. The shortage of doctors in Uganda means that many patients who do get surgery aren't getting it from specialists trained to treat their particular type of problem. It's not uncommon for a woman with a gynecologic problem to seek help from the only doctor available to her, even if that doctor is a pediatrician, Dr. Kakembo says.

In response to this, many Yale Medicine doctors travel on medical missions to provide care for people who wouldn't be treated otherwise. But Dr. Ozgediz envisioned Uganda as a place that, with some help, could provide its own sustainable surgical care. (This perspective mirrors a recent mandate from the World Health Organization to make essential surgical care available in all countries.) So, while he has helped perform thousands of surgeries there, he prefers teaching skills to Ugandan surgeons and advocating to increase local capacity.

With that in mind, in 2006 Dr. Ozgediz co-founded the nonprofit Global Partners in Anesthesia and Surgery (GPAS). It is a multidisciplinary collaboration focused on increasing surgical care capacity in resource-poor settings with projects to strengthen workforce and infrastructure to address the surgical disease locally. More recently, GPAS partnered with a Scottish charity called the Archie Foundation (now KIDS OR), which provided the country with two fully equipped operating rooms (Dr. Ozgediz led research to evaluate the impact of those operating rooms). He also lived in Uganda in 2007 and 2008, working full-time as a visiting surgeon in Mulago Hospital in Kampala. Now, he visits the country as often as four times a year, for two- to four-week stretches, to instruct the new pediatric surgery fellows, in addition to general surgery trainees, in both classroom and clinical settings. ""Once they are trained, each new surgeon will do 700 to 1,000 operations a year, many of them life-saving operations, and more children will have access to surgical care,"" Dr. Ozgediz says.

Dr. Ozgediz says he has built long-term relationships with Ugandan surgeons and like-minded colleagues globally, and worked with local medical teams both in Kampala and in rural areas that are often hours outside the city. The results are promising: One GPAS project helped triple the number of surgical trainees in the country from 15 to 45 (all remained in the country after training). And instead of one pediatric surgeon in the country, there are now four.

Adding an endocrine specialty

Three years ago, Tobias Carling, MD, Ph.D., through connections with Dr. Ozgediz, started to regularly travel to Uganda, having heard there was a need to increase capacity for endocrine surgical care. Dr. Carling is chief of Yale Medicine Endocrine Surgery and director of endocrine cancer care at Smilow Cancer Hospital. ""Growing up in Sweden, and practicing in the United States, I had so many opportunities,"" Dr. Carling says. ""I wanted to get involved in some way. And then this presented itself.""

In addition to performing surgeries himself, Dr. Carling trains surgical residents and fellows in Uganda in endocrine surgery, and tracks surgical outcomes. ""Once I teach the residents how the operation can be done the safe way, they'll have a career for 40 years and be able to train the next generation,"" he says.

He has traveled six hours from Kampala to small hospital ""camps"" in rural areas, sometimes treating patients who have walked two days to get there. Dr. Carling sees many people with goiter, a disease caused by an enlarged thyroid compressing the trachea, affecting breathing and swallowing, that he treats with a subtotal thyroidectomy.

One of his most impactful experiences has been watching doctors do successful surgeries with limited tools and supplies. ""It's night and day as far as resources. That blows your mind a little bit—how much we throw away in the U.S. because things are made to be used only once, and they use them repeatedly because it's all they have,"" he says. He once had to use a World War II-era anesthesia machine to help a patient he was treating. Even so, he says, ""The patients are similar, the anatomy and the difficulty of the operation are the same, and, what's more, we have proven that we can have excellent outcomes.""

Making the most of limited resources

Dr. Kakembo would agree, with at least one difference: There are many more patients in Uganda and limited supplies and equipment.

He told his story while sitting in an office toward the end of a weeklong visit to Yale in October. It was the second visit Dr. Ozgediz had arranged for Dr. Kakembo so that he could speak at Yale, learn from Yale's pediatric surgeons, and attend conferences in this country. (Yale also has hosted medical students and trainees from Uganda, recently including an obstetrician who plans to start a maternal-fetal pediatric program in Uganda.)

He says he performed well enough in his early school years to be accepted to medical school, where he found a mentor who got him interested in surgery. ""He gave me the passion to love the discipline. I loved the art of fixing tissue,"" Dr. Kakembo says. He was a surgical resident when he first met Dr. Ozgediz in 2012. Like many of his young peers, he had considered leaving the country to practice surgery in a place where he could make more money and live an easier life. ""But I didn't have the means to leave then, so I stayed,"" he says. ""I don't think I'll consider leaving my country now. The need is too great. We make a difference every day.""

Dr. Kakembo starts each day by checking on patients who came in during the night, often after they've been in a car crash—roads are dangerous and accidents are frequent. Later, if it's a surgery day, he goes to the operating room, where he performs surgery—including many highly complicated procedures—well into the evening. In his most challenging weeks, if he is working in a hospital camp, he might perform more than 100 surgeries. Recently, a mother traveled three hours by bus so that he could help her baby, who had a large tumor growing out of his back. Another baby's intestines were growing outside of its body—a condition called gastroschisis that is fatal if left untreated.

""For the surgeon, it's a very demanding job, especially when it comes to emergencies. There are so many emergencies,"" Dr. Kakembo says. ""That means we end up having a backlog of elective cases that are not tended to.""

But his greatest concern is for the patients he doesn't see, including children who never see a doctor for devastating anomalies that should be corrected in the first year of life, or who see a doctor when it is almost too late.

""I think we are desensitized,"" Dr. Kakembo says. ""But it's the circumstances. There are so many patients. To advocate for them, we need to do an even better job of quantifying our unmet needs through clinical research.""

The rewards flow both ways

The help provided by Yale Medicine doctors can seem a mere drop in the bucket in the context of so much need. But Dr. Ozgediz and Dr. Carling know that every little bit helps and say that when our doctors work in Uganda, their view of what's possible expands. Their perspective changes. They see that surgeons there, who have found ways to do more with limited resources, can do an operation in Uganda for $15. A medical student might learn how to fix an oxygen tank for a patient if he or she is the only one available to do it.

""American trainees appreciate the resources in the U.S. better when they can see what it is like on the other side,"" Dr. Ozgediz says. ""Many come back forever changed—as clinicians and as human beings.""

""It has made me a bit more patient,"" Dr. Carling says. ""If I'm in the U.S., and something is not functioning perfectly or there is a delay, I think, well, at least we have lights in the operating room, at least we have functioning electricity. We are so fortunate when it comes to the resources we have here.""

Both doctors say their experience in Uganda has made them better listeners when they are consulting with patients at Yale.

Meanwhile, as Dr. Kakembo learns more surgical skills and the capacity to provide surgery in Uganda grows, he wants to educate its citizens about what health care can do for them. ""I want patients to come to us early, so we can provide the best treatment for them,"" he says.

He is grateful to his American colleagues for helping him advance as a pediatric surgeon, and is hopeful for the future. ""Their presence is being felt here,"" says Dr. Kakembo. ""This has really made a difference.""
