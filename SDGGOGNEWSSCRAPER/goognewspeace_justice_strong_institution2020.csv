Antonio | Peace, security are key for sustainable development – Part II ... A critical overview of UNDP’s contributions to Jamaica and a vision of the island’s true potential","In part I of this two-part series, Denise E. Antonio, UNDP resident representative, examined the cost of insecurity to Jamaica and how it denies Jamaica her true potential.

United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has been pleased over the years to partner with the Government and people of Jamaica and other nations in this region in advancing Jamaica’s national development priorities, including those related to peace and security.

UNDP’s focus within the peace and security portfolio has included:

1. Supporting justice reform and promoting equal access to justice services.

2. Supporting the elimination of discriminatory laws.

3. Advancing policies and programmes to reduce inequality.

4. Enhancing citizens’ safety and security (for example, street lighting, small arms management).

5. Strengthening governance systems and the capacities of national and local institutions to deliver better services.

6. Strengthening law-enforcement institutions to carry out their mandates.

7. Improving data gathering and management systems to better monitor crime

8. Training members of the judiciary and law-enforcement officials in human rights.

9. Improving the capacity of countries to lower risks to natural disasters and withstand shocks.

Our internal evaluations tell us that although our interventions have had some impacts, radical steps are needed to achieve lasting peace and security in the region. If we continue with ‘business as usual’, we will lose the kind of impact we desire. Also, many of our projects require improved sustainability strategies. Often, interventions cease when the project ends.

IMPROVE QUALITY OF PEOPLE’S LIVES

We are pleased to report, however, that some UNDP-implemented projects have improved the quality of people’s lives.

Among them are: The ACP-EU Development Minerals Programme that has awarded 19 grants to artisans valuing US$85,000, which they have used to significantly increase their income; the Japan-Caribbean Climate Change Partnership (JCCCP) Project, through its climate change adaptation activities at the community level, has supported sustainable agriculture, improved access to water, including for irrigation, thus enhancing livelihoods.

The JCCCP also supported the development of a vibrant vegetable garden at a correctional facility by inmates.

UNDP also complemented national and local efforts for justice reform, reintegration of involuntary returned migrants, strengthening human resilience in selected communities, building national systems to combat trafficking-in-persons and enhancing social cohesion. These we do in collaboration with our international and local partners.

But there is more that we can do, and UNDP stands ready to support. For example, we must redouble efforts to provide psychosocial support to address the root causes and behavioural change. We must work to improve good governance and effective justice systems. Governance is the hand that cradles the Sustainable Development Goals: We must work to build strong inclusive institutions.

More emphasis must be placed on reducing multidimensional and intergenerational poverty. Most Caribbean countries are small island developing states (SIDS) and therefore require special support and attention. The one size fit all cannot work in and for these countries.

DARE TO HOPE

UNDP has learned that we must have a balance between upstream policy interventions and downstream practical projects, featuring initiatives designed to directly engage and make people’s lives better.

Climate change projects, for example, can focus on community resilience through improving sustainable livelihoods. A major example of this is seen in the JCCCP Project.

The quest for peace and security is well placed at the apex of Jamaica’s budgetary and development obligations and in its Vision 2030 plan for national development.

When Jamaica achieves a sustainable level of peace and security, this may usher in the greatest period of human development and economic growth in Jamaica’s history.

We dare to hope that:

- Jamaicans will have the freedom to live and reach their fullest potential.

- Poverty and inequalities will be reduced.

- A healthy environment will be created for effective provision of services.

- Foreign direct investments that advance development aligned to the country’s priorities will improve significantly.

- Social and political stability will improve.

- Jamaicans will be enabled to build a more resilient society.

We hope that UNDP will continue to be a valuable partner of choice to travel with you on this journey to unleashing the sustainable development potential of Jamaica through strategic focus on peace and security.

We stand ready to support you in this vital endeavour.

Speaking in the capital’s central square, where the walk participants were met by a hostile group of President López Obrador supporters, Sicilia declared “it’s now time to put a real end to so much pain, death, humiliation and lies.”

The activist, who organized and led the walk that left Cuernavaca, Morelos, on Thursday, criticized the federal government’s security strategy, asserting that the “abrazos, no balazos” (hugs, not bullets) approach that favors addressing the root causes of violence with social programs over combating it with force is no better than the failed policies of past administrations.

He and members of the Mexican-American Mormon families who lost nine members in an attack in Sonora last November declined to take up the offer of a meeting with members of the government’s security cabinet, instead sending a contingent of victims of crime to the National Palace to submit a range of documents. These included a proposal for transitional justice to Interior Secretary Olga Sánchez and Security Secretary Alfonso Durazo.

“We have nothing to speak about with the security cabinet,” Sicilia said to applause from approximately 1,200 people gathered in the zócalo.

However, the activist did offer some blunt advice to the president, declaring that he had a choice between “continuing to walk towards the horror” that Mexico saw during the first full year of the new government, when homicides reached an all-time high, or “uniting us . . . through a state policy based on truth, justice and respect.”

He also said that López Obrador must decide “the side of history” towards which “he wants to walk.”

Sicilia said that his justice proposal includes the implementation of an “international mechanism” to investigate crimes and prosecute offenders, the establishment of a truth commission to identify the patterns of violence in the country and the creation of a compensation scheme for family members of victims.

“We mustn’t repeat the past; the past destroyed us and continues to destroy us. We must create something new that preserves life. A real and authentic transformation of the country must be based on truth, justice and peace,” he said.

“. . . We know that it’s not easy; it’s never easy to confront a crisis of civilization of the size we’re suffering today but if we don’t do it . . .violence will always reign. . .”

Earlier on Sunday, Sicilia led the last leg of the peace walk from the Estela de Luz monument outside Chapultepec Park to the capital’s central square.

Hundreds of victims of violence, family members of missing persons and parents of children with cancer were among those who walked along Reforma Avenue to the historic center, intermittently breaking their silence with cries of “Truth, justice and peace! Truth, justice and peace!”

“. . .Health is also justice,” said Rosi Salas, mother of a little girl with leukemia.

Her participation in the walk came days after parents of young cancer sufferers renewed their protest against a long-running cancer drug shortage at a Mexico City children’s hospital.

Relatives of the LeBarón family involved in the November 4 ambush in Sonora that killed three women and six children walked part of the way wearing just one shoe to pay homage to Mackenzie, a 9-year-old girl who survived the attack and walked miles wearing only one shoe to look for help.

Parents of the 43 students who disappeared in Iguala, Guerrero, in September 2014 also joined the march.

“You’re not alone,” said Melitón García, father of one of the young men who were studying to become teachers at the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers College before their disappearance and presumed murder. “The pain that you have is the same that we have for the 43 missing students from Ayotzinapa.”

Upon their arrival in the zócalo, the walk participants were met by a group of more than 100 staunch López Obrador supporters who labeled them fifís, or elitists, among other disparaging terms, and demanded that they leave the square. Members of the LeBarón family were told to go back to the United States.

The newspaper El Universal reported that the peace activists and allies of AMLO, as the president is commonly known, engaged in scuffles in the central square, with the latter accusing the LeBarón family of being traitors, having voted for former president Enrique Peña Nieto and even orchestrating the massacre of their relatives themselves. Members of the media were also caught up in the confrontation, El Universal said.

Proceedings inside the National Palace later on Sunday afternoon were much more civilized, according to Security Secretary Durazo.

He wrote on Twitter that government officials engaged in a “courteous and respectful dialogue” with “a committee of the Walk for Truth, Justice and Peace,” adding that they listened to their “demands and proposals.”

Interior Secretary Sánchez said that “people want to participate in peace and justice” and that “there will be as many meetings as are necessary – we’ll work together, there will be truth and justice.”

For his part, human rights undersecretary Alejandro Encinas rejected the claim that López Obrador had snubbed the walk participants, given that senior government officials were dispatched to the National Palace to meet with them instead.

2,https://www.vox.com/world/2020/1/28/21111890/trump-israel-palestine-peace-plan-deal-century-apartheid,"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Vox.com,Trump’s Israel-Palestine “peace plan” is a con,"Donald Trump’s “peace plan” isn’t a plan for advancing Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. It’s a plan for scuttling them.

The president released the long-awaited political framework of his “Peace to Prosperity” plan on Tuesday afternoon after a White House ceremony featuring Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

The proposal is missing a signature feature of every prior peace plan: a path to a viable Palestinian state. It divides up the Palestinian territories and surrounds them by Israel, and gives Israel total control over Palestinian security — allowing a future Palestinian government to exercise full control over its own land only when Israel deems it acceptable. It’s a kind of state-minus: a Palestine without much of its land and subservient to Israel for basic functions.

“Trump can try to make this a Palestinian state by calling it a state. But it ain’t ever gonna whistle,” writes Tamara Cofman Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Center for Middle East Policy.

Needless to say, the Palestinians cannot and will not agree to such humiliation, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has already ruled it out.

“No, no, and no,” he has said. “Jerusalem is not for sale. All of our rights are not for sale or bartering.”

In fact, the Palestinians didn’t even have a role in writing the plan: It was put together primarily by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, in consultation with the Israeli government. The notion that this is a good-faith effort to make peace is laughable.

So if the “peace plan” isn’t a peace plan, then what is it?

First, it’s an effort to help Netanyahu, a staunch Trump ally, in advance of tightly contested March elections in Israel. The release of a plan so tilted to Israeli priorities helps the right-wing prime minister sell himself as the man best positioned to handle the vital US-Israel relationship. And it doesn’t seem like an accident that the plan was released on the same day that Israel’s attorney general formally indicted Netanyahu on bribery and corruption charges.

Second, and more insidiously, it is a plan to legitimize Israel’s ongoing effort to seize additional Palestinian land.

The United States, as Israel’s most important ally and the historic mediator in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, helps define the parameters of what counts as an acceptable outcome.

As soon as the Palestinians have rejected the plan — and it took only minutes for them to do so — the Israelis can say, “Well, we tried, but they wouldn’t deal.” And they can proceed with settlement expansion and land grabs, moving Israel toward “not peace, but apartheid,” as B’Tselem, a leading Israeli human rights group, put it in a press release on the proposal.

The Trump vision is, in short, a truly Orwellian creation: a “peace plan” that actually is a plan to destroy the prospects for peace.

Trump’s peace plan is a nonstarter

Prior to the Trump plan, the basic framework for Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations had been relatively fixed. There would be two states, with the Palestinians taking control of the overwhelming bulk of the Palestinian-populated West Bank and Gaza Strip, and with Israel largely retreating to its current internationally recognized borders.

The two sides would come to agreement on thorny issues like which Israeli settlements in the West Bank could become part of Israel, and how exactly to share Jerusalem (a holy city for Judaism and Islam that both sides claim as their capital).

The Trump plan pretty much throws out this framework entirely.

Instead of allowing the two sides to negotiate solutions to these core disagreements, the plan lays out a detailed vision for final terms before negotiations have even begun.

On each of the four main issues — West Bank borders/settlements, Jerusalem, justice for Palestinian refugees displaced in the 1948 war, and balancing Israel’s security needs with Palestinian sovereignty — the plan is heavily tilted in Israel’s direction.

“Palestinians are being offered no state at all, just the box a state came in,” writes Hussein Ibish, the senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute. “Israel will be left in complete control of the entire area from the river to the sea. Pure apartheid.”

Perhaps the easiest way to see why is to look at the plan’s map for what final borders would look like. The proposed Palestinian state is in green; the little dots in the middle of the West Bank are Israeli “enclaves” that will remain part of Israel:

What you see is a Palestinian “state” that covers Gaza and a fraction of the West Bank, is surrounded by Israel, and is cut up even further by Israeli land. The plan seems to permit Israel beginning the process of annexing part of this land, starting with the Jordan Valley in the eastern part of the West Bank, an area that would cut off Palestinians from neighboring Jordan.

And the drawing actually understates how bad things will be, because it’s simply too zoomed out to illustrate how many different Israeli settlements there are and how much they’d screw up Palestinian development. This map alone would render the entire plan unacceptable to Palestinians.

“For the first time, the United States has unveiled a map with precise borders, and an Israeli leader has endorsed it. That map is a maximal vision of Israeli territorial control in the West Bank and Jerusalem,” Michael Koplow, the policy director of the Israel Policy Forum, writes in the Forward.

But it’s also terrible for Palestinians on the other three main contentious issues.

The plan states that “Jerusalem will remain the sovereign capital of the State of Israel, and it should remain an undivided city.” The Palestinians will be granted only a tiny fraction of the heavily Palestinian-populated part of the city known as East Jerusalem that excludes the religious holy sites; “all of Jerusalem’s holy sites should be subject to the same governance regimes that exist today,” as the plan euphemistically puts it.

On refugees, the Palestinians literally get nothing — just a vague promise that some money might come up.

“Proposals that demand that the State of Israel agree to take in Palestinian refugees, or that promise tens of billions of dollars in compensation for the refugees, have never been realistic and a credible funding source has never been identified,” the plan explains. “Nevertheless, we will endeavor to raise a fund to provide some compensation to Palestinian refugees.”

Yet it is the security section that is perhaps most revealing. Not only would the future state of Palestine not be permitted to develop its own “military or paramilitary” forces — ever — but Israel would also maintain full security control over Palestinian territory until it decides not to. And if at any time Israel changes its mind, it is within its rights under the deal to retake military control.

“Once the State of Israel determines that the State of Palestine has demonstrated both a clear intention and a sustained capacity to fight terrorism, a pilot program will be initiated in an area of the West Bank portion of the State of Palestine, designated by the State of Israel, to determine if the State of Palestine is able to meet the Security Criteria,” the plan explains. “Should the State of Palestine fail to meet all or any of the Security Criteria at any time, the State of Israel will have the right to reverse the process outlined above.”

A peace plan is supposed to end Israel’s military occupation of the West Bank. By giving Israel full control, the Trump plan makes such a withdrawal nearly impossible to envision.

“If you put it in Israel’s hands it will never happen,” writes Ilan Goldenberg, the Middle East security director at the Center for a New American Security. “It’s a recipe for permanent occupation.”

The real purpose of the plan

Given these harsh terms and the total lack of Palestinian buy-in, there is no plausible reason to believe this plan could ever serve as the basis of an actual peace agreement for the two sides.

So what’s the purpose of releasing it with all this fanfare?

Part of the explanation is purely political: Trump wants to help his friend Netanyahu seem strong before Israel’s elections. The timing of the plan’s release makes this relatively transparent.

But the Trump administration wouldn’t go through all the trouble of drafting a plan just to interfere in a foreign election. There’s a deeper, even likelier explanation: that the right-wingers who make up Trump’s Israel-Palestine team have worked with the Israeli right to figure out a way to undo the peace process itself.

Israeli politics has tilted heavily against peace negotiations in the past two decades, largely as a result of the collapse of the 1990s-era peace process into the violence of the second intifada.

The March elections are primarily a contest between Netanyahu and the center-right Blue and White party, which itself has endorsed the idea of annexing part of the West Bank — and celebrated the release of Trump’s plan as providing “a strong, viable basis for advancing a peace accord with the Palestinian.”

Consider the likely effect of this plan’s release on Israeli politics in this context. The Israel Policy Forum’s Koplow does a good job outlining it:

Israeli expectations have been permanently reset, and the trajectory of the Israeli position moving closer to the Palestinian one with each successive round of talks is over. Trump has destroyed any remaining hope that Israel will settle for the deal that peace processers have envisioned for a quarter century. In fact, Trump’s vision is weighted so far in one direction that it makes any deal at all hard to envision, particularly if Israel actually goes through with the annexation scenario that Trump has now greenlit.

Not only will Israeli leaders be hard-pressed to accept less than what Trump offered, the inevitable Palestinian rejection of Trump’s plan will give them the opportunity to start taking land on their own.

The Israeli argument since Oslo has always been: “We tried to negotiate, but the Palestinians wouldn’t listen.” They’ll be able to say that this time around too, even though the negotiations were never offered in good faith.

What’s more, they can use the plan’s huge territorial concession — that Israel will get to keep its West Bank settlements permanently — as a justification for annexing at least part of it unilaterally. Netanyahu had vowed to annex the Jordan Valley prior to the plan’s release; Israel’s cabinet appears set to start the annexation effort as early as Sunday.

Such a land grab would force Israel down one of two dangerous one-state paths.

Option one would be to give the vote to Palestinians and make them full citizens of Israel, leading to an Arab demographic majority and thus ending Israel’s status as a Jewish state. This is not only a recipe for violence between Muslims and Jews but also unacceptable to Israel’s current leadership, who care much more about the state’s Jewish character than its democratic one.

The other option is indefinite Israeli rule over Palestinians without granting them citizenship. There’s a word for keeping an ethnically defined part of your population in permanent second-class citizenship: apartheid.

And that is the most fundamental effect of the Trump plan: to grant legitimacy to the move toward apartheid, to give America’s imprimatur to something its government once saw as impermissible.

Hun Sen on Thursday expressed thanks to supporters of the campaign, which he said does not oppose any group and demonstrates how stability has allowed Cambodia to develop under his 35-year rule.

“I would like to thank all compatriots who support my political slogan ‘Thank You Peace,’” he wrote in a post to his Facebook page.

“I believe that peace is priceless today and will continue to be in the future. All people need peace, except for terrorists who seek to destroy it,” he added, in a thinly veiled reference to supporters of the now-dissolved opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), several of whom have been detained in recent months amid accusations that they seek to overthrow his government.

In an audio message leaked to social media, Hun Sen also called on all government institutions and schools to promote the slogan as part of a bid to make Cambodians everywhere understand the value of peace.

“The slogan’s meaning does not negatively impact anyone, so it should be displayed over the entrance of every building,” he said in the audio message.

“The slogan is vital because we want everyone to love peace. Our achievements to date came from peace.”

Many institutions have already begun putting banners of the slogan on display, according to a report by the Phnom Penh Post, which also cited Kin Phea, the director-general of the International Relations Institute at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, as saying there is nothing wrong with Hun Sen’s order, as peace was the root cause of and a prerequisite for development in the country.

However, political analyst Kim Sok told RFA’s Khmer Service on Thursday that Cambodia and its people do not enjoy peace, in part due to the country’s ongoing political crisis, which evolved out of the Supreme Court’s decision to ban the CNRP in November 2017 for its role in an alleged plot of treason.

“The slogan amounts to a fake peace symbol,” he said, adding that “the people have nowhere these days to seek justice.”

The move to dissolve the CNRP was part of a wider crackdown by Hun Sen on the political opposition, NGOs, and the independent media that paved the way for his ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) to win all 125 seats in parliament in the country’s July 2018 general election.

Since the election, authorities have detained several CNRP activists over allegations of “treason” and restricted or surveilled others, while appearing to turn a blind eye to physical assaults against party supporters by unknown assailants believed to be associated with the CPP.

Meanwhile, the ongoing crackdown has drawn international condemnation, including from the European Union, which will make a decision in February about whether to withdraw Cambodia’s tariff-free access to its marketplace under the Everything But Arms (EBA) scheme for developing countries.

According to Kim Sok, who lives in self-imposed exile in Finland to avoid a conviction he says is politically motivated, Hun Sen’s campaign seeks to “divert public attention” while he continues to “abuse his power and the constitution” for his personal interests.

Defining ‘peace’

The Phnom Penh Post also quoted social analyst Meas Nee as saying that peace in Cambodia “seems to be only for the rulers and the ruling party, but not for the people.”

“Whether it is peace, social justice, democracy or human rights, it is not the government that measures it but the people,” he said.

“Therefore, if the public feels that ‘peace’ has not been fully achieved, then the government’s definition is mere political demagogy.”

On Nov. 12, the EU warned in a preliminary report that Cambodia has not taken enough measures to prevent a withdrawal of its EBA status, noting the country’s further deterioration of civil, political, labor, social, and cultural rights since the launch of a review process in February last year.

Last month, in a statement accompanying its official response to the report, which was not made public, Cambodia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that, ahead of an EU decision on the matter in February, it expects that the bloc will take into consideration “the government’s good faith efforts to implement all the relevant international conventions under the EBA regulations.”

The ministry’s statement was in stark contrast to recent comments from Hun Sen, who despite warnings from civil society that loss of EBA status would devastate Cambodia’s working class, has said he has no interest in meeting the EU’s demands.

Cambodian Confederation of Unions President Rong Chhun plans to hold a press conference on Friday to discuss his “strategy to maintain EBA status,” during which he will announce the results of a campaign to collect thumbprints from workers petitioning Hun Sen to prevent the loss of the preferential trade status.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr’s life and work in improving rights for the Black community is celebrated on a day known as Martin Luther King day.



While MLK Day celebrates Dr. King’s life, it is also a day where discussion about the future of the Black community takes place. Dalhousie’s Black Student Advising Centre (BSAC) facilitates the celebration of MLK day by hosting events every year. This year, the event was held as a part of their “Black Lives Matter” series and was titled “The Legacy of MLK: Peacemaking & Justice Making in a Time of Trouble”, with experts on the subject matter from within the community participating in the conversation on the topic.



The panel discussion was preceded by opening words by Oluronke Taiwo, the Black Student Advisor with BSAC. She addressed a need for action, calling for a stand against all forms of discrimination and bigotry. “Justice does not come to those who wait”, she said.



Her words were followed by musical performances from Zamani Bernard-Miller and Amariah Bernard-Washington, both established musical performers within the Black community, who sang “Lift Every Voice and Sing” and “I am Light”.

An uphill battle



The panel consisted of Tari Ajadi, Asha Jeffers and Rachel Zellars and was moderated by Tiffany Gordon, a PhD student in Dalhousie’s Department of Philosophy who focuses on criminal justice system in North America. With each having different areas of expertise, they offered contrasting perspectives on the theme of the discussion.



Ajadi, a PhD student in Dalhousie’s Department of Political Science whose work focuses on policies and inequities that affect marginalized communities, spoke on Dr. King’s thoughts as seen in the “Letter from Birmingham Jail” and its transferability to a modern day context.



He stated that very little has changed since Dr. King’s time, noting how eerie it is that modern-day problems faced by the Black community are similar to those faced by the Black community back during the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. “Like then and now, racism is a killer, it amplifies fear,"" he said, adding that racism caused Black families to live in a constant state of fear of the many ways they could be harmed.



Ajadi highlighted recent events involving mistreatment of the Black community, including the incident at a Walmart in Halifax that saw a physical altercation between a 23 year-old Black woman and officers of the Halifax Regional Police. “We know that our police forces and our schools have broken systems,” Tari stated, going on to say that society is “collectively complicit” with regards to racial discriminatory issues.

An example to follow



Dr. Jeffers, an assistant professor in Dalhousie’s Department of English and Department of Gender & Women’s Studies, shared her thoughts on some of the messages that can be extracted from “Letter from Birmingham Jail.""





Dr. Jeffers



She quoted Dr. King who said “whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly"", going on to highlight the need for collective action in order to confront the increasing amount issues faced by the Black community. “Injustice must be rooted out by strong and persistent action,” she quoted, going on to advise that action now requires learning from the past but that it should not be bound to the methods of the past.



On rising tensions between the Black community and governmental institutions and others for a lack of action on racial issues, Dr. Jeffers said that tension was an important part of bringing about change. “In our troubled times, peace can seem hard to achieve,"" she said.



Dr. Zellers, an assistant professor in Saint Mary’s University's Department of Social Justice & Community Studies, commented on Dr. King’s role in creating movements that brought about change. She highlighted Dr. King’s 1967 Riverside Church speech in which he spoke out about the political contradictions of the Vietnam War, causing a swell in anti-Vietnam War sentiment amongst the Black community.



Dr. Zellars



She continued by speaking about what it would mean to centre Dr. King’s 1967 speech as a guidepost for the world at its current state and how to approach its problems. “There is a logic of punishment in current systems of governance that is punitive and destructive,"" she said, going on to echo Dr. King’s sentiment for the need for compassion and nonviolence and to “see the enemy’s point of view and to hear his questions.""



The panel collectively agreed that action was required by the community in order to prevent the encroaching tide of racial issues. As Ajadi said, “we cannot succumb to silence.”","Dr. Martin Luther King Jr’s life and work in improving rights for the Black community is celebrated on a day known as Martin Luther King day.

Five years ago, in February 2015, the first steps towards a vision for peace in Ukraine were taken with the Minsk II agreement. Five years is a long time not only in human life, but also in European history: World War I only lasted four years, and World War II was only two years longer. Five years after Minsk, the crisis in and around Ukraine is yet to be resolved, and the country remains a bleeding wound of Europe with a profound negative impact on the overall relationship between the Russian Federation and the West. The tragic deaths of more than 12,000 people and more than 23,000 injured remind us of the human suffering in this conflict on all sides.

Many hoped that the Normandy summit in December 2019 would become a historic breakthrough, but the outcome of the meeting was quite modest. At best, the four leaders made a cautious step towards freezing the conflict rather than solving it. Protracted and painful discussions in Paris once again demonstrated that there is significant mutual resistance on both sides regarding a genuine settlement. Too many politicians in both Kiev and Moscow still believe that time is on their side, or, at least, that the risks associated with maintaining the current status quo in Donbass are lower than risks resulting from a status quo change.

In order to reach a breakthrough, we need to demonstrate enhanced creativity and out of the box thinking a la Albert Einstein, who observed, “Imagination is more important than knowledge…we can’t solve problems with the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.” One of the ways to ignite creativity is to look beyond the current crisis seeking mindset and adopt the positive crisis resolution experience accumulated in Europe.

Why South Tyrol?

European history knows many examples of how complex territorial, ethnic, confessional and other conflicts can last for many years and even decades without any clear prospects for a “final” solution. Take, for instance, the Armenian-Azeri dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh or the Serbia-Kosovo unfinished divorce. On the other hand, there are also success stories that we should not forget. One of the latter is the Alto Adige (South Tyrol) settlement of the dispute between Italy and Austria. This case, in our view, has certain similarities with the situation in East Ukraine.

South Tyrol was a bone of contention between the newborn Italian Republic and the Republic of Austria for decades. The conflict has never reached the scale of what we are witnessing today in East Ukraine, but it also generated violence, ethnic hatred and victimization. Moreover, it poisoned Austrian relations for a long time. After World War II, from the beginning of negotiations in 1947 until 1971, a series of agreements recognized equal rights for all citizens, despite their language, as well as a balanced decentralization of administrative, legislative, executive and economic competences to be exercised autonomously over the regional territory.

Historical and cultural bonds within the Austrian-Germanic world, Italy’s Trentino- Alto-Adige (South Tyrol) sought a highly autonomous status within the Italian Republic constitution. The process of deriving this status shows the value of reaching an agreement based on a high level of regional autonomy in political, economic, and cultural issues. This status received an appropriate codification within the Italian constitution. This approach eased the institutional balance between the centre and periphery, defusing, in the medium to long term, potentially disruptive political unrest.

South Tyrol successfully consolidated its autonomy over the last decades, fostering ties between the central state authority and the peripheral regional authority. Now, the German-speakers there live peacefully within Italy as citizens of the European Union.

This integration-through-decentralization process into the Italian national identity shows how a widely shared process and agreement recognizing a high level of institutional autonomy would lead, in the medium-to-long term perspective, to constructive and balanced power-sharing, stability and economic development. This achievement is particularly spectacular, given the long history of Austrian-Italian conflicts and even wars.

What Would It Mean for Donbass?

Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi had every reason to refer to the “South Tyrol model” at his meeting with President Vladimir Putin on March 5, 2015. The Russian leader welcomed it as a “valuable suggestion to resolve the situation”. After three hours of discussion in Moscow regarding the EU-Russia crisis involving Ukraine, Putin and Renzi gave a joint press-conference to review their discussion and proposals.

The Italian Prime Minister said, “I think it’s worth highlighting the crucial step forward made,” regarding the signature of the Minsk Agreement. “We will work to implement the statements of this Agreement. Europe and Italy can become a reference point.” Italy in particular, according to the Prime Minister, might “provide all possible support for a solution concerning the urgent request of a new status and a wider autonomy to be granted to the Eastern Ukrainian Regions held by the separatists. We had a wonderful experience in Trentino-Alto Adige (South Tyrol). This is an excellent example of how you can successfully solve the problems of decentralization.”

“We agree that both the parties have to respect the Minsk II Agreement, paving the way to a peaceful solution,” stressed Russian President Putin. He added the need for a broader political dialogue involving the rebel strongholds of Donetsk and Luhansk as well. “We expect Italy, in its national capabilities and as a major European Union member, will play a key role in this process,” he argued. Putin told the media, “The Prime Minister made several valuable suggestions about what could be done to resolve the situation in the future. The situation there remains difficult, and we have to stop the fighting, killing and destroying cities.” The conflicting parties should strictly comply with the agreements reached in Minsk. “I count on more active help of the EU.”

If referred to within the context of the situation in Eastern Ukraine, many ingredients constituting the Austrian-Italian deal could help to settle the Donbass conflict, all the differences between the two cases notwithstanding.

The same rights extended to the local German population in Alto Adige (60 per cent in 1971) should be given to the predominantly Russian speaking (and Russia-oriented) locals in the Donbass. Rights similar to those preserved by Rome as the central government in Italy should be assigned to Kiev. Both languages should be granted official status, and no discrimination of any minority and cultures should be practised in Donbass.

Of course, this arrangement implies that the territory will be Ukrainian, including border-control. The Donbass should be de-militarized. That also applies to the Russian-Ukrainian border like it was the case with the Austrian-Italian border. The status of autonomy calls for guarantees embedded in the Ukrainian constitution, rather than merely a law, which could be changed at any time.

The South Tyrol experience also suggests that it would be impossible to solve and formulate all principal or small regulations for autonomy under Ukrainian law, as it adds up to several thousand details. Therefore, a smart framework agreement is needed and would lay the groundwork for ensuring the rights of ethnic Russians in the Donbass on the same level as those of ethnic Germans in South Tyrol. Such an agreement would also guarantee rights to Kiev similar to those of Rome. Leveraging this framework agreement as the model for Eastern Ukraine seems to be the only reliable way to handle the autonomy smoothly and avert further crisis.

The Austrian-Italian experience also suggests that there will be many bumps on the road to reconciliation and reintegration. To deal with these bumps, it would be helpful to establish a standing Donbass committee with ambassadors from each country within the OSCE in Vienna, with a special best practice team involving Austria and Italy. This committee could appoint an Ombudsman to handle complaints and resolve disputes. The Ukrainian government, together with the Donbass OSCE committee, should prepare an annual progress report and present it to the Verkhovna Rada.

What Is Missing?

Matteo Renzi came up with his proposal in March 2015. Unfortunately, not much has been done to apply the lesson of South Tyrol to Donbass. Therefore, the critical question is why implementing a strategy similar to South Tyrol in Donbass is not yet considered.

The answer, in our opinion, is in the international environment and the nature of the Austria-Italy relations. By the time of the South Tyrol deal, both Austria and Italy considered themselves organic parts of a greater European family of nations. This is despite the fact that Austria, even now, is not a NATO member and only joined the EU in 1995, 24 years after the agreement on South Tyrol had been reached.

Neither country had a fundamental identity problem that could feed radical nationalism and block a settlement. Their respective national identities emerged long before the deal was achieved. Neither side was fearful of aggression, deliberate provocation or gross interference into domestic affairs from the other side.

Both Vienna and Rome saw many advantages in building their economic, political and humanitarian ties with each other. Both Austria and Italy experienced rapid economic growth followed by an expanding middle class, vibrant civil society, maturing political institutions and successful fight against populism, political radicalism and nationalism. No external player in or outside of Europe demonstrated any interest in instigating the conflict through supporting one of the sides. In other words, the overall environment for reaching a compromise was overwhelmingly positive.

Unfortunately, most of these preconditions are currently absent in the case of Donbass. Therefore, we cannot push for the application of the South Tyrol model until such prerequisites are created. This will be difficult, but not impossible.

Going Beyond Minsk

Using the best practice from South Africa, one then is lead to think of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission for Donbas, reporting live on TV in Ukraine and Russia with an annual report. More than twenty countries have done this successfully in the past.

However, the problem of reconciliation is not limited to Donbass only. Both Russia and Ukraine today lack the know-how for true reconciliation, which had been mustered by Austria and Italy after World War II. Let us all learn from the American philosopher Eric Hoffer who said, “A war is only won after you have turned your enemy into a friend.” We can draw upon the lessons of other European states that have mastered the art of reconciliation, including decentralization, after two bitter world wars.

The governments, political parties, opinion leaders and media should learn how to make peace with (former) enemies and utilize European best practices – such as in South Tyrol or Northern Ireland. For the Russian population in Ukraine and all other minorities, including Hungarians and Tatars, fresh Ukrainian Codes of Tolerance should be implemented. The Kiev government should appoint a Minister for Tolerance and Reconciliation with sufficient staff and funding. The United Arab Emirates established the first minister for tolerance in February 2016. The tolerance minister in Kiev would promote respect toward all ethnic and religious minorities in Ukraine and report annually to the parliament and the OSCE in the form of a Ukrainian Codes of Tolerance and Reconciliation Report. Within the context of reconciliation, an amnesty committee would be established, as in South Africa, for people from all conflict parties.

Rebuilding trust will not get us too far until we build the economic foundations of the settlement. The goal should be to turn Donbass from a headache into an opportunity for all. We propose establishing a special reconciliation fund for the region, financed equally by the EU, the US, and the Russian Federation, and utilized to rebuild destroyed infrastructure. By rebuilding, we do not mean restoring the region as it was back in 2013 – this is hardly possible and rather undesirable. We suggest turning the devastated war area into a modern and vibrant ecosystem attractive to both international investors and millions of refugees and displaced persons.

Carefully designed and skillfully localized reforms can stimulate new jobs, especially for small businesses. It is essential to address burning issues of documented property ownership, competitive access to capital, legal enforcement of contracts, governmental and regulatory transparency, and rules that promote and safeguard foreign direct investment. The environment presents yet another challenge, but also another opportunity for multilateral cooperation in Donbass with the European Union taking upon a leadership role.

At the same time, the European Union should move in the direction of a free trade agreement with Russia and other members of the Eurasian Economic Union. A new Ostpolitik by Ursula von der Leyen could help to bring Europe closer together via trade and visa-free travelling.

Towards a New European Security Architecture

A new, fresh and intense dialogue between NATO and Russia, including the discussion of a non-aggression pact and new arms control agreements, is now needed. It was counterproductive to freeze the NATO-Russia Council in April 2014 as punishment. This forum, meant for crisis management, is now active again. It took too long to understand that we need more, not fewer, meetings during crises. Despite many state-banquets and vague speeches in the past years, real discussions were missing for far too long. The western “no-talk no-meetings approach” neglected the lessons learned in the months before World War I.

The dialogue about a common security structure in Europe should start with fresh bi-monthly meetings of the NATO-Russia Council in Moscow and Brussels, as well as in other NATO capitals. Russia and NATO should openly discuss all strategic military issues to find solutions to alleviate tensions and promote cooperation, with several working-groups established for major political, technological, or geographic regional concerns, including mutual threats.

A high-ranking NATO-Russia Summit should be held in Moscow to discuss security issues openly. At this summit, NATO and the Russian Federation should declare not to utilize their military capabilities against each other. They will not use their forces, equipment, active or non-active soldiers or allow those activities against each other.

Both Moscow and Kiev should find their rightful places in the new European security architecture. Confidence building measures between Russia and Ukraine should become a part of a broader CBM system between the East and the West of the continent.

In this new environment, we can broaden the limits of what is possible. All sides have to look for a creative compromise, based on respect for international law, recognizing the national interests and minority rights of all stakeholders, while drawing upon best practices in Europe.

The ultra-nationalists on both sides will be disappointed. Still, only a broad political compromise would be in the national interests of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, the EU, the United States of America and the international community.

We all need humanity, creativity and efficiency for a new Europe 3.0.","Authors: Andrey Kortunov and Hubertus HoffmannFive years ago, in February 2015, the first steps towards a vision for peace in Ukraine were taken with the Minsk II agreement.

But those days are long gone and there is still no sign of progress for women abused by military officers.

A

fter years of international isolation, 2018 was significant for Eritrea, as it struck a peace deal with arch-rival Ethiopia. However, the agreement has disappointed many Eritreans as there has been no domestic progress, including revising an abusive national service program.

Since independence, President Isaias Afwerki and his regime have used tensions with Ethiopia as a pretext to justify universal military conscription beginning during the last year of high school. This prolonged conscription prompted such a flood of Eritreans fleeing military service that the country ranks ninth in the world as a country of origin for refugees, despite having perhaps only just over five million people, according to estimates.

An estimated 12 percent of the population has fled the Red Sea nation. Eritreans come just after Syrians for the number of refugee applicants in Europe and are the second-largest group arriving by boat. The largest factor driving Eritrean youth to flee is considered to be attempts to escape military conscription, which raises questions about conditions.

The rising refugee crisis, tied with the continued militarization of Eritrea, angered the Eritrean diaspora, sparking a social media campaign and opposition movement called ‘Yiakl’ (‘enough’). The campaign’s hashtag, #EndHighSchoolInSawa, is a reference to the Sawa camp where all Eritrean students are sent for a minimum 18-month military training. This compulsory enlistment has been criticized for entailing various human rights abuses, including prevalent sexual violence against female recruits.

Progressive struggle

In the U.S., women’s status during and after conflict was highlighted by World War II. Then, women stepped out of their expected roles—in particular, they took on traditionally male jobs—but were then usurped by returning men post-conflict. This phenomenon is highlighted in the extreme case of Eritrea. During the 30-year war for independence against Ethiopia (1961-1991), Eritrean women played a vital role in the struggle. They stepped out of traditional gender roles and mobilized for independence, including in combat: women made up over a third of the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front (EPLF).

However, Eritrean women’s role in the military, or Eritrean National Service (ENS), shifted dramatically after independence. Although they still serve, the circumstances are different. In the statehood era, the Eritrean military has become saturated with sexism, gender-based violence, sexual violence, subjugation of women, and abuse of power.

Ethiopia and Eritrea's peace must be rooted in past Historical grievances between the two societies are a major barrier to a healthy relationship between Ethiopia and Eritrea.

Allegations of sexual violence against women are prevalent in the ENS, as attested to by former fighters who have fled to Europe. These women detailed their experiences and observations in a study by African Studies Review.

EPLF opening its ranks to women was a pivotal moment in the genesis of gender equality in Eritrea, and the participation that followed was unprecedented. Women held positions in village councils and regional offices, and gained rights to vote and stand for office for the first time. But the greatest transformation of gender roles was the inclusion of women in the military.

During the long struggle, Eritrean women served in all capacities—including the frontline—except for the top leadership ranks. They performed in mixed units as guerrilla fighters. Ultimately, as widely acknowledged, emancipation would have been impossible without women fighters. This created a glorified symbolic image of the Eritrean warrior woman; exemplifying the grassroots aspect of the movement, the inclusivity, and determination for independence—“to fight on to the last man and, beyond him, to the last woman,” as Victoria Bernal put it in her 2001 paper, “From Warriors to Wives: Contradictions of Liberation and Development in Eritrea.”

Austere and equal

Some women had been interested in liberation at the beginning of the ELF struggle. However, the movement limited their involvement to supporting roles. In 1970, a faction of ELF broke away to form the EPLF. It also began as an male-dominated movement, until three women attempted to join. They were accepted and given military training, which catalyzed the recruitment and incorporation of women into the movement. EPLF’s liberation aim was directly linked to achieving gender equality and female emancipation.

Gender equality was preached by EPLF. Under the slogan “Equality through Equal Participation,” it aimed to deconstruct gender norms in politics and at work. They defied culturally imposed roles by training women to work as carpenters, mechanics, and drivers; meanwhile, men in EPLF then took on traditionally female roles such as preparing food. EPLF’s aims to reform the roles of Eritrean women was done through treating them as equivalent to men, which included erasing femininity for female fighters.

Moreover, sexual relations between fighters was forbidden in the EPLF. In fact, celibacy was actually mandatory, so sexual relations with civilians were also prohibited. Bernal cites that the reason for forbidding sexual relations was “to protect the much smaller number of women in the Front from male advances.”

However, the EPLF eventually implemented its own marriage law in 1977. The new marriage culture introduced by EPLF prohibited the rejection and negative stigma on non-virgin brides, defying cultural norms. They established marriage as an institution “the partnership of a man and a woman who are each free individuals exercising choice, a radical departure from the marriage practices of Eritrean communities.” EPLF also discouraged the negative stigma surrounding premarital sex, and went as far as providing contraceptives. The implementation of these new policies and cultures established a new freedom for women in Eritrean society.

Some authors such as Gaim Kibreab contest the notion that sexual violence was not prevalent during the EPLF era. Kibreab stated in a 2017 paper that “the old story that sexual abuse was unheard of in the EPLF is a myth” after interviewing a former EPLF fighter who reported that, “The men who abused us in the mieda [liberation struggle] are now abusing our daughters in the national service. The perpetrators are the same.”

To say that sexual violence was completely absent during EPLF would be a stretch as some former fighters confirm that it was present. However, the fight for gender equality under EPLF was evident; the movement is known for the rights and opportunities it provided Eritrean women for the first time. Moreover, enacting a policy that prohibited sexual relations was a clear attempt to work towards preventing sexual violence.

Business-as-usual

After the independence struggle, the first proclamation of the ENS was published in 1991. However, the law was not enacted officially until military training commenced in 1994. Article 8 required all Eritrean citizens between the ages of 18 and 40 to participate in compulsory military service. Women were not exempt from this requirement, despite protests from some communities.

Officially, the national service was meant to consist of six months of military training and twelve months of active service and development work. However, since the state’s second war with Ethiopia, from 1998-2000, the eighteen-month term of service has been flexible on the pretext that war could break out at any time.

Unlike conditions during the EPLF struggle, the ENS does not have any policies that aim to prevent sexual misconduct. This means there are no regulations that limit the powers of commanders or specifically forbid sexual misconduct. This lack of policies and rules enables abuse of power and gender-based violence without accountability.

Women are assigned to a commander who holds sway over them

It is critical to note that due to power dynamics, rape in the context of the ENS does not necessarily involve physical force. Because the perpetrators are generally commanders, they hold power over women who are coerced into sexual relations due to fear of punishment. Any ‘consent’ maintained through intimidation, pressure, or threats is illegitimate.

The majority of former female conscripts reported that sexual violence occurs in both the Sawa military camp and elsewhere in the ENS after the first six months. After that point, women are assigned to a commander who holds sway over them. The officers then make sexual advances on their inferiors. For the women able to say no, inhumane punishments occur.

Survivors of military service say those who refused sexual relations to a military leader endured punishments such as being locked in shipping containers and underground cells, exposure to extremely hot temperatures, beaten, tortured, denied leave, deprived of food, suspension from trees, sent to dangerous locations such as the front line, and other cruel and unusual punishments. This is persecution and European countries such as Norway have guaranteed Eritrean refugees asylum due to these circumstances.

Enforced domesticity

Sexism in the Eritrean military is also seen in the enforcement of domesticity. Women in the ENS are subjected to tasks such as cooking, laundry, and performing secretary duties for military leaders. This, in conjunction with sexual violence, means the situation has been labeled as sexual slavery. Sadly, many women are discouraged from speaking out due to the “shameful” stigma around rape victims in Eritrea. Thus, military leaders are aware that many women will stay silent.

The prevalence of sexual violence in ENS is an example of the forced imposition of domesticity and attempt to revert to traditional patriarchal societal roles in the post-conflict era. During conflict, women are treated equally because help is desperately needed; after it ends, men abuse their power, returning women to domestic roles and reasserting the patriarchal system.

Gaim Kibreab analyzes how feminist theorists argue that women are only used in the military for the duration of the conflict. He refers to how theorist Cynthia Enloe uses the cases of Algeria and Zimbabwe, in which the dynamics between men and women, and emancipation of women’s participation, only occurred due to the urgency of warfare and prominent nationalism. Once over, attempts to subjugate them by putting them back into traditional roles occurred.

However, in a nation where rule of law is absent, the post-conflict environment cannot be the only factor attributed when analyzing sexual violence in the ENS. Eritrea has still failed to implement its 1997 constitution, and its highly authoritarian regime means it’s ranked as the most censored country in the world. In a country without democratic and functional legal institutions, there is no avenue to campaign against the rampant sexual violence by military officers.

Towards abolition

To address the abuse of high school students in the military, Eritrea, which has not held elections since independence, must introduce constitutional democratic government, including freedom of expression protections. In a bid to not become dependent, the country has rejected foreign aid in the past, reducing external leverage. UN sanctions were lifted after nine years of diplomatic isolation, the peace agreement with Ethiopia being one of the contributing factors.

Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s Nobel Peace Prize has attracted strong criticism from Eritrean activists because the agreement has not brought peace within their country. Tensions with Ethiopia have long been used as a justification for military conscription, yet mandatory enlistment has not ended despite the deal.

Charting a way forward for Eritrea President Isaias Afewerki's rule, once all but unchallenged, is now questioned from all quarters. Can Eritreans chart a way forward?

Moreover, striking up a relationship with Abiy has allowed Isaias to resurface on the international stage, re-legitimizing him. Many Eritreans are concerned as to how this may affect their asylum applications, or whether it will make them more vulnerable to deportation, something that Abiy himself has allegedly encouraged. A lower court in Israel declared that Eritrean asylum seekers can be deported, and the recent peace deal was cited as one of the reasons to not allow Eritreans to stay.

It is inadequate to discuss a peace agreement with Eritrea without addressing the issue of military conscription. In addition to widespread sexual violence, other abuses are also prevalent in the military. The Global Slavery Index has described it as modern-day slavery when Eritrean youth are forced to work in harsh conditions with little or no pay. The UN has also described the indefinite military service as mass enslavement.

The regime is traumatizing an entire generation. This past year, young Eritrean refugee Osman Ahmed Nur, along with three of his friends, killed themselves in the U.K., partly out of fear of being sent back home as Osman was imprisoned and tortured there as a child. The idea of returning to Eritrea’s abusive conditions is evidently something that continues to haunt those who have escaped.

Here are the main points they agreed on their final communique, to be put forward as a UN Security Council resolution.

– End to foreign interference –

The Berlin participants “commit to refraining from interference in the armed conflict or in the internal affairs of Libya” and urge all international actors “to do the same”.

– UN arms embargo –

The participants “commit to unequivocally and fully respect and implement the arms embargo” established by the UN in 2011 but frequently violated, and “call on all international actors to do the same”.

“We call on all actors to refrain from any activities exacerbating the conflict… including the financing of military capabilities or the recruitment of mercenaries,” the text adds.

The document also asks UN experts to monitor and investigate any breaches of the arms embargo “on a continuous basis” and for sanctions to be imposed in case of violations.

– Ceasefire –

The signatories to the final statement “call on all parties concerned to redouble their efforts for a sustained suspension of hostilities, de-escalation and a permanent ceasefire”.

They also urge “the redeployment of heavy weapons, artillery and aerial vehicles” and an end to all military movements by, or in direct support of, the conflict parties — throughout Libya and in its airspace, the text reads.

The participants invite the United Nations to establish “technical committees” to monitor the implementation of the truce.

They call on the UN Security Council “to impose appropriate sanctions on those who are found to be in violation of the ceasefire arrangements and on member states to enforce these”.

– Dissolving militias –

According to the text, the participants want to see “credible steps” towards “the dismantling of armed groups and militias” in Libya, whose members should then be integrated “into civilian, security and military state institutions”. The UN is asked to assist the demobilisation process.

– Return to political process –

The Berlin document urges “all Libyan parties to resume the inclusive Libyan-led and Libyan-owned political process under the auspices of the UNSMIL (the UN Support Mission in Libya)” to reach an intra-Libyan solution.

The goal is to pave “the way to end the transitional period” through free, fair and credible parliamentary and presidential elections.

– Human rights and migration –

The participants “urge all parties in Libya to fully respect international humanitarian law and human rights law”.

They call for an “end to the practice of arbitrary detention” and urge the Libyan authorities to “gradually close the detention centres for migrants and asylum seekers”.

– Economy and oil –

The participants stressed the importance of restoring and safeguarding the integrity of Libyan institutions, in particular the Central Bank of Libya and the National Oil Corporation (NOC).

They urge all parties to guarantee the security of the country’s crucial oil infrastructure, and reject “any illicit exploitation of its energy resources”.

– Follow-up talks –

At the press conference announcing the communique, UN chief Antonio Guterres said Fayez al-Sarraj, the head of the UN-recognised government in Tripoli, and rival strongman Khalifa Haftar, had each appointed five military representatives to attend follow-up talks in Geneva “in the next few days”.","Berlin, Germany | AFP | Key players in the Libya crisis and world leaders held a high-stakes summit in Berlin on Sunday to discuss the way forward to end the conflict.

The head of the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM-MM), Minni Minawi, claims that there is a setback in the current peace negotiations.

On Friday, the head of the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM-MM), Minni Minawi revealed that there has been a great setback in the peace talks regarding Darfur track. On Friday, Minawi wrote on his Facebook account that ""Without shame, the government delegation repudiated all issues that we agreed on. Unfortunately, historically that what they have done repeatedly"".

The (SLM-MM) head of the movement's negotiating delegation, Mohamed Abunumou stated that they observed changes in the government's position. He added that ""we strikingly noticed the changes and the hardened of the government's positions in issues that are deemed as basic and simple.""

Abunumou told Dabanga Radio that the government's positions made their previous optimism shrunk and they became more cautious. He further explained that based on initial consultations and confidence-building arrangements we hoped for a swift and better outcome for everyone.

However, it is too early to judge the spirit of optimism to be dissipated, stressing that peace is a strategic goal for everyone and it cannot be reversed, he added.

Mediation team

In a press statement Friday evening, the head of the South Sudanese mediation team, Tut Galuak explained that the negotiating parties stopped at the necessity to create a land commission. The negotiating parties decided to follow up on the establishment of the land commission with legal experts to determine its mandate. ""On Saturday, the negotiations will continue on the transitional justice paper,"" Tut added.

On Friday afternoon, the government delegation headed by Mohamed Hasan El Taayshi and the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF) for the Darfur track continued negotiations on the power-sharing, in particular, the land issue.

El Taayshi stated that the negotiations made tangible progress in complicated issues related to power sharing and lands. He further explained that the land issue is complicated because it is associated with old conflicts and thus it needs further discussion. He also added that there is a committee of experts working to develop a vision for the issues regarding power-sharing in Darfur where the parties will resume within two days.

El Taayshi denied that the government delegation withdrew from any of the issues agreed upon; stressing that there was no reason for the government delegation to back down. He expressed the government's readiness to make all concessions for the sake of peace.

He said that the differences concerning the Darfur track are about the system of government, levels of governing and reform within the defect in the civil service. These issues were transferred to a technical committee to deal with it.

El Taayshi said that the delay in the discussion occurred due to objective differences and differing perceptions in certain issues. He pointed out that there remains one point in the land issue that has been postponed for legal consultation. On Saturday, the two parties will begin negotiating the issue of justice and reconciliation.

Given the situation on the ground, in case, the government decided to appoint states civilians governors it will temporarily appointments until a peace agreement can be signed, El Taayshi said.

He said the vacuum and the dismantling of the 'deep state' necessitated the appointments in the civil service. He further explained that an agreement between the negotiating parties will determine this matter in the future.

El Taayshi attributed the return of the Chadian mediator to urgent circumstances in Chad, mediator notified all mediation teams that will return soon.

El Sadig Adam, a member of Sudan's Supreme Peace Council and a member of the government delegation, clarified that the transitional government did not back down from any previous agreements in the Darfur track, especially the framework agreement, and the protocol regarding the inclusion of stakeholders in the Juba peace talks. The Friday's session was about the land issue (El Hawakeer).

SRF

On Friday, the government and the Sudan Revolutionary Front delegation held a press conference regarding the progress of the peace negotiations in Juba. In the press conference El Hadi Idris, chairman of the Sudan Revolutionary Front, affirmed that the Juba negotiations on the Darfur track are proceeding as usual. He rebutted the existence of any delay or slowdown from any party regarding the ongoing peace talks. He revealed that there is a possibility of signing an agreement on the North track Within the coming two days and the resumption of negotiations on the Eastern track in the coming days.

El Hadi asserted that the Sudan Revolutionary Front is united and there is no conflict within SRF, he added. He said, however, any party within SRF has the right to express his or her opinion. He further explained that formal SRF statement that there are no differences between the negotiating parties that can hinder the ongoing peace process.

The negotiating parties are eager to reach a comprehensive peace agreement. He highlighted that there are different views between the negotiating parties regarding the transitional period and the unification of the Darfur region as it was with its geographical borders. Within a day and a half, the negotiations achieved great progress in the land and hawakeer issues and we expect a breakthrough in the coming days, he added.

El Hadi confirmed that the committee that formed by the government, SRF and UN-AU Mission in Darfur (Unamid) visited all camps in Darfur, except for three bases in South and East Darfur. He explained that all the displaced people camps have selected their representatives to participate in the conference that expected to be held soon. The discussion about the humanitarian issue will begin when the representatives of the displaced people arrive, he said.

Mohamed Bakheet, a member of the negotiating delegation of the Justice and Equality Movement, stated that the appointment of civilian governors and the legislative council violated the Juba Declaration. He stressed that SRF adheres to its negotiating position. ""I hope we soon reach an agreement to avoid the need of appointing governors,"" Bakheet said.

El Tahir Hajar, head of the Sudan Liberation Forces Alliance at the press conference denied rumours that the disagreements are about the reintegration of the Rapid Support Force into the Sudanese armed forces. ""The negotiating parties have not even started the security arrangements issue yet,"" El Tahir said.","Juba — The government and Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF) confirmed that there is great progress in the ongoing peace talks in Juba the capital of South Sudan.

8723rd Meeting (AM) SC/14109

Note: Following is a partial summary of statements made to today's meeting of the Security Council. A complete summary will be available later today as Press Release SC/14109.

Briefings

MICHELLE BACHELET, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said lasting peace is interlinked with justice, development and respect for human rights. “Peace does not automatically break out when weapons fall silent and atrocity crimes cease,” she said. To rebuild lives, without fear of recurrence, suffering must be acknowledged, confidence in State institutions restored and justice done. In Sudan, the recent overthrow of the regime was driven in large part by demands for justice across society, built over decades of impunity for rights violations.

Noting that transitional justice processes have repeatedly shown they can help to address grievances, she said her own experience in Chile convinced her that processes that are context-specific, nationally owned and focused on the needs and informed choices of victims can empower and transform societies. Truth-seeking initiatives not only enable victims to recount their experiences, they open new spaces within which victims and perpetrators can re-establish a connection, facilitating recognition of multiple narratives about what has occurred and the formulation of recommendations for redress and reform.

Over the last 30 years, truth commissions in the Americas and elsewhere have advanced transitional justice, she said, pointing to the landmark “Memoria del Silencio” (1999) report of Guatemala’s truth commission, which offered an authoritative record of rights violations during 36 years of conflict, giving voice to the victims and analysing the dynamics underlying the fighting. It was instrumental in advancing victims’ rights. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, United Nations-supported consultations in the Kasai region enabled victims to express their views on truth, reconciliation and reparations. During her visit to Ituri, she was struck by the desire by both the Hema and Lendu communities for transitional justice. Recalling that the violence, which erupted in 2003, never gave rise to efforts to promote accountability, she expressed her belief that “this failure to sustain justice processes has been a factor in the revival of violence today”.

For a society to succeed in establishing a transition to peace, she said systemic discrimination, institutional deficiencies, unfair power structures and structural impunity are among the issues to be identified and addressed, with the broadest possible participation of civil society in decision-making. It is particularly crucial for military and police forces, and more broadly, all Government institutions, to regain the confidence of traumatized and abused communities. As fair, even-handed and accountable use of public power is central to rebuilding shattered trust in law enforcement, vetting processes and security reforms should be given high priority. She described the work under way in Colombia on guarantees of non-recurrence by the Comprehensive System for Truth, Justice, Reparation and Non-Repetition, citing the landmark 2011 Victims Law, which calls for a range of mechanisms to prevent and resolve social conflict, as well as legal empowerment of victims, distributive land restitution and measures to dismantle economic and political structures that have benefited from, and given support to armed groups.

Citing the Council’s “sustaining peace” resolution, she said creating trust among former enemies will always be a challenge. Transitional justice cannot be imported or imposed from the outside. Rather, locally led and locally appropriate permutations of transitional justice have the best chances of success. “Without humility and modesty, the risks of failure are real,” she assured. At the same time, the international community, and the Council in particular, have essential roles in helping States in these complex processes, by sharing experiences, mandating international support and encouraging implementation of comprehensive approaches. She drew attention in this context to the Council’s mandating of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) to explicitly advise on the establishment and implementation of judicial and non-judicial processes to address the legacy of large-scale human rights violations. Transitional justice should not be seen as an alternative to criminal accountability for the perpetrators of atrocity crimes. However, criminal accountability should be accompanied by measures to support truth, justice, reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence. And while there is no single way to get the mix right, there is a way to get it wrong by considering victims’ rightful demands as an inconvenient distraction that can be papered over or indefinitely delayed.

FRANCISCO DE ROUX, President of the Commission for the Clarification of Truth, Coexistence and Non-Repetition, said transitional justice is an encouraging peacebuilding tool and the best international response to war-related tragedies, costing very little when compared to military or corporate transactions. Peace in Colombia has already led to positive changes, providing new hope. Outlining several key points, he said the victims of armed conflict should be at the centre of efforts. During the 50-year-long conflict in Colombia, 240,000 people were killed and there were almost 9 million known victims. In all countries in transition, the road to peace typically begins with a ceasefire ahead of the difficult role of peacebuilding.

Truth in transitional justice is a gateway, he said, noting that the concept has become more developed to work on judicial issues to end impunity. In Colombia, victims participated in sentencing People’s Alternative Revolutionary Force (FARC) perpetrators, with one group given the sentence of eight years imprisonment and building a school. Such efforts aim at determining responsibility and not singling out or fuelling hatred. Another unit in Colombia serves families of “disappeared” individuals, given that the whereabouts of more than 100,000 people remain unknown.

Indeed, an acceptance of responsibility by the perpetrators is a way to ensure non-repetition, he said. Last week, former FARC fighters apologized for an attack launched 17 years ago. To ensure non-repetition, efforts like those made in a village where paramilitary fighters committed crimes against children must focus on addressing issues, overcoming the past and moving towards a common positive future.

Ensuring a comprehensive transition means caring for the lives of former combatants, he said, including reintegrating them in society with dignity. It requires the Government’s political determination to avoid polarization, which undermines such programmes and their desired results. People tend to forego violence when they taste peace, he said, adding that transitional justice is based on ethics, requiring a will to learn of best practices that put human beings above any other goal. Without transitional justice, it would have been impossible to achieve peace in countries the Council addresses and in Colombia. In this regard, the Security Council must play its role.

YASMIN SOOKA, Executive Director, Foundation for Human Rights in South Africa and Chair of the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, said she comes from a country where, during the apartheid years, scores of detainees were said to have jumped from windows at police headquarters, hanged themselves in cells, died hitting their heads against police filing cabinets or fatally slipping on bars of soap. “Inquests held under the apartheid system found nobody responsible for their deaths,” she said. Now, two decades after South Africa’s transitional justice process, these inquests are at last being reopened, with many of those who were detained speaking out about their torture at the hands of South Africa’s notorious security branch

She said these reopened inquests — and reports that Sudan’s Omer al-Bashir may be transferred to the International Criminal Court to face genocide and war crimes charges — demonstrate the importance of addressing impunity. But even the best processes exclude many who are not yet ready to tell their stories. As in her own country, it can take decades to deliver justice, and often the quest for truth is driven by the families of victims. Recalling that South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission was deeply influenced by the Latin American experiences of building accountability, while also ensuring stability and continuance of new Government, she said that as an actor in the transitional justice process, she was deeply conscious of the limitations of a narrow mandate which did not allow for considering structural violations.

While the principles to combat impunity, developed by Louis Joinet, advanced the field of transitional justice — positing that States bear primary responsibility for ensuring victims and their families realize their right to truth, justice and reparations — she said African experiences have challenged the narrow focus on civil and political rights violations, in light of the legacies of violence and structural violations arising from their colonial histories. Processes in such countries as Sierra Leone, Peru and Tunisia have also addressed gender. Rural women in Sierra Leone, for example, asked the Truth Commission to ensure that the Government allocate funds received from the heavily indebted poor countries debt initiative for girls’ secondary education. The Truth and Dignity Commission in Tunisia has been ground-breaking, including by ensuring an independent budget to facilitate the participation of women and girls.

But sexual and gender-based violence is too often still framed narrowly as a matter of gender identity, she said. While focus on women and girls is critical, ignoring violations perpetrated against men and boys limits the analysis of how gender norms fuel the use of sexual violence and stymies prevention efforts. Further, fragile States have not always been able to carry out ambitious transitional justice programmes. The United Nations should be required to provide vital support. She urged the Council to ensure the non-recurrence of violations and to address such indirect causes of conflict as structural violence, discrimination and economic exploitation. It should take innovative, decisive approaches to conflicts on its agenda in concert with the Human Rights Council, High Commissioner for Human Rights, General Assembly and bodies such as the African Union. “It is essential to ensure that peace and justice are seen as mutually reinforcing imperatives, and not replaced by erroneous notions that peace must come first before accountability,” she stressed.

Statements

PHILIPPE GOFFIN, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence of Belgium, Council President for February, spoke in his national capacity, saying that the 15-member organ plays an important role in transitional justice, with peace operations helping States to strengthen their capacity and reform their institutions. Establishing responsibility for crimes is essential for building peace. The International Criminal Court can play a complementary role with national transitional justice measures. But, implementing transitional justice has many challenges, including costly restorations of traditional judicial systems. The sequence of measures taken is essential for success. The Council should concentrate on specific actions, including adopting a holistic approach that respects national ownership. In addition, the victims’ demands must be at the core of transitional justice, using inclusive measures that includes a gender perspective and addressing the root causes of conflict.

KALLA ANKOURAO, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Cooperation, African Integration and Nigeriens Abroad of Niger, said promoting reconciliation is just as important as breaking a cycle of impunity. Expressing support for the United Nations and political missions that strive to strengthen trust between civilians and security forces, he said Niger has created the High Authority for Peacebuilding with similar goals that has already made gains in ensuring victims’ needs are met and establishing an environment of confidence. Endorsing the 2019 adoption of the African Union’s policy on transitional justice, he underlined the importance of drawing upon members’ experiences and shared values.

MÄRT VOLMER, Deputy-Minister for Foreign Affairs of Estonia, shared his country’s experience in overcoming the harmful legacy of mass atrocity crimes, stressing the vital importance of building strong institutions capable of preserving the rule of law and ensuring human rights for all. Following its independence in 1991, he said, Estonia re-established the rule of law, reinstating democratic institutions while bringing to justice the perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the occupation by the repressive regime. Welcoming recent reports of Sudan’s commitment to cooperate with the International Criminal Court, he said this would constitute a significant step in the pursuit of justice — a case referred to the Court by the Security Council 15 years ago. His country also supports international independent fact-finding and evidence preservation efforts, including in Syria and Myanmar. Going forward, Estonia wishes to see a more consistent Council record on preventing atrocities, he added.

JERRY MATTHEWS MATJILA (South Africa) said his country values national transitional justice processes. “In our own case, transitional justice was a vital cog in securing a relatively peaceful transition from apartheid to the stable constitutional democracy we are today.” Noting South Africa recently marked the thirtieth anniversary of the prison release of transitional justice champion and former President Nelson Mandela, he said the goal pursued was not simply to end conflict, but to rebuild the political, security, social and economic dimensions of a society emerging from conflict. The spectrum of transitional justice should be explored, from criminal prosecutions, truth commissions and reparations programmes, to exhumation of mass graves, apologies, amnesty and institutional reforms to redress human rights abuses.

For South Africa, the restorative justice approach chosen by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission sought to fight impunity, uncover gross rights violations and help the families of victims heal, he said. It also had the strategic goal of promoting national unity. While ensuring justice by means of individual accountability is important, it often fails to address the structural challenges that initially sparked violence and causes a State to relapse into conflict. Thus, the United Nations should be enabled to provide more support to national transitional justice, notably through peacekeeping missions and the Peacebuilding Commission. The Council should encourage adherence to international guidelines and regional policies, he said, cautioning that transitional justice must not be appropriated by the international community but rather driven by those emerging from conflict. He highlighted the importance of including reconciliation in holistic transition plans that consider community-based justice mechanisms and ensure that women and young people, in particular, are represented.

CHERITH NORMAN-CHALET (United States) recalled that resolution 2282 (2016) calls for comprehensive approaches to transitional justice, noting that United Nations tribunals can play an integral role and calling for more equitable burden-sharing in this regard. While transitional justice must incorporate the views of victims and survivors, it is also a political process, in which political leaders set the tone. They should develop a public record of abuses and work to reintegrate those members of their forces into society. Transitional justice processes must be nationally owned and inclusive, and it is imperative that women and girls are reflected in the related mechanisms, as women’s direct participation in peace processes increases the sustainability of peace agreements. A country’s existing legal and institutional structures also must be taken into account. She called on South Sudan’s leaders to implement all aspects of the peace agreement, including for transitional justice, recognizing the comprehensive approach taken in the Central African Republic, where the Peacebuilding Commission ensured that the peace process was linked to the 2015 consultative process. While she welcomed that women-led civil society groups were consulted, she expressed concern that no women were signatories to the accord.

13,https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/02/21/trumps-middle-east-peace-plan-whats-there-to-be-upset-about/,"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Brookings Institution,Trump’s Middle East peace plan: What’s there to be upset about?,"A lot, if you are Palestinian. Even before reading past the plan’s first few pages, virtually no Palestinian could be reasonably expected to still be looking for a silver lining in its details. This should come as no surprise. The plan’s introduction cites Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin’s October 1995 speech before the Knesset, in which he sought to win approval for the Oslo II Interim Agreement by laying out a vision of a future Palestinian entity that he described as “less than a state.” That citation had a profound impact on me.

For what else can be made of a plan that emphasizes that the Palestinian leadership did not reject Rabin’s vision at the time? And, as if the point the plan’s authors were trying to drive home was not adequately clear, they made sure to underscore that Rabin’s vision was explicit on “Jerusalem remaining united under Israeli rule; on the portions of the West bank with large Jewish populations and the Jordan valley being incorporated in Israel; and on the remainder of the West Bank, along with Gaza, becoming subject to Palestinian autonomy…in something that was less than a state.” With Trump’s vision embracing these tenets of Rabin’s, the authors are clearly suggesting that the widely anticipated Palestinian rejection of the plan is unjustifiable.

There is a lot to unpack here. To begin with, the assertion that the Palestinian leadership did not reject Rabin’s vision does not mean they accepted it. To be sure, what that leadership signed on to under the Oslo framework was a mere autonomy, and only in parts of the Palestinian territory that Israel occupied in 1967. But what they thought they were getting, after an interim period of five years, was a state that Palestinians could proudly call home. And they were not alone in thinking that way. Whether on grounds of fairness, legality, practicality, or a combination thereof, there indeed developed a broad international consensus, including in Israel itself, in favor of a two-state vision that both Israelis and Palestinians could live with. That, in a nutshell, was what the various American-led mediation attempts had sought, but failed, to accomplish since Oslo.

Without much analysis, the plan’s authors suggest that past mediation efforts were doomed by their lack of comprehensiveness, the absence of substantial economic content, and the failure to adequately take into account the prevailing realities. While the causes of that failure are varied, the first two explanations the authors offer are questionable.

For one thing, the assertion of lack of comprehensiveness ignores the record of extensive negotiations and detailed work throughout successive rounds of mediation and diplomacy over the past 25 years. For another, it is worth recalling that the tripartite framework (consisting of Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and the international donor community) was, since the inception of the Palestinian Authority, anchored on a heavy economic and Palestinian capacity-building component.

As to the authors’ third explanation, the framing of the Trump administration’s plan and the specific language it deploys would seem to suggest that what it really wanted to say was that past efforts did not go far enough in prioritizing the Israeli narrative — or, more specifically, that they failed to fully embrace the worldview of Israel’s far-right. This may sound like a strong statement. In reality, however, its validity is underscored by the plan’s abridgment of the Palestinians’ right to self-determination, if not by its dismissiveness of the Palestinian narrative altogether.

The framing of the Trump administration’s plan…would seem to suggest that what it really wanted to say was that past efforts did not go far enough in prioritizing the Israeli narrative.

Indeed, the plan specifically requires the realization of the Palestinians’ right to self-determination to be limited to a “path to a dignified national life,” with Israel being and remaining the only state with full sovereignty and control over the entire area west of the Jordan River. Of special significance in this regard is the earmarking for annexation by Israel — effectively at a time of its choosing, no less — of the Jordan Valley and other areas of the West Bank that are vitally important to the viability of any future Palestinian state. In addition, while the plan asserts respect for “the historic and religious significance of the region to its people,” its insistence on Jerusalem remaining united under Israel’s full sovereignty is another case in point.

Yet another problem is the not-so-subtle attempt to strip the Palestinian refugee issue of any political dimension. On top of its emphatic, explicit denial of the right of return for refugees, the plan equally categorically excludes Israel as a possible home destination. It also places limitations, and vests in Israel a veto power, on the extent to which the “state of Palestine” can serve as a home destination — not to mention that, in addition, it circumscribes the possibility of direct compensation.

Furthermore, the plan is replete with other examples and suggestions regarding whose narrative should prevail. These include the suggestion that Palestinians have no territorial rights whatsoever, as is clearly implied by the plan’s reference to “the designation” of territory “to which Israel has asserted valid legal and historical claims” for a future Palestinian state; the expectation of having individual title possession claims when drawing the borders, subject to litigation within the Israeli legal system; and the limitation on the Palestinian state’s purview over planning and zoning in areas adjacent to its border with Israel, without even suggesting any limitation on Israel’s latitude to veto Palestinian decisions in this regard.

There are other deeply troubling aspects of the plan for Palestinians in general, but especially for those who are citizens of the state of Israel, at least in two areas. The first relates to what appears to be a deliberate exclusion of political rights from the realm of protected rights of citizenship, while the second relates to the proposal to incorporate the “Triangle Communities” into the state of Palestine not being contingent on the consent of the residents of that region.

Unlike in 1995, the Palestinian leadership can have no illusion at this juncture that the offer at hand is about anything but a “state minus.”

If the serious structural shortcomings outlined above are not reason enough for Palestinians not to want to have anything to do with Trump’s vision, consider this. Unlike in 1995, the Palestinian leadership can have no illusion at this juncture that the offer at hand is about anything but a “state minus.” Worse, not even that is a sure thing. Rather, it is the opportunity to embark on a four-year qualification odyssey in a quest for that “state minus,” with Israel and the United States jointly keeping score on the Palestinian effort in the governance sphere in general, and with Israel alone being the ultimate judge of the Palestinians’ performance in the realm of security.

When the plan’s resuscitation of the “Quartet Principles” is considered — along with its simultaneous statement that Hamas must be disarmed in Gaza as a requirement within the framework of those principles —one can easily see that rather than a “path to a dignified national life,” (or, less charitably, “state minus”), the proposed prequalification exercise is a path to nowhere. Even Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu all but said as much on January 28, when, standing alongside the president of the United States, he brazenly declared: “I know it may take [the Palestinians] a very long time to reach the end of that path. It may take them a very long time to get to the beginning of that path.” This happens to be true, even if — fearing that his constituency back in Israel would not be adequately reassured by his relegation of the issue of Palestinian statehood to endless negotiations — the prime minister merely intended to help secure a right-wing majority in the upcoming Israeli elections.

All of this provides a compelling basis for a Palestinian rejection of Trump’s vision. It is well to keep in mind, however, that, by itself, such rejection does not render that vision inconsequential. Nor should it, therefore, be conflated with a rejection strategy, with the latter requiring a clear-eyed assessment of the existential risks the Palestinian national movement faces, an informed identification of available policy choices, and the willpower needed to pursue them.

Such would be an act of leadership whose absence at several inflection points over the past century better explains the causes of Palestinian failures than the mere rejection of past visons or plans. Needless to say, the Palestinian effort going forward should not at all be encumbered by the heavy weight of the false narrative underlying the adage “every time Palestinians say ‘no’, they lose.” To be sure, we did not fare too well either on the countless times we said “yes,” particularly since 1988.

One way in which Trump’s vision can be catastrophically consequential in the near term lies in the distinct possibility that Israel will act on that vision’s greenlighting of the annexation of territory that is vital to the viability of Palestinian statehood. While initially touted as imminent, there is ambiguity now as to when that step will actually be taken. Nevertheless, the plan itself did not at all link Israeli annexation to negotiations, or any other benchmark for that matter. Thus, it could potentially happen any time, more likely sooner than later. This points to the obvious need for Palestinians to prioritize stopping the Israeli annexation drive, as a matter of utmost urgency, as they formulate an effective rejection strategy.

Such a strategy need not, and should not, be framed in terms of Palestinian readiness to engage regionally or internationally on the basis of Trump’s vision. Rather, it could take the form of launching a Palestinian initiative that takes advantage of the plan’s repeated reference to “the issues having to ultimately be resolved in negotiations between the parties themselves” to require precluding the possibility of any Israeli annexation before completing negotiations. The initiative could go on to elaborate a Palestinian four-year program of action that is anchored on furthering the cause of Palestinian empowerment, beginning with the all-important reunification of the Palestinian polity and fortification of national governance institutions and processes. This would require the immediate convening of the Unified Leadership Framework — a forum with representatives from the full spectrum of the Palestinian body politic — with a view to agreeing on the basis for assuring non-Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) factions of genuine partnership in decisionmaking, without requiring them to alter their individual party platforms.

Order from Chaos The real threat to Palestine is a crisis of leadership

It is, of course, understood that the plan’s insistence on a strict application of the “Quartet Principles” would complicate matters in this regard. That, however, should be a reason for Palestinian recalcitrance, not hesitation. Only an inclusive political framework that is not conditioned on the acceptance by non-PLO factions of the PLO’s political platform can, at this juncture, help bring about the desperately needed intra-Palestinian reconciliation.

It is far from certain that such an initiative could save the Palestinian cause. But, its capacity to alter the negative dynamic that has prevailed since the plan was launched should not be underestimated. If nothing else, it certainly beats the dry parroting of the — by now unmoving — two-state solution eulogies. Far better than that, it could spur Palestinians into the kind of action that should have been undertaken a long time ago. After all, the writing has been on the wall for quite some time. For the plan can objectively be seen as merely having been an attempt at formalizing, in the authors’ words, “today’s realities” — with the dominantly prevailing version of those realities being, and having been for a while, a Palestinian state lookalike in Gaza and another on the West Bank’s leftovers.

The Palestinian Authority has become an instrument of national entrapment and disempowerment for the Palestinian people.

In that sense, Trump’s vision may already have been consequential in one important, positive way — namely, it has brought into much greater focus than ever before an inconvenient truth that the Palestinian leadership must contend with as it wrestles with the question of where to go from here. That truth is that the Palestinian Authority has become an instrument of national entrapment and disempowerment for the Palestinian people. Among other things, by virtue of assuming responsibility — as a national authority — for the welfare of Palestinians under occupation, it provided Israel, long before the Trump administration’s plan, with an important counter-argument against charges of apartheid. The mere rejection of the plan is not going to alter this reality. For even if it does not turn into the “state minus” state envisaged under Trump’s vision — or, 25 years ago, under Rabin’s — the Authority will continue to serve that important Israeli political need while blocking, in the process, a channel of potential positive influence.

Therefore, in parallel with the effort to forge a strategy along the lines outlined above — indeed, as an integral part of that effort — Palestinians have to come to terms with whether they will be able to summon the willpower needed to turn their Authority from the instrument of entrapment and disempowerment it has become to the instrument of empowerment it needs to be. If not, then we are duty-bound to embark on the more challenging dual task of revamping our national program and remaking our institutions.

It would be a travesty if this were to be understood as an echo of the often-repeated call on the Palestinian Authority to disband by simply “throwing the keys to Netanyahu.” Even if it were followed, such course of action would not guarantee that its implied objective of turning the conflict into a struggle for equal rights in one state will be realized. Far from it, the most enduring legacy of the Oslo Accords has been a Palestinian Authority that, by splintering into two “state minus” states some 13 years ago, has already demonstrated the capacity to multiply. But more worrisome — absent an effective preventive strategy — should be what has become a built-in potential for it to be succeeded by a reincarnation of its old self.","All of this provides a compelling basis for a Palestinian rejection of Trump’s vision.
Such a strategy need not, and should not, be framed in terms of Palestinian readiness to engage regionally or internationally on the basis of Trump’s vision.

With $1.5 trillion spent, thousands of American lives — and, by some estimates, hundreds of thousands of Afghan lives — lost, it’s time to end the bloodshed. If the violence cannot end with victory, the argument goes, it is best to end it with a peace deal.

Negotiating with terrorists

For all the discussion of the mechanics of the U.S.-Taliban peace deal — whether or not it will hold in the first phase that is currently underway, what phase two might look like, what sort of power-sharing arrangement might emerge between the Taliban and the Afghan government — the central question of negotiating with terrorists, and the cost of that, is not one this administration is grappling with in any significant way. (The Democratic presidential candidates even less so — both Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg have said that they will leave Afghanistan and its “endless war” with or without a peace deal; the latter would be catastrophic for Afghans.)

But this should be a central question: What is the cost of negotiating with the very terrorists who you once sought to defeat, those who are responsible for the loss of thousands of American lives and even more Afghan lives?

For Afghanistan watchers, there seems to be a recognition in narrow terms that giving the Taliban a say in government threatens gains made in women’s rights since 2001. Most observers have said that we should try to prevent these gains from being lost in whatever peace deal is signed. But how can that be guaranteed? The Taliban has never done anything other than terrorize women (and many men), and many Afghan women doubt that the Taliban will have any respect for girls’ schooling or the right of women to work, no matter what the deputy leader of the Taliban Sirajuddin Haqqani may write in the New York Times.

But while backsliding in women’s rights is at least discussed, there is little mention of the message this peace deal sends to extremists and to terrorist groups in Afghanistan and its region. The Taliban sees the deal as “America’s surrender.” That the United States was unable to defeat the Taliban will also be seen as a broader victory for the tactics and the ideology of jihadism, a dangerous thing in a region where jihadi ideologies have flourished for decades and where terrorist groups of many stripes — beyond the Afghan Taliban, ISIS, and al-Qaida, which pose the most direct danger to the United States and are thus of the most concern to the U.S. government — continue to exist.

Terrorism in Pakistan

For Pakistan — whose military routed the Pakistan Taliban, also known as the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), in an operation starting in 2014, and whose citizens largely turned against the group after it killed more than 130 schoolchildren at the Army Public School in Peshawar in 2014 — this peace deal threatens the hard-won gains of its kinetic victory against the TTP. The TTP killed tens of thousands of Pakistanis, and is closely related to the Afghan Taliban: Both pledged allegiance to the same leader, Mullah Omar. In a future where the Taliban has more control in Afghanistan, the many TTP fighters who have sought refuge in Afghanistan may feel emboldened to launch cross-border attacks on Pakistan, or to regroup and return to Pakistan’s northwest.

Of course, you could say this is in many ways Pakistan’s doing — that Pakistan emboldened the Afghan Taliban and wants it in a position of power on its Western border. There’s no arguing with that, but Pakistan’s unambiguous support for the Afghan Taliban before the related TTP emerged in Pakistan and began an existential assault on the Pakistani state may now be more complex: Pakistan may still want the Afghan Taliban empowered strategically, but not if it comes at the expense of its own security.

Legitimacy for extremists

In preparing to sign a peace deal with the Taliban, the U.S. has given the Taliban international legitimacy. The Sirajuddin Haqqani op-ed in the New York Times is just one sordid example of how this will play out. Jihadi ideologies tend to blur into each other — groups may have different targets and different goals, but the use of religion to justify violence ultimately underlies each of them. Every one of the terrorist groups operating in the region — TTP militants; the Lashkar-e-Taiba, which attacks Indian targets to liberate Kashmir; the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a sectarian militant group; and others — will see the U.S.-Taliban peace deal as vindication of their ideology. To see the Taliban clamoring for sharia, using violence, and getting its way will embolden these extremist groups, and also win them support.

In preparing to sign a peace deal with the Taliban, the U.S. has given the Taliban international legitimacy.

In Pakistan, this upends a tenuous narrative win against the Pakistan Taliban: The country as a whole stood against the TTP’s violence, though not without sympathy for its ideology. Now, you can see Pakistan’s confusion about extremism and terrorism anew. Its own prime minister talks about negotiating with the Afghan Taliban and TTP interchangeably, though negotiations with the latter were a failure. And now that America is making a deal with the Taliban, many Pakistanis are wondering out loud why they were maligned for more than a decade as sponsors of terror.

And this deal is a boost not just to terrorists, but more broadly to Islamists and extremists in the region. A more Islamist government in Afghanistan will embolden Pakistan’s own Islamists and extremists, who have long clamored for stricter Islamic laws in Pakistan. This will likely be accompanied by concessions to these groups, and a worsening of minority rights and greater intolerance — including a rise in accusations of blasphemy and vigilante killings, as in the past. For the region, a new complicated phase has just begun. Related Content Order from Chaos Why is Pakistan’s military repressing a huge, nonviolent Pashtun protest movement? Good deals — and bad ones — with the Taliban Order from Chaos After the US-Taliban deal, what might negotiations between the Taliban and Afghan side look like?

America’s responsibilities: A narrative and the deal

America needs to account for such repercussions of a deal, in part because problematic outcomes down the road in the region will be seen as America’s responsibility. This builds on the region’s narrative of American meddling, opportunism, and abandonment in the 1980s leading up to the struggles of the 1990s in Afghanistan.

But America can do things better this time. It has a chance to not repeat the mistakes of the 1990s, when it left its covert war in Afghanistan with a vacuum and without a narrative. It can do so in two ways: with a clear narrative on the war and its deal with the Taliban, and with elements in the deal itself that can mitigate some of its negative repercussions.

A clear American narrative has been missing in the war, and now on the deal, allowing the Taliban to mount a narrative of victory. It is perhaps no surprise given that the goals of this war drifted from defeating al-Qaida to defeating the Taliban to stabilization and nation-building, then back to fighting terrorists. (In Trump’s exact words: “We are fighting terrorists. We are not nation-building again.”) And now to an exit. Providing a narrative is the first part. America can fully reckon with the war — explain why its goals had to shift and where it missed a chance at victory, and mourn the loss of American and Afghan lives.

Second, America can highlight where the war succeeded: the gains in human rights and especially women’s rights since 2001, and the installation of a democracy in the country, however imperfect. It can also share what exactly it will do to safeguard the gains made in the last 18 years from the Taliban squandering them. This part has to do with the actual deal. The secrecy around it means we don’t fully understand its components, but the conditionality of the whole peace deal — of phase one holding if phase two is completed successfully — is one way it helps insure against the Taliban going rogue. It is also important to think of concrete ways to preserve gains if those aren’t already in the deal: safeguarding women’s and human rights should be a key condition in any deal and if this condition is violated, the U.S. should leave the deal. In a recent Brookings piece, John R. Allen, Mike O’Hanlon, and Saad Mohseni argue that U.N. officials and development experts should monitor implementation of such conditions.

Third, America can acknowledge that negotiations with the Taliban were and are indeed a last resort – and that this by no means provides a clean chit to all terrorist groups in the region. It should add measures to address this in any deal: Beyond al-Qaida, the Taliban’s support for regional and local terrorist groups such as the TTP and Lashkar-e-Taiba should also be a red line.

There is also the question of how America can ensure that Pakistan does not act as a spoiler following a U.S.-Taliban deal. Pakistan as it stands in 2020 — for all its possible complicated feelings on a U.S.-Taliban deal, and its support for the Afghan Taliban — is not likely to be a spoiler, as long as the U.S. incentivizes it with carrots for continuing to behave well. Over the past year, Pakistan has enjoyed the benefits of engagement with the Trump administration as a reward for bringing the Taliban to the table and helping with peace talks. For Pakistan, at least at this moment, positive economic and public relations incentives are paramount, and it will continue to respond to those.

No state wants to acknowledge its failures, least of all a superpower, and Trump especially will have no inclination to do so. But with a narrative void, the voices of extremism and terrorism will win out. Mitigating that narrative win will be easier if the U.S. government can point concretely to how it will safeguard progress in human rights in Afghanistan and against all terrorist groups in the region.","If the violence cannot end with victory, the argument goes, it is best to end it with a peace deal.

15,https://www.iol.co.za/pretoria-news/news/egyptian-religious-leaders-promote-peace-and-justice-41867474,"Sat, 01 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Independent Online,Egyptian religious leaders promote peace and justice,"Egypt's religious leaders are spreading a message of peace, justice and fraternity in Africa.

An African editors tour of the capital, Cairo, included an audience with the Grand Imam, Dr Ahmed al-Tayeb of Al-Azar, Egypt, as well as Pope Tawadros 11, of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria.

Al-Azhar is more than an historic mosque founded in Cairo in 970AD: it is a vital Egyptian institution that, 1 000 years later plays an important role within the country and beyond.

Islamic clerics and scholars do not get involved in politics, says Imam Al-Tayeb, but they do participate in the national discourse, work towards social upliftment and conflict resolution, and serve everyone regardless of religion with compassion and in the interests of peace.

The Al-Azhar Observatory for Combating Extremism works to counter misinterpretations of Islam and put a stop to hate in the name of religion, while its Convoys spread the message of tolerance and offer practical support in countries, including Chad, Nigeria, Somalia and Sudan, he said.

The institution supported the initiative of Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi as AU chair to “Silence the Guns”, an effort to end war and violent conflict on the continent, and promote development, a theme to be continued by South Africa which takes over the AU chair in February.

Al-Azhar is a centre of scholarship and home to the world’s second-oldest Islamic university, which draws its 300 000 students from far and wide; and it supports schools with more than 2 million learners offering the Egyptian curriculum with an emphasis on reading, maths, science and Islamic studies, as well as numerous language and religious studies centres.

Its influence extends beyond Egypt with a presence in 23 African countries, including South Africa.

Al-Tayeb said Africa needed not only religious leaders but doctors, engineers and scientists,and Al-Azhar granted scholarships to 5 000 students from 46 African countries to study in a variety of fields at its institutions.

Another programme is the training of imams, with a focus on dealing with the misconceptions of Islam spread by terrorist groups, and an outreach which started in Nigeria and will be rolled out to other African countries, he said.

The Grand Imam engages regularly with other religious leaders, including those from the Muslim, Christian, and Jewish faiths, and last year was received at the Vatican by Pope Francis, where the Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together was discussed.

This document calls for co-operation in spreading a culture of tolerance and living in harmony; an end the bloodshed of wars and conflicts; to address hate and intolerance, violence and extremism; to protect the environment and the rights of women; and, to build a moral society and true citizenship for all.

Although Christians are in the minority in Egypt, religious tolerance is seen as a hallmark. An example was the building and simultaneous opening of the huge Al-Fattah Al-Aleem Mosque and Cathedral of the Nativity in Egypt’s new administrative capital east of Cairo in January last year.

Speaking to the’ group at the St Mark’s Cathedral complex, seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope in Cairo, Pope Tawadros II said the Coptic church had been established in Alexandria in the 1AD by St Mark the Evangelist.

Iconography in churches around Cairo - including the site of the Church of St Sergius and St Bacchus where the Holy family is believed to have found a safe haven during the Flight into Egypt - reflect the importance of this area to the early Christian Church.

The Coptic Orthodox Church has an expanded ministry with 33 dioceses outside Egypt, and 500 churches in around 50 countries worldwide. Although its missionary work began earlier, a physical presence in South Africa was only established in the 1990s with the lifting of restrictive regulations at the end of apartheid. Among its institutions here are the St Mark’s Coptic Orthodox Church and St Mark and St Samuel the Confessor Monastery in Joburg.

Pope Tawadros II said the church had good relations with the Egyptian leadership and Islamic organisations, and has met religious luminaries, such as Pope Francis and the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church.

An area of mutual concern is the fight against extremism and terrorism and he had praise for Egypt’s strong forces in protecting the country. Egypt as a holy place, he said, had a role in preventing the spread of fanaticism and the church had a responsibility to promote peace and living in harmony.

The view from the Gulf

Neil Quilliam

There has been no coordinated response among states of the GCC, but the messages have been universal, and surprisingly each one has welcomed US efforts to restart peace talks and praised this particular US administration for doing so. But in each case, the same set of issues and concerns has been highlighted, namely the status of Jerusalem, the situation of refugees and ultimately a simple absence of a revival contiguous Palestinian state.

While much has been made of younger Gulf generation’s apparent disconnect from the emotive issues around Palestinian statehood, the state of Jerusalem and the larger refugee issue, older leaders in the Gulf continue to pay them heed. And despite a desire to coordinate with Israel on matters of security, intelligence sharing and tech, they will not advance the relationship under the terms of the so-called ‘deal of the century’.

Put simply, the deal forces Palestinians to concede ground on all matters of importance. And should the Arab Gulf states sign up to it, they will be judged harshly by history for not only selling out Palestine for $50 billion, but also footing the bill. As such, they all feel compelled to hedge and pay salutary lip-service to US efforts but know quietly they will die on the vine and that the Arab Peace Initiative is the only viable framework for advancing talks.

Even younger leaders know that the greater risk will come from signing up to the deal rather than twitter wrath of the US president.

Kuwaiti Parliament Speaker Marzouq Al-Ghanim threw a copy in the bin, emphasizing that it ‘was born dead’ and ‘should be thrown in the dustbin of history’.

While the Saudi official position towards the deal was one of qualified support, the Saudi press reported that King Salman had spoken with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who has rejected the plan, to ‘stress to him the Kingdom's steadfast position vis-à-vis the Palestinian cause and the rights of the Palestinian people’. The king reportedly added: ‘The Kingdom stands alongside the Palestinian people and supports its choices and what[ever] will actualize its hopes and aspirations.’

Turki Al-Faisal, the former Saudi intelligence chief, described the deal’s idea of a Palestinian state as ‘a brutal conception’ and the deal itself as a ‘modern-day Frankenstein’. ‘For Palestine, it is definitely a step back,’ Al-Faisal said. ‘[The Trump administration has] given up the legitimate history and weight of the United Nations Security Council resolutions and adopted a unilateral path.’

The view from Europe

Reni Zhelyazkova

The initial EU response to President Trump’s ‘Peace to Prosperity’ plan was one of caution. An official statement soon after the announcement declared that the proposal needs to be studied and assessed but only a few days later the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Josep Borrell, condemned the plan for being out of line with internationally agreed parameters.

Some member states like Luxembourg have expressed support for the foreign policy chief’s position. Ireland, historically a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause, and Sweden, the only country to recognize the Palestinian state after becoming an EU member, have responded negatively to the US proposal, expressing concern over mentions of Israeli annexation of Palestinian land and stating that it falls short from previous international agreements.

Other EU countries, however, have been much more guarded in their reactions. Responses from Germany and France have so far been lukewarm – on the one hand, welcoming US attempts at re-igniting peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians, and, on the other, warning that any future negotiations and agreements must be carried out in accordance with internationally established parameters and legal frameworks.

A strong voice of support for Trump’s proposal was that of Hungary, whose minister of foreign affairs and trade, Péter Szijjártó, commended White House adviser Jared Kushner on the plan during a meeting in Washington last week. Other EU countries are yet to respond publicly to the proposal but unity among all EU countries is far from certain.

The EU’s official position is that a two-state solution based on pre-1967 borders and in line with previous agreements and UN resolutions is the only viable option for lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians.

However, Israeli foreign policy under Netanyahu has focused on strengthening bilateral relations with countries in eastern and central Europe. Cooperation with Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and most recently Slovakia and Hungary has improved in all areas – from security and trade to tourism and cultural exchanges.

Five of these countries, namely, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria recognized the State of Palestine prior to joining the EU, but the rise of populist nationalism, concerns over migration and terrorism, and improving relations with the Trump administration in the US have contributed to an alignment in views between Israel and the right-leaning governments in southern and eastern Europe, as well as those in Italy and Austria.

Improved bilateral relations have translated into political acts of good will towards Israel with a number of EU countries expressing support for Israel in the United Nations and other international forums. Austria, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic defied official EU position and attended the US embassy opening in Jerusalem in May 2018.

In this sense, Israel’s strategy in eastern and central Europe can be seen as a deliberate effort to break up consensus within the EU, and, ideally, reverse the bloc’s position towards the Middle East conflict, but also towards Iran.

At a time when the EU is managing Brexit, a complex internal agenda, including arguments over the EU budget, and with its relationship with the US strained over Iran, trade and other issues, it is unlikely that the bloc will contribute significant efforts to the Middle East Peace Process. It is even more difficult to see the EU coming up with its own proposal and even less likely that all member states will be able to agree on such an initiative given internal divisions.

Under the EU Neighbourhood Policy, the European Joint Strategy in Support of Palestine for the period 2017-20 has focused on supporting the Palestinian Authority (PA) with institutional reform, economic development and service delivery. Progress, however, has been limited as the success of programming is dependent on Israeli policy towards the West Bank and Gaza. This has hardened under Netanyahu, who enjoys the full support of the current US administration and sees the EU as biased towards the Palestinians.

Any plan that replaces the 2017-20 joint strategy will most likely be a continuation of the current approach which focuses on conflict management and supporting the already crumbling two-state solution by keeping the PA alive.

Some room for cautious hope remains, as much depends on the outcome of the Israeli election on 2 March and the US presidential election in November. Changes in leadership could open up space for EU to actively support the reinvigoration of peace talks and regain its relevance as a mediator in the Middle East Peace Process.","Other EU countries, however, have been much more guarded in their reactions.

17,https://omannews.gov.om/NewsDescription/ArtMID/392/ArticleID/8406/Oman%E2%80%99s-Legacy-of-Peace-Established-by-The-Late-Sultan-Is-Appreciated-by-The-World,"Sun, 16 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Oman News Agency,Oman’s Legacy of Peace Established by The Late Sultan Is Appreciated by The World,"Muscat, Feb 16 (ONA) --- Oman’s conviction in the institution of peace and its pursuits of requisites of peace—as it develops relations and stances from different parties in the world—has led to the expansion of these relations and friendships at various GCC, Arab, regional and global levels.

These parties include the GCC, the Arab League, the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation IOR-ARC, the United Nations (UN) and its affiliate organisations and agencies.

The lack of any ideological or political disputes between the Sultanate and any other party is a major factor in the growth of Oman’s relations with all. This adds to the Sultanate’s practical application of the method of peace since it never hesitates in exerting its benign efforts to participate in resolving any disputes or conflicts between two or more parties, particularly when the disputing parties request that from the Sultanate.

Oman never imposes itself on anyone, neither does it seek to play an undesirable role in any problems or disputes within the region or abroad because it respects the uniqueness of others.

In the meantime, the Sultanate does not wish to publicise the efforts it undertakes for the sake of others unless they themselves announce these efforts.

Most importantly, the Sultanate does not market the efforts it makes in favour of others, neither does it exploit these efforts in return for any favour or any agenda. This made others trust the credibility of the Sultanate’s roles. Hence, it is not a coincidence that President Mahmud Abbas of Palestine said in his October 2018 statement after leaving Oman that the Sultanate “does not sell or buy when dealing with the Palestinian issue” and that the Sultanate’s compass is permanent.

Testimony to the durability of the Omani stance is the statement made by Yousef bin Alawi bin Abdullah during the emergency ministerial meeting on the Deal of the Century, when he reaffirmed that Oman’s stand on the Palestinian cause is “permanent and supportive of the Palestinian people’s legitimate rights, particularly their right to establish their own independent state, with East Jerusalem as its capital.”

Another factor of significance is that His Majesty Sultan Haitham Bin Tarik said in his first address to the nation, “We shall trace the course of the late Sultan, reaffirming the fundamentals of our country’s foreign policy based on peaceful co-existence with nations, good neighborliness, non-interference in the internal affairs of others, respect for countries’ sovereignty and international cooperation in various spheres. We will remain as the world had known us during the reign of the late His Majesty Sultan Qaboos. We will call and contribute to resolving disputes by peaceful means, sparing no effort in finding satisfactory solutions in a spirit of harmony and understanding.

We will continue contact with our brethren, leaders of Arab Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states, to enhance our countries’ march of collaboration to realize our peoples’ aspirations and to push the GCC forward.

His Majesty Sultan Haitham Bin Tarik also reaffirmed that the Sultanate will continue to support the Arab League and maintain its role as an active member of the UN, a member that respects the UN Charter and works with member states towards achieving international peace and security.

“We will build our relations with all world countries on the basis of the great heritage left behind for us by the late Sultan, God bless him, a heritage whose essence is based on commitment to relations of friendship and cooperation with all, as well as respect for charters, laws and agreements signed with other countries and organizations,” said His Majesty Sultan Haitham Bin Tarik.

Because the late Sultan worked throughout his reign for the establishment of peace and stability—not only for the Omani people, but also for countries and peoples of the world—it is not strange that world leaders and nations feel profound loss, regret his demise and express their appreciation and their recognition for his contributions for the sake of humanity.

Since he assumed power on 23 July 1970, the late His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Said Bin Taimour laid emphasis on devising and implementing principles for Oman’s relations in a manner that guarantees positive and fruitful cooperation with countries that reciprocate the Sultanate’s principles and values, which comply with the international law and international charters and which reserve the sovereignty of all parties, secure non-interference in the internal affairs of others and the solution of disputes and conflicts by peaceful means while at the same time realizing the fostering of better ties among nations for generations to come.

Deep faith in peace as a method and means for establishing ties with other countries, in all conditions, over the past 50 years has indeed been key to understanding the parameters

of the late Sultan’s stands and, accordingly, the stance of the Sultanate on all issues and events that took place in the region and the world around it.

The late Sultan’s conviction in peace—as a value, a means and an end—was not merely a matter of theory, but it is true faith and true practice that proved itself in the straightforward and transparent handling of developments in the region and the world at large. This deepened the confidence of region countries’ leaders in the late Sultan’s stands. It made leaders in the region and the world keen on meeting His Majesty Sultan Qaboos and soliciting his views, visions and assessment of events and developments.

The stands of the Sultanate derived from the speeches of the late Sultan and his press meetings represent a framework and a highly significant reference, for he announced, right from the start of his reign, that the Sultanate is a “State of Peace” and that this kind of peace the “Peace of the strong ones who equip themselves for peace that is based on justice and fairness”.

In this context, it is worth noting that the Sultanate founded its relations with sisterly and friendly states on pillars that consolidate mutual respect for sovereignty, reject wars and work towards resolving disputes by peaceful means and in a manner paves the way for the establishment of dignified relations with all, guarantees security and stability in the region and secures the interests of all parties.

Since the late His Majesty Sultan Qaboos had such deep conviction in peace and, since Oman’s stands stemmed from this vantage point over the past 50 years, it is not a coincidence that the Sultanate and its leadership are accorded such respect, confidence and recognition from all countries of the region and the world.

--- Ends/AB/KH","The lack of any ideological or political disputes between the Sultanate and any other party is a major factor in the growth of Oman’s relations with all.
In the meantime, the Sultanate does not wish to publicise the efforts it undertakes for the sake of others unless they themselves announce these efforts.
We will remain as the world had known us during the reign of the late His Majesty Sultan Qaboos.
This deepened the confidence of region countries’ leaders in the late Sultan’s stands.
It made leaders in the region and the world keen on meeting His Majesty Sultan Qaboos and soliciting his views, visions and assessment of events and developments."

Today we have [Senior State Department Official], who’s going to talk to us about developments in South Sudan. The attribution for this talk will be background, senior State Department official. Sir, go ahead.

**SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: **Okay. Well, I don’t know how much – how closely you all follow the South Sudan peace process, but there’s a lot of peace processes in the world, and this is the one I’ve been following the most closely. I’ve been at post for about 21 months at U.S. Embassy in Juba, and when I started the conflict was still ongoing. They were in the throes of some peace talks that people weren’t sure were even that promising. But a few months later – in fact, in September 2018 – a peace agreement was signed which kicked the government and the country into what they call the pre-transitional period. They had a bunch of work that the agreements that had to take place before they could really start the transition. And the development, the pre-transition was extended a couple times, and it shook the confidence of the country in whether the peace process would even work.

But the big development that’s just happened is this last Saturday a new unity government as called for in the peace agreement came into being, and that kicked the country into the next phase, which is the transition phase. That’s supposed to last three years, and then the country’s first national election since its independence. So it’s a big deal if it all gets there. There’s a – the peace agreement is really a fulsome agreement. They call it the revitalized peace agreement, because it’s – the 2015 agreement that failed, they took that as the starting point for the new agreement. And it has a good, healthy reform agenda built into it. And this transition period is when they’re supposed to start getting to some of those reforms.

So everyone’s looking to see: Will this new unity government work? Will it remain an inclusive and unified government? What will their work habits be? And really, what I – the main take is if it works, if the parties work collaboratively, it has a chance of working. If they continue to be competitors within this government, it’s – it has a lot less chance of working. So a collaborative approach is what we’re looking for. We’re looking for signs of that collaboration, attitudinal changes. But really, collaboration is the word of the day there, I think. It was compromise leading up to this. The parties had to compromise to get here, but they’ve done that.

So now the work continues, and starts in some cases. A lot of the obligations for the pre-transition period haven’t, in fact, been completed. There’s still a lot of work to be done on the security sector.

QUESTION: You said “have not”? Sorry.

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: May have to have a – there – the security sector was supposed to be unified, so the rebel armies and the government’s armies were supposed to have been brought together. And that wasn’t completed before, but there was enough confidence that it was starting, that process was starting. So this new government will have to continue that process in the security sector. They’ll have to kind of reinvent how they do governance. Again, a collaborative approach on that would be better. And then the other parts of the peace agreement that should kick in are a recovery program that includes returns of refugees and displaced people; improvements in public financial management and transparency and counter-corruption; transitional justice is a big chapter, so reconciliation and transitional justice. And then there’s also a chapter in the peace agreement on a constitutional process that will kick in leading to the elections. And that’s where they will have these big national dialogues about federalism and the shape of the country and the shape of the future government that comes after the transition period.

So it’s a big agenda, a very big agenda. And this is where we’re at right now. A lot of people will be looking to see what the international community’s role in this process will be. The key players are the neighbors of South Sudan, the IGAD countries, which were the guarantors of this process. Sudan is the new chairman of the IGAD, but Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda are all very key players here. And then if you look at concentric circles, the AU also has a lot of roles to play here in the peace process, and the United Nations. The UNMISS mission is one of the biggest – the biggest by some parameters – peacekeeping mission in the world right now. And we have the pen on the resolutions up in New York on the Security Council, so we and other internationals are paying a lot of attention to this as well.

But the nature of that partnership – on our part, at least – the nature of that partnership really will depend on the nature of this new government. Are they taking responsible decisions that are focused on the needs of their people, or are they taking self-interested decisions based on their own kind of political needs or their needs for power or corrupt finances? And so this is, again, a watchful situation, but it’s also more hopeful than it’s been in a long time.

So there’s – right now, this weekend in Juba, the mood was good, relatively good. But the – it doesn’t erase the healthy skepticism either, and people need to build their confidence up from the beginning. So confidence – I guess I’d talk about collaboration and compromise and confidence – it’s a lot of c words – but confidence of the people in their new government, confidence of the parties within the new government in each other, and confidence of the internationals in the process going forward. That’s just top-level stuff.

And there are other things happening in South Sudan, too – major floods this last year, locusts just came across the border. Those are things – if the ceasefire holds, and the ceasefire has been holding mostly since the peace agreement was signed in September 2018, these other problems which are major, major disasters, emergencies – the world knows how to help deal with those if we can. If the pause is there in the fighting, I think we can keep working on all these other issues.

But the – all the numbers are really off the charts in South Sudan. It is – it’s the biggest humanitarian emergency on the continent, and that means it’s big. The brutality of the civil war that lasted five years – really, it’s off the charts in a lot of ways, what happened to that country, and so the trauma that it’s left with is very, very serious and it pervades everything. So it’s a hefty set of tasks ahead, and – but it – again, it depends on this new government. Are they going to be collaborative and work in the interests of the people or not? So this is what we’re watching, and not just watching, we’re pushing as well. We’re applying pressure and engagement and trying to make sure that it works.

MODERATOR: Why don’t we take a few questions?

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Yeah, please.

MODERATOR: All right.

QUESTION: (Inaudible) ask about the – you talked a couple times about the confidence level of – or there’s a great deal of suspicion. Given the fact that there is – this has been such a tortured road that has been really kind of dominated by personalities and personal vanity of the leaders, who were called out repeatedly about this, what is the confidence level that Machar and these guys are going to be able to actually get along and not just —

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Yeah, well, like you said – yeah.

QUESTION: — not just plunder the place and do what they have done every single time since Garang died?

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Yeah, it’s Kiir and Machar again, so confidence – like, there’s a lot of different kinds of confidence. Can these two parties and then the other parties – it’s a much more inclusive agreement than the last one. There’s five major parties to this peace agreement, and some of those are umbrellas that include many more parties. So that – the first thing about keeping the ceasefire going is that these parties have confidence in each other, but the citizens’ confidence in their government will be a little harder to come by, and we’ll be – we won’t jump into changing the way we do assistance right away either, so we’re very watchful. We don’t – for instance, none of our assistance goes to or through the government. We do it – we’re the biggest donors there because of the humanitarian emergencies, but our assistance does not go to or through the government because we can’t be sure that it will be well spent that way. But – I don’t know, you call —

MODERATOR: (Inaudible.) Carol.

QUESTION: I was in Juba a couple years ago and it was still pretty – sort of dicey. Aid workers were in fear for their lives, and convoys were being attacked, and the ambassador herself was living in the middle of a highly guarded compound. I’m wondering if the security situation has improved at all there, if you see any signs of that.

And also, just following up on what Matt said, beyond hope, do you – is there anything concrete to give you reason that Kiir and Machar will be able to put aside their rivalry? Because I still see them being described as bitter rivals.

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: On the security situation, we’re still on that compound. I tell my colleagues here – I tell them we all live in hooches, but they’re the nicest hooches in the Foreign Service. We have a good degree of community and morale, but it is – we have a curfew, we’re unaccompanied, one-year assignments for most of my officers. So it’s a tough place, like some of the other places that you cover more frequently in your news programs.

That said, since that ceasefire went in place, there’s still a lot of criminality in the city and it’s very unpredictable for our local staff, for instance. For South Sudanese it’s a very difficult environment still, but it’s gotten much better since those times. Since the ceasefire went into effect, it’s – but it’s still a lot of crime, and the fear that it could revert to conflict is – that trauma lasts a lot longer than – people are going to be careful for a long time on that front.

It’s still – I mean, we – the UN keeps a running tab of humanitarians who are attacked or killed, and so we still sometimes throw up the factoid that it’s the most dangerous place in the world for humanitarians. There was a good long stretch at the beginning of 2019 for about nine months were there weren’t any casualties among humanitarian workers, but then starting in the fall there have been a few different attacks where people have been either killed or victims in other ways of attacks. So there’s – it’s still not – it’s still a dangerous place, but it’s better than it had been during the open conflict.

So a lot of violence in the country. Even with the national-level conflict right now under a ceasefire, there’s a lot of violence around the country in any case. There’s cattle-raiding violence, community-level violence that’s very serious – lots of guns in the country. And so it’s – but again, those are the kind of problems that if the ceasefire holds at the national level, there are methodologies and ways to start dealing with that and making some inroads in that.

Hope for the future. We all hope – I – one of the signs that this is different than before, there are assertions by all parties that it’s different this time, assertions which have to be tested and watched very carefully. So and there —

QUESTION: When you say “assertions” —

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: And there are some – there’s some talk about even kind of a – with a religious angle to it. The president talked about – in the speech when he was announcing the new government, talked about his experience with the Pope last spring where the Pope knelt down and kissed the feet of these leaders and really challenged them to be more humble and less – think more about their country and less about their personal power.

So —

MODERATOR: Robbie.

QUESTION: Yeah. I mean, to that point, it feels a bit like Groundhog Day where it’s the same actors making the same if not a similar deal. So to phrase it another way, I mean, do you – does the State Department have faith in Kiir and Machar themselves to carry forward this? What’s changed for these two personalities in the past three or four years that makes you say, yes, we believe you when you say these things are different this time, even though you’ve broken so many ceasefires and so many agreements before?

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: No, well, this is not an agreement that we signed. In 2015 we signed that one. This one we’ve participated in in the sense of putting pressure on, and we have been watchful, and we have been commenting on it and pushing the parties along, but this is not our agreement in that sense. We haven’t – we don’t – it’s not our job now to pronounce it – that it’s good. We will be watchful, we will be – have healthy skepticism, and we will hopefully see some positive things that we can encourage and enable as well, but we’ll also be calling them if they’re – if they’re making some of the same mistakes.

So I think it’s more about watching their deeds rather than giving them a – pronouncing all is well, giving them a grade, a passing grade. It’s too early for that. And we’ll have to watch their institutional reforms – are some of these reforms going to kick in that mean – that can make it more than about the two individuals, right? One of the things that’s different about this agreement, this version of the agreement, the revitalized version, is it’s more inclusive than the other one. It’s not just the two parties. Now it’s a lot more parties. But it’s – these are still the two big men and this is still where most people focus. If it’s going to fall apart, it – this is where it would fall apart, along that fracture.

QUESTION: And just a quick follow-on. If it falls apart, is the U.S. readying any additional sanctions on senior South Sudanese leaders in that case? I know there were sanctions on one of the vice presidents I think late last year.

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Yeah, yeah. Well, I’ve told everybody we reserve the right to use all our diplomatic tools, including more sanctions, if necessary. We have the – we have all the same authorities in place, and I’ve made sure that that’s clear. Right now with the developments just this last week, Kiir did what we and others have been asking him to do – the last big stumbling block to making this new government was temporarily resolving this question of how many states there would be. And I don’t know if you know that background at all, but Kiir and his party favored 32 states; all the other opposition were saying 23. Kiir decided to make a decision not as the head of his party but as the head of the nation and agreed to a 10-state approach, which was the original number in the 2015 agreement. It’s complicated. But he did what the world asked him to do, which is get beyond his party’s immediate interests and make a decision that was – could facilitate the formation of this new government.

So he’s done that. Machar had to make a tough decision also whether he would go along with this, and they did. So, I mean, they made these tough decisions for themselves that they have to go back and sell to their coalitions, and so I think we want to see that – if that works – give them a little bit of a pat on the back for that, but not lose our watchfulness on this.

MODERATOR: Okay, there are a couple more. Yeah, Francesco.

QUESTION: Thank you. So yeah, to follow on the sanctions, is the U.S. considering lifting the designations you announced while there was a stalemate on the national unity government or are you prepared to wait and see?

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Yeah. Well, there’s a lot of different kinds of sanctions. So on the individual, targeted sanctions, I’d – Treasury, OFAC, is who puts those in place, so there is some news out of there today that you might – if you want to track it down, I’d point you towards Treasury on one of those, but those – that’s one kind of sanction. There’s also Department of Commerce has some export controls on the – on U.S. companies that would be dealing with the petroleum and mining industry. Those are still there. Those, I think, should be there till there’s improvements in the investment climate, in the kind of transparency and public financial management field, make sure that they are spending their petroleum revenues in a way that benefits the country rather than contributes to the conflict.

And then the other big area of sanctions are the UN sanctions, including the arms embargo, and I think it’s way too early to consider lifting the arms embargo.

QUESTION: Is that – the Treasury action, this is the Israeli guy?

**SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: **That’s the one that’s today, yeah. Yeah.

QUESTION: Which were moved?

**SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: **So it – and I haven’t even seen anything on that, so that’s why I refer you to them, yeah.

QUESTION:But it’s under – it was under the South Sudan sanctions authority —

**SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: **Yes, it was under —

QUESTION: — but it wasn’t on a Sudanese –

**SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: **Yeah. And even those targeted ones are – yeah, it was because of his business in South Sudan, but he wasn’t a South Sudanese citizen, and his companies as well. We have an executive order under which some of the individual sanctions have been levied, and then we’ve also – there are some that have been levied under Global Magnitsky Act. And I’d have to check notes to make sure which is which, but I think this is under the executive order.

MODERATOR: Abbie.

QUESTION: I know that sexual violence was a huge weapon of war in the last couple of years, and with the formation of this unity government, I wonder what accountability you see for the perpetrators of those crimes or what the U.S. is involved in in helping the women who survived that.

**SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: **Yeah. It was a huge problem during the war, and it’s not an automatic thing that with the end of the war even that this will go away as an issue, as a malady of – I mean, it’s a terrible situation. These numbers are, again, off the charts, and it’s a complicated phenomenon too. Some people will say it’s cultural; some people say it’s the conflict; and it’s probably a crazy mixture of both of those.

So there’s a lot of attention to this issue set, and we’ve been pushing all the individual parties to make progress on this even before they came together as a government. And so I think there will be a lot of internationals that continue to push. And there are some South Sudanese who are really becoming active in pushing for this. So I think the solutions for justice in these cases are going to have to be – it’s a mix. It’s going to need multiple tools. So we would love to see if there can be more developed in the South Sudanese justice systems and courts. The UN’s been helping with mobile courts to go out to places in the country that don’t have access to judicial services any other way than that. So that’s a starter kit, but they need to develop their own institutions.

But also, some of the mechanisms that are to be built into the reform efforts, chapter 5 of the peace agreement is on transitional justice. So there’s a Truth, Reconciliation, and Healing Commission. There is supposed to be a hybrid court – it’s an AU-South Sudan hybrid court for, one would think, the worst perpetrators of human rights atrocities during the war. So that has to be constituted. And all these tools together – there’s also other international mechanisms. There’s the UN Commission for Human Rights in South Sudan that’s established in Geneva. We used to have the pen on that when we were still on the council. And a report just came out from them that covered a whole range of human rights issues, including starvation as a crime, which is a kind of interesting take, but some of the gender-based violence reporting that’s come out of the UN system and our own reporting, it’s been just – it’s so difficult to deal with. I have to say it’s probably one of the most difficult things to kind of comprehend the magnitude of it when I got there, and I’ve worked in places like Taliban, Afghanistan, and I found South Sudan shocking at the level of sexual violence there.

MODERATOR: Do you have time for one more?

**SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: **Sure.

MODERATOR: All right, take one more. Conor.

QUESTION: Just a quick —

**SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: **I’m just skipping out of a boring meeting, so this is —

QUESTION: A quick follow-up on Carol’s question about security.

QUESTION: And we can keep asking.

**QUESTION: **At the end of last month there was an embassy alert about a terror plot against the embassy and against U.S. personnel in the country. I was wondering if you could provide any more details on that, what groups, and whether or not that threat still remains in the country.

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Well, we took steps. We had some evidence to believe that the embassy was being watched by bad guys. So we did a couple things. We had very good cooperation from the South Sudanese police and National Security Services to help us make sure security in our neighborhood was good, and we’ve done all the things that most embassies do. We took steps to vary our times and our routes, and in fact, we’d already had warnings out to the public about security conditions in South Sudan. So it didn’t look too different to too many people, but we did take some extra steps. I don’t know if we’ll ever kind of know the outcome of that, but —

QUESTION: Was it a local actor or —

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Oh, don’t even know. I mean, that’s – yeah, it’s – don’t even – it doesn’t matter. We had to – it wasn’t a South Sudanese if that’s what you mean by local.

QUESTION: Right.

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: But local like – yeah, I mean, in South Sudan. Yeah, and our embassy in Juba is what – but at the same time, there was – you know how everybody uses WhatsApp over there. So there was a WhatsApp message going around that wasn’t really what we were looking at, but that’s really what most people were reacting to. So – and that had all sorts of information that I never saw in our threat information, but I think it was – it was just – it came after the month where you had the events in Baghdad and there was an al-Shabaab attack in Kenya. And so I think some of that broader rumor stuff was actually earlier from just kind of the regional look at things.

So, yeah, that’s – but ours – we just took a – like I said, we – at the beginning, we already had curfew and we already had a lot of other security precautions. We just stepped up our good practices like varying your times and routes, so we’re hanging in there.

MODERATOR: All right. Thanks for being here with us today. Very much appreciate the —

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Okay. Yeah. Thank you so much.

QUESTION: Thank you for taking the time.

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: And thank you for attention to South Sudan issues.

QUESTION: There isn’t anything more on terrain combat, is there?

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Not lately, no. I mean, that was one of the things, when I got there, that the verdict wasn’t out yet, but then it has since – they’ve delivered that verdict, but there’s still stuff that needs —

QUESTION: They still haven’t paid, right? Or have they —

SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: They’ve – I don’t think they have, no. I mean, that’s not the question. The question is on – terrain was just whether they – the people – some of the victims have gone back to ask for higher compensation, and that hasn’t gone anywhere yet.

**QUESTION: **Okay.","Today we have [Senior State Department Official], who’s going to talk to us about developments in South Sudan.
SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Yeah, yeah.
SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Yeah.
QUESTION:But it’s under – it was under the South Sudan sanctions authority —**SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: **Yes, it was under —QUESTION: — but it wasn’t on a Sudanese –**SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: **Yeah.
**SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: **Yeah."
19,https://www.jta.org/2020/02/26/opinion/elizabeth-warren-trumps-israel-peace-plan-is-a-disaster-ive-got-a-plan-for-that,"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Jewish Telegraphic Agency,Elizabeth Warren: Trump’s Middle East peace plan is a disaster. I’ve got a plan for that.,"(JTA) — This is the fourth op-ed in a series of pieces about anti-Semitism and Jewish issues written by 2020 presidential candidates. This one is by Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts.

The Jewish Telegraphic Agency has sent five questions about anti-Semitism and Jewish issues to all of the registered presidential candidates from both parties. You can read Joe Biden’s responses here, Pete Buttigieg’s responses here and Mike Bloomberg’s responses here.

1) Anti-Semitic hate crimes are currently on the rise across the United States. In 2018, there were two deadly shootings at synagogues in Pittsburgh and Poway, violent attacks now regularly plague the Jews of New York City, and Jews continue to be the target of most religion-based hate crimes across the country. In a few sentences, describe your plan to address the rise in U.S. anti-Semitism.

Our first president promised the early Jewish community in our country that “there shall be none to make him afraid,” welcoming them as equal citizens and pledging that bigotry would receive no foothold in our new nation. But just as so many of our foundational tenets have been challenged over the past few years, this commitment has also been shaken. Jews have been murdered in their places of worship, assaulted on the streets and subjected to hateful invective — simply because of who they are. Anti-Semitic incidents such as physical assault, vandalism and attacks on Jewish institutions surged nearly 60 percent in 2017, the largest single-year increase on record.

In the aftermath of the 2018 shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh that killed eleven Jewish worshipers, I attended Shabbat services at Temple Emanuel in Newton, Massachusetts. The shooting was an act of pure evil, an attack on the Jewish community not just in Pittsburgh but all across our country. I attended to mourn the victims and to grieve with their families. But I also attended to worship with people who were determined to come together and reaffirm that we are one people, that we value each other. Attacks like the ones we have experienced in recent years are completely incompatible with American values. They are a threat to American safety and security. We can and must do better — and in a Warren administration, we will use every tool we have to do so.

As president, I’ll improve data collection on bias-motivated crimes and prioritize their investigation and prosecution. I’ll expand background checks and the use of extreme risk protection orders to keep guns out of the hands of those who would use them to provoke fear in Jewish communities. I’ll promote anti-bias education — including about manifestations of anti-Semitism and about the Holocaust — as an educational priority, and I’ll establish a commission to address incitement to violence on the Internet in a manner consistent with freedom of expression. I’ll work with state and local law enforcement to ensure that Jewish institutions and neighborhoods are safe and free from fear, and I’ll work with local community leaders to build trust and combat hate. And I will welcome every part of the Jewish community to my White House, celebrating the diversity of the community and its unshakeable place within our American community.

Anti-Semitism has no place in democracy. When our neighbors are being persecuted, or attacked, or treated unfairly, that impacts all of us. To take on hate, we all have to stand up against it — together.

2) A number of Democratic lawmakers have recently critiqued Israel in ways that some have characterized as anti-Semitic. What is the line between legitimate criticism of Israel and anti-Semitism to you?

We have a moral duty to combat hateful ideologies in our own country and around the world, and that includes anti-Semitism. In a democracy, we can and should have an open, respectful debate about the Middle East that focuses on policy.

Criticism that singles out Israel as uniquely worthy of censure can often be anti-Semitic in intent. At the same time, branding all criticism of Israel as automatically anti-Semitic has a chilling effect on our public discourse and makes it harder to achieve a peaceful solution between Israelis and Palestinians. We can speak out against the far-right-wing policies of the Netanyahu government, like annexation and settlements, while supporting Israel. What I don’t accept is when people on either side of the aisle criticize or commend Israel in terms that echo long-standing slanders against the Jewish people. Our leaders have a responsibility not to do that. And threats of violence — from any side — are never acceptable.

3) Countless politicians have tried to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians, and yet, a two-state outcome now seems more dream than possibility. What are your concrete plans to address the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians?

I believe in the worth and value of every Israeli and every Palestinian. And I believe that the way we respect all parties is through a two-state solution — an outcome that’s good for U.S. interests, good for Israel’s security and its future, and good for Palestinian rights, dignity and self-determination. To achieve this, there must be an end to the Israeli occupation and the creation of an independent and sovereign Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip living alongside Israel.

Israel is a strong ally and an important friend. It has been a close partner in disrupting terrorism and in containing regional security threats. I am committed to Israel’s security and safety, and to working together to combat those shared threats. Unfortunately, the Trump administration’s approach has made a two-state solution harder to achieve. His one-sided “peace plan” is a rubber stamp for annexation and offers no chance for a real Palestinian state. As president, I’ll take immediate steps to fix the damage and reestablish America’s role as a credible mediator.

I will welcome the Palestinian General Delegation back to Washington, because we cannot advance peace when we have closed our channels of communication. I will resume aid to the Palestinians that the Trump Administration has cut off and place greater emphasis on relieving the humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza Strip, because we cannot sustain peace without a future that brings greater freedom, prosperity and security to the Palestinian people. I will reopen the U.S. mission in Jerusalem to the Palestinians and make clear that in a two-state agreement both parties should be able to have their capitals in Jerusalem.

Today the continued expansion of Israeli settlements and the increasing normalization of proposals for Israel to annex parts or all of the West Bank are the most immediate dangers to the two-state solution. These are policies that have been aggressively pursued by Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies, but also by successive Israeli governments for years. I oppose unilateral annexation in any form — and I will reverse any U.S. policy that supports it. If Israel’s government continues with steps to annex the West Bank, the U.S. should make clear that none of our aid should be used to support annexation. At the same time, I will also address anti-democratic practices and corruption within the Palestinian Authority that have fed a sense of disillusionment inside the Palestinian Territories. And we must unequivocally press all sides to refrain from violence or incitement to violence.

But for the sake of both parties and for the future of the two-state solution, we must address the credibility gap that has been created amongst the young Israelis and Palestinians who simply do not believe that peace is possible, where hope has been replaced by fear and mistrust. We must work to lay a foundation that enables Israelis and Palestinians to overcome the broken status quo and move towards a brighter future — one where Israelis and Palestinians can live together in peace, freedom, security, and prosperity.

4) Is there any part of American Jewish culture, or Jewish figure from history, that has been particularly meaningful to you in your life?

Jewish leaders have always contributed to the fight for social justice in our country, and I take inspiration from a long legacy of activists and advocates that drew strength from their Jewish faith.

I think about Rose Schneiderman and her efforts to defend the rights of workers, particularly women and immigrants. Out of the ashes of the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist factory, Rose organized a movement of women laborers to fight back. She fought against dangerous and squalid conditions, and for labor protections, shorter hours, and higher pay. And she built a movement, inspiring others to join the fight and telling them that “The worker must have bread, but she must have roses, too.” It was in honor of Rose and her fellow activists that I launched my campaign for the presidency in Lawrence, Massachusetts, the site of the Bread and Roses labor strike.

I also think about Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. He used the power of the law to rein in big corporations and dismantle monopolies, and to fight back against rampant wealth inequality in our country. It was Justice Brandeis who warned that “We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can’t have both.” Just like today, the fights to break up powerful trusts were ferocious — but democracy eventually prevailed, and corporations were denied the power to write their own rules.

5) Have you participated in a Passover Seder or other Jewish holiday ritual? If so, what were the circumstances, and what was the experience like for you?

During my time as a Senator, I have been fortunate to participate in seders to celebrate the Passover holiday in communities across Massachusetts. It is a special privilege to be invited into someone’s home and to gather with friends and family to celebrate shared values. Passover is a holiday that requires us to reflect on history and tradition as we relive the story of the Jewish people’s journey from slavery to freedom. But it is also a holiday that requires us to renew our courage to fight for freedom and justice — not only for ourselves, but for the homeless, the oppressed, and the vulnerable in our communities and around the world — today and every day.

Afghanistan remains one of the poorest, most corrupt and deadly countries despite the apparent generous foreign monetary funding as well as the sacrifices of men and women in uniform over all these years.

Some three million Afghans are displaced in their own country out of a total estimated 3.5 million population. Close to six million are refugees wandering in different corners of the world and close to two million are drug addicts. The rest of the population is not in an ideal state either, gripped by crippling poverty amid a dearth of services, opportunities for education and jobs etc.

The prevailing corruption in government institutions makes it literally impossible for innocent war victims to seek justice and compensation. So what mechanisms have been discussed by the US and the Taliban in their marathon round of talks to ensure justice is done after their likely inking of the proposed deal (that is mainly focused on the withdrawal of foreign troops and guarantees that international terrorism would not be launched from Afghanistan)?

All warning sides have blood of the civilians on their hands in this raging conflict in its 19th year. Only last week, twice, dozens of Afghans had to protest in northern parts of the country against civilian casualties with bodies of their loved ones in the punishing harsh winter.

The third-party, the Afghan government, which has so far been sidelined, seems to struggle for survival as it grabs a seat at the negotiation table. Logically speaking, it is the government that should take a strong stance and lead in representing the population, their rights and seek compensation for their losses.

It leaves the international community, particularly the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan to realize and certify that this matter is addressed in any proposed peace deal, and justice is done for the rights of the Afghans who have suffered a lot.

The conflict has been considered intractable, due to its complexity multiple endeavors failed to bring on a solution. The conflict that erupted between Turkish and Greek Cypriots on the island had a different language, culture, and religion. These two components are the triggers of the Cyprus conflict which have dragged external actors into the conflict. After independence, these two ethnic groups were granted self-governance as one state on the Island. They have been given an authority based on a constitution that has been enacted by the presence of external actors. They shared the governance of the island until the Coup of 1974 that led to separate these two ethnic groups into two constituencies which resulted in two separate regions. Turkish intervention in the 1980s divided the island into two republics. The self-declaring of an independent state for ethnic Turkish in Northern Cyprus has made the conflict intractable. The tension grew strain between them until 2014 when the reunification discussions opened between the two sides. (1)

There is a primary and secondary actor in the conflict, both actors have their interests in the conflict. Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots are the main actors and the external actor such as Turkey, Greece and Britain are the main secondary actors.

Historical background of the conflict

Cyprus has been a victim of its geographical significance, due to its geopolitical importance has been conquered by multiple empires in the region. The ownership of Cyprus has changed hands among the empires such as Greeks, Egyptian, Roman, Ottoman. And British as the last empire took over from the Ottoman empire from 1878 until independence in 1960.Cyprus conflict has national, regional, and international dimensions, so the solution should take the account of multiple actors. In addition to the ethnic nationalism in terms of conflict between Greek -Turkish Cypriots, there are other actors such as Turkey and Greece. Moreover, there are international actors such as the EU,NATO, and the United Nations.(2)As Cyprus connects three continents, its geopolitical importance has lent it both vulnerability and strengths. That is why history has been of external powers’ interest.

The root cause of the conflict attributes to the lack of national identity within Cypriot society, lack of commonality has paved the way to disagreement over multiple cases. When Britain took over the administration of the island did not allow these two ethnicities to intermingle, during the independence made them too strange to each other to get along together under one state. The actual independence struggle itself was to reunification with motherland Greek which was unacceptable for Turkish Cypriots. The guerrilla war itself that was initiated by Greek Cypriot was to reunify with Greece, not for its independent state. The reunification was not in the interest of both Turkey and Great Britain. So, the conflict started, and later the North Cypriots self-declared their ethnic state. External powers fuelled the conflict for their interest. In so case, the conflict in Cyprus took in the international aspect which later UN involved to stop fighting.(3)

One of the main causes of the conflict between these two groups was security, the Turkish Cypriots did not experience security towards their Cypriots counterpart. There was inequality both socially and economically. The Greek Cypriots within the republic had more power in all sectors of life, therefore the Turkish experienced alienation which gave them a feeling of a stranger inside their own country. To fill the security vacuum they resorted to external support and Turkey was ready to present them this security. In this way, external powers such as Greece, UK, and Turkey shifted their role from guarantor to a supporter of one side over the other that made the conflict more intractable. In the referendum, the majority of Turkish Cypriots voted yes to Annan Plan but on the other side most of the Cypriot Greek vote no to this plan. Annan’s plan was an initiative to start the process of the reunification of the Island in one whole state instead of two divided states.(4)

Divide and rule

Divide and rule strategy has been a tactic of all European colonizers from the time of the Roman empire until the end of the colonization. The Dutch and the Spanish have made benefit from this strategy. All of these empires including Britain and France have employed different ways but most Western colonialist have used four basic tactics as 1)“The creation of the differences within the conquered population 2) the augmentation of existing differences 3) the channeling or exploitation of these differences for the benefit of the colonial power; and 4) the politicization of these differences so that they carry over into the post-colonial”. Britain even used an educational system to promote segregated education between ethnic Greece and Turkish Cypriots. In such a way Greek schools were staffed by teachers from Greece and Turkish schools by teachers from Turkey. They used the same tactics in Nigeria between the South and the North in a way opened more schools in the South than in the North which created different education levels.(5)

The policy of divide and rule was one of the most important strategies that have been employed by the British empire during its colony and after decolonization. The British empire has divided the people of the colonized states into multiple parts. The division policy has been followed to facilitate the governing process such as the Partition policy in India. Adoption of this strategy was the paramount goal for British empire expansion. Otherwise, it had been difficult for Britain to keep control over all these places in the world. There are various examples regarding partition policy such as in Palestine in the Middle East or Zimbabwe in Africa. Britain in contrast to France has employed segregation by dividing people to rule better. Internal Cyprus conflict is the result of the independence movement and decolonization process which led to dividing the state between Greek and Turkish Cypriots.(6)The treaties of guarantors and alliances or unworkable constitutions were the start of the intercommunal conflict between Greeks and Turkish on the island.

Multiple differences within Cypriots society laid the foundation of conflict that was exploited by external powers. They have different languages, religions, and cultures which mistakenly have been a catalyst of the conflict.

Primordial attachment

Cyprus geographically is important for major powers in the region therefore all three so-called guarantor countries such as Greece, Turkey, and Britain sought to keep influence on the Island. Through developing nationalism, the external powers gained a foothold there, from the 1960s onwards they urged national identity based on primordial principles. Both Greek and Turkey alongside Britain in a variety of ways intervened in the internal situation of the people of Cyprus. The population in Greece attached to different countries to protect themselves from another side. In such a way the idea of union with Greek the mainland for Greek Cypriot was the goal. And for the Turkish Cypriots, the partition of the Island was a case of maintaining the Turkish identity. The importance of the Island came to the surface even more in the period between 1960 -1974 when the two ethnic groups divided, and the external powers entered the conflict with support confined to nationalism toward both sides(7)

National identity is what binds the people together, in Cyprus, there are religion and language have been the main elements of their national identity. But for the new generation in Cyprus, there are other elements alongside religion and language to become an individual identity. Most of the new generation are speaking fluently English which gives them a new allegiance and a new identity. In the modern era, principles of gender, human rights, freedom, and democracy are the main goals for human beings to stand for it. So multiple factors replaced the traditional elements of identity building.(8)

The conflict in Cyprus starts directly after the independence before the independence both Turkish and Greek Cypriots were fighting Britain and seeking independence. But after Britain’s withdrawal, primordial values in terms of ethnic affiliations were promoted, and intercommunal fighting erupted between them.

Geopolitical interests

Geopolitical interests in Cyprus have played a big role in regional politics in the Middle East. This significance made the Island a victim of regional and international politics. It is an important gateway for three continents namely Asia, Europe, and Africa. Due to its location which is connecting three continents, has attracted major powers. It locates in a place that can control the connections of the most important chokepoints in the Mediterranean such as Bab-el-Mandeb, the Suez channel, and the Hormuz Strait. Where through these chokepoints import and export from oil and gas producers are transported to industrialized countries. Due to its significance has become of external powers’ interest throughout history. From Cyprus, it is easier to surveil all these chokepoints and from modern time, the USA has established an intelligence base to observe the Eastern Mediterranean and further.(9)

Even though Cyprus far away from most of the international powers, due to its importance geopolitically most of the major power through one or another way established a kind of link with it.USA under the excuse of NATO alliances with Turkey and Greece has a presence there. Britain has physical military bases and works as a guarantor based on the London-Zurich agreement. Turkey as a guarantor and links to ethnic Turkish Cypriots, Greece as a guarantor and links to Greek Cypriot, European Union through the republic memberships. So, the conflicts in Cyprus have both national and international aspects. (10)

Late discoveries of natural gas in the Eastern Mediterranean surfaced the importance of the Island again. Egypt, Israel, and the Republic of Cyprus started to explore gas in the area which provokes Turkey. Against this background, Turkey intensifies its presence in the Mediterranean by starting to explore natural gas alongside other actors there. This development triggers the start of shifting a balance of power and new alliances which leads to a new equilibrium in the region. Even Turkey has threatened to blacklist those firms that are developing offshore gas exploration.(11) findings of gas in the Eastern Mediterranean have enhanced amicable relationship among Israel, Greece, and the Republic of Cyprus, on the other side Turkey got a foothold in the waters of Southern Cyprus through the Northern republic which is recognized by only Turkey. These alliances made all countries in the region insecure which reflected negatively on the other conflicted areas such as Syria and Libya.(12)

Solution

The conflict in Cyprus is considered intractable which means resolving is more difficult than the other. Establishing peace on the Island can be achieved by adopting a conflict transformation approach. In this method, all walks of society participate in the peacebuilding process. , through individual participation, reconciliation will be materialized in a way that all citizens on the island are direct contributors and participators in the process. In doing so conflict transformation make benefits from civil society promoting which binds individual from both ethnic groups. In so case the allegiance shifting away from ethnicities to citizenship based on individual rights and interests. Conflict transformation is suited to the case of Cyprus which refrains the two ethnic groups form an in-group attachment.

So far peacemakers on the Island have sought to find a solution for the conflict based on the conflict resolution approach. This kind of solution has promoted ethnic nationalism and in-group allegiance, therefore international mediation whether coercive or non coercive has failed to find a common interest between these two ethnic groups. Coercive peacebuilding is a Modell that is practiced by Russia which has never given sustainable peace such as Russia’s mediation in Ukraine, Chechenia, Libya, and Syria. (13)

There is non-coercive intervention conflict resolution such as the ideas of William Zartman which allows the conflict parties to reach a mutually hurting stalemate. This method at the end of the day creates a time ripeness for negotiation in which both sides reach a level of damage in terms of the utility of war.Ripeness moment has been used as a strategy to convince and force the conflicting sides to apply to the negotiation and come into a sustainable agreement which results in peacebuilding.(14)

Resolving the conflict through international and external mediation results in a temporary solution that potentially re-emerges after the international system and shifting of their interests. Thus, the conflict can be sustainable only in the case of internal solutions based on individual rights and finding common interests among the population regardless of religion, language, and cultures.

Promoting common interest within the conflicting sides can result in sustainable peacebuilding. to achieve this goal enhancing the principles of democracy such as human rights, freedom, and supporting civil society which finally binds the individuals together based on citizenship than ethnicities allegiance. Through the principles of democracy, primordial nationalism is replaced by civic nationalism. This strategy has been used in Canada which resulted in positive consequences in terms of coexistence between Quebec and the rest of the populations. The people of Quebec find their interests with the English people than with the French people in the other land.(15)

“There are four main factors which tend to create internal conflict: discriminatory political institutions; exclusionary national ideologies; intergroup politics; and elite politics”. (Michael E. Brown 1997).These factors apply to the conflict on the island, due to the longevity of the conflict common national identity has been weakening year after year. And there are four main schools to settle ethnic disputes that can be used to mitigate the hostility between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots. The first school concentrate on coercive intervention to create a balance of power(Fen Osler Hampson1997),the second school concentrate on non-coercive intervention through confidence building or ripe moment and power-sharing(Fen Osler Hampson1997),and the third schools argue that just political order is important and supporting civil society(Fen Osler Hampston1997),and the fourth school includes the use of the conflict resolution workshops which seek to reduce stereotyping in the citizen level(Jhon Burton1972)(16)

Creating a national identity in Cyprus is of paramount importance to mitigate the hostilities between the two ethnic groups, in away the people of Cyprus should promote their Cypriots attachment instead of external attachment towards Greece by Cypriot Greek and attachment to Turkey by Turkish Cypriots. Finding commonality between these two ethnicities inside Cyprus in away way both ethnicities feel secure toward each other is a path for a solution. Geopolitically a powerful Cyprus is not in the interest of external stakeholders such as Turkey and Greece therefore they always are seeking to hold the republic of Cyprus divided and weak. In such a way they would be able to intervene and make benefit from its geopolitical importance in the region which has its importance by locating among three continents. Creating a sense of Cypriot’s identity facilitates establishing a civic nationalism which paves the way to coexistence and cooperation toward a common goal. Democratic principles that give citizenship, equal economic and social rights, and free political participation are elements that can be achieved under civic nationalism, in such a way materializing a Cyprus nationalism based on duty and rights, not ethnic belongings.(17)

Through civil society promoting and confidence-building measures, the relationship between communities is possible to yield positive results. As Christopher Michell says, “Local peacebuilding and national peace” In a way Channels of communication can be promoted through grassroots communication. Building multiple organizations would lead to building more trust among the ordinary people in such a way mutual interest facilitates the foundation of peace. Through civil society promoting the relationship between local and national level which ultimately peacebuilding is achieved.(18)

Enhancing the role of civil society based on track two diplomacy, the two communities can open multiple channels of communication which at the end of the day the fear of insecurity is dissipated for those who voted no in the referendum in 2004. As these two ethnicities have different backgrounds in terms of language and religion and both of them have a connection to the different motherlands, they are seeking security from their respective motherlands. But in the case of building internal security through low politics strategy and micro-level communication, this fear is covered as Oliver Richmond says “NGOs fulfill vital roles that states and their agencies cannot take on”. (19)

Another alternative to promote peace and finding a resolution for the Cyprus conflict is economic factors through gas exploration in the eastern Mediterranean which gives benefits for economic prosper for the people of Cyprus. In 2014 enormous gas discovery in the region has given the prospect of the reunification of Cyprus and ending the long conflict. As multiple actors have been involved in the Cyprus conflict, its resolution should be internationally in a way all actors experience security towards each other.(20)

After Cyprus accession to the European Union, there was more possibility of finding a mutual solution thatyields joint interest for both communities in Cyprus. The people of Cyprus have lived peacefully through history the conflict flared up in 1950 during the independence war against the United Kingdom, therefore, the application of the methods of Roger and Fisher (2011) can result in positive consequences. There are some of the methods that underpin the process of negotiation of the resolution of the conflicts. These methods are” 1)Don’t bargain over position 2) separate the people of the problem 3) focus on interests, not positions 4) invent options for mutual gains 5) insist of objective criteria”.(9) In the case of Cyprus, joint gains can be achieved through gas exploration and redistribute the resources’ revenue equally over the Cyprus population.(21)

Based on the oven mentioned points Greek and Turkish Cyprus can find commonality and mutual interests which leads to coexistence and cooperation instead of fighting each other and experiencing insecurity.

Conclusion

Cyprus has been a pivotal case for most empires in the old and new history. All empires had sought to keep control over the island, which they were using as a corridor between East and West. As it connects Asia, Africa, and Europe, the major powers were interested to keep control over it. The Island was occupied by the Greek, Roman, and Ottoman empires until 1870 was deliver to the British empire. These external powers made the way for inter-communal groups to fight each other. Its significance urged these external powers to sow the soul of dissension between the two main ethnic groups as a divide and rule strategy. There are primary and secondary actors in the Cyprus conflict, the primary are the two ethnic groups such as Turkish and Greeks who are living on the Island. Finding the solution for this conflict can start from the primary actors such as Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Through the transformation approach, the relationship between these two ethnic groups is promoting and based on low-level interaction peacebuilding starts to flourish. Moreover, there are secondary actors are playing an expansive role within the Cyprus conflict. The fatherlands of Greece and Turkey are involved by supporting their ethnic groups on the Island. Through establishing the bases of security for both ethnic groups is the foundation of the conflict resolution for the intractable conflict of Cyprus.

Getting to Yes which is concentrating on interests than position is helpful to resolve disputes between conflicting sides. In the case of Cyprus looking forward than looking back is facilitating the process of negotiation. Some points can be used in the process of negotiation in the Cyprus conflict. Most important points er 1) bargaining over interests than position 2)separating the people from the problem 3)mutual gain 4) insisting on objective criteria.(22)

Based on the conflict transformation strategies and win-win negotiations, citizens can be drawn into the negotiations. These measures within conflict resolution by engaging civil society the fear of insecurity can be dissipated. In that case, the conflicting parties within Cyprus society could be reunified and the main causes of their internal conflicts are transformed and resolved.

South Sudanese are cautiously celebrating the long-awaited formation of the Revitalised Transitional Government of National Unity (R-TGoNU), expected to finally bring a peace agreement signed in late 2018 between the government of Salva Kiir Mayardit and former Vice President, Riek Machar Teny to its final implementation stages.

Mediated by Inter-Governmental Agency on Development (IGAD), a regional trade bloc for East and Horn of Africa, this phase of the agreement is expected to focus on consolidation of power-sharing, security transformation, reconciliation between communities and reconstruction of the war-torn country, including institutional reforms. There was a cautious applause when the two principal leaders met in Juba last week to form the unity government. Cautious because it remains unclear whether this government will genuinely begin with a real reconciliation program that translates the agreement that underpins it into peace at fundamental levels of society, into a program the war-battered populations can buy into, own, trust in and take to the bank, or whether it will be a band aid patch trying to mend a gaping and profusely bleeding wound.

Anyone who has lived in South Sudan over the past six years of the civil war and was able to observe the behaviour of some of these leaders who are now forming the unity government will testify that there must be much more concrete signs of peace than the photo opportunities, the handshakes and media statements of the last few days before anyone will let out a sigh of relief that peace is here. It takes money to domesticate peace, to repatriate millions of refugees and internally displaced persons, to invest in new livelihoods, to resuscitate the infrastructure projects that were halted by war and which are vital for the country's economic come back from the dead, and this government has to show that the massive oil revenues will be put up for this mission. There is very little evidence that this will happen, as the government will be made up of the same old personalities, both in opposition and in government, that have already been the champions of corruption. Will the new government use the revenues to renew the promise of state viability or to mere appease the partners?

This is not being overly cynical, as I am sure many South Sudanese will accuse me, but about reading the signs objectively and realistically, if the recent history, how these same leaders handled the fate of the entire nation with utter callousness and with no remorse, is any guide.

TIRED OF WAR

What is missing then from the events that are now unfolding in Juba? There is no question that most people are tired of war and it is probably better to have this agreement than none at all. But people want this new government to start championing a project of return to peace, reviving the economy, providing hope to the millions in refugees and internally displaced persons that there will be security and that they will be assisted to return home. That is a tall order indeed, one for which there is no evidence it will be attempted.

More importantly, as the two principal leaders, Riek Machar and Salva Kiir exchange niceties and words of mutual forgiveness, they do not seem mindful that the most meaningful forgiveness needs to happen in such war-torn communities as in Malakal, Wau, Bentiu, Bor and Yei, Akobo and others, between the various ethnic groups that were pitted against one another by the rivalry between these two men. If the two or any of their other four vice presidents do not invest resources and time to tour all these locations to assure the people that peace has returned, it will not be too long before the people become disillusioned and violence will not cease. They forgot to appeal for forgiveness from the people of South Sudan for the destruction, death and agony they brought upon them. Mr Machar's speech on the occasion of his swearing in as First Vice President has already left many people unsatisfied, not in what he said but in what he has left out. He was expected to articulate a strong reform agenda, a vision that can restore trust between the people, to mend the ethnic relations that have been wrecked by the war and to promise a better citizen-state relations, especially in terms of justice and accountability, fighting corruption and narrowing the economic inequities that have been created by corruption and mass diversion of public resources to individuals. He needed to at least give some indication that he is aware of these issues, let alone the fact he had gone to war in the name of reforms.

If the previous failed agreements should be any guide, the leaders who will now make up R-TGoNU have only one thing to remember, that this country has truly come to a fork in the road. The question on everyone's mind is which fork in the road are the R-TGoNU planning to take in the next several weeks to months. Either they will engage in the old tricks, jockeying to lodge themselves and their allies in the more lucrative positions in Finance, Banking and Petroleum, forgetting about the suffering the six-year civil war has inflicted on more than 70 percent of the country's population, or genuinely seek a new dispensation that emphasises a people-centred politics.

BLIND EYE

This government will be a mere postponement of conflict if it gives a blind eye to the corruption and grand theft that has created a ghastly and deadly form of inequality in South Sudan since 2005. Of all the peoples in Eastern Africa, whose histories and political cultures we resemble, South Sudanese should know best, that injustice begets war. It was injustice that got South Sudanese to rise up and to obstinately fight hard and testing wars spanning 200 years against foreign occupiers with unflinching dedication, until political independence was achieved in 2011. Throughout it all, especially in the last 60 years, they disagreed among themselves, turned guns against one another, fought vicious internal wars that have convinced outside observers at times that South Sudanese had all together forgotten about their common cause. But they have always risen above those moments of in-fighting, reunited and relaunched their quest for freedom, all because there was always a unifying enemy. Without such a common opponent, one thing is certain, and that is South Sudanese will not put up with injustice and this country could go into eternity with these wars, unless there is a true leadership that confronts injustice head-on.

On January 27, 2020, Amnesty International condemned what it described as the return of mass arrests of opposition activists and supporters in Ethiopia, expressing shock and disappointment at a Prime Minister who had won the Nobel Peace Prize just months earlier because of his peace initiatives with neighboring Eritrea.

Amnesty confirmed that at least 75 supporters of the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) were arrested over that weekend from various places in different parts of Oromia Regional State, as Ethiopian authorities intensified the crackdown on dissenting political views ahead of the general elections.

“These sweeping arrests risk undermining the rights to freedom of expression and association ahead of the 2020 elections,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Director for East and Southern Africa.

According to Amnesty, the arrests took place across the state including in Finchawa town in West Guji Zone of Oromia, and Shambu town in Horo-Guduru Wallaga Zone of Oromia. Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed

Chaltu Takele had spent more than eight years in prison between 2008 and 2016 after being accused of being a member of the Oromo Liberation Front, which the Ethiopian government had listed as a “terrorist organization”.

The Ethiopian Parliament delisted OLF and other political opposition groups from being proscribed terrorist groups in 2018. Chaltu was also arrested and briefly detained in 2017, and again 2019 while she was pregnant.

Amnesty said those violent arrests were the latest in a long line of mass arrests of opposition activists.

It said the Ethiopian police and military have been rounding up people for “rehabilitation training” since February 2019. After spending time in various military and police detention centers, most were released between September and November 2019.

But Abiy Ahmed did not stop. Last Saturday, Amnesty International expressed anger and shock after police in Ethiopia launched another brutal attack on opposition party supporters in the Oromia Region, killing one person and arresting and injuring scores more.

Just hours after the date for Ethiopia’s parliamentary elections was announced, the Oromia Liyu police raided the inauguration of an Oromia Liberation Front (OLF) office in Welenchiti, firing live bullets and tear gas, killing one OLF supporter who was a clothes vendor.

Later that day, police arrested around 30 guests at a hotel launch party in Burayu and drove them to a sports stadium where they were beaten and humiliated for hours.

“These brazen attacks show just how dangerous it is becoming to assemble and express political stances in Ethiopia,” said Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for East and Southern Africa, Seif Magango.

“Raids on opposition gatherings must not be allowed to become a feature of the pre-election period. The authorities must immediately launch an independent and effective investigation into these attacks and hold suspects to account in fair trials.”

Following the attack on the OLF office in Welenchiti, the regional Liyu police beat up the gathered supporters and pursued those who fled, hitting them with sticks. They also immobilized a parked vehicle belonging to a local news crew, from the Oromia News Network (ONN), by shooting its tyres, then later moving it to a local police station with the journalists’ filming equipment still inside.

The second attack by the Liyu Police took place later the same day at the launch of a new hotel in Burayu. Police descended on the guests as the party was winding down, bundled about 30 of them into a police van and drove them to the Burayu Stadium.

There detainees were beaten again, forced to do laps around the stadium on their knees and roll on the ground late into the night.

Hawi Haile Yesus Keneni, a female musician, was among those seriously beaten up in Burayu, sustaining injuries that require surgery. She told Amnesty International that members of the Oromia Liyu Police in green uniforms beat her on the head, hands and other parts of her body.

While the Burayu town administration has, on their Facebook page, dismissed the violence as a “brawl that broke out over a disagreement about the choice of song”, victims and witnesses told Amnesty International the party was over by the time the police arrived. One of the artists said he heard the commanding police officer at the scene accuse the detainees of being OLF supporters. The Prime Minister of Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia H.E.

“It is outrageous that the authorities charged with ensuring the security and safety of members of the public can brutally attack people going about their business with no regard for human life. The Ethiopian authorities must denounce these attacks in the strongest terms and ensure such scenes are not repeated,” said Seif Magango.

The country’s parliamentary elections are due to be held on 29 August 2020.

With Abiy turning Ethiopia into a violent dictatorship, it now appears that winning a Nobel Peace Prize is looking more and more meaningless in Ethiopia.

26,https://allafrica.com/stories/202002240345.html,"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",AllAfrica - Top Africa News,"South Sudan: Citizens Now Hope for Lasting Peace as Kiir, Machar Unite","Ahead of the formation of a unity government on Saturday, South Sudanese have expressed optimism that this time round the peace deal will be honoured by warring parties, bringing an end to years of conflict.

Two years after gaining independence in 2011, President Salva Kiir sacked his then deputy Riek Machar, triggering a civil war in 2013.

Several peace pacts have since been broken and the war-weary citizens hope that the 2018 agreement whose implementation has been delayed many times will now hold.

In a surprise move last weekend, President Kiir announced that he had agreed to revert to 10 states from the 32 he had created, paving the way for the creation of a transitional government of national unity.

The reduction of the number of states was one of key demands by the opposition groups.

On Thursday, Dr Machar met Mr Kiir in Juba ahead of the February 22 deadline where they agreed to form the transitional administration with the President reappointing the former rebel leader as the first vice president on Friday.

Mawut Mabior, a resident of Juba, welcomed the decision to revert to the 10 states, saying it was an act of assurance for peace in South Sudan.

""I expect the unity coalition government to be formed to be a transparent one. A government that will manage the country's resources properly, and in a very transparent manner where the citizens benefit,"" he told The EastAfrican.

A beauty queen of now former Jonglei State, Anyier Malual Leek, said she hoped reconciliation forums would be set up to help reunite the citizens.

""In the past, we have been struggling to have peace and this resolution will help in restoring peace. I now expect the new government of 10 states to come up with peace and reconciliation conferences so that the people are brought together and have access to reconciliation and healing,"" said Ms Leek.

Ajith Awan, a student leader at John Garang Memorial University, urged President Kiir to engage the former governors in the next government. They were rendered jobless by the reduction in the number of states.

""When politicians are redundant, they can cause chaos in communities. The President should engage the recently relieved governors so that they are not left idle to avoid disaster.""

""We as students expect the new transitional government to invest in the education sector by making the 10 percent national budget allocation to the sector a reality,"" said Mr Awan.

Civil society groups have called for a crackdown on corruption and appointment of persons of integrity in government.

Garang David Goch, the chairperson of The Network of Civil Society Organisation in Jonglei, urged President Kiir and Dr Machar to pick peace-loving, transparent and accountable leaders who will deliver services to their people.

""In the next government, we want leaders who are not corrupt, who have not looted their communities, leaders who can deliver service to the locals,"" Mr Goch stressed.

In addition to the 10 states, which the country had at independence, three administrative regions seen as oil-rich have also been formed. They are Abyei, whose border demarcation with Sudan is still a matter of discussion, Ruweng and Greater Pibor.

According to the amendment endorsed by the Council of Ministers, chief administrators of the regions will report to state governor, who reports directly to the Office of the President and First Vice President.

The resolution stated that oil producing states will receive four percent of the revenues with one percent going to the administrative area. But opposition groups argue that the three administrative areas should be part of the states and not be under a separate management.

""The issue of the administrative areas will be solved within four months by the Transitional Government of National Unity,"" the presidency said.","Two years after gaining independence in 2011, President Salva Kiir sacked his then deputy Riek Machar, triggering a civil war in 2013.

Last week the song once again flooded social media, as a group of self-isolating Hollywood A-listers attempted to cheer up a global public facing the worst pandemic in over a century. For some it prompted a renewed appreciation of Lennon's timeless idealism, for others it provided an opportunity to share the story of how Elton John was so bemused by the contrast between the former Beatles' utopian ideals and his luxury lifestyle that he once rewrote the lyrics as ""Imagine six apartments, it isn't hard to do, one is full of fur coats, another's full of shoes"".

The video and anecdote raised a smile at a time when the world is facing its biggest collective health and economic crisis since at least the end of the Second World War. But Lennon's guileless vision of a world at peace is also likely to get trotted out a fair few times in the coming months and years, as political and business leaders first battle with the coronavirus pandemic and then ask how to rebuild the global economy in a way that both guards against another outbreak and enhances prospects and quality of life for a traumatised and insecure world.

UN Secretary General António Guterres has already declared that the world has ""a responsibility to recover better"" than it did after the financial crisis in 2008, arguing the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change should provide the framework for the stimulus packages that are already taking shape. ""We have a framework for action - the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We must keep our promises for people and planet"".

Imagine

As part of this recovery, one of the SDGs that has previously been somewhat sidelined could soon take on a central role. The targets of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16 are not quite as ambitious as those depicted by Lennon, but they are not that far off: tackle all forms of violence, end child abuse and exploitation, promote the rule of law, ensure equal access to justice for all, reduce corruption and bribery, and deliver accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.

It is that last goal - the promise of renewed and effective institutions - that is suddenly in sharp focus, as many of the world's leading economies endure a crash course in how vulnerable many of their institutions have become to global shocks. The absence of a multilateral response to the escalating pandemic is just one of the many distressing aspects of the crisis. As President Trump toys with the idea of scaling back already underpowered health precautions to 'protect the economy' and Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro peddles conspiracy theories, already the call is going out for the global community to seize the opportunity to rejuvenate its battered institutions or risk the war on coronavirus triggering wars of a more conventional kind. What does the Bretton Woods Conference for a world battling coronavirus look like? The hope is that the plea to ""recover better"" can gain traction. The fear is that it won't.

Unless you have good governance, any progress towards goals on healthcare, education, infrastructure, clean energy is going to be fragmentary, short-lived and quite volatile - Matthew Jenkins, Transparency International

All proponents of a particular SDG see it as the cornerstone in the sustainable development hierarchy - and goal 16 is no exception. ""One of the most defining challenges the world faces and development faces is weak governance, poor institutions, lack of rule of law, lack of democracy,"" observes Ulysses Smith, director of the business and rule of law programme at think-tank Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law, who, like most of the experts contributing to this article spoke to BusinessGreen before the coronavirus outbreak escalated into a global pandemic. ""If you don't have the institutional frameworks in place the chances are you're not going to secure the gains that you have. You're going to make progress and backslide.""

""For us, SDG16 is the fundamental one,"" agrees Matthew Jenkins, research coordinator at Transparency International. ""Unless you're able to curb corruption and unless you have good governance, any progress towards goals on healthcare, education, infrastructure, clean energy is going to be fragmentary, short-lived and quite volatile.""

The implications for green businesses and the climate movement are obvious, with supply chain management, climate finance, carbon markets, tariffs, and offsets, and low carbon infrastructure projects just a few of the areas where corruption and a lack of institutional oversight can quickly undermine progress and hamper much needed investment.

Given SDG16's widespread importance, it's sobering to think the goal might not have existed at all. Smith explains that targets on governance and law were the most controversial part of the discussions on the development of the SDGs because they were considered so politically sensitive. ""The fact that goal 16 was included in the final agenda in 2015 in itself was a pretty significant achievement,"" he notes.

But five years on the monitoring framework for SDG16 targets remains inadequate, particularly on governance and corruption, which makes it difficult to measure progress. ""With bribery, there's widespread data gaps all around the world,"" says Jenkins. ""And these issues are politically sensitive so trusting state parties to report accurately how well they're doing is a bit of a leap of faith."" A 2019 report by the Institute for Economics and Peace notes that five of the 12 targets for SDG16 are not currently being measured by any countries at all. Getting authoritarian states to agree to a goal requiring the development of credible justice systems was difficult; getting them to agree to report on progress against that goal appears to be almost impossible.

What we do know is that improvements have been decidedly uneven. According to the UN's 2018 progress report, public authorities are increasingly putting in place regulations to promote public access to information and strengthening institutions upholding human rights at national levels. But many regions continue to suffer as a result of armed conflict or other forms of violence, while there is now a widespread fear that the fallout from the coronavirus crisis could throw what progress there has been into reverse. Democracy and civil rights campaigners are already eyeing some of the emergency powers governments around the world are enacting with considerable nervousness.

Power corrupts

The private sector is also keenly aware of the limited progress on SDG16. Business leaders in more than 100 countries responding to the World Economic Forum's 2017/18 survey said their nation's justice system was not independent of the influence of government, powerful individuals, or businesses. Too often, the dice is loaded.

In Smith's view, many of the fundamental aims of SDG16 are being seriously challenged. ""Whether that's with the populist resurgence, what's happening with Trump and the challenges to the rule of law and good governance that I think he and his party poses, through to what's happening in Poland and Hungary, Turkey and Russia and the Philippines.""

Environmental campaigners in particular have felt the brunt of repressive regimes. A report by Global Witness found that more than three activists were murdered on average each week in 2018, with countless more criminalised for defending their land and the environment.

Even in countries that have traditionally prided themselves on the strength of their national institutions, the rule of law is coming under unprecedented attack. In 2016, one of the UK's most popular and powerful newspapers branded three judges 'Enemies of the People' for ruling that the UK government would require the consent of parliament to give notice of Brexit. Green groups remain hugely concerned that the government's proposed reforms to the judicial review process amount to a power grab that will dilute the ability of civil society to challenge the executive on environmental issues and other matters.

""Five or 10 years ago we might have thought: 'This stuff is on an upward trend. Democracy and good governance are secure',"" reflects Smith. ""But that's not the case. The governments that might have been leading the charge in the past are either absent or sometimes actively undermining it."" Again, the fear is that the pandemic will serve to further accelerate this worrying trend, as various governments with already questionable democratic track records look to further consolidate their power at a time of emergency.

Even before the crisis struck, Smith observed that with too many governments failing to hold the line in defence of SDG16 ""there's a need and an opportunity for businesses to step into the gap"".

While states undoubtedly bear the bulk of the responsibility for delivering on SDG16, the private sector has a vital role to play and a key stake in its success.

At the most basic level, a lack of peace is bad for business, whether that means outright war or interpersonal violence such as murder and slavery. ""Higher levels of violence greatly affect economic development by reducing foreign direct investment and the broader macroeconomic environment,"" states the report by the Institute for Economics and Peace, which estimates the cost to the global economy as $14.1tr - roughly 12 per cent of global GDP - in 2019. ""Business competitiveness and economic productivity are both associated with the most peaceful countries, as is the presence of regulatory systems that are conducive to business operations,"" it adds.

Again, the interconnectedness with climate and environment focused SDGs is obvious. The role of climate impacts and environmental degradation in increasing the risk of conflict is well documented, while delivering low carbon infrastructure and habitat protection in a war zone is all but impossible.

In some cases, private sector organisations can respond directly to violence. In the city of Ciudad Juárez in Mexico's Chihuahua state, which at one point had the world's highest murder rate, a broad coalition of local businesses led calls for a new corporate income tax to pay for security and to fund education schemes.

But for most companies, attention is most usefully focused on the robustness and transparency of regulatory systems. A survey of business leaders by the Bingham Centre found those making decisions about foreign direct investment put the existence of a stable political environments and the rule of law as two of their top three priorities, behind only the ease of doing business.

Jenkins says sustainable development should be a boon to companies. ""What does the private sector need?"" he asks. ""It needs an educated, healthy workforce, it needs good infrastructure, it needs reliable energy sources, and intelligent use of other resources. Most of these are unattainable when schools are affected by corruption, when public procurement processes are ineffective."" Such afflictions also undermine staff morale and productivity, he adds.

Billions of dollars do not reach the target recipients of development money due to bribery - David Croft, global director of sustainability, environment and human rights at RB

The key areas where business can have an influence, says Jenkins, are in tackling corruption and bribery. These fit under target SDG16.4, which seeks to ""significantly reduce illicit financial and arms flows, strengthen the recovery and return of stolen assets and combat all forms of organised crime"".

David Croft, global director of sustainability, environment and human rights for household goods giant RB (formerly Reckitt Benckiser) and chair of Business at the OECD's development committee, says multinationals are already acutely aware of the business risks of these problems, which all serve to dilute investment. ""Billions of dollars do not reach the target recipients of development money due to bribery,"" he warns

And companies are increasingly aware of the legal risks too. The UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the two leading pieces of legislation on this front, both control what companies linked to those two countries do in any other part of the world. ""The penalties are considerable and all multinationals I've worked for take anti-bribery and corruption stuff very seriously,"" says Croft.

Just say no

Croft believes big companies can have a real impact in delivering on SDG16. ""If a multinational says 'I'm not prepared to pay bribes to facilitate an import into a country' - not an uncommon type of activity - then it gives confidence to other companies, to local suppliers, to operate in the same way and they know they have to because we put that into our contractual approaches. Multinationals have the scale to say 'no'; I've seen it happening.""

He says taking such a line can also boost political will to create legislation and tackle underlying problems. ""It starts to enable the scale of tax base in the country to grow,"" Croft continues. ""It means the economy can grow, public services can grow and perhaps public officials are paid a wage that means they don't rely upon bribes.""

Smith concurs. ""Businesses succeed and do well in environments where institutions are strong,"" he agrees. ""That's not to say that there aren't predatory businesses that take advantage of weak institutions - because that's of course true - but the kind of business that we want to promote and that I think most governments would want to welcome into their country are businesses that are not predatory and do well with strong SDGs.""

Jenkins says there is strong evidence that business integrity positively affects the bottom line. ""Healthy competition between companies is hamstrung where there's widespread corruption in the private sector,"" he warns. ""In settings with an operative rule of law where companies have access to justice themselves, in markets in which corruption is less prevalent, we see that aggregate firm performance is better. And when many corporate actors are engaged in corruption then markets in general perform poorly.""

Even for those that are in bed with government, says Jenkins, ""there are less immediately obvious and tangible disadvantages even for companies that on the surface may be benefitting"".

Nevertheless Transparency International warns that grand corruption - the abuse of high-level power - remains a serious problem. Amongst other things, it has found examples where the influence of private interests over public policy is so disproportionate that it frustrates action in critical areas, such as measures to combat climate change or improve healthcare systems. The fear will be that the coronavirus pandemic could amplify this already widespread problem, as vested interests block attempts to engineer a recovery that pushes the global economy towards more sustainable operating models.

'Dirty Money'

The NGO says effort is also specifically needed to tackle a host of problems linked to 'dirty money', such as tax havens, money laundering, and weak due diligence. And it would like to see more transparency globally on beneficial ownership, where the public can see who really owns a company, so as to encourage corporations to become more accountable.

As well as having a critical role in tackling corruption, the private sector relies on an independent judiciary that can apply the law in a dispute in a fair and timely way. ""Businesses need that because they run into those kinds of issues all the time and if they have to worry that a judgment on a contract dispute will take ten or 15 years - which happens in India for example - or if they have to worry that the party leader can call the judge the night before the decision to dictate the outcome, that's not good for business,"" says Smith.

In a 2019 report , the Task Force on Justice - an initiative of UN member states, international organisations, civil society groups, and businesses - concluded individual businesses have little incentive to tackle systemic injustices on their own, but national and international chambers of commerce and other representative bodies can challenge corruption and impunity where they threaten markets or create risks of political instability. Larger corporations, meanwhile, should be interested in the justice needs of their employees and customers, ""recognising the need to build trust within the marketplace and the potential for greater legal inclusion to create new business opportunities"".

As well as benefitting from strong public institutions, businesses play an important role in modelling good governance in their own organisations - a phenomenon that has been much in evidence in the past month as corporates have frequently been ahead of governments in imposing internal policies to restrict travel and limit personal interaction as they quickly recognised the risks associated with the coronavirus outbreak and took steps to try and protect their staff and stakeholders.

Slowly but surely the soft law of the human rights system is being translated into law that multinationals need to be aware of and follow - Ulysses Smith, Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law

The Task Force on Justice also makes a strong case for investment by the private sector in supply chain management, especially when it is at risk of becoming party to the abuse of human rights. ""Many multinational corporations have suffered serious reputational damage when it has been discovered that modern slaves were involved in their supply chains, for example,"" the report states. ""Others have lost customers and seen their share price fall following revelations over their failure to look after workers or their exploitation of natural resources in countries with weak rule of law.""

Again, these are no longer solely reputational risks, but legal ones. Smith notes that human rights rules are crystalling into legislation, such as the UK's ground-breaking Modern Slavery Act, which requires companies above a certain size to produce annual statements setting out what they have done to ensure there is no slavery in their business and, crucially, their supply chains. ""Slowly but surely the soft law of the human rights system is being translated into law that multinationals need to be aware of and follow,"" says Smith. ""And those do reach company activities outside of their own borders.""

The private sector can benefit from these rules too. According to a good practice guide on managing risks associated with modern slavery, produced by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), CDC Group Plc, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the UK Department for International Development (DFID), businesses that invest in social and labour rights ""tend to be more successful and have greater levels of productivity and innovation, more predictable supply of goods and services, better retention and motivation, and more robust due diligence and monitoring systems"".

""How you want your supply chain to function and removing trafficking - particularly children but really it relates to all - is something multinationals are very, very active in and progressively making progress in,"" says Croft. But he stresses that, while the private sector has a role to play because of the influence it has within its value chain, it still needs support from effective government agencies and local rule of law.

Green gains

While parts of the green economy still have relatively immature and flexible supply chains and scrutiny systems, potentially making them vulnerable to practices that run counter to SDG16, such as bribery, corruption, and workforce exploitation, they are also in a position to develop good systems from the ground up. There have been a handful horror stories of tough conditions in clean technology or green farming supply chains, while the any engineering and technology based sector faces continuing question over the environmental and human impacts of rare earth mining. But equally, a sector established first and foremost to drive sustainable development tends to translate its progressive focus on minimising environmental impacts into its wider governance efforts.

And the green economy might have the most to gain from SDG16. ""The benefit is simple,"" says Patrizia Heidegger, director for global policies and sustainability at the European Environmental Bureau. ""Citizens, local communities and employees all need to be in support of private sector practice in order for business not to lose its licence to operate. And the public are more likely to support decisions about the environment when the facts are clear and available for all, when environmental rights are granted and when companies are transparent and accountable.""

Companies, particularly in some high carbon sectors, are also finding themselves the subject of legal action from civil society and even public institutions themselves. Around the world, corporations are increasingly being taken to court for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties relating to climate risks.

ExxonMobil, for example, one of the world's largest oil and gas firms, has faced multiple legal challenges from US states and shareholders who claim it misled investors and the public over the real risks of climate change. And the Philippines' national Commission on Human Rights made a bold statement last year when summarising the findings of its landmark inquiry into climate change, which concluded the world's biggest polluters could potentially be held legally liable for their contributions to global warming.

Climate activists have increasingly used legal action to put pressure on fossil fuel companies

As the increase in climate litigation shows, these are no longer just local or national issues; in an increasingly globalised world, a level international playing field is crucial.

""While European solutions can be trailblazers for solutions at regional or global level, and while we have the power to set high standards that also influence our trading partners, level playing fields - obviously with high standards - are always the better solution,"" says Patrizia Heidegger, director for global policies and sustainability at the European Environmental Bureau.

Trade opportunities

Some academics assert that free trade agreements are one of most useful anti-corruption tools, arguing that free, fair and open international trading systems are essential to the very health of the private sector, but Heidegger is more wary. ""The way the EU negotiates and agrees on new trade agreements is already the opposite of transparent and participatory governance where citizens enjoy access to information,"" she says. ""The secretive negotiations of, for instance, TTIP [the scuppered Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the US and EU] have triggered strong resistance from people who felt bypassed by policy-makers.""

But research by Transparency International finds there is growing consensus around best practice anti-corruption and transparency provisions for inclusion in trade deals, such as explicit references to international anti-corruption conventions, commitments to criminalise active and passive bribery, non-criminal sanctions for firms where they are not subject to criminal liability, and whistleblower protection. Environmental campaigners similarly hope high environmental standards can similarly be embedded in trade deals to advance the adoption of green best practices around the world. It is a vision that is about to be hugely tested as the UK seeks post-Brexit trade deals with the EU and the US, with the government signaling that level-playing field provisions are set to be a major sticking point in the talks.

Transparency International concludes that there is a strong business case for including a range of anti-corruption provisions in trade agreements. However, these still need to be enforced, which requires political will at a national level.

""Corruption is often described as a collective action problem,"" says Jenkins ""It's no-one's first preference. Everyone recognises it's a situation where companies can exploit situations or pay bribes to win contracts is an undesirable situation.""

But he says it is difficult to stick your head above the parapet. ""Increasingly what we are seeing is collective action by businesses, particularly at sector level but also occasionally involving the International Chamber of Commerce and business associations, to try and inculcate a culture in which these things are rejected,"" he explains.

Smith agrees, saying many companies are trying to unify their voices for more transparent and fair regulation and enforcement. He advises the UN Global Compact, a UN body working with businesses around the world to help them align their activities with the SDGs, which is ramping up its work this year. It will shortly begin consulting with businesses around the world about the importance of SDG16 and asking them about concrete ways in which they already support its targets or could do in future. The aim is to have a complete action framework for this SDG by the end of the year.

Croft admits that the relationship between political and private sector spheres does need to be carefully considered. ""If business is too close to the framing of legislation then questions need to be asked,"" he acknowledges. ""But as a whole with SDGs seeing business as a partner is critical if we are to deliver them effectively and in a way that is sustainable. The strength of our economy and private sector in delivering them is critical to their success.""

John Lennon may have baulked at the idea, but Jenkins is optimistic, seeing fewer opportunities for 'SDG washing' with SDG16 than on some other goals. ""Where businesses publicly declare their support for SDG16, with its focus on peace, justice and good governance, I think that is a broadly positive development,"" he says. ""Not least because such affirmations from the business community could potentially spur reform among governments, which are typically more sensitive to the concerns of business groups rather than civil society organisations.""

As the world steps up its response to the worst public health and economic crisis in nearly a century one thing is clear: strong institutions and the pursuit of peace will be more important than ever. And everyone - politicians, businesses, and civil society - has a critical role to play.","Power corruptsThe private sector is also keenly aware of the limited progress on SDG16.

Among his most trenchant and incisive arguments are that the process unwisely did not include the Afghan government (or broader Afghan society) at all; that in the deal the Taliban expressed no remorse or critique of al-Qaida’s 9/11 attacks, or any other jihadi or Salafist violence perpetrated in recent decades; and that the text of the agreement suggests that the U.S. (and thus NATO) troop withdrawal will happen with or without a broader deal on power-sharing between the Taliban and other Afghan actors, including the government of President Ashraf Ghani. I am grateful for Bruce’s blunt warnings around how badly this process could play out. His admonition about the importance of avoiding an agreement like the shameful Paris Peace Accords that ended the U.S. role in the Vietnam War is welcome.

For all the reasons Bruce delineates, it would be a major mistake to get too excited about what has been agreed to date. Thankfully, no one is talking about Nobel prizes, even in jest, and I do not believe the deal should be viewed as a major foreign policy accomplishment of the Trump administration. Moreover, the substantive challenges involved in reaching a follow-on, Phase Two accord between the Taliban and a broad range of Afghan actors including the government are enormous. Both sides believe they are in effect the legitimate rulers of the entire country, and both will thus surely want to keep their own security forces while overseeing the dismantlement of the other’s. As a wealth of academic literature also shows, this kind of civil war is especially hard to resolve (see a recent piece by my colleague Vanda Felbab-Brown for useful comparative context).

Still, there are reasons for hope. Perhaps the Phase One deal can be at least a baby step forward — even if the hard work, we can all agree, still remains to be done. As Bruce notes, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper (and also Secretary of State Mike Pompeo) have publicly interpreted the deal to mean that the U.S. departure from Afghanistan is, in their view, conditional rather than not automatic.

Admittedly, there is ambiguity on this point in the actual agreement. But perhaps the ambiguity can be used constructively to push the Ghani government to offer real concessions on power-sharing. (By the way, I might suggest making Chief Executive of Afghanistan’s Unity Government Abdullah Abdullah the lead negotiator for the government and broader Afghan political and civil society in future talks with the Taliban).

Make no mistake: There is no moral equivalence between the Taliban and the other side of the bargaining table. The former have a horrible history of violence, misogyny, barbarity, and self-righteousness. The latter include some corrupt actors, but also many good and brave people. All the more reason, however, why Ghani and others on his side may resist real compromise. In that event, stalemate or breakdown of the talks is the predictable result.

So, we may as well try to make a virtue out of the Phase One deal’s weaknesses, and use the uncertainty about our own long-term commitment to Afghanistan to prod both sides to compromise. Let me be clear that I do not prefer this approach. (Nor do I prefer the terms for the preemptive release of thousands of Taliban prisoners.) However, given the unwillingness of President Trump (like President Obama before him) to commit to the mission over a longer term, this kind of ambiguity may be the best we can hope for right now. Related Content Policy 2020 5,000 Troops for 5 years Good deals — and bad ones — with the Taliban Order from Chaos After the US-Taliban deal, what might negotiations between the Taliban and Afghan side look like?

Let me finish by reiterating the kinds of elements that Brookings President John R. Allen, Saad Mohseni, and I wrote about last week as essential to any successful overall peace plan for Afghanistan. To me, since the February 29 agreement does not directly contradict any of these core principles, it is still possible that it could prove a useful if small step forward on the way to the hard part: the Phase Two accord that the Afghan government as well as teammates will now begin to attempt with the Taliban.

The Taliban must stop trying to control who on the government side they negotiate with, and accept the legitimacy of the other party, even as President Ghani also promised an inclusive negotiating team on the government side that transcended his own finite presidential term;

Many foreign forces should not leave until a peace deal is reached and then implemented over a period of at least a couple years, allowing the foreign forces to remain in a strategic overwatch role (it is very doubtful foreign forces would return to enforce a deal once a withdrawal was complete, so timing would be crucial);

NATO’s departure might be succeeded by an international U.N. peacekeeping force that, while not mandated to impose peace through force of arms, could help monitor an accord as a way of determining if the future government should continue to receive international aid as promised. Other foreign specialists working in areas of development would also have to be allowed sustained access to the country;

Not only human and gender and religious rights, but elections of some sort together with protections for free speech, must be part of any future Afghan political system. The Taliban should not be allowed simply to rule the country by force or to muzzle core elements of the new Afghan democracy; and

Rather than dismantle either the Taliban’s fighting forces or the current Afghan army and police, any peace accord should allow them all to remain intact (and be paid). Over time, they could gradually be brought under regional coordination commands that deconflicted their respective roles, rather than integrating them quickly or requiring one side or the other to disband.

While it is true that the 14-month time horizon for the complete departure of foreign troops is at odds with the second bullet point above, perhaps a U.N. force can help ensure compliance thereafter, by monitoring the behavior of various parties and only approving ongoing foreign assistance if the Taliban sticks to its deal. Ideally, that time horizon can be stretched out if negotiations hit the roadblocks that they almost inevitably soon will. For one thing is perhaps clear above all others: This process, even if it can somehow be successful (and the odds are admittedly against it), is just beginning, and the hard part is still to come.","In a separate Brookings piece, my colleague Bruce Riedel is devastating and almost completely convincing in his critique of the Phase One deal of the U.S.-Taliban peace process.

Almost 50 years ago, the Nobel prize committee sent a strong signal to the world, underpinning the social value of agriculture. Norman Borlaug (1914-2009) – the father of the so-called “green revolution”, a scientist who invented disease-resistant wheat and saved millions from starvation – was awarded with the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970.

During the Oslo ceremony, Borlaug held a speech about his work, titled “The Green Revolution, Peace and Humanity”.

“Civilization as it is known today”, he stated, “could not have evolved, nor can it survive, without an adequate food supply. (…) If you desire peace, cultivate justice, but at the same time cultivate the fields to produce more bread.”

Today, half a century after the Nobel Prize, similar questions still prevail more than ever. Food security and water management are increasingly understood as key concerns for global governance and stability. Against this backdrop, it is timely that the 2020 Munich Security Conference (MSC), which just came to an end, dealt with the topic of food security for the first time in its long history.

During the conference, I joined our CEO Werner Baumann as well as the member of our Supervisory Board and former President of the World Food Programme Ertharin Cousin, in some of the food security conversation. We received great feedback, e.g. from David Beasley, Executive Director for the UN World Food Programme.

As a leader in agriculture, we are starting to get our arms around the scale of Bayer’s responsibility. Just to give you one example: Almost half of all fungicides for wheat in Europe, the Middle East and Africa are Bayer products. They are essential for avoiding crop failures with wide-ranging consequences. Wheat is – and has historically been – at the center of agricultural goods when we talk about global crises.

The discussions in Munich have left me thinking about the need for next steps. Here are some of my immediate take-aways:

Climate Change is the most significant threat to food security which will in turn become a major security risk.

My first point is that climate change is by far the biggest threat to food security. That comes with no surprise but with a lot of evidence. 2020, for the first time ever, the top five risks in the annual World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report were all climate-related. Near-term impacts of climate change add up, as the report says, to a “planetary emergency that will include loss of life and social and geopolitical tensions”.

For example, 93% of the climate security and military experts surveyed in the recent World Climate and Security Report assess that climate-driven water insecurity will pose a significant or higher risk to global security by 2030. Other studies emphasized the impact of climate change on migration or on crop insecurity.

Munich and Davos meetings are setting the agenda—but we need to engage with farmers on the ground. We aim to support 100 million smallholders to lead better lives.

While many discuss the climate-related issues from a 30,000 feet airplane-perspective, farmers can tell from looking at their fields. In 2019 alone, they had to deal with another dry summer in Europe, historic rainfalls in the United States, a massively destructive drought in Australia or parts of Africa, and locust infestations in East-Africa.

Last December, we presented our new sustainability strategy at Bayer. Beginning this year, sustainable business and financial success is equally important to us. Ten years ahead, in 2030, we want to achieve our ambitious sustainability goals in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations.

One of the key elements is our focus on smallholder and subsistence farmers, a key group when it comes to strengthening global food security. 550 million smallholder farms exist all over the world and in developing countries, they produce about 80 percent of available food supplies–but in many cases, the producers themselves face hunger and poverty.

By 2030, we strive to provide 100 million smallholder farmers with access to training, tailored agricultural solutions and partnerships to increase their harvests and improve the local food supply. Most of the smallholder farming responsibilities rest on the shoulders of women. 25 years after the first UN Women Conference in Beijing, the world needs to prioritize significant efforts to improve women’s livelihoods in rural areas.

Our work has already begun:

My third take-away: Innovation will be key to feed the world of 10 billion people.

Another take-away is (once more) the importance of innovation: To secure food supply in a world growing to 10 billion and increasingly affluent people whilst we will be hit by an increasing impact of climate change, it will take the brightest minds and the smartest technologies to ensure we feed the world without starving the planet. My colleague Bob Reiter and his team are stewards of the by far largest R&D budget of an agri-business in history.

They are working passionately on future innovation for a more sustainable agriculture. Over the past few days, they have published fascinating insights into our innovation pipeline that are relevant to investors as well as the public. Achievements like hybrid rice or the short stature corn will have tremendous value for global food security. At Bayer, we are committed to make these innovations available for all growers, including access programs for smallholder farmers.

Lastly: Collaboration is the name of the game

As so often, it’s about the right mindset. We must agree that the global environmental, health and nutritional challenges we face today are complex, significant and inter-connected. No one country, multilateral institution or company can solve this challenge alone. As my colleague Ronald Guendel pointed out: “Collaboration is the name of the game when it comes to food security”.

In the run-up for the 2021 UN Food Systems Summit, we need to form new partnerships that enable us to work across existing conflict lines to de-carbonize agriculture, support farmers to better withstand extreme weather events, and tackle the extreme poverty in rural areas.

When it comes to food security, as the Australian author Julian Cribb phrased it in his recently released book “Food or War”:

“Food is one of the greatest, least recognized and most affordable ‘weapons of peace’ available to humanity.”

Or in the famous words of Lord John Boyd Orr (1880-1971), who became the first director-general of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN back in 1945:

“You can’t build peace on empty stomachs.”

Engaging in an honest, respectful and constructive debate about the challenges towards a more sustainable development strategy is the type of leadership expected from our generation. And it’s our joint responsibility to achieve the SDGs in 2030. To get there, we have less than #120months – 119 actually, and the clock is ticking.

30,https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/03/05/the-us-taliban-peace-deal-a-road-to-nowhere/,"Thu, 05 Mar 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Brookings Institution,The US-Taliban peace deal: A road to nowhere,"My colleagues here at Brookings have written artfully about the pros and cons of the recent U.S.-Taliban peace deal, and the overall outlook for Afghanistan. I agree with much of their analysis, all of which is rooted in their deep expertise on the issue at hand.

Having led all U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan from 2011-13, I have my own perspective on this agreement, which is grounded in practical, lived experience. As I’ve said publicly, the Taliban are untrustworthy; their doctrine is irreconcilable with modernity and the rights of women; and in practice, they’re incapable of summoning the necessary internal controls and organizational discipline needed to implement a far-flung agreement like this. The so-called “Agreement for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan” will not only not be honored by the Taliban, it will also not bring peace.

While others have written more comprehensively on the overall agreement, here, I’ll express my specific misgivings over a number of points.

The U.S. committed to a significant number of measurable commitments. The Taliban did not.

From a specific departure deadline to a series of diplomatic and legal obligations, U.S. negotiators have provided in detail exactly what they intend to do in order to fulfill their end of the bargain. All of this was done — seemingly — to create an environment in which the Taliban felt the U.S. was operating clearly and in good faith.

Yet, the Taliban in turn have been obligated to very little that can be measured in any meaningful sense. Vagaries about ongoing negotiations with the Afghan government or the broad intent to keep Afghanistan safe from those who would collude with the Taliban against the U.S. and allied interests — these are not measurable, nor are they enforceable. And why would we ever believe the Taliban would now break with al-Qaida et al, when under the hammer blows of 150,000 coalition troops and hundreds of thousands of Afghan security personnel, they wouldn’t.

That’s not only my view, it’s also what Taliban leaders are saying informally outside the negotiating halls. Without a specific verification and enforcement mechanism, aspirational Taliban commitments will be impossible to address, and local incidents of violence will be chalked-up to rogue elements of the group. It’s also worth remembering that the number two in the Taliban — Sirajuddin Haqqani, recently published by the New York Times — orchestrated the introduction of the lead elements of al-Qaida into the war against the Soviet Union. These connections run deep and are not likely to be given up at precisely the moment the U.S. is leaving Afghanistan.

The U.S. and Taliban committed to intra-Afghan talks. Ongoing violence prevents these from occurring.

The official U.S.-Taliban deal details a number of talks that would continue well into the future between the U.S., Taliban, and the government of Afghanistan. And yet, ongoing violence, especially against innocent civilian communities, largely negates the value in these discussions. Just on schedule, the Taliban are attacking the Afghan government while supposedly not attacking the U.S. and our allies. Why would the U.S. commit to an agreement where the Taliban could conclude that the U.S. and its coalition partners would be immune from attack, but the U.S. would be sanguine about the Taliban attacking our principal ally in this war, the Afghan government? On its face alone, the Afghan government would be hard-pressed to find a good, logical reason to meet amidst ongoing attacks. These activities by the Taliban are the very definition of bad-faith behavior, and with the U.S. departing, the government of Afghanistan will have significantly less power and authority to hold the Taliban accountable, and to enter into talks on an even remotely equal footing.

In such an environment, the entire premise of intra-Afghan peace talks is called into question and is potentially rendered useless. We’ve seen this before in Afghanistan and elsewhere: In the time between commitments to limit or cease violence and the final implementation of agreements, violence may spike as one side or the other seeks to change the facts on the ground to achieve relative advantage ahead of formal compliance. No one should be surprised the Taliban is attacking Afghan government forces. The U.S.-Taliban agreement left them no incentive not to, so of course we’re already bombing the Taliban in Helmand Province.

Furthermore, there’s very limited capacity for the Taliban to control violence themselves, even if they wanted to.

From my own experience, the Taliban are too decentralized and too diverse a group to meaningfully control themselves. Over and over during Eid ceasefires, while the Taliban crowed about its capacity to demonstrate control over violence, innocent Afghan civilian were killed and injured by the hundreds. One could be negotiating directly with the Quetta Shura or Peshawar Shura Taliban, and still you would have field commanders making independent decisions absent any ongoing “official” discussions or agreements. Too often we treat this group as one homogeneous entity when in fact it is a loose conglomeration of local tribal leadership, independent warlords, and disconnected or siloed cells. Any argument that the Taliban can control violence in the long-term is a fantasy.

The current deal obligates the Afghan government to release 5,000 Taliban fighters by March 10. Yet, in almost every instance, a mass release is immediately followed by an uptick in violence.

To be clear, if the United States was not willing to take a stance on behalf of Afghan women’s rights (more on that later), it had no business negotiating away the Afghan government’s prerogatives on releasing 5,000 hardened Taliban fighters. These 5,000 are in Afghan government hands because they’re killers. Killers of Afghan security forces, but much worse, killers of innocent Afghan civilians.

It should follow, then, that this aspect of the agreement has gone down hard with the Ghani government, which should instead have been supported by the U.S. government in making the decision themselves, especially given the likelihood that these individuals will be found on the frontlines within days of their release. This is a critical flaw in the deal, and I was unsurprised to learn that President Ashraf Ghani announced his refusal to release these prisoners within 24 hours of the deal’s signing. If these prisoners are to be released, it should come at the satisfactory conclusion of the intra-Afghan talks, not as a precondition by the Taliban to their talking with the Afghan government, and certainly not at the beginning of the talks.

Finally, and most importantly, the U.S. failed to establish an internationally acceptable minimum standard for the rights of women.

When asked about the U.S. position on this vital matter in the context of the U.S.-Taliban negotiations, American officials dismissed there being an American role in guaranteeing the rights of Afghan women, suggesting this should be left to the Afghans to sort out. The position of women in Afghanistan is today, such as it is, precisely the result of the U.S. and coalition involvement, and never could have emerged to this degree without the courageous stands by Afghan women activists, as well as our remaining steadfastly committed over the last two decades to women’s rights.

It’s utterly absurd to believe the Afghan government and Taliban will ever find an outcome for Afghan women consistent with our values. For the U.S. to have concluded this agreement without a clear statement of our expectation for the rights of women is an abandonment of our principles and the very reason we fought so long and so hard. Simply, to leave the fate of Afghan women to the intra-Afghan dialogue is a massive abdication of American and international responsibility to support universal human rights. We should all be very clear on something: The Taliban will never accord Afghan women the respect and the place in the future Afghan society that they deserve. For the U.S. government to believe otherwise is either the height of naïveté, or the willful abandonment of these women, or both.

If there’s one thing that always comes to mind for me when thinking about my service in Afghanistan, it’s the faces of the women and young girls, many of whom were able to go to school for the first time and lifted themselves out of poverty as a result. The Taliban would seek to destroy that progress and reverse it. Indeed, the Taliban and their allies endorse a form of Islam with results that deprive women of any meaningful rights as we understand and enjoy them in the year 2020 — among them the right to an education and the freedom to pursue their own wants and interests, such as, for example, the legal profession. To think that once the U.S. and the coalition depart Afghanistan the Taliban will undergo some form of humanitarian metamorphosis and doctrinal epiphany is, frankly, ridiculous.

With familiar bombast, we’re being told not to worry — that if the Taliban violate the terms of this agreement, the U.S. will come roaring back into Afghanistan with overwhelming force. But to do what? Fight the Taliban ourselves? Reinforce the Afghan security forces? And how many innocent Afghans will have died in the meantime over this failed experiment in peacemaking? From an administration that has, in the last six months, abandoned the Kurds in Syria and undercut the Palestinians, it’s hard to imagine an American strategic counterattack into Afghanistan when the Taliban inevitably violate the terms of this agreement, but only just enough to harm the Afghans, and not enough to necessitate the redeployment of our U.S. armed forces.

The Taliban know what year it is, and they know the U.S. forces will be coming out ahead of the U.S. presidential election. They’re wagering that this administration, which seeks to point to this agreement in the months ahead as evidence of keeping a campaign promise, will be extremely reluctant to walk away from this agreement or come back in over local violations. They have the U.S. exactly where they’ve wanted us, but to where they couldn’t maneuver previous administrations. The Taliban are many things: drug dealers, violent abusers of women, and terrorists. But there’s one thing they are not: stupid.","My colleagues here at Brookings have written artfully about the pros and cons of the recent U.S.-Taliban peace deal, and the overall outlook for Afghanistan.
The so-called “Agreement for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan” will not only not be honored by the Taliban, it will also not bring peace.
The official U.S.-Taliban deal details a number of talks that would continue well into the future between the U.S., Taliban, and the government of Afghanistan.
And yet, ongoing violence, especially against innocent civilian communities, largely negates the value in these discussions.
The U.S.-Taliban agreement left them no incentive not to, so of course we’re already bombing the Taliban in Helmand Province."

(March 3, 2020) — Since 1961, more than 240,000 U.S. citizens have served the global community as Peace Corps volunteers — living and working alongside local leaders to create change. Now, the University of Kentucky campus community can discover the benefits of Peace Corps service from those who have returned from service.

On Wednesday, March 4, the International Center will host an information session as part National Peace Corps week, which celebrates the initiation of the Peace Corps by John F. Kennedy on March 1, 1961. The session will take place at 4 p.m. in Room 202 of the Stuckert Career Center and will include a panel of returning Peace Corps volunteers (RPCVs) and Peace Corps recruiter, Carlos Jean Baptiste.

The Peace Corps is a service opportunity for motivated change-makers to immerse themselves in a community abroad. Volunteers work hand in hand with local professionals and leaders to tackle the most pressing challenges being faced by the community and current generations.

During this information session, Baptiste will give an overview of the Peace Corps, and the RPCVs will host a Q&A to talk about their experiences in the service and how to join. The volunteer panel will consist of Madison Batt (RPCV Uganda), Jessica Byassee (RPCV Tanzania), Spencer Cruse (RPCV Uganda), Rona Roberts (RPCV Philippines) and Angene Wilson (RPCV Liberia).

“My experience as a Peace Corps volunteer was the most important transformational moment in my life,” Russell E. Morgan Jr., a RPCV, said. “These first-hand experiences gave me a glimpse of the need for public health improvements in developing communities and served as an underpinning of education and economic growth.”

This spring, UK launched the Peace Corps Prep program, which offers a certificate program for undergraduate students to develop skills in foreign language proficiency, intercultural competence and leadership. The program prepares students to become engaged, global citizens as Peace Corps volunteers or professionals in international development.

“Peace Corps service can be the first step toward a career or the continuation of a life’s work by sharpening existing skills or being challenged with new opportunities,” Craig Borie, director of Peace Corps Prep, said. “Peace Corps service benefits include unique opportunities to help others as part of a community, work for the world, learn a new language or improve language skills and grow as a person.”

Since 1961, UK has sent 346 UK graduates to serve in the Peace Corps in one of the following sectors: education, health, environment, agriculture, youth in development and community economic development.

Mar 2 2020 - A succession of meetings over the last two months in Berlin, Geneva and Munich has signified a renewed multilateral effort to resolve the Libyan civil conflict. With 13 nations led by the UN, seeking to enforce a brittle arms embargo and comprehensive cease-fire, the concerned parties have been seeking to resolve the rivalry between the UN-recognized administration based in the capital of Tripoli and the country’s western regions with the backing of Turkey, Qatar and Italy, and the rival eastern-based government led by General Khalifa Haftar, with the support of Egypt, France, Russia and other states.



While recent diplomatic efforts have produced a 55-point road map to resolve the conflict, a potential conflict resolution is still very much dependent on the complex interplay between internal and external actors and the willingness of all parties to observe the tentative internationally-led peace effort. With the humanitarian situation in Libya deteriorating due to the country’s contracting economy, a robust peaceful solution is urgently needed.

Libya as a proxy in foreign powers’ interplay

Nine years after the initial outbreak of violence against the regime of Muammar Al-Qaddafi, Libya is still at war, marred with the refugee and migrant crises, internal strife between opposing militias, haunted by Islamist groups, and unable to govern its own territory. In addition to an over-inflated narrative of Al-Qaddafi’s prominent role in inciting violence in 2011, the aftermath of the NATO intervention in Libya[i] left a jarring environment of tribal, ethnic, religious and ideological violence that had a negative spill-over effect on the neighboring countries, the most prominent example being the case of Mali in 2013.

The 2012 parliamentary elections were initially seen as a promising development. With the turn-up rate higher than 60 percent, the elections brought to office a moderate, secular coalition government despite persistent instances of violence across the country. However, since mid-2014, the country has seen the rise and progression of two parallel governing systems, one based in Tobruk, controlling the Libyan National Army (LNA), the other based in Tripoli with the international endorsement and support of the UN and external allies, further complicating the already byzantine political landscape of post-uprising Libya.

As one of the key markers of the conflict, tribal violence has gone unaddressed under Al-Qaddafi and further exacerbated in the post-uprising Libya. While this item took a backseat on the agenda of the recent internationally-brokered peace talks, this issue remains crucial to tackling the country’s peaceful power-sharing. The inability of the dual government to impose a monopoly on violence has been further perpetuated by the 2013 Political Isolation Law, which came as an attempt to prevent members of the Qaddafi regime from holding public office during the country’s transition to peace and stable power-sharing. Moreover, most of the militias across the country have been paid by one of the two rival governments despite failed attempts to incorporate them in the budding, but still weak, national security forces. This is in addition to a massive number of weapons still in possession of private individuals.

Marginalized in the peace talks, one impeding factor that cannot be ignored is the rising influence of radical Islamists, including various branches of ISIS), aided by larger regional movements. Such groups have actively worked to undermine any progress toward peace, as stabilization is not in their interest. One particularly (unclear) has been garnering support from the local population by undertaking charity work, especially for martyrs’ families. They have positioned themselves as worthy challengers by providing socio-economic assistance where the government had previously failed. As a consequence, the Islamist agenda is becoming more attractive for Libyans, begging the question of potential legitimacy of either of the two competing governments in any post-conflict scenario.

Post-2011, the deep-seated tribal divisions that had been utilized by the Qaddafi regime have been left untouched, which has opened a Pandora’s box of difficulties for consolidating any power-sharing mechanisms and establishing peace. The tribe-state relations in Libya have been historically fluid, pragmatic and opportunistic, and the marginalization has reinforced the co-optation of some tribes, but contended to threaten the exclusion of others. The downside of tribal involvement in security provision is that protection is offered in selective manner, reproducing politics of co-optation and exclusion at local level.

The 2011 uprising led to a Libyan polity that was able to remove Qaddafi from power, yet remained short of addressing the tribe-government nexus, which was later swallowed by a vortex of militias, extremist groups and external players. This conundrum was furthered by the NATO intervention in Libya and the intense involvement of external forces in the country’s civil war, a factor that marks the conflict even today and continues to be one of the greatest impediments to any serious peace negotiation. As an antithesis to any on-ground progression toward peace, the role of external forces further complicates the situation in the country by internationalizing its conflict without tackling its domestic drivers.

The UN has been involved in the country since the beginning of the Libyan revolt in 2011. Following the NATO intervention in Libya, the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), established in September of the same year, became the primary international body seeking reconciliation between various revolutionary groups. Egypt and Russia have steadily supported the House of Representatives in Tobruk in efforts to drive other groups out of Benghazi and Eastern Libya, according to some reports, while Turkey, Qatar and Sudan have supported the Tripoli-based government.

Ongoing efforts to resolve the conflict

Despite several meetings that have taken place and those that are scheduled in the old continent, the short- and medium-term future of Libya continues to hang on a thread. As the first meeting between Libya’s warring sides since early 2018, the Berlin conference failed to produce fruitful and credible results. The sequel, seen in the Munich Security Conference held in early February, merely addressed the failures of its predecessor. The most recent Geneva talks failed to even include the warring sides. These failures, especially the inability to stop the supply of weapons to various factions in Libya, indicate a lack of credible commitment by both local and international actors toward any sustainable peace efforts.

Following the latest peace effort in Geneva, the next meeting is scheduled for early March in Rome, though it remains uncertain which of the parties will attend. While the unprecedented frequency of high-level meetings indicates renewed global interest in resolving the conflicts in Libya, these platforms have also been used as an extension of proxy confrontations among various sides. For instance, the European Union has, thus far, used the UN arms embargo on Libya to cease its Operation Sophia and launch Operation EU Active Surveillance. In parallel, Turkey has used the very same political vacuum to send fighters from Syria to Libya.

These high-level discussions have largely contributed to the marginalization of previously-mentioned local processes within Libya, thereby undermining the efforts of local actors to maintain their step-by-step approach to forging the country’s peaceful future. Ensuring that no external party further complicates the on-ground conundrum has proven to be virtually impossible. In the short-term, the international community needs to work on establishing credibility and trust in order for all sides to step away from armed conflict. And in the long-term, all parties involved have to diligently and collectively work on securing a permanent cessation of hostilities as both a necessary and a sufficient condition for the resumption of Libya’s dormant political process.

The urgent need for a negotiated solution is compounded by Libya’s rapidly deteriorating economic situation, with a contributory factor in the UN’s prediction that more than 900,000 people in the country will be in need of some form of humanitarian assistance in 2020. Perhaps the right solution lies beyond regularly meeting and talking peace with the warring sides, in their presence or otherwise.

Competing external and internal factions

In an interplay between domestic forces and international actors, eastern Libya ports, controlled by the Libyan National Army (LNA) under the command of Khalifa Haftar, have shut down oil exports, resulting in national crude output being cut by more than half ahead of the Berlin summit. In addition, of the build-up to the Munich follow-up conference held on February 16-17, a period of calm was overshadowed by high-level discussions on the future of the UN arms embargo on Libya and the complicating factor of Turkish troops being deployed in the war-torn country.

As the first meeting between the warring sides since 2018, the Berlin summit left a bitter aftertaste for both the LNA Chief, Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, and the Prime Minister of the GNA, Fayez al-Sarraj. In January 2020, as many as 11 world leaders and both warring sides of the Libyan conflict walked away with a diluted pledge to cease the flow of weapons into Libya and a promise to form a five-by-five military council to negotiate a ceasefire in the near future. In the event, the Munich follow-up meetings produced similar results to the most recent Geneva talks.

In the post-Berlin period, the international community has maintained its focus on the conflict-torn Libya despite the tensions and conflicting interests that undermined the negotiations in Geneva.

The renewed efforts to seek a solution have been galvanized by Turkey’s direct military intervention in the conflict. Even as Berlin prepared for the meeting, the UN called for an end to foreign intervention in Libya. Yet Turkey announced in January that it is sending troops to Libya in support of the GNA. The decision was backed by the deployment of hundreds of Syrian fighters to bolster the GNA forces’ efforts, envisioned to work in tandem with the Turkish forces. Around the time of the Munich conference, however, additional reports surfaced that Turkey sent fighters to fight in Libya, a move that underscored the extent to which the government led by Recep Tayyip Erdogan was prepared to disregard the UN-led principle of non-involvement. Although Erdogan stated that Turkish forces were involved in Libya for training purposes only, the intervention suggests that Turkey wishes to further assert its power in the Eastern Mediterranean in order to overcome its relative diplomatic isolation following recent agreements between Greece, Cyprus, Egypt and Israel on exploring local hydrocarbons reserves.

The announcement served as a prelude to ceasefire negotiations and a mini-summit between the GNA, supported by Turkey, Qatar and Italy, and the LNA, supported by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, France and Russia, that took place on January 13 in Moscow, reflecting the fact that Russia increasingly sees Libya as one of the focal points of its interest in the region. President Vladimir Putin’s interest in the conflict stems from his ambition to assert Russia’s interests in the Mediterranean as part of a strategic push-and-pull with the Western powers and a conviction that Russia’s status necessitates a say in the outcome of the Libyan civil war. However, the January talks in Moscow prematurely ended when Haftar requested more time for consideration, subsequently leaving Russia without a concrete agreement and signaling to Moscow and other capitals that Haftar’s objectives might greatly differ from their agendas.

With no concrete steps on the horizon, the reiteration of the urgency of obtaining peace in Libya was at the heart of the Munich debate. Despite the fact that the Berlin summit hosted all the key players of the Libyan conflict, including the Arab League and the African Union in an attempt to prevent the marginalization of Libya’s immediate neighbours, the ultimate conclusion did not progress from previous efforts. Moreover, the voices of both the Arab League and the African Union have gone unheard amid renewed tensions and the latest spill of weapons into Libya, despite prominent statements from the region repeatedly seeking consensus-based political arrangements.

The unofficial ceasefire declared by Turkey and Russia, who support the GNA and Haftar respectively, has reduced active fighting to Libya’s capital since it went into force on January 12; however, no official document detailing the ceasefire has been signed. Under the auspices of the UN special envoy for Libya, Ghassan Salame, Germany was hoping to finalize a political roadmap agreement during the Berlin summit in Europe’s latest and most concrete attempt to stabilize Libya; however, no concrete follow-up has been negotiated as of February 27th.

Viable future avenues

While the UN is seeking a step away from foreign interference in Libya, focusing on transforming the unofficial ceasefire into an official agreement with monitoring and separation of rival groups and repositioning of heavy weapons, the most recent wave of geopolitical focus on Libya paints a different picture. Turkey has sent troops to Libya, followed by a Russian-led ceasefire negotiation that was left open-ended, as a prelude to the Berlin summit and Europe’s increased involvement in Libya’s future. In negotiating the ceasefire and Libya’s post-conflict peace landscape, efforts to build a new Libya should take into account the country’s strong tribal character and should look into integrating tribal forces in a manner that favors the central state project while simultaneously allowing for true representation and inclusion of all local and tribal entities.

In the long-term, an improvement of the current situation in Libya is direly needed, especially in terms of the rule of law, the socio-economic sector; and infrastructure. Politically, such a leap toward peace could be achieved through federalism and a step-by-step approach in addressing the country’s system of dual governance and underlying tribal issues, that could further aid both national and international efforts in containing armed opposition and re-securing entire Libya’s territory.

Ultimately, securing Libya’s peace process will be a tedious and fickle process. The international community and the parties to the conflict have to stick to the step-by-step approach to tackling each issue that is undermining the credibility of actors and viability of a peaceful status quo. In the short-term, all sides will have to jointly and in good faith work on establishing and maintaining the credibility of intention and trust. In concrete terms, abiding by the UN arms embargo on Libya may not necessitate the cessation of other measures, which is what the EU had done with Operation Sophia to launch Operation EU Active Surveillance. This will also demand greater involvement by other parties as well, which have thus far been seen as marginal to the negotiations, including the African Union, with a stronger pledge to adhere to the UN embargo. In the long-run, such efforts will ensure a permanent cessation of hostilities within Libya along with a greater degree of certainty of not reverting to lawlessness.

The meeting aimed at fostering a wider discussion around the respective conflicts and create more effective strategies for defending the rights of those affected.

Georgian doctor Vazha Gaprindashvili was imprisoned for 50 days in South Ossetia for supposedly crossing the border illegally. He said that this was a tactic Russia used to intimidate Georgian citizens.

“There were four other detainees in Tskhinvali prison with me for crossing the border illegally; later the number increased to six,” he recalled. “One Georgian citizen, Bestaev, was sentenced to two years for illegally crossing the border, which he struggled to understand because he actually lives at the border. He was taken to prison from his home and could not prove that he did not break any laws.

“I think that these arrests are intended to intimidate people and impede direct person-to-person communication, because in general, there are more Ossetians crossing the so-called border than Georgians, and in private conversation all of them say that they want to restore the relationships they had [before the wars],” Gaprindashvili concluded.

Ukrainian film maker Oleg Sentsov spent five years in detention after being handed a 20-year sentence for planning terrorist acts. He was released in a 2019 prisoner swap.

Sentsov stressed that the problem of those held illegally by Russia was not widely enough known.

“I started a hunger strike because I wanted to attract the attention of the international community about the other prisoners who were kept in detention with me,” he continued. “There was always enough attention paid to me, but as for other detainees they lacked it and I realised that I should do something to draw more public attention.

“At the time of my detention there were about 64 Ukrainians detained and since then 35 were released. Today, there are about 100 prisoners, 76 of them are Crimean Tatars. We have never stopped speaking up for these people at every international level,” Sentsov said.

Other speakers at the February 21 discussion, moderated by IWPR contributor Temur Kiguradze, included Norwegian ambassador Helene Sand Andresen and Ukrainian envoy Ilhor Dolhov.

“I think human rights defenders and journalists should be able to carry out their work without threat to themselves and their families,” Andresen said. “It should go without saying, but unfortunately today that's not the case. We understand that pointing out these failures is difficult and controversial in many places but nowhere is it more so than in areas where international monitoring mechanisms have no access, in occupied territories, in places like South Ossetia, Abkhazia, Crimea, and Donbas.”

Dolhov noted the challenges shared by both his country and Georgia after so many years of conflict.

“I believe that today’s gathering will bring us closer to the understanding that to win we have to be strong, we have to be strong as a people, Ukrainians and Georgians, and strong as states, as Georgia and Ukraine,” Dolhov said.

Levan Asatiani, senior campaigner for Amnesty International in the South Caucasus, said that it was vital for Europe to coordinate with its Georgian and Ukrainian partners when it came to relations with Russia.

“Georgia and Ukraine will not be able to deal with Russia alone on issues like the release of prisoners,” he said. “Kyiv and Tbilisi must actively cooperate with western states and institutions and use all their pressure on Russia to ensure the protection of human rights in the occupied territories. There must be a unity between European states as well in relation to Russia’s politics and the facts of human rights violations in the territories occupied by Russia.”","The plight of the hundreds of Georgian and Ukrainians illegally held by Russia was highlighted at an IWPR event in Tbilisi addressed by former detainees themselves.

Since independent India in 1947, North East India has been witnessing a bewildering line-up of insurgencies gripping states such as Nagaland, Mizoram Manipur, Assam, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya. Even after several ceasefire agreements and SoO or Suspension of Operation Agreements, there are at least over 50 armed outfits operating in the North East region with their presence in the upper Sagaing region of Myanmar. Out of these, at least eight are separatist organisations. It must be said that the Naga insurgency which first took birth as ‘Naga hostiles’ is without a doubt, the ‘mother’ of insurgencies in the region.

Fortunately, the hostilities with most of the Naga armed groups have ended since 1997 through a series of ceasefire agreements and dug-in on a never-ending spree of peace negotiations. It is another matter that the ‘talks’ with the Nagas is impeded by cryptic ceasefire ground rules and the complex question of the feasibility of integrating all the Nagas, scattered across the northeastern states, particularly Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, under one political unit, the core demand of the principal Naga armed group, the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isaak-Muivah group), NSCN-IM.

It is a fact that many viewed the on-going ‘Indo-Naga Political Peace Talks’ as the forerunner to resolving all of the divisive armed movement going on in the region. On the positive side, the Indo-Naga Talks has yielded at least a ‘Framework of Agreement’ in the 23 years of negotiating and just when words were doing the rounds that the ‘talks’ is coming close to culminating into an accord, the tone and substance of a statement made by the peace talks interlocutor-turned Nagaland Governor RN Ravi, revealed the fragility of the talks as it stands today.

In an interview to a local daily of Nagaland, the Nagaland Post, Governor Ravi accused the NSCN-IM of delaying the peace pact by making ‘mischievous interpretation’ of the agreed positions on contentious issues. The interlocutor-turned governor was quoted as saying that, “Framework Agreement is a commitment to settle the Naga political issue on the basis of power sharing with due regard to the contemporary realities.” The governor further accused the “NSCN-IM of trying to mislead the people by imagining things which are not in the Framework Agreement.”

While stating categorically that the Naga political issue belongs to the Naga people and not a single entity has franchise over it, Ravi hinted the possibility of dropping NSCN-IM to deliver a peace pact together with other stakeholders if necessary.

Meanwhile NSCN-IM, through a press release by its publicity department said that the political solution which would be worked out with the Government of India shall be a ‘Naga solution’ of the Nagas wherever they are, hinting at the contentious Pan Naga entity. The emergency meeting of its functionaries, including the collective leadership, Kilonsers, Tatars, heads of departments and its Army officials further asserted that the Naga National Flag and the Constitution is an inalienable right of the Nagas for an honourable political solution.

Anthony Shimray, the military chief of the NSCN-IM is quoted as saying that the Government of India had conceded that the history of the Nagas was ‘unique’ and that there would be ‘shared sovereignty’ with the rest of India.

It is clear that the Centre and the armed group are not on the same page while interpreting the Framework Agreement signed between the parties on 3 August 2015 which Prime Minister Narendra Modi had termed as historic.

Governor Ravi had stated categorically that there would be no separate flag and constitution for the Nagas under the peace deal. Ravi stated that the NSCN-IM has “adopted a procrastinating attitude to delay the settlement raising the contentious symbolic issues of separate Naga national flag and constitution on which they are fully aware of the Government of India’s position.”

Significantly, the Centre’s stalemate with the NSCN-IM peaked after the abolition of Article 370 of Jammu and Kashmir. All of a sudden, the Modi government abolished the provision under which the state had a separate flag and a constitution. This swift move by the Centre has fuelled a strong air of apprehension about the possibilities of similar action against the special provisions that are enshrined in Article 371A for the Nagas.

Article 371A states that no Act of Parliament — with respect to religious or social practices of the Nagas, their customary law and procedure, administration of civil and criminal justice involving decisions according to Naga customary law, ownership and transfer of land and its resources — shall apply to the state unless the Assembly decides by a resolution.

Notwithstanding the decline of violent activities in the last one decade and several ‘political talks’ between a number of armed ethnic groups who are on 'Suspension of Operation Agreements' with the government, the ongoing Indo-Naga talks seem to be giving the wrong signals, especially to the Manipur insurgents. They seemed to have hardened their stance by saying that there are no options other than to endure on the armed struggle against India.

Even as the law and order situation in Manipur has shown signs of improvement, the border state still remains the most violent state, accounting for 50 percent of the total violent incidents reported across the northeastern region. Primarily, Manipur is affected by activities of the Meitei, Naga, Kuki, Zomi, Hmar and Muslim armed groups with the Meitei insurgents accounting for about 57 percent of insurgency-related incidents.

Irengbam Chaoren, the elusive guerrilla leader who leads one of Manipur’s most potent armed outfit, the Revolutionary Peoples’ Front (RPF), in a press release, emailed to mark the outfit’s 41st Rising Day, ruled out getting into any peace parley with the Government India, saying his party will never compromise on the question of Manipur’s freedom.

In his press communique, Chaoren said that “under the current situation it will be impossible to come to any form of agreement on the liberation of Manipur through dialogue between the Government of India and the revolutionary groups of Manipur"".

Explaining his position, the rebel leader termed “India’s initiative for dialogue is basically about merging the revolutionaries into the Indian mainstream, make them real Indians; disarm the revolutionary groups and bring a solution within the Constitution of India"".

Giving reference to the NSCN-IM and Government of India peace-talk, Chaoren said that India’s approach has been “testified repeatedly by the accords signed earlier and the on-going political dialogues.” The RPF president emphasised that RPF’s armed movement to liberate Manipur is a response to the call of the over 2,000 years old national history of independence and freedom. He said that RPF’s armed movement is now over 40 years old and is fundamentally against the Government of India’s colonial rule.

He further rejected the views of the Indian security analysts who reasoned that the lack of development and unemployment brewed insurgency in the North East. “The armed movement is not a manifestation of grievances against administrative or economic policies formulated by the Government of India for the people of Manipur. The armed movement is a movement to liberate Manipur and establish self-rule,” Chaoren said.

He then went on to say that the revolutionary movement for the liberation of Manipur will evidentially attain the ‘Ultimate Victory’ given its long written national history and the fact that Manipur was forcefully annexed.

This strong-worded ‘message’ from the chief of RPF whose armed division, the People’s Liberation Army, PLA, is a headache for the Indian Army comes at a time when Manipur is gripped in the tense atmosphere emitted by the post CAA or the Citizenship Amendment Act. The Coalition for Indigenous Rights Campaign, CIRCA, a citizens' organisation of Manipur had termed the passing of CAB 2019 as ""an act of declaring war on the indigenous people of the North East”. Following the CAA related unrest, social observers in the state have said that insurgency in the northeast may get a fresh lease of life with the Modi government bend of enforcing the CAA.","Fortunately, the hostilities with most of the Naga armed groups have ended since 1997 through a series of ceasefire agreements and dug-in on a never-ending spree of peace negotiations.
It is a fact that many viewed the on-going ‘Indo-Naga Political Peace Talks’ as the forerunner to resolving all of the divisive armed movement going on in the region.
He said that RPF’s armed movement is now over 40 years old and is fundamentally against the Government of India’s colonial rule.
“The armed movement is not a manifestation of grievances against administrative or economic policies formulated by the Government of India for the people of Manipur.
The armed movement is a movement to liberate Manipur and establish self-rule,” Chaoren said."

This conference report outlines the main findings of the workshop on ‘European Security’ organised by RUSI and the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC) in February 2021 as part of the UK–Russia Security Dialogue. The dialogue is a proven format that has provided an opportunity for RUSI and RIAC to bring together experts from the two countries to discuss key questions, including sensitive security issues, at a time when this kind of interaction is the exception rather than the rule.

UK–Russia relations have become increasingly strained over the past decade, notably from 2014 following Russia’s actions in Crimea and the war in eastern Ukraine, which together marked a turning point in the bilateral relationship. In the subsequent years, there have been a series of efforts by Western European leaders, including from the UK, to reset relations with Russia. Despite these efforts, relations have continued to deteriorate. Against this background, the prospect for a reset of the sort that was pursued between the US and Russia in 2009 seems, at present, dim.

Given this environment, the focus of the current dialogue workshop was on how to reduce the chances for open military confrontation between NATO and Russia, especially in Europe, and on maintaining mutual engagement in the spheres where it is absolutely crucial.

The UK’s position in Europe has undergone significant evolution in recent years, although European security remains a core focus in the ‘Global Britain’ agenda. Previously preoccupied with Brexit, the UK government has started to move beyond negotiations on the UK’s departure from the EU to fashion a revised foreign and security policy. Even though EU–UK relations might remain tense for some time, it is clear that the UK is committed to working closely with both the EU and major European powers on foreign and security policy. Equally, the transatlantic relationship will remain a core part of the UK approach to European security. As a result, UK approaches to Russia will be closely aligned with its European and North American allies.

Indeed, in contrast to the apprehension about the reliability of the US as a security partner under Donald Trump, cooperation with President Joe Biden’s administration is likely to give a new momentum to transatlantic ties. These ties are based on mutual interests and reflect largely similar approaches to Russia. Following Brexit, the UK has ensured that sanctions relating to Russia continue to operate effectively by replacing the existing EU legislation with national measures.

For Russia, it is of paramount importance which mode of interaction the Biden administration will opt for in relations with Moscow. President Biden might be a more difficult partner, but the Russian view is that opportunities for some positive moves by NATO should not be ruled out. The integration of military-to-military contact into the political discussions of the NATO–Russia Council could be an important initial step to help promote stability and manage relations. From a Russian perspective, such a move should not be seen by the Alliance as a step to appease Russia or as a departure from NATO’s established approach, but rather as a step that would lay the ground for more dialogue.

Moderate optimism can be expressed about the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) regarding measures to overcome its institutional crisis and Sweden’s chairmanship in 2021, which may bring new opportunities. Russia chairing the Arctic Council from 2021 to 2023 provides a further opportunity to open the space for cooperation in some areas that affect the security situation in the High North.

With UK–Russia relations likely to be difficult, it is imperative that efforts remain focused on the realistic goal of developing a ‘new normalcy’ to stabilise the situation. Moves from confrontation to cooperation are unlikely given that both sides have irreconcilable visions of the essence of the international system and cite the lack of trust as an underlying impediment to normalisation. In this situation, it is important that efforts to exchange information and views continue and that there is further work on confidence-building measures to manage confrontation to lower risks and costs.

Summary of the Discussion

This UK–Russia dialogue workshop explored the various political and security issues affecting the contemporary European security landscape and provided an opportunity to share threat perceptions and consider the potential to mitigate security risks. The participants presented their countries’ strategic priorities and perspectives on the evolving nature of European security, including the prospects for arms control. The workshop also introduced the sub-regional perspective by focusing on the security complex in the Baltic Sea, Northern Europe and the Arctic.

The discussion focused on: the challenges that the European regional security order faces; the dangers stemming from its fragmentation; the erosion of much of the post-Cold War arms control regime; and the ebbing of the credibility of the OSCE, which faced a deep institutional crisis in 2020.

UK–Russia Relations

UK contributors noted that there have been a number of factors that have strained the UK–Russia relationship, such as the Russian annexation of Crimea and the military incursion into eastern Ukraine in 2014, Russian interference during the 2016 Brexit referendum, the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko on UK soil in 2006, the 2018 Salisbury chemical weapons attack and the attempted murder of Alexei Navalny in 2020. Some of these actions have led to the introduction of UK sanctions against Russia. Against this backdrop, the resumption of cooperative ties between the governments does not look feasible and the restoration of direct military cooperation is unlikely.

Citing this environment, the overarching idea of the discussion shared by most participants was that the status quo in relations between Russia and the UK – a ‘new normalcy’ – is not desirable but sustainable, is ‘not acceptable but bearable’. This perception about the potential for relations is likely to continue to inform the policy responses by both sides in the foreseeable future. Participants noted that the current state of affairs appears to be characterised by a situation in which both parties have reciprocal expectations that the steps towards normalisation need to come from the other side.

At the same time, participants underlined the importance of measures to reduce the chances of open confrontation. A key theme to emerge from the discussion was, thus, the need to maintain engagement in the spheres where it is most crucial.

A Russian participant expressed his concern that the decision taken by NATO in April 2014 to sever ties with Russia had grave repercussions in terms of increasing the risks of unintended military escalation. In the absence of an appropriate venue for discussions, many in the Russian expert community would like to see the governments of Russia and NATO countries start to discuss imminent threats in order to anticipate areas of tension and to set in place the means to de-escalate confrontations.

It was recognised that, at present, communication tends to start only when the risks become unacceptable, like in Syria. With important, but narrow, mechanisms for preventing dangerous military incidents already in place, there is no incentive to conduct political talks on the factors that could lead to confrontation.

It was noted that a key role for expert discussions such as the UK–Russia dialogue should be to alert governments to the possibility that ‘acceptable risks today can become unacceptable tomorrow’. The prevention of tensions or even resolution of some areas of dispute is thus crucial to managing the current difficult relations and avoiding a further dangerous deterioration. A Russian participant noted, however, that the West seems not to be ready for a selective approach to Russia which would allow for the compartmentalisation of the bilateral agenda into independent areas.

UK participants observed that while relations with Russia are difficult, the current status quo is viewed as sustainable and there are many other issues on the international security agenda for the UK to focus on beyond relations with Russia. At the same time, it was noted that if Russia does not shift its approach in the coming years, which was deemed unlikely, the transatlantic community will increasingly focus on deterrence and risk management in their relations with Russia.

It was noted that following a series of unsuccessful outreaches to Russia by NATO members, the Allies do not feel they should be the demandeurs in terms of the reset with Russia or for arms control initiatives. A UK participant observed that recent efforts by Western European states to reach out to Russia, including President Emmanuel Macron’s initiative and the visit to Moscow by EU High Representative Josep Borrell, bore no fruit and did not generate a positive response from the Russian side.

Thus, for any reset to occur, it was suggested that Russia would have to take the first steps. This would need to involve addressing the issues that have strained relations between Russia and the West, notably the annexation of Crimea, military intervention in Ukraine and actions in the Middle East, as well as Russian activities in the cyber domain. At the same time, the widespread view in the UK is that the Russian government does not believe that it is currently in its interests to make substantial concessions in relation to eastern Ukraine, over the joint management of the Syrian issue or in regard to its cyber activities.

The Challenges Facing Arms Control in Europe

The significant risks for a new arms race emerging in Europe were discussed at length. Participants were sceptical about the prospects of another golden age for arms control emerging, comparable to the one in the 1960s after the Cuban and Berlin crises, or in the late 1980s when the Soviet Union sought a radical change in its policies towards NATO and the West. Conventional arms control in Europe – based on the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), the Vienna Document and the Open Skies Treaty – is in demise and the existing regimes are no longer considered adequate to address contemporary security threats.

There was consensus that the erosion of the nuclear arms control architecture between the US and Russia poses a serious threat to European security, even if the UK and other European states are not direct participants in US–Russia treaties. Following the demise of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, the extension at the beginning of 2021 of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) between Moscow and Washington was met with relief. This positive step to renew the last remaining arms control agreement was hailed by Russian and UK participants, albeit a deal reached in an emergency rather than as a result of a wide r détente.

The collapse in recent years of the last remaining confidence- and security-building measures in Europe was noted as emblematic of the rapid deterioration of Russia–West relations. The US under the Trump administration withdrew from the Open Skies Treaty in November 2020, accusing Russia of treaty violations that made continued US membership impossible. In January 2021, Moscow announced it would follow the US and withdraw from the Treaty, citing the failure of NATO signatories to agree to its demands not to share information from the Russian surveillance flights with the US.

Though the future of the agreement remains uncertain, a Russian expert welcomed the possibility of the Biden administration returning the US to the Treaty. It was opined that Russia actually launched the withdrawal procedure to send the signal to the US that renewing its participation should be considered an urgent matter.

Workshop participants indicated that it is unlikely that there will be progress towards Europe-wide conventional arms control, along the lines of the adapted CFE treaty, in the foreseeable future. Russian participants expressed support for consultations to address the risks around sensitive areas where NATO and Russia border with each other – in the Baltic and the Black Sea regions. The aim should be to, at minimum, establish the sub-regional arrangements that could prevent unintended security escalations.

It was also noted that it should be a priority to extend confidence-building measures into the Barents and Norwegian Seas, which are the overlapping areas of operations by the Russian Northern Fleet and the recently re-established US Second Fleet. Participants recognised, however, that NATO did not accept the idea of concluding separate sub-regional agreements with Russia. One of the benefits of re-establishing NATO–Russia military-to-military dialogue was identified as providing a more credible notification arrangement on ground forces and, thus, a means to improve transparency and trust.

On the arms control regime in Europe, Russian participants indicated that Moscow would welcome European initiatives on arms control mechanisms but noted that Russia assessed that European capitals are wary of Washington’s reactions to such initiatives and oversensitive to potential criticism.

At the same time, the Russian perception of Europe as lacking strategic autonomy on security issues loomed in the discussions when a Russian discussant expressed the belief that for the Russian defence establishment, talking to Europeans about arms control when the US is not at the table has no practical sense.

The fate of the Chemical Weapons Convention was discussed. A UK participant raised the issue of the large-scale use of chemical weapons in Syria, where Russia is supporting the regime of Bashar Al-Assad. The use of banned chemical agents for attempted assassinations was also noted. These actions were identified as policies that seriously erode trust in Russia’s commitment to adhere to legally binding treaties.

Against the background of the chemical weapons attacks in Salisbury in 2018 and the attempted poisoning of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in 2020 using a prohibited nerve agent, restoring the credibility of the Chemical Weapons Convention and Russia’s adherence to its provisions were seen as a cornerstone for improving relations with the West.

The deterioration of arms control arrangements was seen as reflective of the wider breakdown of the crisis management functions of the OSCE. Experts agreed that there were some improvements at the end of 2020 with agreement on the appointment of the organisation’s institutional heads and with the stable hand of the Swedish chairmanship guiding this process. But the continuous tensions around these institutions, which embody the comprehensive security concept at the core of the OSCE, and the lack of significant progress around the organisation’s regional conflict management activities, were raised. The limited levers available to the OSCE during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war were also highlighted.

A Russian expert opined that Moscow does not see a bigger independent role for the OSCE in crisis management and arms control, since it views the organisation as an instrument that has been privatised by the West. The Russia–NATO relationship was identified as a better-placed format to discuss arms control issues.

Perspectives on the Security of Northern Europe

In the session devoted to discussing Northern Europe and the Arctic, the Baltic sub-region was identified as the most dangerous environment. At the same time, the Arctic can no longer be considered as a region insulated from tensions. The vision of the Arctic as a region of peace and cooperation may no longer hold true as the security mechanisms of the past are losing their relevance.

The discussion highlighted differences in perceptions between UK and Russian specialists on the military dynamics in the region. Russia sees Northern Europe and the Baltic Sea as two distinct regions, while the UK – together with the other states of Northern Europe – increasingly see these areas as a single security space.

A Russian participant contended that assessments that Moscow is militarising the region are exaggerated; there is force modernisation, rather than the creation of new offensive capabilities. These modernisation programmes, it was argued, do not violate the military balance or provoke an arms race in the region, and are aimed to make the Russian armed forces better prepared to deal with non-traditional security threats.

A British discussant noted, however, that Russia’s increased sense of security is creating a growing sense of insecurity among its neighbours. Russia has extended its capabilities in air defence and other areas beyond its borders in order to protect its strategic forces located in the north. With new capabilities, it is able to project power beyond the Arctic into the North Atlantic.

As a result of Russian activities in the region, the transatlantic community assesses that the security environment has changed substantively. NATO, including the UK, has developed a much keener interest in the region, and NATO Arctic states that were previously resistant to the Alliance having a regional role are shifting to accept that it can be an interlocutor on Arctic military questions. There is a perception that there needs to be an Alliance response to Russian activities with a growing focus on the Greenland–Iceland–UK gap.

With new actors, including China, coming into the region, Russia is on the defensive. Responding to a question about whether Russia is prepared to talk to NATO about the Arctic and managing military tensions, it was noted that Russia is opposed to seeing more NATO engagement in the region, and security dialogue should be conducted among the five littoral states directly.

Conclusions

The workshop highlighted the importance of maintaining a channel for candid talks between Russia and the UK’s expert communities. There were a number of areas of consensus, in the sense that both sides recognised the need to maintain a dialogue without illusions in order to, at minimum, better understand each other’s perspective and positions. Participants agreed that the UK and Russia should be aware of the real potential risks of any further deterioration in European security at the cost of an arms race, or even unwanted confrontation. Dialogue participants also highlighted that, despite the bilateral difficulties, there are ways that both parties can manage the risks of the ‘new normal’ situation. There is, thus, an urgent need to explore how this can be achieved effectively.

A realistic assessment of UK–Russia relations points to the need for both sides to recognise that the focus of bilateral ties should be on developing pragmatic and limited areas of cooperation. Discussion of a wholesale reset, which is not feasible at present, should be avoided. Some of those pragmatic areas could be talks about how to make progress on arms control, ways to strengthen military-to-military contacts, and maintaining the discussions on threat perceptions and regional security.

Women who had been displaced by fighting in South Sudan are sowing seeds of peace, with support from the UN mission in the country, UNMISS.

They have been given ox ploughs to work the land, as part of a campaign to resettle returnees in the Rumbek North area who were uprooted during intercommunal clashes last year.

""We realized that household food security is one of the key factors for return and reintegration to be sustainable,"" said Caroline Opok, a representative of the peacekeeping mission.

Rumbek North has been greatly affected by conflict, displacement and food insecurity.

Due to persistent intercommunal violence, including cattle raids, revenge attacks and armed ambushes, many people in the region have been reduced to relying on relief aid.

Tired of depending on external assistance, and with oxen aplenty available, residents figured that having ploughs could improve their situation.

""The challenge they reported was a lack of implements to increase their food production. That's how the ox plough idea was born,"" said Samuel Owoko, a representative of Sans Frontieres Germany, the organization implementing the project.

The tools were handed to women's groups, as local tradition dictates that girls and women are the ones responsible for feeding their families.

They will be put to good use, according to Mary Agor, a local women's leader.

""We have been using hand hoes, and with that you can only do so much. With these ox ploughs coming in, we shall cultivate bigger areas which will help us sustain our families throughout the long dry spell. We shall also have some surplus produce to sell at the market in Rumbek and thus make some money"", she said.

All that is required now is for their men to bring back the bulls to draw the ploughs.

Most of the time, male villagers bring their cattle and run into the wilderness as a way of fending off possible raids from neighbouring communities. Now, their women want them back home and working.

""We are telling men that food security is the responsibility of the entire household, not just women"", said Ms. Opok, the UNMISS representative. ""We are encouraging men to bring out the bulls and put in the energy to work together with their women to expand the areas of cultivation"".

Ms. Agor, the women's group leader, also had a message for the national authorities: ""We want our Government to make sure that there is enough security so that we can bring in our bulls and cultivate. Without peace, that will not be possible. Right now, the roads are full of armed youth. They should go away so that our men can safely return with their cattle"".","Ox ploughs have been delivered to women's groups in Rumbek North to enable the cultivation of larger areas.

…Ex Boko Haram men reveal brainwashing skills of insurgents while recruiting

•Shocking testimonies of ex-combatants and their new resolutions

•Saturday Vanguard visits ex Boko Haram Rehab Centre

•What OPSC is all about – Commandant, Brig.-Gen Musa Ibrahim

By Soni Daniel, Northern Region Editor

The compound wears the toga of any normal military barracks. It remains quiet all the time and is flustered with the aura of being forlorn. But the Malam Sidi Camp of the Nigerian Army has many buildings scattered in the massive compound tucked away in a conspicuous roadside in Lawanti town, Akko Local Government Area of Gombe State.

Like any other military establishment, it enjoys 24-hour surveillance and scrutiny by eagle-eyed military personnel, who are eager to frisk any visitor to their pants before authorizing entry into the place. Although there is nothing avaunt-garde about the compound, there are very important persons who are housed there for very special purpose. Of a truth, the occupants may not command any serious attention because of their physical appearance.

Many of them may not attract a generous handshake from most Nigerians because of their physique but their current status in the ongoing campaign by the Nigerian military to end the cycle of insurgency and terrorism in the country makes them the cynosure of anyone who steps into the camp any day. If any success is to be made in the adoption of non-violent approach in ending the ongoing war between Nigeria and insurgents in the north, the testament of these category of men, may help. That is why they occupy a special place in the heart of top military commanders who have been deeply involved in ending the onslaught that has tasked the nation and its resources since it assumed a war status in 2009.

These men who have been consigned to these building can rightly be described as history-makers because of the status conferred on them by the Nigerian government and circumstances that drove them there in the first place.

They are Nigerian men drawn from no fewer than seven local government areas of the country, who were either conscripted into the Boko Haram fighting force or voluntarily enlisted into the virulent group in order to achieve its set goal of turning Nigeria into their caliphate. In this category are no fewer than 606 mostly young adult males who have denounced terrorism and association with the Boko Haram sect and embraced the Federal Government’s De-radicalisation, Rehabilitation and Reintegration, DRR, programme, which is anchored by a special unit called ‘Operation Safe Corridor, OPSC, and coordinated by Major General Bamidele Ashafa of the Nigerian Army and Brig. Gen. Musa Ibrahim as the Commandant, who sees face to the face with the former Boko Haram elements daily and attends to their daily needs, including training, welfare and capacity building to be able to face the future with hope and confidence after leaving the camp. In order to give them a good sense of belonging, the former fighters (not all of them were gun-wielding but carried out designated chores for the sect inside the bush) these repentant men are not taunted as ex-Boko Haram fighters or members by the government but are ingeniously designated and addressed as ‘Clients’ and given all the necessary support and encouragement they need in order to turn a new leave and become useful to themselves and the larger society.

The De-radicalisation, Rehabilitation and Reintegration, DDR, which is akin to what the Federal Government offered the Niger Delta militants on June 25, 2009 in order to lay down their arms and embrace peace under the amnesty granted them by the government, is considered one of the best steps in ending the terrorism war using a non-kinetic approach, which many consider less expensive and a win-win approach if it succeeds.

Under the programme, OPSC has successfully de-radicalised and trained 280 ex-Boko Haram combatants, including two Chadians and thereafter transferred them to their respective states and national authorities for reintegration. In the current DRR programme, OPSC working in concert with 18 other stakeholders, undertake a comprehensive medical screening, DNA , biometric registration and further debriefing of the ‘clients’ under the De-radicalisation and rehabilitation phase of the operation.

In specific terms, de-radicalistion process, which appears to be the most difficult aspect of the job eked out for the military include: Psychotherapy, psycho-spiritual counseling, art therapy intervention, social therapy, drug use intervention, introductory formal education as most of them can neither read nor write and recreation/sports.

The rehabilitation phase of the programme has easily launched and transformed the former combatants into ‘experts’ in barbing, carpentry, cosmetology, farming, leather works, tailoring and welding. While the other phases are handled by OPSC in collaboration with the other stakeholders, the reintegration aspect is the responsibility of the respective state governments, family members, religious leaders and gradual reintegration into their respective communities.

But the ‘clients’ are not just being admitted to the programme by choice but through a well laid out process: the client must first denounce membership of Boko Haram, swear to an oath of allegiance to the Federal Republic of Nigeria before a senior judicial officer from the Federal Ministry of Justice before being admitted into the DRR programme. Beyond that, OPSC continues to monitor the activities and progress of ex-combatants even after leaving the DRR camp through government security traditional rulers and religious institutions in their respective states.

For the clients, the DRR has provided them with a golden opportunity of transformation and given them a sense of belonging. It has moved them from sick, forgotten, fragile, hopeless and destabilized people to well organized, balanced and strong Nigerians armed with the choice trades of their own.

And the beneficiaries drawn mostly from Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States are very excited about the transformation they have undergone and the ray of hope that lies ahead of them having undergone vocational training in many areas of human endeavours. And, as a demonstration of their skills, the camp is littered with products like cream, detergents, soaps, furniture, caps, shoes, cosmetic and other household items produced by the clients while others are actively serving as barbers and laundrymen. They are men who can beat their chests in self adulation and say something like ‘we are now free from our captors and our future is better than when we came here because now we have learnt many skills that can give us financial independence and a means of survival’. Indeed, even for a moment, they have reasons to be excited about their transformation and be grateful to their handlers in the OPSC because when they arrived at the camp, they were frustrated, confused and disoriented lot jolted by constant fear over their safety. This was largely because while working for Boko Haram, they had been brainwashed by the ideology that the Nigerian Government does not want to see them, does not have anything to offer them and would kill any of them who returns to Nigeria.

The Commandant of Operation Safe Corridor, Brig.Gen. Musa Ibrahim, maintains that the essence of the operation is to rehabilitate the repentant ex-combatants, train them in vocational skills of their choice and prepare them to live normal life and reintegrate fully with the Nigerian society.

“We are not training them to join the Nigerian Army as some people have alluded but we are giving them a leeway to become useful citizens and return to normal lives. We are adopting a non-kinetic approach to try and end the war after which we will hand them over to their respective states for reintegration, Ibrahim,” who knows virtually all the 606 clients by first name basis, explains.

“Most of them were conscripted by Boko Haram into their fighting teams and sent into the bush to just fight while others were deceived to join insurgency without knowing why and what they were going into at that time. But we have de-radicalised them and transformed them from sick, fragile and destabilized men to strong and balanced human beings with a sense of self worth and happiness,” he added.

The commandant explained that OPSC has a system of monitoring the progress of each of the men after leaving the camp given their biometric and arrangement put in place with 17 other agencies who are stakeholders in the programme. These include: the Department of State Services, Office of the National Security Adviser, The Nigeria Police Force, the National Intelligence Agency, Nigerian Correctional Service, National Orientation Service, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Ministry of Humanitarian Services, Federal Ministry of Justice, National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, National Directorate of Employment, North East Development Commission, National Emergency Management Agency and the National Identify Management Commission.

The testimonies emanating from the ex-combatants are as many as the men themselves. The oldest of the ‘clients’ is 81 year-old man from Adamawa, who was a customary court judge before he was conscripted by the insurgent along with his 23-year-old son. With less than three months the end of their training by OPSC in order to begin a new phase of life, they are very happy to have left the insurgents and given an opportunity by the federal government to learn a trade of their choice and are itching to return home to reunite with their family members, whom they have not seen for many years.

“I must confess how much I miss my wife and four children,” says 54-year-old Mohammed Muazu from Yobe State, who was forced to join the insurgents when the terrorists overran his community in 2013. He is currently learning shoe and soap-making at the camp after undergoing de-radicalisation. I really miss my wife and my four children and I pray that I will have the opportunity to reunite with them one day. I have no basis to return to the bush,” he said.

His testimony tallies with that of Alli Mallam Yilda, a father of two girls from Bama in Borno State, who was captured and taken away by the insurgents to join their fighting force in 2014 when he was pretty young. “My mother, I am told, is still alive and I am anxious to return home to join with her having lost my father before I was captured by the insurgents. They took me away after they shot and killed my boss, who was the driver of the bus where I served as a conductor” Isha Allah, I want to go home and become a better person to my family and Bama community,” the man, who is learning hat-making and carpentry said.

The quartet of Umar Buka Wanzama, 25, from Bama Borno State, Mohammed Lawal, 24 from Adamawa, Maina Bukar, 35 years from Bama and Ali Bukar from Damboa in Borno State were similarly forced to join the insurgents in 2016 and they are eager to return home to join the surviving members of their families. Many of them do not know where the rest of their family members are and if they are still alive and want a quick return home to start a new lease of life. They are thankful to OPSC for rescuing them from their captors and training them in different skills to become self-sufficient once more.

Malam Abba, who was also captured by the sect in from Bama in 2016, said they were told by his captors that Nigeria did not mean well for them and that only Boko Haram could guarantee them peace, job and security and that they should fight and defeat Nigeria at all cost. But he said he was lucky as they never gave him guns to fight and kill anyone throughout his stay with them until he was rescued by the Nigerian military after he picked up a flyer from a NAF jet and decided it was time he denounced and left the insurgents.

But for Tijani Mele, a trained vigilante from Konduga in Borno State, who is successfully training as a barber with OPSC, he was captured by Boko Haram after many of his colleagues had been killed. “They (insurgents) killed most of our members who were protecting the community and forced many of us to join them and we pleaded loyalty to them. I handled guns and took part in many operations for Boko Haram having been already trained in gun handling as a vigilante in the local government,” Mele said. “But today, I want to say that I am very remorseful for what happened. I want to start afresh and become a successful barber,” he said.

But among them clients is a very senior member, Abdullahi Usman, popularly referred to as ‘GOC’ apparently because of the active role he used to play in the Boko Haram enclave before being rescued by the Nigerian military. Usman confesses: “ They gave me the name GOC because of my leadership style and charismatic style in dealing with others while in the bush.

“I am roaring to return to my home in Borno State,” said the 34-year- old man, who has studied poultry and vegetable farming in the camp.

“I will never return to the bush to work for Boko Haram because the training by OPSC has transformed my life tremendously and if I have another opportunity I will go back to school. Most of my Boko Haram colleagues were killed while I was still in the bush and I don’t want to go back there given the opportunity we have been given here to learn various trades. I am very happy and excited about the prospect of returning to my family after this programme, which most of us did not believe was real before we came here,” Usman confessed.

The Coordinator of OPSC, Maj. Gen. Bamidele Ashafa, described the programme as the best so far in the entire West African region and hopes that it will go a long way in assisting to quicken the end of the insurgency war in the north.

Indeed, OPSC may soon become the game changer for both the Nigerian Government and the recalcitrant and malevolent insurgents who keep fighting and throwing new challenges into the battlefield.

It is they, after all, who have the ability to deliver fair justice systems, effective governance, and geopolitical stability. But from anti-corruption measures and sustainable supply chain management to progressive lobbying efforts and labour policies, green and responsible businesses can play a key role in maximising the chances of this vital global goal being met.

BusinessGreen talks to a number of leasing experts about how business leaders can develop a successful strategy in support of SDG16 and presents their six top tips.

1. Break down what it means to you

Sustainable Development Goal 16's targets can, on the face of it, look rather abstract from a private sector perspective. But Ulysses Smith, director of the business and rule of law programme at think-tank Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law, tells his clients that it's actually the goal that has the most relevance to a company's ability to operate.

""Once you get past the language of the SDGs and the UN-speak it becomes very clear for businesses to understand that it's about institutional frameworks, it's about the rule of law, it's about transparency and accessible regulatory frameworks, it's about fair judicial action. If you can translate it into common-sense everyday things it's about basic governance principles,"" says Smith.

2. Be transparent

""Business has a significant role to play by modelling the right behaviours, being transparent in its reporting, allowing sensible regulation to come to the fore and giving politicians confidence to put that legislation onto statute,"" says David Croft, global director of sustainability, environment and human rights for household goods giant RB (formerly Reckitt Benckiser).

Companies can contribute to this in many ways, says Transparency International, including appointing diverse management teams to enhance the openness of the leadership environment and publicly reporting on political contributions and lobbying activities throughout their supply chain.

Transparency International would also particularly like to see progress on beneficial ownership transparency, where the public can see who really owns a company. However, this is a more sensitive topic, says Smith. ""There definitely are companies that are calling out for new laws and regulations to require more transparency [but] I guess there is more hesitance to engage on this topic than human rights,"" he notes.

3. Think global

Clearly, the context in which a firm operates is going to affect how it can practice. Transparency International's Business Integrity Country Agenda tool analyses the integrity of the broader business environment, and the interplay between the state and private companies.

""What has become clear from these assessments is that the strength of a company's internal integrity management system is critical in markets in which corruption is commonplace,"" says Matthew Jenkins, research coordinator at NGO Transparency International. ""While it is obviously easier to act with probity when one is not being solicited for bribes by public officials, robust anti-corruption policies can help inoculate a firm against governance risks in difficult markets.""

He adds that many firms operate in multiple jurisdictions, which are likely to have different standards of good governance and varying levels of institutional strength. ""This is another compelling reason for multinationals to establish a strong culture of corporate compliance, anti-bribery policies, codes of ethics and so on, to make it crystal clear that no employee can use discrepancies between jurisdictions as either an excuse or rationale for corrupt behaviour,"" he says.

4. Corruption-proof your business

Running a global business and supply chain opens a company up to significant corruption and bribery risks, warns Transparency International. It recommends that companies measure their risk of exposure and report on it openly and regularly as a first step towards tackling a problem that is often far larger than many people suspect.

Existing business integrity tools can then provide useful recommendations and suggest good practice on how to prevent or mitigate those risks through comprehensive anti-corruption programmes, says Transparency International.

Rigorous supply chain scrutiny is essential - as it is for all SDGs. Some multinationals like Nestle use third-party organisations such as Ecovadis to undertake independent assessments of their suppliers, although these are usually complemented by unique internal processes to provide a fuller picture.

5. Find partners that share your principles

The majority of sustainable development work has focused on multinationals, says Smith, because they have more clout and bear the highest risks of legal action or reputational damage. ""Whether on the green economy or SDGs more generally, for the most part it has been up until now the bigger companies that have been driving the change,"" he says.

But smaller organisations play an important role too. ""A lot of multinationals can have trouble finding joint venture partners or companies they want to merge with because of that whole issue that whoever they team up with is clean. There's a real incentive for smaller businesses who want to partner with them to improve their practices,"" adds Smith.

6. Harness the power of technology

The Task Force on Justice - an initiative of UN member states, international organisations, civil society and businesses - highlights promising technologies that can provide justice at scale. These include services that facilitate the resolution of disputes, new technologies that support user-friendly contracts, and alternative private sector legal providers that aim to help large numbers of individuals and small businesses make good use of the law.

Innovative examples include an app developed by the UK government's Department for International Development called 'Pay no Bribe' which allows users to report bribery and identify corruption hotspots. It has already been piloted in Sierra Leone and thereare hopes it could be rolled out more widely.

As well as benefitting from such technology, the Task Force says the private sector can help develop new ways of meeting people's justice needs at low cost. ""The public and private sector innovators need space to collaborate and support for innovation through all stages of the process, from researching needs and developing a response, to monitoring impact,"" it advises.","Break down what it means to youSustainable Development Goal 16's targets can, on the face of it, look rather abstract from a private sector perspective.

But when I survey the countries not on newspapers’ front pages, often fragile states emerging from war or on the brink of economic collapse, I see the possibility of what scholars call a “positive peace” following the pandemic.

To respond to the unimaginable conditions of this virus, the UN has launched the COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), a coordinated effort between several agencies including UNDP, and led by the World Health Organization (WHO). The HRP will make its mark not only for the coronavirus but also, we expect, for future crises and disasters, whether natural or manmade, as it will synchronize our efforts, reduce response times, avoid duplication, and provide faster and more efficient relief to those hardest hit. That is critical to avoid a breakdown in peace processes, or to allow problems unmitigated to fester and spawn new crises.

The HRP will address other issues that hobble collective response efforts in the event of a global crisis. First, how will local responders cope if international organizations are confined or have no manoeuvre to work? How can organizations such as UNDP support them, while simultaneously guarding civil society? What if fragile contexts lose a broad cadre of trusted elderly leaders? What will this mean for social cohesion and political stability, especially if “fake news” continues to misinform?

Minimizing impact

When it comes to peace and security, what happens if peacekeepers are forced to stay confined to barracks? How can we minimize the impact of their reduced presence, whether when it comes to enforcing peace agreements, protecting civilians, or keeping economies afloat?

What impact will the pandemic have on the macroeconomic stability of fragile contexts, in areas already at risk of debt distress that may need to take on further debt to refinance broken health systems? If aid is diverted to deal with the immediate effects of COVID-19, what will this mean for progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in fragile contexts, much less for peace and stability?

Finally, and perhaps on a more hopeful note, will this crisis create opportunities to end longstanding conflicts, not unlike how the 2004 tsunami helped pave the way for peace in Aceh, Indonesia?

As alluded to in a recent think piece from the International Crisis Group, there is emerging evidence of humanitarian gestures between rivals—the United Arab Emirates’ support to Iran, the United States’ to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and cross-border communication between Venezuela and Colombia.

Greater global solidarity

Yuval Noah Harari, author of the award-winning Sapiens, has also set out the case for greater global solidarity after the pandemic. He warns about some potentially sinister side effects, such as the deployment of widespread surveillance technology, the rise of authoritarianism, a breakdown of societal trust, and sets out interesting thoughts on the aptly-named “soap police”—those deputized to enforce people to wash their hands.

Harari calls for a global plan that includes countries sharing equipment and personnel, dealing with the economic fallout and not throwing up trade barriers, as well as sensible global travel guidance. If ever there was a wakeup call for greater global comradery and collective governance, this is it. Hard to believe only a few months back there was squabbling over the perceived bankruptcy and bottoming out of globalismas manifested by Brexit, the rise of populism, and the backlash against globalist efforts at Davos and elsewhere.

There is a thirst for solidarity not seen since the waning days of World War Two. Humanity requires a common voice and global leadership to defeat the coronavirus, to build resilience to reduce its secondary risks, and eventually to recover from the fallout. Our COVID-19 Integrated Response includes supporting the health response, the procurement and supply of essential health products such as x-ray machines, infrared thermometers, infusion pumps, protective suits, gloves and hand sanitizer, strengthening crisis management, and addressing critical social and economic impacts.

Expensive fallout

The Global Humanitarian Response Plan should hopefully raise the resources needed to alleviate the immediate human suffering caused by COVID-19. But that will not be enough to deal with the expensive fallout across the world’s most fragile states. Complementary funding will be needed. This can come through trusted development and peace partners such as UNDP, but regardless of its source, we must ensure this pandemic and its aftermath is managed in a systemic way. In a best-case scenario, this funding could be on a “no regrets” basis; even if the COVID-19 risks do not manifest themselves, the related programming will still provide positive benefits for the world’s most vulnerable societies. This funding could also help seize what might be once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for peace. In the worst-case scenario—that is, if COVID-19 does lead to a significant increase in conflict—this funding will help support critical prevention measures, saving lives, and saving money.

Everyone must play a role

To talk of opportunities is not to downplay the magnitude of this crisis, nor is it to ignore those suffering. It is seeking out a silver lining that can both prevent future tragedies while putting in place a more robust and synchronous architecture to ensure a faster response were another coronavirus-like crisis to erupt.

COVID-19 is not just a humanitarian or public health crisis. Everyone must play a role. This includes diplomats as well as development workers. Although this is only my first month at UNDP, I can say that I am amazed by UNDP’s ability to leverage its uniquely massive global footprint—it is to respond both robustly yet also rapidly.

It is often said UN agencies are at their best during a time of crisis. And tragedies are often the wellspring of opportunities and innovation. The HRP will hopefully be one legacy of the current crisis that makes for a more effective response to future emergencies. For that we can be grateful and, dare I say, optimistic.","It might almost come off as callous during these difficult times to speak of opportunities emerging from the coronavirus COVID-19.

Increased development will lead to increased peace. The first and possibly best example of sport diplomacy is the Olympic Games. Since their inception in the times of Ancient Greece, the Olympic Games have had the tradition of the Olympic Truce. The Olympic Truce is to ensure the safe travel of athletes and spectators to the Games during times of war. The Olympic Games allow people to put aside their differences and come together in the spirit of international cooperation. Sports unite people. At the Olympic Games and other international competitions, we bring people together and create a space for international cooperation, showing the world that we can all get along.

Individual nations are placing sport as a central pillar in their foreign policy. The Australian Government launched their Sport Diplomacy 2030 initiative February of 2019:

Sports Diplomacy 2030 envisages closer collaboration between the Australian sports codes, industry and government to leverage the nation's sporting excellence in ways that enhance Australia's influence and reputation and advance our national interests.

To help deliver these goals the strategy is organised around four strategic priority areas:

Empower Australian sport to represent Australia globally Build linkages with our neighbours Maximise trade, tourism and investment opportunities Strengthen communities in the Indo-Pacific

Australia is using sport to strengthen its reputation in the world and help build partnerships with other countries. This in turn helps with trade and helps grow the economy.

The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs at the US Department of State uses sport as a tool for diplomacy as well. They highlight that they use sport as a way to transcend linguistic and sociocultural differences and that it can build links between countries.

A good example of sport diplomacy in action is how Samantha Power, former US ambassador to the United Nations, on many of her overseas trips used sport to break down barriers and connect with women and girls around the world. This is a form of sport diplomacy, building stronger connections and a global community through sport. Sport diplomacy is a growing trend for increasing international cooperation. It can be used to increase peace around the world.

Another concrete example of sport diplomacy can be seen on the Korean peninsula. During the 2018 Winter Olympics, we saw a joint North and South Korea delegation. They also announced that they intended on launching a joint bid for the 2032 Olympics. Sports are bringing these two countries together. A lot more needs to be done outside of the field of play, but sport can help bridge the divide. A lot of consideration needs to be taken before awarding the Olympic Games to a country that has such poor human rights record as North Korea. But these small steps can lead to something much bigger. The closer the ties between these two countries, the more work can be done to improve the lives of people living in North Korea. By uniting these countries and bringing them closer together, South Korea can help influence positive change to make the lives better for those that live in North Korea.

There is also grassroots sport diplomacy. What is grassroots sport diplomacy? The International Sport and Culture Association defines grassroots sport diplomacy as:

“A new qualitative, cost efficient and impactful approach aiming at:

Increasing or creating lasting dialogue and cultural understanding;

Facilitating transfer of knowledge between the grassroots sport sector and relevant actors (including other grassroots sport organisations, states, NGOs, civil society or even individuals); and

Contributing to society and individual development in the health, educational and sport or social fields.”

Grassroots sport diplomacy to me is a citizen-to-citizen engagement that takes place in the community. It creates more inclusion within a society for women and girls, newcomers, LGBTQ+ people and people with disabilities.

One area that can grow more is cross-border grassroots diplomacy. Engaging at the citizen level between nations may be easier in Europe where countries are closer together and it is easier and cheaper for youth teams to travel, compared to Canada where the only land border is with the United States. But there are many opportunities to build stronger ties between countries that can be taken when engaging at a more grassroots level.

One example that I love for grassroots sport diplomacy is the Canada Games. These Games engage youth from across the country in sports and create mutual understanding, a sense of belonging and connectedness. We are currently going through what seems like a national unity crisis, but sports help remind us that we have more in common than differences. There is more that unites us as a country than divides us. Grassroots sport diplomacy has a role to play in keeping citizens engaged with each other and ending the ""us"" versus ""them"" mentality.

Foreign policymakers and thinkers should use sport as a policy tool to increase international presence, and social and economic ties, using sport as the vessel for peace and development around the world.

David Thibodeau is a former competitive swimmer and current National Coaching Certification Program certified coach. He founded Sports for Social Impact to explore sport policy and provide insightful analysis to those working in the sport industry. He is an advocate for better inclusion of LGBTQ+ people in sports and gym classes. And has a Masters in Public Policy and Administration from Carleton University.

14 APRIL 2020

SECURITY COUNCIL

The global COVID-19 pandemic is having a profound impact on Colombia, but it cannot be allowed to derail the Latin American nation’s quest for sustainable peace after five decades of conflict, the Head of the United Nations Verification Mission in that country told the Security Council in a videoconference meeting* on 14 April.

Carlos Ruiz Massieu, who is also the Secretary-General’s Special Representative to Colombia, said that the pandemic will impact on the implementation of the Final Agreement for Ending the Conflict and Building a Stable and Lasting Peace, signed on 24 November 2016 between Bogota and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia‑People’s Army (FARC-EP).

It is encouraging to see Colombians finding creative responses to the crisis and responding positively to calls for unity as authorities at all levels take measures to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, he said, noting how implementing parties are embracing video technology to continue their work.

However, while the National Liberation Army (ELN) — which is still in negotiations with the Government — has declared a month-long ceasefire for April, clashes involving illegal armed groups are continuing, he said.

“At a time when all efforts must be focused on fighting the pandemic, we urge all illegal armed actors in Colombia to desist from continuing to perpetrate violence upon vulnerable communities, including indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities,” he emphasized.

He told the 15-member Council that the international community has a “collective obligation” to ensure progress in implementing the 2016 peace agreement.

“Peace in Colombia cannot and should not be a casualty of this pandemic,” he added, calling for ongoing progress to fully implement the Final Agreement, including on three priorities that the Secretary-General set out in his latest report on the Mission’s work (document S/2020/239).

Those include: adopting all necessary measures to protect social leaders, human rights defenders and former combatants from acts of violence; strengthening the foundations for the longer-term reintegration of former combatants and ensuring that the benefits of the peace agreement reach them; and ensuring that communities — especially victims — remain at the heart of peacebuilding efforts.

Elaborating, he said that violence against social leaders, human rights defenders and former combatants is continuing despite a nationwide quarantine. Since the Secretary-General’s report was issued on 26 March, three more former combatants have been killed, bringing to 195 the total number of former combatants killed since the peace deal was signed. Three social leaders have also died violently.

“Just as Colombian actors are uniting to confront the pandemic, it is imperative for all actors to unite to end the epidemic of violence against social leaders, human rights defenders and former combatants,” he said.

On reintegration efforts, he said that close attention must be paid to former combatants living outside former training and reintegration areas, in places where access to basic service, such as clean water and sanitation, is more vulnerable. He also encouraged the parties to work within the National Reintegration Council to support collective projects that are more vulnerable to the economic consequences of COVID-19.

Turning to peacebuilding efforts, the Special Representative said that the current context is an opportunity to undertake planning and consultations to put the Comprehensive Programme for Security and Protection of Communities and Organizations in the Territories — a key part of the Final Agreement — into operation. Doing so, he stressed, “can make an important difference on the ground”.

Also briefing the Council was David Santiago Cano Salazar, youth representative, said all Colombians who lived through the conflict have suffered from the consequences of violence. Having grown up in Medellín, he remembers neighbours who were killed, corpses on TV, the sounds of gun shots and pervasive fear. While the peace agreement fulfilled hopes, it also raised expectations that peace would finally take root in rural Colombia. These expectations remain and all Colombians must do their part to implement the entire peace agreement.

Following his travels with the United Nations Verification Mission in Colombia to Miravalle, Caquetá — the heart of the conflict for decades — where former combatants were now being trained as tour guides, he made a pledge to do his part. In December 2019, he organized a fair in Bogotá for former combatants to sell agricultural products and handicrafts, in an alliance with the United Nations, the Agency for Reintegration and Normalization and several non‑governmental organizations. He is now working to replicate the fair in other cities and has launched a programme for young entrepreneurs to share tech advice, another example of how his generation is supporting peace and reconciliation.

Going forward, he said steps must be taken to help the most vulnerable Colombians withstand the economic impact of COVID-19. Former combatants struggling due to diminished fair sales are being encouraged by mentors to sell their wares online or to offer new products. Others previously involved in a clothing project are turning adversity into opportunity, producing face masks for the COVID-19 response. Violence against young social leaders is another challenge — one of the deepest wounds on the national conscience. Measures must be taken to protect them “so they do not need to fear for their lives when speaking up for their communities”.

He pointed to the lack of State presence in rural communities as another problem, stressing that these regions need teachers, doctors, roads, schools, investments and opportunities. The end of the conflict presents an opportunity for the Government to bring a State presence and investments. “Indeed, it is their duty,” he assured. Drug cartels take advantage of that vacuum to recruit children. Cocaine use — “including in many of your countries” — means that young Colombians pay the price in blood, tears and suffering. Eradication is not the solution as it leaves poor farmers with little recourse for their livelihoods; crop substitution and economic opportunities are needed. With the right tools and market access, coca-growing families would much rather grow coffee. “We should not need a pandemic to argue for the silencing of weapons,” he said, urging the Council to see COVID-19 as a reminder that “we are stronger when we are united”.

In the ensuing discussion, Council members agreed that Colombia must forge ahead with implementing the peace agreement and that violence — particularly in rural areas — must come to a halt. They also underscored the risks that the novel coronavirus outbreak holds for the humanitarian situation.

The representative of the United States said her Government is providing $8.5 million to help Colombia respond to the pandemic, aimed at monitoring the spread of the virus, providing water and sanitation supplies and managing cases. “The rise in COVID-19 cases is worsening an already fragile humanitarian situation,” she said, adding that it is further stretching available health and social services for vulnerable populations — including more than 1.8 million Venezuelan refugees and other displaced persons living in Colombia. Welcoming steps by the Government to ensure continued implementation of the peace agreement, she voiced concern that criminal groups have recently targeted high-profile leaders, coinciding with the onset of COVID-19. The United States remains engaged in efforts to reduce coca cultivation and cocaine production, extend State presence and promote integrated rural development, she said.

The representative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, speaking also on behalf of Niger, Tunisia and South Africa, welcomed the National Liberation Army’s ceasefire and Bogota’s decision to keep implementing peace-related programmes despite the COVID-19 pandemic. “The peace process is at a critical stage, and neither Colombians nor the people of the Latin America and the Caribbean region can afford for this process to relapse.” She underscored the paramount importance of holistic land and agricultural reform in the countryside, and welcomed progress in promoting transitional justice, reconciliation and sustainable peace. She expressed concern, however, that women, including former combatants, still face significant challenges in accessing education and training programmes. She went on to condemn the assassination of indigenous and Afro-Colombian leaders, as well as former FARC-EP members, and called for greater efforts to guarantee the safety of the most vulnerable segments of the population.

The representative of the Dominican Republic, Council President for April, spoke in his national capacity, welcoming progress made thus far in Colombia but also noting with regret that acts of violence are continuing in some areas of the country due to the presence of illegal armed groups. All parties should guarantee a safe environment for civilians, women leaders and human rights defenders. He underscored the need to push forward social and economic reintegration, particularly by improving security for some 9,500 former combatants residing outside former Territorial Areas for Training and Reintegration. In view of COVID-19 and the Secretary-General’s call for a global ceasefire, he voiced cautious optimism about the National Liberation Army’s declaration of a one-month ceasefire and called for its continuation.

Belgium’s representative agreed that implementing the peace agreement remains the way forward, describing the commitment demonstrated by the new subnational authorities as a welcome development. Calling on the parties to make full use of the Agreement’s dispute resolution mechanisms, he said that, while COVID-19 presents additional challenges, the authorities in Colombia have put forward a strong initial response. However, he voiced concern about consistent high levels of violence against human rights defenders — emphasizing that their safety must be guaranteed — as well as recent cases of child soldier recruitment. Among other things, he called for more progress in operationalizing the Comprehensive Security and Protection Programme for Communities and Organizations in the Territories.

Germany’s representative similarly welcomed efforts by the Government to implement peace-related programmes against the backdrop of the pandemic, as well as preventative actions taken by both the Government and FARC-EP. “Balancing the consequences of COVID-19 is an extremely challenging task and the stakes are especially high with regards to the peace process,” he said, underscoring the need to “keep the political momentum alive and kicking”. Noting that social leaders and human rights defenders who support the peace agreement, indigenous leaders and women’s rights defenders — as well as former combatants — face high risks of violence, he said no efforts should be spared to protect them. Meanwhile, he joined other speakers in expressing hope that the National Liberation Army’s one‑month ceasefire will become a departure point for future engagement, leading to confidence-building measures and ultimately negotiations.

The representative of the United Kingdom, welcoming the National Liberation Army’s unilateral ceasefire, nonetheless registered serious concern about the rising numbers of killings of human rights defenders and other activists. A related action plan should soon become a reality, especially as people who rightly stay home to combat COVID-19 are potentially more easily targeted for attack. Similarly, protection measures for former FARC-EP combatants inside and outside former Territorial Areas for Training and Reintegration should be strengthened. Mechanisms to address implementation challenges already exist, including the National Commission on Security Guarantees, which should more often engage with civil society. He also called for ensuring community participation, from process design through to implementation and follow‑up, and from rural reform to crop substitution and security. As local authorities and civil society are a source of local knowledge, capacity and commitment, it makes sense that they are at the heart of efforts to secure and sustain peace.

France’s representative commended the Colombian authorities for reaffirming their commitment to peace in the current difficult context. She welcomed a positive attitude of recently elected local and regional authorities towards implementing the peace agreement, adding that a ceasefire among armed groups can renew the momentum for long-lasting peace. She agreed with the Secretary-General that the focus now must shift towards the sustainability of the peace process. The illicit crop substitution programme — a huge hope for thousands of families — must get the resources it needs for long-term success. She also emphasized that no effort must be spared to put an end to the tragic killings of social leaders, human rights defenders and former combatants, and to bring those responsible to justice. Special attention should be given to the rights and protection of women, children, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons individuals, and of persons belonging to minorities.

Indonesia’s representative said that implementation of the peace agreement depends on constant engagement between the parties, as well as with State institutions, civil society and international partners, pointing to the Commission’s 8 April videoconference as a sign that parties are adapting in the context of the 24 March quarantine. Underscoring the collective obligation to ensure implementation of the peace accord, he said the priority is to protect social leaders, rights defenders and former combatants, voicing particular concern at the situations in Putumayo and Cauca departments. He called for enhancing the National Commission on Security Guarantees, the National Protection Unit and the Special Investigations Unit. Second, it is important to ensure that the benefits of reintegration reach all former combatants, regardless of where they live, while the “reintegration road map” should be implemented in a collaborative manner. A third priority should be to ensure that communities — especially victims — remain at the centre of peacebuilding efforts. He called on all armed actors in Colombia to “put life above any other consideration” and work to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Estonia’s representative said that the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to make implementation of Colombia’s peace agreement “much more challenging”. Welcoming the Government’s efforts to combat the novel coronavirus, as well as the National Liberation Army’s announcement of a ceasefire, he said that victims of the conflict must remain at the centre of the peace process going forward. Welcoming also the firm commitment of most former FARC-EP members to the peace process, he said that a comprehensive transition is key to reintegrating former combatants into society with dignity. He urged the Government to do all it can to stop the tragic killings of social leaders, human rights defenders and former combatants, adding that protection measures for former combatants living in places outside the former Territorial Areas for Training and Reintegration need to be extended.

Viet Nam’s representative echoed support for recent positive developments in Colombia, including the National Liberation Army’s announcement of a one-month ceasefire in response to COVID-19. Urging other armed groups to follow suit, he called on the United Nations, Member States, international organizations and others active in Colombia to urgently take preventive measures to combat the pandemic. He voiced concern that FARC-EP and the Government still have differences regarding the compliance with their obligations under the peace agreement, and that human rights defenders, former combatants and social leaders continue to suffer violent attacks linked to criminal organizations and illegal armed groups. As the Government works to end those attacks, the root causes of failure of reconciliation and long-term peace must be unceasingly addressed, he said.

Claudia Blum, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Colombia, thanked Council members for their support during a reporting period in which her nation faced numerous challenges — not least among them the flow of 1.8 million Venezuelans into her country and the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Outlining efforts to fulfil Colombia’s commitment to victims, ex-combatants, communities and families, she said the Government has made progress in consolidating 16 different development plans in the 170 municipalities most affected by violence and poverty — efforts which are now also backed by the new regional and local authorities. There has also been significant progress in reincorporating ex‑combatants, including through a Government allocation of $4 million for the acquisition of their land.

Turning to the country’s biggest challenge — guaranteeing the safety of ex‑combatants, human rights defenders, social leaders and vulnerable communities — she outlined a range of protection efforts, many launched by presidential order. She described initiatives aimed at combating armed drug trafficking and illegal mining groups and suppressing the cultivation of illicit crops. Turning to the unilateral ceasefire announced by “terrorist armed group” National Liberation Army on 29 March, she said that measure is only “partial” in nature, as the group has expressed its willingness to launch attacks in certain cases. Implementing the peace agreement is a two-way process requiring commitment from both the State and FARC-EP. In that context, she urged the Verification Mission to request the latter to provide information on drug‑trafficking routes, help locate missing persons and hand over assets for victims’ reparation, among other pending matters.

Representatives of China and the Russian Federation also participated in the meeting.

On Friday 24th of April 2020, Ismail Wais the IGAD Special Envoy for South Sudan told reporters by video conference from Addis Ababa that the Sant’Egidio is ""facilitating"" discussions between the South Sudanese government and the SSOMA in Rome but the process remains ""under the IGAD rules of engagement"".

In response to a question by Sudan Tribune, he further that once a peace agreement is reached the SSOMA has two alternatives if they want to participate in the three-year transition.

""One alternative, they come back and again join their former institutions. The other alternative is to stand alone and join the process but not in the implementation as such. So they can prepare themselves and participate in the elections within three years, and take any activities or mandate given to them by the people of South Sudan"".

In response, the SSOMA recalled its rejection of the Revitalised Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) stressing that the root causes of the conflict remain unresolved.

The R-ARCSS ""does not address the fundamental root causes of the conflict; which have been accepted and acknowledged by the government of the Republic of South Sudan in the Rome Declaration as the basis of Rome Peace Process,"" SSOMA said.

The opposition alliance, further, brushed aside the two alternatives offered by the IGAD special envoy saying they are ""misplaced"", adding these options ""have never been considered before"".

""It must be explicitly stated that at present, SSOMA does not follow any rules of engagement other than those that have been set up by the Community of Sant’Egidio peace initiative"".

This conference report outlines the main findings of the workshop on ‘European Security’ organised by RUSI and the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC) in February 2021 as part of the UK–Russia Security Dialogue. The dialogue is a proven format that has provided an opportunity for RUSI and RIAC to bring together experts from the two countries to discuss key questions, including sensitive security issues, at a time when this kind of interaction is the exception rather than the rule.

UK–Russia relations have become increasingly strained over the past decade, notably from 2014 following Russia’s actions in Crimea and the war in eastern Ukraine, which together marked a turning point in the bilateral relationship. In the subsequent years, there have been a series of efforts by Western European leaders, including from the UK, to reset relations with Russia. Despite these efforts, relations have continued to deteriorate. Against this background, the prospect for a reset of the sort that was pursued between the US and Russia in 2009 seems, at present, dim.

Given this environment, the focus of the current dialogue workshop was on how to reduce the chances for open military confrontation between NATO and Russia, especially in Europe, and on maintaining mutual engagement in the spheres where it is absolutely crucial.

The UK’s position in Europe has undergone significant evolution in recent years, although European security remains a core focus in the ‘Global Britain’ agenda. Previously preoccupied with Brexit, the UK government has started to move beyond negotiations on the UK’s departure from the EU to fashion a revised foreign and security policy. Even though EU–UK relations might remain tense for some time, it is clear that the UK is committed to working closely with both the EU and major European powers on foreign and security policy. Equally, the transatlantic relationship will remain a core part of the UK approach to European security. As a result, UK approaches to Russia will be closely aligned with its European and North American allies.

Indeed, in contrast to the apprehension about the reliability of the US as a security partner under Donald Trump, cooperation with President Joe Biden’s administration is likely to give a new momentum to transatlantic ties. These ties are based on mutual interests and reflect largely similar approaches to Russia. Following Brexit, the UK has ensured that sanctions relating to Russia continue to operate effectively by replacing the existing EU legislation with national measures.

For Russia, it is of paramount importance which mode of interaction the Biden administration will opt for in relations with Moscow. President Biden might be a more difficult partner, but the Russian view is that opportunities for some positive moves by NATO should not be ruled out. The integration of military-to-military contact into the political discussions of the NATO–Russia Council could be an important initial step to help promote stability and manage relations. From a Russian perspective, such a move should not be seen by the Alliance as a step to appease Russia or as a departure from NATO’s established approach, but rather as a step that would lay the ground for more dialogue.

Moderate optimism can be expressed about the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) regarding measures to overcome its institutional crisis and Sweden’s chairmanship in 2021, which may bring new opportunities. Russia chairing the Arctic Council from 2021 to 2023 provides a further opportunity to open the space for cooperation in some areas that affect the security situation in the High North.

With UK–Russia relations likely to be difficult, it is imperative that efforts remain focused on the realistic goal of developing a ‘new normalcy’ to stabilise the situation. Moves from confrontation to cooperation are unlikely given that both sides have irreconcilable visions of the essence of the international system and cite the lack of trust as an underlying impediment to normalisation. In this situation, it is important that efforts to exchange information and views continue and that there is further work on confidence-building measures to manage confrontation to lower risks and costs.

Summary of the Discussion

This UK–Russia dialogue workshop explored the various political and security issues affecting the contemporary European security landscape and provided an opportunity to share threat perceptions and consider the potential to mitigate security risks. The participants presented their countries’ strategic priorities and perspectives on the evolving nature of European security, including the prospects for arms control. The workshop also introduced the sub-regional perspective by focusing on the security complex in the Baltic Sea, Northern Europe and the Arctic.

The discussion focused on: the challenges that the European regional security order faces; the dangers stemming from its fragmentation; the erosion of much of the post-Cold War arms control regime; and the ebbing of the credibility of the OSCE, which faced a deep institutional crisis in 2020.

UK–Russia Relations

UK contributors noted that there have been a number of factors that have strained the UK–Russia relationship, such as the Russian annexation of Crimea and the military incursion into eastern Ukraine in 2014, Russian interference during the 2016 Brexit referendum, the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko on UK soil in 2006, the 2018 Salisbury chemical weapons attack and the attempted murder of Alexei Navalny in 2020. Some of these actions have led to the introduction of UK sanctions against Russia. Against this backdrop, the resumption of cooperative ties between the governments does not look feasible and the restoration of direct military cooperation is unlikely.

Citing this environment, the overarching idea of the discussion shared by most participants was that the status quo in relations between Russia and the UK – a ‘new normalcy’ – is not desirable but sustainable, is ‘not acceptable but bearable’. This perception about the potential for relations is likely to continue to inform the policy responses by both sides in the foreseeable future. Participants noted that the current state of affairs appears to be characterised by a situation in which both parties have reciprocal expectations that the steps towards normalisation need to come from the other side.

At the same time, participants underlined the importance of measures to reduce the chances of open confrontation. A key theme to emerge from the discussion was, thus, the need to maintain engagement in the spheres where it is most crucial.

A Russian participant expressed his concern that the decision taken by NATO in April 2014 to sever ties with Russia had grave repercussions in terms of increasing the risks of unintended military escalation. In the absence of an appropriate venue for discussions, many in the Russian expert community would like to see the governments of Russia and NATO countries start to discuss imminent threats in order to anticipate areas of tension and to set in place the means to de-escalate confrontations.

It was recognised that, at present, communication tends to start only when the risks become unacceptable, like in Syria. With important, but narrow, mechanisms for preventing dangerous military incidents already in place, there is no incentive to conduct political talks on the factors that could lead to confrontation.

It was noted that a key role for expert discussions such as the UK–Russia dialogue should be to alert governments to the possibility that ‘acceptable risks today can become unacceptable tomorrow’. The prevention of tensions or even resolution of some areas of dispute is thus crucial to managing the current difficult relations and avoiding a further dangerous deterioration. A Russian participant noted, however, that the West seems not to be ready for a selective approach to Russia which would allow for the compartmentalisation of the bilateral agenda into independent areas.

UK participants observed that while relations with Russia are difficult, the current status quo is viewed as sustainable and there are many other issues on the international security agenda for the UK to focus on beyond relations with Russia. At the same time, it was noted that if Russia does not shift its approach in the coming years, which was deemed unlikely, the transatlantic community will increasingly focus on deterrence and risk management in their relations with Russia.

It was noted that following a series of unsuccessful outreaches to Russia by NATO members, the Allies do not feel they should be the demandeurs in terms of the reset with Russia or for arms control initiatives. A UK participant observed that recent efforts by Western European states to reach out to Russia, including President Emmanuel Macron’s initiative and the visit to Moscow by EU High Representative Josep Borrell, bore no fruit and did not generate a positive response from the Russian side.

Thus, for any reset to occur, it was suggested that Russia would have to take the first steps. This would need to involve addressing the issues that have strained relations between Russia and the West, notably the annexation of Crimea, military intervention in Ukraine and actions in the Middle East, as well as Russian activities in the cyber domain. At the same time, the widespread view in the UK is that the Russian government does not believe that it is currently in its interests to make substantial concessions in relation to eastern Ukraine, over the joint management of the Syrian issue or in regard to its cyber activities.

The Challenges Facing Arms Control in Europe

The significant risks for a new arms race emerging in Europe were discussed at length. Participants were sceptical about the prospects of another golden age for arms control emerging, comparable to the one in the 1960s after the Cuban and Berlin crises, or in the late 1980s when the Soviet Union sought a radical change in its policies towards NATO and the West. Conventional arms control in Europe – based on the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), the Vienna Document and the Open Skies Treaty – is in demise and the existing regimes are no longer considered adequate to address contemporary security threats.

There was consensus that the erosion of the nuclear arms control architecture between the US and Russia poses a serious threat to European security, even if the UK and other European states are not direct participants in US–Russia treaties. Following the demise of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, the extension at the beginning of 2021 of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) between Moscow and Washington was met with relief. This positive step to renew the last remaining arms control agreement was hailed by Russian and UK participants, albeit a deal reached in an emergency rather than as a result of a wide r détente.

The collapse in recent years of the last remaining confidence- and security-building measures in Europe was noted as emblematic of the rapid deterioration of Russia–West relations. The US under the Trump administration withdrew from the Open Skies Treaty in November 2020, accusing Russia of treaty violations that made continued US membership impossible. In January 2021, Moscow announced it would follow the US and withdraw from the Treaty, citing the failure of NATO signatories to agree to its demands not to share information from the Russian surveillance flights with the US.

Though the future of the agreement remains uncertain, a Russian expert welcomed the possibility of the Biden administration returning the US to the Treaty. It was opined that Russia actually launched the withdrawal procedure to send the signal to the US that renewing its participation should be considered an urgent matter.

Workshop participants indicated that it is unlikely that there will be progress towards Europe-wide conventional arms control, along the lines of the adapted CFE treaty, in the foreseeable future. Russian participants expressed support for consultations to address the risks around sensitive areas where NATO and Russia border with each other – in the Baltic and the Black Sea regions. The aim should be to, at minimum, establish the sub-regional arrangements that could prevent unintended security escalations.

It was also noted that it should be a priority to extend confidence-building measures into the Barents and Norwegian Seas, which are the overlapping areas of operations by the Russian Northern Fleet and the recently re-established US Second Fleet. Participants recognised, however, that NATO did not accept the idea of concluding separate sub-regional agreements with Russia. One of the benefits of re-establishing NATO–Russia military-to-military dialogue was identified as providing a more credible notification arrangement on ground forces and, thus, a means to improve transparency and trust.

On the arms control regime in Europe, Russian participants indicated that Moscow would welcome European initiatives on arms control mechanisms but noted that Russia assessed that European capitals are wary of Washington’s reactions to such initiatives and oversensitive to potential criticism.

At the same time, the Russian perception of Europe as lacking strategic autonomy on security issues loomed in the discussions when a Russian discussant expressed the belief that for the Russian defence establishment, talking to Europeans about arms control when the US is not at the table has no practical sense.

The fate of the Chemical Weapons Convention was discussed. A UK participant raised the issue of the large-scale use of chemical weapons in Syria, where Russia is supporting the regime of Bashar Al-Assad. The use of banned chemical agents for attempted assassinations was also noted. These actions were identified as policies that seriously erode trust in Russia’s commitment to adhere to legally binding treaties.

Against the background of the chemical weapons attacks in Salisbury in 2018 and the attempted poisoning of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in 2020 using a prohibited nerve agent, restoring the credibility of the Chemical Weapons Convention and Russia’s adherence to its provisions were seen as a cornerstone for improving relations with the West.

The deterioration of arms control arrangements was seen as reflective of the wider breakdown of the crisis management functions of the OSCE. Experts agreed that there were some improvements at the end of 2020 with agreement on the appointment of the organisation’s institutional heads and with the stable hand of the Swedish chairmanship guiding this process. But the continuous tensions around these institutions, which embody the comprehensive security concept at the core of the OSCE, and the lack of significant progress around the organisation’s regional conflict management activities, were raised. The limited levers available to the OSCE during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war were also highlighted.

A Russian expert opined that Moscow does not see a bigger independent role for the OSCE in crisis management and arms control, since it views the organisation as an instrument that has been privatised by the West. The Russia–NATO relationship was identified as a better-placed format to discuss arms control issues.

Perspectives on the Security of Northern Europe

In the session devoted to discussing Northern Europe and the Arctic, the Baltic sub-region was identified as the most dangerous environment. At the same time, the Arctic can no longer be considered as a region insulated from tensions. The vision of the Arctic as a region of peace and cooperation may no longer hold true as the security mechanisms of the past are losing their relevance.

The discussion highlighted differences in perceptions between UK and Russian specialists on the military dynamics in the region. Russia sees Northern Europe and the Baltic Sea as two distinct regions, while the UK – together with the other states of Northern Europe – increasingly see these areas as a single security space.

A Russian participant contended that assessments that Moscow is militarising the region are exaggerated; there is force modernisation, rather than the creation of new offensive capabilities. These modernisation programmes, it was argued, do not violate the military balance or provoke an arms race in the region, and are aimed to make the Russian armed forces better prepared to deal with non-traditional security threats.

A British discussant noted, however, that Russia’s increased sense of security is creating a growing sense of insecurity among its neighbours. Russia has extended its capabilities in air defence and other areas beyond its borders in order to protect its strategic forces located in the north. With new capabilities, it is able to project power beyond the Arctic into the North Atlantic.

As a result of Russian activities in the region, the transatlantic community assesses that the security environment has changed substantively. NATO, including the UK, has developed a much keener interest in the region, and NATO Arctic states that were previously resistant to the Alliance having a regional role are shifting to accept that it can be an interlocutor on Arctic military questions. There is a perception that there needs to be an Alliance response to Russian activities with a growing focus on the Greenland–Iceland–UK gap.

With new actors, including China, coming into the region, Russia is on the defensive. Responding to a question about whether Russia is prepared to talk to NATO about the Arctic and managing military tensions, it was noted that Russia is opposed to seeing more NATO engagement in the region, and security dialogue should be conducted among the five littoral states directly.

Conclusions

The workshop highlighted the importance of maintaining a channel for candid talks between Russia and the UK’s expert communities. There were a number of areas of consensus, in the sense that both sides recognised the need to maintain a dialogue without illusions in order to, at minimum, better understand each other’s perspective and positions. Participants agreed that the UK and Russia should be aware of the real potential risks of any further deterioration in European security at the cost of an arms race, or even unwanted confrontation. Dialogue participants also highlighted that, despite the bilateral difficulties, there are ways that both parties can manage the risks of the ‘new normal’ situation. There is, thus, an urgent need to explore how this can be achieved effectively.

A realistic assessment of UK–Russia relations points to the need for both sides to recognise that the focus of bilateral ties should be on developing pragmatic and limited areas of cooperation. Discussion of a wholesale reset, which is not feasible at present, should be avoided. Some of those pragmatic areas could be talks about how to make progress on arms control, ways to strengthen military-to-military contacts, and maintaining the discussions on threat perceptions and regional security.

Afghanistan between Government Crisis and a U.S. Peace Deal with the Taliban,"Executive Summary

With a US-Taliban is again at a decisive moment where it’s political and social order and its role as a Western partner are renegotiated. The Taliban leadership seems ready to move from combat to politics. The current government crisis and hardened intra-Afghan conflicts put the pluralist-democratic achievements of the past twenty years at risk when going to the negotiation table with the Taliban. If the inner political struggles remain unsolved, Afghans risk losing all, its hard-won democracy and prospects for peace.

Introduction

On 29 February 2020, the USA signed a peace agreement with the Taliban leadership in Qatar. The agreement could put an end to almost twenty years of war and violence between the Taliban, the Afghan government and international NATO forces. The agreement regulates the withdrawal of foreign troops – a long-standing demand of the Taliban movement – an anti-terror guarantee on the part of the Taliban, the modalities for a comprehensive ceasefire and the start of intra-Afghan negotiations. With the Taliban’s intended international legalisation and participation in the government in Kabul, the political and societal order of the Afghan Republic is up for negotiation for the first time since the fall of the Taliban Emirate in 2001.

On 18 February 2020, only two weeks before the signing of the U.S.-Taliban peace deal and almost five months after the Afghan presidential elections in September last year, the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) announced the final election results. As expected, incumbent President Ashraf Ghani was declared the winner with 50.64 percent of the vote. Second was the current head of government, CEO Abdullah, with 39.52 percent. With the announcement of the official election results, the political polarization between Ghani supporters and opponents, above all the camp of former CEO Abdullah, had critically intensified. The main political rivals accuse President Ghani’s team of election fraud.

With a U.S.-Taliban agreement on a NATO troop’s withdrawal signed, a critical government crisis after contested presidential elections and intra-Afghan peace negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government in the making, Afghanistan is again at a defining turning point where its political system, national identity and role as a Western partner may be renegotiated.

This paper gives an overview on the current political developments and conditions for peace, inherent weaknesses in the post-2001 Afghan political setting and asks about what would be at stake in intra-Afghan negotiations if the Taliban (co-)ruled the government in Kabul again.

Roadmap to Peace: From Bilateral to Intra-Afghan

2019 started as a promising year. When the USA began official peace talks with the Taliban for the first time in Doha, Qatar in February 2019, there was great optimism that a new chapter in the almost 20-year conflict between the Taliban, the Afghan government, and NATO forces might begin. This was the closest the country has come to a political solution since 2001.

On 29 February 2020, the USA signed a bilateral agreement with the Taliban leadership in Doha, Qatar. The agreement outlines a roadmap to a peaceful political settlement covering four main areas: (1) the withdrawal of foreign troops, (2) an anti-terrorism guarantee by the Taliban, (3) the question of a comprehensive ceasefire and (4) the start of intra-Afghan negotiations. The main hurdle to peace is now to include the Afghan government into the peace agreement and transform the bilateral U.S.-Taliban roadmap into an inclusive intra-Afghan process.

(1) Withdrawal of troops

The agreement regulates the withdrawal of foreign troops, the longstanding core demand of the Taliban. The USA has agreed to a successive reduction of its troops from more than 12,000 to 8,600 within 135 days (by mid-July 2020) and is holding out the prospect of a total withdrawal of all U.S. and NATO troops within 14 months (by April 2021).

Meanwhile, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg had declared the continuation of international support for the Afghan security sector. The international community finances the salaries and maintenance of the Afghan Security and Defence Forces (ANDSF).[1] The United States finance roughly half of the Afghan national security budget and almost fully the Afghan armed forces (AAF). The Afghan National Police (ANP) and the Afghan Local Police (ALP) are financed and trained by the international community through the UNDP Law and Order Trust Fund for Afghanistan (LOTFA). Security analysts had repeatedly warned that a critical US disengagement from the security sector without further support would lead to the collapse of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDF).[2]

(2) Taliban anti-terrorism guarantee

The Taliban have given a guarantee that they will not provide protection or assistance to terrorist groups such as to al-Qaida, the Islamic State of Wilayat Khorasan (ISKP) or to any other groups and individuals that pose a threat against the United States or its allies. The Taliban’s refusal in 2001 to hand over al-Qaida chief Usama bin Ladin after the 9/11 attacks and cut their alleged links to Al-Qaida were the initial reason for the U.S. and NATO military engagement and toppling of the Taliban regime.

(3) Comprehensive and permanent ceasefire

The modalities for a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire are to be negotiated in intra-Afghan negotiations. A seven-day reduction of violence, agreed by the USA and the Taliban, preceded the signing of the bilateral peace deal on February 29. The reduction of violence was a major confidence-building measure and statement of mutual commitment. In contrast to a comprehensive ceasefire, the reduction of violence was a face-saving compromise and lowered pressure on both sides as defectors are expected to continue to spoil the process. A permanent ceasefire remains the core demand of the Afghan government and the main bargaining chip of the Taliban.

(4) Intra-Afghan negotiations

Intra-Afghan negotiations between the Taliban and a broad Afghan delegation of government and other political and civil societal actors are to negotiate the modalities of the Taliban’s political integration and participation in the government in Kabul, as well as the path towards a new constitution. For peace negotiations, the Afghan government must propose a list of negotiators accepted by all sides. With regard to the current government crisis and polarisation between President Ashraf Ghani and his challengers, most notably Abdullah, this seems extremely difficult.

The agreement regulates that intra-Afghan negotiations are to be preceded by a mutual release of prisoners as a confidence-building measure: The Afghan government is to release 5,000 (out of over 10,000) Taliban prisoners; the Taliban are to release 1,000 Afghan soldiers and police officers held as prisoners by them. The prisoners release remains a delicate issue and core demand of the Taliban. The Taliban demand the full and unconditional release of 5.000 fighters according to their list and a priori to the negotiations. The Ghani government, however, offers a successive and conditions-based release. The government does not feel bound by a bilateral agreement between the United States and the Taliban, of which it was not a contracting party.

According to the bilateral U.S.-Taliban peace agreement, the USA will – within the framework of the intra-Afghan negotiations and after examination – lift its sanctions against the Taliban movement (self-designated as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan) by 27 August 2020. The United States also pledged to lobby UNSR members to equally effect a lifting of international sanctions against the Taliban.[3] In addition, the USA stated its will to seek positive economic relations with the new government emerging from the peace process and to refrain from interfering in Afghanistan’s internal affairs.

Government in Crisis

On 18 February 2020, almost five months after the Afghan presidential elections in September last year and only two weeks ahead of the signing of the US-Taliban peace agreement, the Independent Election Commission (IEC) announced the final election results. As expected, incumbent President Ashraf Ghani was declared the winner with 50.64 percent of the vote. Second was the by then head of government (CEO), Abdullah Abdullah, with 39.52 percent.

With election results announced, the already intense political polarization between Ghani supporters and opponents, above all his main challenger Abdullah, had critically intensified. Opponents to President Ghani accused his team of election fraud. The international community remained conspicuously silent and observant the first days after the announced results. India, one of the Afghan government’s closest political allies, was among the first states to congratulate Ghani on his election victory.

On 09 March, Ashraf Ghani hold his presidential inauguration ceremony in the Presidential Palace (Arg) in Kabul in the presence of Western and international diplomats. At the same time, in Sapidar Palace within the Arg premises, Abdullah declared himself state president in the presence of Afghan political figures such as former Mujahideen commanders Abdul Rashid Dostum (formerly allied with Ghani) and Muhammad Mohaqiq.

The contest of President Ghani’s second term came at an unfavourable time. For the forthcoming intra-Afghan negotiations with the Taliban, the political divisions and polarisation are weakening the political solidarity and unity that is needed to defend the values of the Afghan Republic against the Taliban’s demands for an Islamic Emirate.

Fragmentation, but no Separatism

Despite the dangerous political polarization that is currently peaking and sometimes simplified as a natural ethnic-regional divide, political opinions and loyalties are more complex. Political loyalties in government and parliament as well as voting behavior are usually told to be fractured along ethnic, tribal, regional or sectarian cleavages and power brokers. They are, however, fluid and flexible and, as currently seen in the shifting of political alliances, often based on opportunistic calculations.

Political loyalties and trust are often given to political figures or power brokers who have personal links or roots in the own community. However, identities and faultlines overlap and run at different levels. At times, loyalties and interests may be more defined by personal obligations or feuds, sometimes identities and feelings of belonging are more defined by the region (manteqa) rather than ethnicity (qawm).[4]

Despite tribal, ethnic, regional or linguistic fragmentations, there is no separatist or secessionist movement in Afghanistan. Neither is there the desire of ethnic groups to join their fellows in the neighbour countries, such as Tajiks joining Tajikistan, Uzbeks joining Uzbekistan, Turkmen joining Turkmenistan, or Pashtuns joining Pakistan.[5] Until the present day, Afghans have found a unitary state as more advantageous and protective against foreign influence and meddling.[6]

The current government crisis is less an ethnic (Pashto/non-Pashtu) or regional (Kabul vs. North) divide. It may rather reveal a fragmentation along inter-generational and inter-elite conflicts between a declining but still powerful political class of former Mujahideen freedom fighters and a small intellectual-cosmopolitan, non-Mujahideen elite currently in government. It shows the contest by former political elites of military commanders and tribal leaders for lost power and influence.

The new post-Taliban generation

The current government crisis also expresses a generational conflict and the polarization between an empowered generation of young, urbanized and cosmopolitan Afghans and the perceived marginalized political class of former Mujahideen fighters who had formed the new social and political elite after the Russian invasion in 1979.

Afghanistan has one of the youngest societies in the world. 40 percent of the population is under the age of 15 years, more than 60 percent is under 25.[7] The majority of the population in the government-controlled areas knows the Mujahideen fighting and life under the Taliban rule in the 1990s only from stories and media.

Thanks to President Ghani’s modernization and rejuvenation of the state bureaucracy, the new generation is already in high-profile government positions. In the Afghan government and diplomatic service, a number of deputy ministers and ambassadors are under the age of 30, including women.

Ghani’s modernization policy also had its price. Similarly to the top-down modernization policy of King Amanullah Khan a hundred years ago, the reorganisation under the Ghani administration has upset parts of the conservative establishment, tribal elders and elites, and first and foremost, the political class of former Mujahideen fighters. Critique and prejudice against a young, internationally educated governmental elite under the age of 30, often holding dual citizenships, has upset those Afghans that have similarly suffered or fought under the Taliban regime, and now feel left behind or sidelined.

Weaknesses and Flaws in the Afghan Political System

Not only the government and political power brokers, but the political system as a whole has remained weakened and in parts dysfunctional. Some dysfunctions are rooted in the constitutional or legal setup. Others are grounded in the lack of implementation or observance of legal norms when informal justice or social habits predominate.

The drafters of the current Constitution of 2004 intended to design a presidential system with a strong head of state who would be constrained by a parliament vested with strong oversight and legislative powers.[8] In practice, the executive was split since 2014 between a President and a Chief Executive Officer (CEO), a quasi-head of government not provided for in the constitution. This power triangle between the President, the CEO and the parliament has been marked by hostilities and destructive blockade policies.

The lack of credible and disciplined political parties has facilitated a fragmented and weak parliament, unable to present united coalition fronts towards an executive dominance. Since 2005, only five laws that were passed came of the parliament’s initiative, as there is no effective parliamentary group. The Presidential Palace has been the dominating power in ruling and initiating laws and policies.[9]

The Single non-transferable vote (SNTV) system, applied in Afghanistan and only a few countries worldwide, even more facilitates the personalization and fragmentation of opinions, distorts the representativity to the benefit of minorities and marginalizes the role of political parties for aggregating opinions and votes.

Executive and legislative powers have been, at times, overstretched or misused against each other. At times, the government sidelined the parliament or simply ignored legislative decisions.[10] But also parliament members did not hesitate to misuse their legislative oversight powers such as no-confidence votes or the right to impeach government ministers for their own retaliatory or individual purposes.[11]

Legal security and access to justice is weak. In provinces and districts where government justice is weak or the Taliban prevail, informal justice systems or Taliban courts have become a well-received alternative to state courts for daily disputes. Where judgments of state courts have the reputation of requiring lengthy procedures and the payment of bribes, Taliban courts are told to be fast, unbiased and non-corrupt. The legitimacy and legal status of Taliban courts put aside, their popular reputation vis-à-vis state courts weakens the popular trust in the republican institutions which is urgently needed.

Corruption is endemic in state and public institutions as well as in foreign-funded state-building projects. At the Corruption Perceptions Index of Transparency International, Afghanistan ranks on place 173 (out of 180).[12] The post-2001 international reconstruction has strengthened structures of neo-patrimonial governance. State offices in government, parliament, justice or educational institutions are seen as places of self-enrichment and personal insurance. This adds to the value of and competition for state offices or parliamentarian seats and undermines the morality and protection of those officials who want to carry out their duties honestly and conscientiously.

Trade off between Peace and Democracy?

With the resumption of the peace process in 2018 between the United States and the Taliban, the so-called “Doha process”, many democracy activists and advocates for human and women rights fear that Afghanistan’s liberal-democratic achievements may be sacrificed for the sake of peace. Many of them see a considerable risk that the foreign troops withdrawal without political guarantees could leave the political sway to the Taliban and endanger the democratic achievements.

In the Doha process, the Taliban continue to advocate for an Islamic Emirate. For the Afghan government and civil society, the question remains to what extent the Taliban’s political attitude and willingness to compromise has changed since the 1990s. Would the Taliban agree to the protection of fundamental liberal-pluralist rights? Will they accept peaceful transitions of power by means of democratic elections?

The intra-Afghan negotiations will put the political system and the social order back on the negotiating table. In the Doha process, the Taliban had already announced that a constitutional amendment was a necessary condition for the implementation of a peace agreement.

What it would mean in detail remains unclear. The Taliban leadership is keeping a low profile on the question of the concrete form of an Islamic state or emirate for several reasons. For one thing, the Taliban do not want to make concrete political promises in advance and by this give up their negotiating cards. Nor do they want to deter the other side with political demands right from the start.[13] Secondly, they have no elaborated vision or idea of what an Islamic state could look like for a multi-ethnic, multi-sectarian, culturally diverse and globally connected Afghan society.

Unlike other Islamist movements, the Taliban movement does not have a sophisticated political ideology based on a binding, written, theoretical framework. Rather, according to Islamic scholars, the Taliban movement is held together by a common creed.[14] The political Taliban leadership in Qatar is anxious to present the Taliban movement as a homogeneous and unified group that is bound together by a clear conviction and command structure.

Emirate vs. Republic: What to expect from a Taliban Power-sharing in Kabul?

With regard to the Taliban’s willingness to compromise, one can only speculate on the basis of the experiences during the Taliban rule of the 1990s, of reports from Taliban-controlled districts, and of what the Taliban leadership communicates on its media portals.

The intra-Afghan negotiations and a national reconciliation process will have to address the questions of power-sharing, power transitions and governance, the status of human rights and individual freedoms, and Afghanistan’s foreign relations with its neighbours and the international community.

Religious vs. Democratic Legitimacy

In the Doha process, the Taliban leadership emphasized that it does not claim sole dominance, but would agree to share power. It is unclear if the Taliban would also agree to democratic shifts in power and to a democratic legitimacy of the state. This will be the thin line between an Islamic Emirate and the current Islamic Republic. The Taliban deputy leader Sirajuddin Haqqani stated that the kind of (Islamic) government depends on the consensus among Afghans.[15] In intra-Afghan negotiations, the Taliban will advocate for the inclusion of theocratic elements in the constitution, but may possibly compromise with an Islamic Republic which would be highly overseen by religious Mullahs or a religious scholar-elite (Ulama).

Just like its two neighbour countries Iran and Pakistan, Afghanistan is an Islamic Republic. It is, however, clearly different from the Islamic Republic of Iran, a hybrid system of theocratic and democratic elements in which the state is also responsible for defining and enforcing social morals. A state in which democratic elections and changes of power take place only below a council of guardians (as in Iran) or an Islamic shura council could possibly be a semi-democratic and republican model that the Taliban may engage in.[16] The Taliban leadership would welcome a certain democratic or popular legitimacy as well as the international recognition as long as it does not threaten their share in power and their main concepts of society.

Women Rights, Public Morality and Gender Policy

The question of women rights and gender policy under a new Taliban-ruled government in Kabul occupies many debates. In the 1990s, the main changes the Taliban regime imposed on society were related to the freedoms of women and gender, most notably the right of women to education, to work and to participate and appear in public.[17] The ban on women to work and their restriction of mobility in public had the severest immediate impact, also because many families existentially relied on the income of women.

In the current Doha peace process, the Taliban announced to guarantee women’s rights in accordance with Islamic values. Their narrative circles around providing protection for women and omits the question of women participation. Its leadership acknowledges women’s right to education and work but demands the observance of an Islamic dress code such as wearing the veil (hijab).[18]

In strictly Islamic but well-educated countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran, women are increasingly conquering the job market and make up half of university students. For Saudi or Iranian middle-class women, it is common to strive for high education and professional careers, under the observance of gender segregation and Islamic dress codes in public.

A Taliban-ruled government would probably seek to apply similar regulations in Afghanistan. Even if Taliban will not demand a ban on women education or work, Afghan women will probably find it much harder to acquire high-ranking government positions and even be formally banned from taking certain state positions such as state judges or state president.

Gender segregation is still very common in Afghanistan’s conservative and male-dominated society. School education is largely gender-separated; co-education is only practiced at university and partly in elementary schools. Also the dress code of both women and men, including the urban centers and the capital Kabul, are highly conservative and respecting Islamic morality codes.

The main changes a Taliban co-ruled government in Kabul would therefore bring to the post-2001 liberal-democratic achievements must be rather expected in the content of education and in the freedom of expression and thinking.

Media Pluralism and Freedom of Expression

One of Afghanistan’s main achievements of the post-2001 order is its considerably free and pluralistic media landscape which is unique compared to the state-controlled media in the regional neighbour countries. Even though media outlets have been economically struggling over the past years, and are often financed and influenced by political power brokers, Afghanistan has a remarkable and flourishing debate culture and freedom of expression. At the same time, the country’s precarious security situation makes it one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists. According to Reporters Without Borders, it therefore ranks 121st out of 180 in the global ranking of press freedom.[19]

What seems to be most under threat under a co-ruled Taliban government would be today’s open debate culture in public media, university life and civil society. The pluralist media landscape and the content of the education system would probably be the first areas that Taliban politicians would attempt to transform.

Foreign Policy and Relations with the International Community

Since their emergence to power in 1995, the Taliban movement has sought international recognition. However, only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had acknowledged their declared Islamic Emirate until its toppling in 2001. The Taliban’s motivation is two-sided. On the one hand, the leadership wants to get out of international isolation and sanctions. According to their present statements, they seek good relations with Afghanistan’s neighbours and the international community. The Taliban leadership has stated its interest to keep the international community engaged in Afghanistan to secure postwar development and reconstruction aid.[20]

On the other hand, even though the political leadership sends the message that they do not pursue an isolationist approach, they demand from foreign countries to stop interfering in Afghanistan’s domestic political, social or cultural affairs and endeavour to re-install Afghanistan’s full sovereignty and independence.[21] The Taliban leadership announced to be committed to international law and conventions as long as they are compatible with Islamic principles.[22]

Under a Taliban co-ruled government, the foreign relations of Afghanistan would shift. It would possibly diversify its foreign relations and look out for non-Western partners like Russia, China, Turkey, or even Iran. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, the current host country of the Taliban leadership, could make use of their privileged relations and ideological closeness with the Islamist movement. Yet, the Taliban leadership is cautious not to become a minion of any foreign country, including Pakistan.[23] With India, the largest regional donor country (even before China) and the closest regional ally of the current Afghan government, a Taliban-led government would not have a similarly warm and close relationship. Yet, in the past decades of various sorts of support from Pakistan, the Taliban leadership has been keen to keep itself out of the Indian-Pakistani conflict.

Outlook: Republic at Stake?

Last year, Afghanistan commemorated 100 years of the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919, which brought full sovereignty from British tutelage to Afghanistan under King Amanullah Khan. A hundred years after its independence, Afghanistan remains politically, militarily and financially dependent on foreign allies and vulnerable to external conflicts of power and interests. The Kulturkampf started more than one hundred years ago between religious conservative, new radical Islamist, and liberal-secular thinking is still to be settled. This contest of ideas is today overlapped by an inter-generational and inter-elite conflict between a still powerful political elite of former Mujahideen freedom fighters and a new technocrat intellectual elite currently in government. Both of them claim to be the guardians and representatives of the Afghan Republic vis-à-vis the Taliban.

Twenty years after the fall of the Taliban, Afghanistan is once again at a defining turning point where the political system, national identity and role as a Western partner are being renegotiated. For the war-weary population, the prospect of a ceasefire and the freedom of movement and quality of life that it will bring is a priority. The Taliban leadership seems willing to move from combat to politics. In order to secure the achievements of freedom and achieve a sustainable peace, all sections of society must work for national reconciliation and social cohesion within the highly fragmented, suspicious and traumatised Afghan society. Furthermore, to be sustainable, the intra-Afghan reconciliation must be meaningfully complemented by an intra-regional dialogue.

Afghanistan is stranded in political quicksand, again. It was mid-February when its election institutions ended a five-month count and handed Ashraf Ghani a second Presidential term. But his main challenger Dr Abdullah still alleges large-scale fraud and continues the parallel government he setup in protest. Mediation by Afghan elders and the US also continues, with Secretary Pompeo even threatening to strip $1 billion of US aid.

The easy analysis says this is an ego-fuelled spat between an uncompromising winner and a sore loser that stalls progress on peace. Disunity and political crisis prevent substantive negotiations with the Taliban and further erodes public trust in politicians just as COVID-19 takes hold.

Or is there another way to look at it?

First, is it a crisis? Think of it more as a negotiation. Afghan political crises emerge periodically and will continue to, especially on the path to peace. ‘Crisis’ is a bargaining tool, used by certain elites to try to extract concessions and secure interests when they perceive change that threatens their standing or access to state resources.

Second, think of this crisis—or negotiation—as a step towards peace. Afghan peace is not about hugging it out and exchanging guns for flowers. It is about re-shaping the existing elite balance of power in a way that incorporates the Taliban. But to reshape it, it first needs to exist. That is what the current political crisis is doing. It is the negotiation to create a balance of power between the President and the many ethno-political factions that form the political opposition. The National Unity Government of the past five years was that kind of accommodation. It had flaws but it did meld most of the political factions together. Something similar is needed again. Without it, a government-only peace team would have to negotiate peace on (at least) two fronts—with the political opposition and with the Taliban.

What all this highlights is that an Afghan peace process is less about negotiating peace than negotiating power. It should enable powerbrokers, including Taliban, to bargain for access to state resources but without bullets and bombs. It is about reconfiguring the political make-up, i.e. a new division of the pie among those who control—or can rally—constituencies. Political antagonism and historical grievances will not end though: it is about peace, not reconciliation.

Enter the formalized political unsettlement.

This is a concept from academic literature on inclusive peace deals.[1] It is basically a peace deal without resolving core issues. It instead creates institutions—inclusive of key players—that contain and manage fundamental disputes rather than solve them (as a ‘traditional’ political settlement would). Parties agree to continue negotiations but after outright violence ends. It is similar to Northern Ireland or Bosnia where peace deals created power-sharing arrangements with ethno-political divisions constitutionally enshrined in return for ending armed conflict. Put simply, war is translated into political institutions. Call it a move from conflict to politics more than conflict to peace.

Would it work in Afghanistan?

Yes. An unsettlement suits scenarios with intransigence on one or more core issues, like the nature of the state. This is the case in Afghanistan where it will be painful to find compromise between Taliban demands for an Islamic Emirate and everyone else’s insistence on protecting the Republic.

An unsettlement also solves two consistent problems in Afghan peace processes: exclusion of key actors and weak implementation (i.e. someone walks away). Afghans can make peace deals—look at Geneva in the 1980s, Peshawar and Islamabad in the 90s, Bonn or the Hezbi Islami process in the 2000s. But inclusion is the Achilles heel. An unsettlement enables inclusion. It also aids implementation because it forces foes into partnership and incentivizes them to maintain the structures and the balance of power. Paradoxically, no party ‘wins’ everything it wants but walking away is in nobody’s interest. This is why it works: everyone loses but everyone loses equally.

What makes an unsettlement attractive today is time pressure. Afghan peace efforts are being compressed into a high-speed timeline, especially with the US-Taliban deal signed and US/NATO drawdown underway. The COVID-19 crisis and its ramifications on donor fatigue will inject added haste. There is no time to wait for Afghans to negotiate a ‘comprehensive’ deal. It cannot be foisted onto them either. A political unsettlement is the way to buy time for a more naturally evolving re-balancing of power while ending violence.

The strongest argument is inevitability. Some Afghan parties have already espoused similar ideas dressed up as peace plans. Multiple Afghan politicians, and US negotiator Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, raised international eyebrows by suggesting that intra-Afghan negotiations can be concluded in three months or 100 days. With many incompatible interests and historical grievances, this is only possible if some topics are pushed down the road. Important issues like transitional justice will be shunned for more pressing political inclusion and constitutional change. Formalizing a political unsettlement could at least lock the parties into an agreement that they will tackle forgotten issues eventually, rather than ignore them.

A political unsettlement can be criticized as a ‘no-war, no-peace’ stalemate. It abandons any well-defined ‘end’. ‘Muddling through’ becomes success, which is difficult to sell to the public after the initial euphoria of an end to violence wears off. You could also argue that it was tried—and failed—in Afghanistan in the early 1990s. There are lessons to learn from that period, including the need for a strong international hand to ensure women, youth and non-combatants are adequately represented. It is not perfect. But it is pragmatism, and that is required to create a new configuration of power that will hold.

Peace in Afghanistan is now about dealing in the art of the possible rather than the perfect. A political unsettlement is the best, or least worst, option.

A set of brutal attacks in Afghanistan on May 12 has thrown the very idea of a peace process into question. Many are asking whether that process is dead before it ever got under way. Yet it was always unlikely that intra-Afghan negotiations among the Afghan government, powerbrokers, the Taliban, and perhaps — under the luckiest of circumstances — Afghan society would be a linear continuation of the U.S.-Taliban deal or significantly reduce violence.

This week’s violence may well be a much more accurate, if terrible, preview of what is to come: on-and-off negotiations, suspended for lengthy periods amidst protracted violence and devastating bloodshed well past the departure of U.S. forces from Afghanistan (scheduled to be completed by July 2021).

Nonetheless, the Afghan government and elites — as well as the international community, in spite of the U.S. military withdrawal — can still shape the country’s future. Even though they have not had success so far, they should continue to press for violence reduction on the battlefield, with a focus on minimizing the most brutal targeting of civilians.

Bloodshed across the country

On the morning of May 12, three militants stormed a maternity ward in a Shia neighborhood of Kabul frequently targeted by the Islamic State in Khorasan (IS-KH). For four hours, they massacred women in labor, mothers with newborn infants in their arms, and medical personnel, killing at least 15, as male relatives outside wailed in anguish.

That same day, attackers targeted a funeral in Nangarhar, also a stronghold of IS-KH, where a suicide bomber slaughtered 25 and wounded 68.

Elsewhere in the country, the Taliban attacked military and police targets. The group had gone back to pounding Afghan security forces as soon as the ink of the U.S.-Taliban deal dried in early March. It has refused calls for a national ceasefire, in spite of the COVID-19 outbreak. It wants to negotiate from maximum battlefield strength and appease some of its middle-level commanders. It also fears its fighters would go soft during any lengthy ceasefire and be hard to remobilize.

With more than 100 dead on May 12, the Afghan government announced an end to “active defense” and promised an offensive against the Taliban. The government attributed the attacks to the Taliban, suggesting its units, such as the Haqqani group, joined forces with IS-KH. (The Taliban rejected responsibility for the Kabul and Nangarhar attacks, the latter claimed by an IS-KH affiliate.)

The peace process as it was not going to be

Ghani’s announcement is a poignant coda to the optimistic version of intra-Afghan negotiations. That version envisioned that soon after the U.S.-Taliban deal, the Taliban would sit down with the Afghan government to negotiate while keeping violence low. The U.S.-Taliban deal stipulated that the Taliban would not conduct terrorist attacks against the U.S. homeland or assets, nor allow the territory it controls to be used for external terrorism — at least against the U.S. and allies.

In turn, the United States would withdraw its forces from Afghanistan by July 2021, with a 5,600-troop reduction by July 2020. The U.S. military apparently hoped that there was an unwritten understanding that the Taliban would maintain a large (perhaps 80%) reduction in violence during the U.S. withdrawal period and negotiations with the Afghan government. The Taliban claims there was no such an oral deal; and in any case, during the entire year and half of negotiations beforehand, the Taliban was absolutely clear that it had no intention of reducing violence while it negotiates. The group understands well that the stronger it is on the battlefield, the more powerful it will be at the negotiating table — even at the cost of diminished credibility with the international community and segments of the Afghan public.

Moreover, the Taliban assumed there was an unwritten prisoner exchange deal: The United States would force the Afghan government to rapidly release 5,000 Taliban prisoners, after which the Taliban would release over 1,000 prisoners. The Ghani government refused to do so, realizing that it would give up one of few chips it has with the U.S. (in recognizing his close and contested electoral victory) and with the Taliban. Prisoner releases have proceeded in dribs and drabs.

But it is not clear that any new anti-Taliban offensive will significantly alter the battlefield. For the past several years, Afghan security forces have mostly hunkered down in a static defensive mode — no way to win a counterinsurgency. Plagued by high soldier attrition, problematic logistics and support, and ethnic and political rifts, they regularly reach accommodation with local Taliban units, sometimes discharging ammunition in fake operations about which they warn the Taliban beforehand.

The only units that have mounted serious offensive operations against the Taliban have been the capable but overused Afghan special operations forces. By and large, it has been the Taliban that has dictated the battlefield’s intense operational tempo.

The potential, but unlikely, game-changers

The larger questions are to what extent U.S. forces will come to the defense of Afghan forces and whether U.S. actions will motivate the Taliban to start attacking U.S. forces again. The U.S. military has already stated that it would continue to conduct airstrikes in defense of Afghan forces despite the resumption of offensive operations by the Afghan military. Will the Taliban simply accept U.S. air strikes — which have been the predominant reason it has not been able to hold onto provincial capitals it captured? Or, will it, despite the U.S.-Taliban deal, attack U.S. forces, perhaps using methods similar to those of pro-Iran militias in Iraq, such as lobbing missiles on U.S. bases from trucks parked nearby?

The Ghani government may well hope, as many Afghans still do, that such attacks on U.S. forces would reverse the U.S. decision to militarily withdraw. Many Afghan politicians cling to the misguided belief the United States defines Afghanistan as a geostrategic fulcrum of vital importance and thus the U.S. military will not depart. Many urban Afghans wish America will stay, fearing a withdrawal means more brutality a la May 12 and a return to the viciousness of the Taliban’s 1990s rule.

But any forthcoming Taliban attacks on the U.S. military may, in fact, motivate the Trump administration to withdraw from Afghanistan even faster.

Negotiations of a different shape

Ultimately, neither the Taliban nor the Afghan government has the option not to negotiate, because neither has the capacity to decisively prevail on the battlefield. A de facto division of Afghanistan into a portion controlled by the Taliban and portions controlled by the Afghan government (plus affiliated or more independent powerbrokers) is certainly a possibility. However, such fragmentation is not a preferred outcome for anyone: It comes with many sources of instability. Even getting to such an arrangement would involve numerous, overlapping, and complex layers of negotiations.

The real question is: How much will the battlefield have changed by the time of the negotiations, possibly when the U.S. military presence in low or zero? The battlefield conditions will be affected by a) the Taliban’s choices (such as overusing its fighters as cannon fodder) and b) how much weaker Afghan security forces will have become. Certainly, the Afghan forces will be critically undermined if the United States starts implementing cuts of $1 billion of U.S. aid this year and another next year (as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced) out of frustration with the continued lack of a political deal between President Ghani and his chief electoral opponent Abdullah Abdullah. Afghan forces are fully financially dependent on the United States. Despite his pronouncements, Ghani has no way to offset such losses of U.S. aid, either through austerity or new aid from Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, China, or India.

Without payments, Afghan forces will fracture outright, possibly buckling altogether as they did when the Soviet Union stopped paying for them at the end of the Cold War. The Taliban may be banking on such an outcome. The longer the Ghani government waits to or is unable to negotiate, the weaker it will get — not just vis-à-vis the Taliban, but also vis-à-vis Afghan powerbrokers.

Meanwhile, the Taliban will try to strike a deal with a set of Afghan powerbrokers, many of whom are susceptible to its entreaties. The May 10 defection to the Taliban of General Abdul Jalil Bakhtawar — for years a dogged enemy of the Taliban, and whose son is the deputy governor of Farah province — is just one example of these dynamics.

Afghan politicians and powerbrokers are in constant negotiations with the Taliban, much as they are in negotiation with the Afghan government to milk out concessions and patronage. Incentives for making a deal with the Taliban include fear for their lives or the lives of their families (the apparent reason Bakhtawar switched sides) and being slighted by the Afghan government without prospect of getting back on the patronage gravy train. So before they would overtly and definitely switch to the Taliban, or attempt to declare a separate government with the Taliban, they would have to determine that the Ghani government was either close to falling, or that neither Ghani nor Abdullah could satisfy their demands for patronage resources. Most Afghan politicians with national-level power are not ready to make such a judgement. But choices of that sort are on the horizon.

Tragically, the negotiations are and likely will continue to be back-room deals, on-and-off amid the bloodshed. Starting formal Afghan government negotiations with the Taliban as soon as possible, even though they will drag on for months and years, is important to maximize the bargaining power of the Afghan government. It is vital that the Afghan elite, starting with Ghani and Abdullah but much beyond, for once comes together. They must, at least, face the Taliban in negotiations with a more unified front. Afghanistan is on the cusp of profound political and power redistribution change, and not all Afghan powerbrokers can assume that they will be able to strike a satisfactory bargain with the Taliban in a deal behind closed doors.

It is also crucial that the United States and the international community insist that the voices of Afghan society be heard. All Afghan actors must work to reduce violence against innocent civilians like that seen on May 12.","A set of brutal attacks in Afghanistan on May 12 has thrown the very idea of a peace process into question.

But violence has continued across the country since then.

There has been an increase in both air strikes and raids by US-backed Afghan government forces, and continued Taliban attacks. Attacks on a maternity ward, on funerals, mosques and clinics by both the Taliban and Afghan forces killed hundreds in May.

In the wake of the US-Taliban agreement, Afghan government leaders announced preparations for intra-Afghan negotiations between all sides in the conflict, including the Taliban and other key political factions. But these negotiations have been delayed mainly by disagreements over the nature and mechanisms for prisoner releases and the reduction of violence by all sides.

While a recent power-sharing deal was agreed between President Ashraf Ghani and his rival Abduallah Abduallah in mid-May, it is too early to know how the forthcoming government in Afghanistan will approach peace-making with the Taliban. There is still a long way to go before peace comes to Afghanistan – and to the many people displaced during 40 years of conflict.

Brutal toll

War in Afghanistan started with a Marxist coup followed by a Soviet invasion in 1979. While the underlying reason for conflict has altered, hostilities have continued ever since. Research shows that serious human rights violations were committed by all combatants over the last 40 years, including Afghan and international forces. These include summary executions, aerial bombing and drone attacks on civilians, sexual violence, abduction and torture.

Since the US-led war in Afghanistan began in 2001, some 147,124 people, 26% of them civilians, have been killed, and more than 1.8 million people have been internally displaced, adding to the 5.1 million already displaced by previous conflicts. Displaced people fled affected communities, including in Badghis, Kandahar and Helmand provinces, and moved to regions and urban centres throughout Afghanistan.

Conditions for returning

Our ongoing research with these displaced people is showing how much their lives lack dignity. Between May and October 2019 our team of researchers listened to the stories of more than 1,000 internally displaced people living in camps and cities across the country. Many told us they want a peace settlement that facilitates their return home, their wellbeing and their sense of dignity. But this requires sustainable and humanitarian support focused on their priorities: peace, physical and humanitarian security, education and a livelihood. As one man in Badakhshan said:

Our dignity would be better protected if we were in our village. If it was safe we could return. To me, dignity means a peaceful life and being safe.

While many displaced people want to return to their place of origin, a sizeable minority do not because they fear continued violence and a lack of physical security. Some are also concerned about indignity, injustice, land disputes and a lack of freedom. One woman in Kunduz lamented:

Since I was born, I haven’t seen peace in my country. I’ve never worried or thought about myself or my children but expected a peaceful and secure country. We’re satisfied with a loaf of bread on a mountain but we need peace.

Without creating an environment conducive for the safe and voluntary return of displaced people and for their reintegration into society, the peace process will fail to deliver sustainable solutions. Without a sustainable future, peace will be fragile. Many people, both those who are displaced and the communities that host them, will continue to be attracted to or forced into militancy, as has happened in the past.

Uncertain way forward

The US-Taliban peace agreement only touches on some of these issues. It has strong international and regional dimensions with commitments to withdraw all foreign forces if certain conditions are met, but does nothing to address the culture of local warlords and the violence of their power battles.

In order to avoid future civil war, any post-war government in Afghanistan will have to engage warlords and other factions – including the Taliban – politically as well as culturally.

The Taliban, for example, will need to recognise that their version of culture and religion is at odds with those of the new Afghanistan which embraces human rights and equal access to education and work opportunities for men and women. The intra-Afghan negotiations must respect divergent viewpoints – religious, traditional and secular – and reach common understandings.

The peace agreement also says little about development, leaving the Afghan government to provide basic services such as education and justice and to stamp out corruption. The government needs the international community to invest in sustainable development in the country, but increased aid is unlikely until there is a realistic prospect of peace.

Sustainable development is clearly what displaced people in Afghanistan want, but no party in the negotiations for Afghanistan’s future has made any reference to them. This omission may be fatal to a permanent end to hostilities. Without sustainable development, any peace will only be partial, fragile and temporary.","Hopes for peace in Afghanistan were high in February when the US and Taliban signed an agreement to end their long-running conflict.

Both of these events are landmarks in the history of the establishment of the liberal democratic international order that exists today. And yet as we remember them, we must also recognise that we are losing sight of what it is that we achieved to get there.

It is often forgotten that before the war democracy had been the exception as opposed to the rule. At its lowest point, there were less than twenty democracies in the world as a result of the war. However, a small number of countries in Western Europe stood firmly behind their belief in freedom – those countries would go on to liberate the others. The conclusion of the Cold War and the collapse of Communism and Socialism in Eastern Europe created more free nations. Democracy today stands as the dominant force in Europe and around the world.

This was only possible because we in the West were unwavering in our support for our system. Because democracy and the rule of law inspired confidence. We lived in societies in which the ruling elite trusted the people and the people could trust the elite to make the right decisions, and explain to them why these decisions had to be made.

Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher both succeeded as leaders of the free world because they inspired the confidence of those at home and abroad. They understood the need to be trusted, and to explain to people along the way their actions. They also weren’t afraid to remind the public that the liberal democratic market-based system they lived in was worth defending and needed defending.

Today, our politicians are almost embarrassed to talk about the benefits that have been brought about by the system that we fought so hard to establish after the Second World War, and then fought even harder to defend during the Cold War. We are instead willing to make concessions to those who are actively seeking to undermine our system.

Our overdependence in Europe on Russian gas has meant that we have abandoned our allies in Ukraine and Georgia. Our overdependence on China for cheap manufacturing means that we have abandoned Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Uyghur people.

And by doing this we have given up on our principles. Both Ukraine and Georgia are in a fight for their identity as independent and free democratic nations. Hong Kong is in a struggle for the rule of law and the independence of its judiciary. Taiwan is in a struggle to defend its existence as a democracy. The Uyghurs are fighting to protect their culture and right to worship. As President Reagan said to the European Parliament on the 40th Anniversary of VE Day: “Aggression feeds on appeasement.”

Our forebears who established NATO, the United Nations, and the European Community for the preservation of peace and freedom in the world would not have sat idly by. They would have made their positions clear and backed them with actions. Had the Allies not backed projects such as the Marshall Plan, Radio Free Europe and supported intellectual dissidents during the Cold War, Eastern Europe would still today be under the thumb of a collectivist regime that strips away individual identity.

Equally, had those in Europe been as sharply anti-American as they are today, the West would not have won. Every time Europe’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, or another high ranking figure in Brussels chooses to side with our adversaries against the United States, they undermine the ability for the West to defend its ideals. We have only ever been able to stand up to totalitarianism when we have done so together.

We are after all the heirs to the great traditions of the liberal democratic world – individual liberty, the rule of law, the sovereignty of the nation-state, the freedom of the press, freedom of conscience, trust in strong and democratic institutions – and as such it should be the job of the European Union, along with NATO and the other Western Allies to defend these values as they are. They should not be setting out to rewrite our values or try and harmonise them.

We must recognise that there isn’t a one-sized solution to global problems – that’s to say that our values may be similar but not identical. French values are not the same as German values and German values are not the same as American – however, that’s not to say that the common ground isn’t worth fighting for together.

We must also recognise that our strength comes from our diversity, and is strengthened further by our common purpose. Respect for one another and our differences is what sets us apart from our enemies who choose not to respect anyone at all. That includes respect for our nations and peoples decisions.

The mistake that Brussels has continued to make in the last few years is that we are different. They have instead tried to enforce what they believe to be right onto its 27 members without popular legitimacy and without recognising the differences. At the same time, they have chosen to try and forge their own path, ignoring those who share their values.

If we truly want to defend the international order that we established after World War II, and built upon after the collapse of Socialism, then we must continue to act together as the Western world, not just Europe. We must also not lose sight of the fact that the democracy that we are trying to defend can only exist with popular legitimacy.

A coalition of the willing – involving the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and NATO – is the only way that we can continue to defend our way of life from the existential threats posed by external totalitarianism from Russia and China.","Last week, we celebrated 75 years since the end of the Second World War in Europe and 70 years since the signing of the Schumann Declaration.

The U.S. State Department’s Office of the Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security on April 24, 2020, published online a paper entitled “Strengthening Deterrence and Reducing Nuclear Risks: The Supplemental Low-Yield U.S. Submarine-Launched Warhead.” Christopher Ford, the de facto undersecretary, authored the introduction, while the section on “The W76-2 Low-Yield Option” was attributed to the Bureau of Arms Control, Verification, and Compliance.

Briefly, the paper describes why and how the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), issued under U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, clarified “‘the extreme circumstances’ under which the United States does not a priori rule out the possibility of using nuclear weapons.” The paper adds further that “deterring limited nuclear attacks on allies and deployed U.S. forces” is the most urgent nuclear deterrence challenge today. To this end, the United States should continue to deploy the W76-2 low-yield nuclear warhead on submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). In explaining this controversial position, the paper respectfully addresses the central arguments that have been made against this weapon.

Like previous writings by Ford, this one will engender intense debate among nuclear policy aficionados in the United States and around the world. Carnegie Vice President for Studies and Ken Olivier and Angela Nomellini Chair George Perkovich, as before, welcomes the insights that the State Department publication provides into U.S. policy and offers the following critique of the paper in hopes of inviting others to join this discussion.

Clarifying the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, Sort Of

Much of the debate on the new paper will focus specifically on the case Ford and his colleagues make for deploying the low-yield W76-2 nuclear warhead. Yet, while that argument is important, Ford’s introductory explanation of the 2018 NPR deserves more attention.

George Perkovich Perkovich works primarily on nuclear strategy and nonproliferation issues; cyberconflict; and new approaches to international public-private management of strategic technologies. More >

Ford writes that a major “innovation” of the NPR was “the greater clarity we brought to U.S. declaratory policy by specifying that the ‘extreme circumstances’ under which the United States does not a priori rule out the possibility of using nuclear weapons include the threat of ‘significant, non-nuclear strategic attacks.’”

This is very interesting. Previous Republican and Democratic administrations have declared “extreme circumstances” to be the threshold whereupon the United States would consider using nuclear weapons. Now a senior Trump administration official says this phrasing is excessively ambiguous. He is correct.

More importantly, by using a double negative (“does not . . . rule out”), Ford is suggesting declaratory policy should not convey when the United States would be justified in using nuclear weapons. Rather, he’s saying that U.S. nuclear use is ruled out except under “extreme circumstances” that should be clarified. In an actual war, the semantic shift probably would mean nothing, but the nod toward a nuclear taboo should be welcomed. Whatever the motivations, it is useful to have a Republican administration on record in this way.

The focus of analysis and debate should then shift to clarifying what such extreme circumstances could be. Here, Ford writes, the inclusion of “significant, non-nuclear strategic attacks . . . did not expand the range of circumstances in which the United States might use nuclear weapons. . . . No previous U.S. administration . . . had been willing to offer any insight into what such longstanding comments about ‘extreme circumstances’ actually meant. . . . We opted for honesty and for clarity in order to enhance deterrence and reduce the risk of miscalculation.”

Greater clarity is indeed welcome. The 2018 NPR did not provide much, but Ford’s introduction might offer more. What would make a non-nuclear strategic attack “significant” enough to overcome the United States’ generally ruling out nuclear use?

Ford answers: “This declaratory policy clarification was necessary because ours is an age in which non-nuclear capabilities have the potential to wreak havoc in some respects comparable to a nuclear attack [emphasis added].” Merriam-Webster defines havoc as “wide and general destruction” or “great confusion and disorder.” If Ford wished to convey the first meaning, why not just say something like “death and destruction”? Here, the qualifier, “havoc in some respects comparable to a nuclear attack” becomes very important. Perhaps Ford and the administration are thinking of cyber attacks, which could cause great confusion and disorder but would not be violently destructive and lethal. If so, why not say it?

A leaked draft of the 2018 NPR declared that cyber attacks against critical civilian infrastructure could justify U.S. nuclear use. But the final version of the document dropped this specific reference, which had become controversial. A cyber attack that corrupted the integrity of financial data of one of the world’s global systemically important financial institutions over several weeks or months and that was publicly revealed by its perpetrators to cause massive confusion, economic loss, and political disorder would fit the definition of havoc. But would it be comparable enough to nuclear attack to warrant U.S. nuclear use? What about shutting down a regional electrical grid?

One of the strategically attractive things about cyber attacks is that they don’t necessarily cause destruction or even irreversible damage, let alone death. Assume that the United States could with 99.9 percent certainty attribute a cyber attack to the Kremlin (and not merely Kremlin proxies). Would it be legally and strategically justifiable to respond by attacking Russia with nuclear weapons? What if China or North Korea were the villain in the same scenario? Nuclear retaliation would not stop the cyber attack or cause the adversary to retreat. Nor would it spare the United States or the world from death and destruction; it would add to it if the adversary then used nuclear weapons too.

Nuclear attack (against most targets) means death and destruction, perhaps on a massive and indiscriminate scale. Thus, using nuclear weapons in response to an adversary attack (of whatever sort) that caused death and destruction equivalent to a nuclear attack could meet legal criteria as well as traditional security thresholds. It is important to recall here that, in Ford’s words echoing the 2018 NPR, “U.S. nuclear operations would adhere to the law of armed conflict.” (The International Court of Justice in 1996 issued an advisory opinion that while many uses of nuclear weapons would violate international law, it could not “reach a definitive conclusion as to the legality or illegality of the use of nuclear weapons by a State in an extreme circumstance of self-defence, in which its very survival would be at stake.”) But, if a non-nuclear strategic attack did not cause massive death, would it be nevertheless “in some respects” comparable to a nuclear attack? What scale of physical destruction crosses this threshold?

Clarity in nuclear policy is good. There is still a lot more work to do in defining a non-nuclear cause of “havoc” that would be comparable enough to nuclear attack to make it sensible and legal for the United States to respond by using nuclear weapons. Perhaps in 2021 a new administration, whoever heads it, should produce a new or revised Nuclear Posture Review adding still more clarity to that which the State Department has tried to provide.

Why Maintain Massive Strategic Arsenals of High-Yield Weapons?

“While we continue to posture our forces to deter large-scale nuclear attacks,” the State Department paper declares, “the 2018 NPR also highlighted the importance of deterring limited nuclear attacks on allies and deployed U.S. forces—something both the Obama and Trump Administrations considered more likely than a ‘bolt-out-of-the-blue’ attack.”

Because “bolt-out-of-the-blue” attacks are very implausible, the primary role of nuclear weapons today is to deter escalation of potential Russian and Chinese conflict with U.S. allies. To this end, the State Department paper argues that there is a need for low-yield nuclear warheads that are not forward deployed. The specific arguments for the SLBM-based low-yield W76-2 warhead are discussed immediately below. Here, I largely endorse the general proposition in favor of low-yield nuclear weapons (compared to high-yield ones) and draw a larger conclusion that both the Trump administration and many of its critics ignore.

The main argument for a survivable low-yield option is that it is “capable of providing an effective response with less collateral damage than a very high-yield weapon.” Thus, “potential adversaries may perceive it as a more credible response to a limited attack and thus a more credible deterrent to a strategy that seeks to split the United States from its allies.” Low-yield weapons are advantageous insofar as they would cause less collateral death and environmental destruction than higher-yield weapons (on similar targets in similar numbers), which makes them less inconsistent with the law of armed conflict, which the United States has committed to follow.

But the State Department authors and, perhaps, many of their critics miss a huge implication of this argument: it calls into question why the United States “needs” an arsenal of more than 3,800 high-yield weapons. This does not imply politically infeasible unilateral nuclear disarmament. Rather, the point is that the State Department’s own facts and reasoning show that the United States (and the world) would be more secure against risks of catastrophic nuclear war and would have a more credible and law-abiding deterrent if it and Russia negotiated down the numbers and types of nuclear weapons suited for bolt-out-of-the-blue scenarios, and instead relied on a much smaller arsenal of low-yield weapons better suited to regional contingencies.

The enormous U.S. and Russian strategic arsenals of high-yield weapons are mostly targeted against each other in scenarios of rapid massive preemption and retaliation. These plans are as unrealistic and suicidal as the “bolt-out-of-the-blue” strikes that the State Department rightly dismisses. Everyone would be better off and deterrence would probably be more credible and certainly more legal if most of these weapons were bargained away. As Ford notes, “even though a low-yield nuclear weapon is less destructive than a very high-yield weapon, it is still capable of inflicting unacceptable costs.” Nuclear deterrence can survive the removal of overkill weapons.

Of course, to pursue such a course, both Moscow and Washington would need (for political reasons at least) China’s binding commitments not to build up its nuclear forces in ways that would threaten the new, less excessively threatening Russian and U.S. deterrents. The Trump administration has taunted China to join nuclear arms control, but it unfortunately has not even hinted what the United States and Russia would be willing to offer in return. The prospect of U.S. and Russian willingness to explore further major reductions in their nuclear forces in the direction suggested here could be a viable way to invite reluctant Chinese leaders to consider joining an arms control process. Such an approach likely would be applauded by non-nuclear-weapon states and international civil society. Chinese leaders then would need to decide whether their international interests would be better served by being seen as the obstacle to major progress in nuclear disarmament or instead being a facilitator of it.

The Low-Yield W76-2 Debate

The State Department correctly argues that it would not be credible (or desirable) to rely on use of “very high-yield warheads” to respond to Russian (or Chinese) use of limited numbers of lower-yield weapons in a regional war. Nor would it be desirable or feasible for the United States “to match Russia weapon-for-weapon at the non-strategic or theater level” by deploying “up to 2,000 ground-, air-, and sea-based non-strategic nuclear weapons.” As the paper notes, “A massive response to a limited attack is even less likely to restore deterrence and more likely to spur further nuclear escalation that could devastate the world.” (Interestingly, the paper does not add that such a massive response would be of dubious legality.)

The State Department correctly notes that the United States already has air-deliverable low-yield options in its arsenal and in development: “U.S. nuclear-capable bombers provide both penetrating and standoff response options; they are survivable against counterforce attacks when they are armed with weapons, alerted, and dispersed; and we can visibly signal with them in peacetime and military crises.”

“Yet,” the paper continues, “there are several distinct attributes of SLBMs that our air-based nuclear forces do not possess. Ballistic missiles are unmatched in their ability to reliably penetrate defenses. They are more prompt than air-delivered nuclear forces . . . [and] the low-yield SLBM provides a response option that is operationally survivable day-to-day and always ready. Thus, unlike our bombers and dual-capable aircraft, which are not armed, alerted, and dispersed day-to-day, we do not need to generate the low-yield SLBM in a crisis.”

However, to close, it is worthwhile to consider less adequate elements of the case for the W76-2. The authors acknowledge the widely discussed discrimination problem—that is, the difficulty Russian (or Chinese) early warning systems and personnel would have in distinguishing launched low-yield weapons from high-yield ones. Critics argue that Russia would be most likely to respond to this problem by assuming the worst and therefore could be more likely to unleash a more destructive response than advocates of the W76-2 assert. The State Department responds by saying a foe “would not be able to determine the yield of the weapons on a U.S. bomber or air-launched cruise missile either.” This seems correct and more like an argument for nuclear disarmament than anything else. More persuasive is the argument that “there is no strategic rationale for an adversary to use nuclear weapons in a limited way and then launch a massive nuclear attack upon detection of a single SLBM, triggering the unlimited war it is trying to avoid.”

Neither the State Department nor any other agency has articulated what the plausible targets of this weapon would be. The April paper says, “Our strategy for deterring limited nuclear war is not target-based; it is capacity based: we deter limited nuclear attack by sustaining an effective military posture to protect the vital interests of the United States and its allies in the face of nuclear-backed aggression.”

This does not clarify much, if anything. It raises as many questions as it answers. If there is an imperative to make plans for when deterrence fails, as the paper insists, then those plans must involve targets. What targets would SLBM-based low-yield nuclear warheads be needed to destroy that could not be adequately threatened by other low-yield weapons in the U.S./NATO arsenal? Without a sense of likely targets, it is extremely difficult for officials and analysts in the United States and elsewhere to assess whether these weapons are more likely to stabilize or destabilize crises and escalate or de-escalate nuclear exchanges.

Ultimately, given that the W76-2 is already deployed and U.S. allies do not seem to object to it, there is little, if anything, to be gained by removing it. Indeed, the administration and critics of this weapon are looking through the wrong end of the telescope. In focusing attention on the priority of deterring regional conflict and its escalation, the State Department’s paper makes a strong case for negotiating deep reductions in U.S. and Russian high-yield strategic weapons.","To this end, the United States should continue to deploy the W76-2 low-yield nuclear warhead on submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs).

But would it be comparable enough to nuclear attack to warrant U.S. nuclear use?
To this end, the State Department paper argues that there is a need for low-yield nuclear warheads that are not forward deployed.

51,https://theconversation.com/lesothos-new-leader-faces-enormous-hurdles-ensuring-peace-and-political-stability-139320,"Tue, 26 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",The Conversation CA,Lesotho’s new leader faces enormous hurdles ensuring peace and political stability,"Tom Thabane (81), the embattled veteran Lesotho politician, has finally bowed to pressure to resign as the Prime Minister of the politically volatile southern African nation of 2.2 million. This comes at least two years before the end of his term.

But, will his replacement by Moeketsi Majoro (58) enable Lesotho to move in a more progressive direction? Majoro is an economist, former executive at the International Monetary Fund as well as the country’s former finance minister. He was recently appointed to lead the governing coalition of the majority All Basotho Convention, and the Democratic Congress of Lesotho, ahead of Thabane’s resignation.

The Thabane saga, revolving around allegations that he was party to a conspiracy to murder his then estranged wife, and that his new wife interferes in state matters, has been dragging on for more than a year.

These events have fed into a the raging political conflict within his ruling party, All Basotho Convention, and its governing coalition with the Democratic Congress of Lesotho. This has provided a major distraction to any attempt to address the country’s massive developmental problems.

But, setting Lesotho on a significantly different political trajectory will not be easy.

Majoro’s installation as Prime Minister is welcome. But it does not guarantee much needed political stability in an era of complex coalition politics in which none of Lesotho’s parties has a clear majority. Nor does it guarantee internal peace when the military and police both remain significant political players, with linkages to different political parties and actors.

Questions have correctly been posed whether Majoro, a technocrat with a great deal of international experience, has the political skills to hold his governing coalition together. For the moment, Thabane remains leader of the All Basotho Congress, and cannot be guaranteed to lend his support to the new government.

Balancing act

Thabane can be expected to use his position to try to secure immunity for himself from prosecution for his alleged role in the murder of his estranged wife, Lipopelo Thabane (58). She was shot dead in June 2017 - two days before he was sworn in as the Prime Minister. Maesaiah Liabiloe Ramoholi (42), the woman he was living with at the time, and eventually married, is on trial for the murder. Thabane was also later charged with the murder.

Majoro must know that if he concedes this immunity, he will lose a great deal of domestic and global credibility. But if doesn’t show some leniency he may lose the support of a disgruntled element of his party which continues to back Thabane.

How this plays out may influence whether Majoro can secure the leadership of the party at its next congress, expected in February 2021.

This may not be plain sailing. One of the big factors will be the willingness of the deputy leader of the party, Nqosa Mahao, to support him.

Mahao defeated Majoro for leadership position in the party in February 2020. Though both will now want Thabane out of the way (a conviction in court would be convenient), it’s not clear whether they will work cooperatively together.

Key challenges

Beyond the immediate political problems, there are three major issues which need to be confronted. One is whether the country’s electoral system can be restructured to render the political landscape more predictable. Another is whether a recent tendency for the judiciary to be politicised can be reversed. A third is whether the political entanglements of the police and military can be neutralised.

To appreciate how difficult this may be, it is necessary to recall that Lesotho is governed by a small elite (military and judicial as well as political), whose members’ knowledge of each other and their families often goes back decades.

In a country where poverty is intense and resources are so few, personal feuds can easily translate into political issues.

The National Dialogue process, launched in 2015 under the auspices of the Southern African Development Community, has led to proposals for electoral reform. Introduced in 2002, Lesotho’s Mixed Member Proportional electoral system combines first-past-the-post constituency elections with a national list proportional representation system to ensure proportionality of party representation.

But, its outcomes have been undermined by politicians crossing the floor for personal advantage, upsetting the intended proportionality and encouraging fragmentation of political parties. The Southern African Development Community has now proposed that such floor crossing should be banned, and parties should obtain a minimum proportion of the vote before they secure representation in parliament.

The real issue still to be resolved is how to form political parties which are genuinely constructed around political programmes rather than personal ambitions.

Read more: Events in Lesotho point to poor prospects for political stability

Lesotho’s political parties have often sought to resolve their problems by directing them to the courts. Most recently, the battle for control of the All Basotho Convention led to Thabane throwing his weight behind Acting Chief Justice ‘Maseforo Mahase, whose curious rulings in Thabane’s favour were to be thrown out by the Court of Appeal, amid popular accusations of her political bias.

It seems unlikely, with Thabane out of the way, that Mahase will now be confirmed in her position. But, Majoro will need to avoid the temptation of securing the appointment of a crony as the Chief Justice. Prior to Thabane’s politicking, the judiciary had more or less been kept above the political fray. This neutrality now needs to be restored.

Yet the major problem confronting stability in Lesotho is presented by the military and police. They have been a major factor in the country’s politics, stretching back to 1970, when the then Police Mobile Unit backed Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan to overthrow the adverse results of the first post-independence election.

Headache for new PM

The military’s penchant for direct intervention in the political arena has been curtailed by the insistence of South Africa, Southern African the Development Community, and the African Union that the legitimacy of coups will not be accepted. But this has not stopped governments seeking protection from political opponents by forging strong links with the senior military.

In an era of unstable government coalitions, this has itself become a source of major tension, with incoming governments seeking to counter-balance military leaderships left over by the previous government by cosying up to the police. Determined efforts to neutralise the military have been made via training programmes carried out by, among others, South Africa, the Southern African the Development Community, India, Britain and Zimbabwe. None have yet succeeded.

For all that Majoro may want attend to tackling Covid-19 and the economy, his biggest headache may yet turn out to be the army.","Nor does it guarantee internal peace when the military and police both remain significant political players, with linkages to different political parties and actors.

53,https://www.timesofisrael.com/peace-activist-author-a-b-yehoshua-now-pushes-for-a-one-state-solution/,"Sun, 03 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",The Times of Israel,Peace activist author A.B. Yehoshua now pushes for a one-state solution,"LONDON — Like the rest of the Israeli population, writer A.B. Yehoshua is currently in lockdown.

“I’m obeying the orders of the government and, as I am old man, I have to be patient and not complain too much,” says the 83-year-old acclaimed novelist, playwright and essayist, speaking over the phone from his Givatayim apartment. “I say to myself, there are so many people who have far more serious problems.”

Since the relatively recent death of his wife, Rivka, a renowned psychoanalyst, Yehoshua lives alone. But, he says, his children are taking care of him and he manages to cook for himself. “It’s not a problem.”

Yehoshua’s latest novel, “The Tunnel,” is about a man grappling with the early stages of dementia. Tender, slow paced, humorous — but at times also painful — it is a tale about deep love, memory and identity. Underpinning it is the close, loving and long relationship between its protagonist, Zvi Luria, a retired road engineer and Dina, his pediatrician wife of 48 years. Yehoshua admits there are aspects of his characters’ partnership that mirror what he shared with Rivka, who became ill and died during the writing of the book.

“The love between [Zvi and Dina] gave expression [to what we had]. When Rivka died, I didn’t know if I could continue to write the novel,” says Yehoshua. “I was so sorry and so sad in my darkness but little by little, I came back to continue to write it and create their sweet love.”

Yehoshua wanted to examine the impact of Zvi’s creeping dementia in a gentle way, he says, by showing how Zvi copes and tries to fight against a process that will eventually destroy who he is. In order to try and slow down the onset of the illness, Zvi’s neurologist advises him to find meaningful work in his field and, encouraged by wife, he volunteers to assist a young engineer at the Israel Roads Authority to plan a secret road for the army in the Ramon crater in the Negev Desert.

“For me, it was very important to push the novel into the desert,” Yehoshua says. “Half of Israel is desert and it is an extremely important part of our identity.”

In a nod to Yehoshua’s belief in traditional, classical Zionism, two of his characters go to Kibbutz Sde Boker to visit the graves of the country’s founding father, David Ben-Gurion and his wife, Paula, who were known for being attached to the desert.

An Israeli fixture

A.B. Yehoshua, (the B refers to Bulli, a childhood nickname) is one of the giants of Israeli literature. Born in 1936, in Jerusalem, he is often referred to as a member of the “generation of the state,” which includes other notable, celebrated writers, such as Aharon Appelfeld and Amos Oz, both of whom also came of age after the establishment of the State of Israel and drew upon the problems facing their country in their writing.

Yehoshua has been the recipient of numerous awards, including the Israel Prize in 1995, the Dan David prize in 2017, and in 2005 he was shortlisted for the International Man Booker. An ardent peace activist, Yehoshua has also used his literary voice as a social and political commentator. He is an outspoken critic of Israeli and Palestinian policies and for decades was a die-hard believer in the two-state solution — the vision of a secure Israel alongside a Palestinian state. In the last few years, however, his position has changed, partly, he says, due to the question of the settlements.

“The settlements are making the possibility of the creation of a Palestinian state no longer possible. The Palestinians won’t agree to have a state without East Jerusalem as part of the major city, so we are moving together to a one state solution. We have to find a way to maintain that one state with equal rights for both Palestinians and Israelis.”

Searching for a solution

Israeli respect for, and recognition of, the Palestinians is often present in Yehoshua’s novels. In “The Tunnel,” there is a mystery about a Palestinian family living, or trapped, on a hill, on the route of the proposed new road. Should the family be evicted, or, as Luria suggests, should a tunnel be built beneath it?

The intertwined identities of Jewish Israelis and the Palestinians become apparent — a situation that embodies Yehoshua’s belief in the plan for a one state solution; a topic he returns to several times during his conversation with The Times of Israel: “We have to integrate the Palestinians into Israel, [in a proposal conceived either] by the right or the left.”

Yet the novel is not political, Yehoshua points out. The main focus of the narrative centers on Zvi’s dementia and the ways in which he attempts to overcome it. The question of the Palestinian family is just another subject raised in the book, he says, not the sole theme.

The tunnel represents a link between Luria’s present and his future, characterized by his brain’s slow demise.

“I symbolize the need for the little positive things in order to be more attentive to life and to participate in it,” says Yehoshua. Zvi creates innovative solutions to assist himself with his forgetfulness, including tattooing his car ignition code onto his arm. Although this “code of memory” is a symbol of the Holocaust, explains Yehoshua, to Zvi it is a symbol that enables him to maintain his memory and continue to be active. By controlling his car, he can live his life.

But sometimes, Zvi’s memory loss and vulnerability result in comedic moments: he confuses first names, takes home the wrong child from his grandson’s kindergarten, and his repeated buying of tomatoes eventually leads to numerous plates of shakshuka.

On the other hand, too much memory is not always good, insists Yehoshua: “To forget is also a positive element.” Remembering can be an obstacle to different communities connecting, he says. Tunnels exist between different identities, such as between religious and secular, between the left and right.

“We must have more connections. This is a challenge to us [in Israel] — to break the burdens of different groups and to fight the way of solidarity, collaboration and identity,” he says.

In some ways, the coronavirus crisis is helping the process along. It is also further pushing the country in the direction of a one state solution, says Yehoshua, as many Palestinian doctors and nurses work alongside their Israeli colleagues in hospitals.

“We are in the same condition, the same fate. We have to prepare ourselves for a kind of unity. Perhaps, the way in which this unity will work is the way of the future,” he says.","Yehoshua, (the B refers to Bulli, a childhood nickname) is one of the giants of Israeli literature.

The United Nations has designated the 16th of May as a day devoted to Living Together in Peace. It therefore seems appropriate to mark this day by discussing the reasons why war must be eliminated as a human institution.



Science and technology are double-edged



As we start the 21st century and the new millennium, our scientific and technological civilization seems to be entering a period of crisis. Today, for the first time in history, science has given to humans the possibility of a life of comfort, free from hunger and cold, and free from the constant threat of infectious disease. At the same time, science has given us the power to destroy civilization through thermonuclear war, as well as the power to make our planet uninhabitable through pollution and overpopulation. The question of which of these alternatives we choose is a matter of life or death to ourselves and our children.



Science and technology have shown themselves to be double-edged, capable of doing great good or of producing great harm, depending on the way in which we use the enormous power over nature, which science has given to us. For this reason, ethical thought is needed now more than ever before. The wisdom of the world’s religions, the traditional wisdom of humankind, can help us as we try to insure that our overwhelming material progress will be beneficial rather than disastrous.



Contrasting rates of change



The crisis of civilization, which we face today, has been produced by the rapidity with which science and technology have developed. Our institutions and ideas adjust too slowly to the change. The great challenge which history has given to our generation is the task of building new international political structures, which will be in harmony with modern technology. At the same time, we must develop a new global ethic, which will replace our narrow loyalties by loyalty to humanity as a whole.



In the long run, because of the enormously destructive weapons, which have been produced through the misuse of science, the survival of civilization can only be insured if we are able to abolish the institution of war.



Every war is a war against children!



While in earlier epochs it may have been possible to confine the effects of war mainly to combatants, in our own century the victims of war have increasingly been civilians, and especially children. For example, according to Quincy Wright’s statistics, the First and Second World Wars together cost the lives of 26 million soldiers, but the toll in civilian lives was much larger: 64 million.



Civilian casualties often occur through malnutrition and through diseases, which would be preventable in normal circumstances. Because of the social disruption caused by war, normal supplies of food, safe water and medicine are interrupted, so that populations become vulnerable to famine and epidemics. In the event of a catastrophic nuclear war, starvation and disease would add greatly to the loss of life caused by the direct effects of nuclear weapons.



Indirect damage due to wars



The indirect effects of war are also enormous. Globally, preparations for war interfere seriously with the use of tax money for constructive and peaceful purposes. During the year 2019, according to the Stockholm Peace Research Institute, the world spent 1.9 trillion (i.e. almost 2 million million) US dollars on armaments. This enormous flood of money, which is almost too large to imagine, could have been used instead for urgently needed public health measures.



The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us that “defense departments” do not really defend us. Better health care systems and more research on vaccines could have defended us against the pandemic.



Today’s world is one in which roughly ten million children die each year from diseases related to poverty. Besides this enormous waste of young lives through malnutrition and preventable disease, there is a huge waste of opportunities through inadequate education. The total number of illiterates in the world is estimated to be 800 million. Meanwhile every 60 seconds the world spends roughly 2 million U. S. dollars on armaments.

It is plain that if the almost unbelievable sums now wasted on armaments were used constructively, most of the pressing problems now facing humanity could be solved.

The threat of thermonuclear war



The threat of an all-destroying nuclear war makes it clear that civilian populations are only hostages in the power-struggles of their leaders. In a thermonuclear war, hundreds of millions of civilians would die, also in neutral countries.



War as a business; war as an institution



Because the world spends almost two trillion dollars each year on armaments, it follows that very many people make their living from war. This is the reason why it is correct to speak of war as a social institution, and also the reason why war persists, although everyone realizes that it is the cause of much of the suffering that inflicts humanity. We know that war is madness, but it persists. We know that it threatens the future survival of our species, but it persists, entrenched in the attitudes of historians, newspaper editors and television producers, entrenched in the methods by which politicians finance their campaigns, and entrenched in the financial power of arms manufacturers, entrenched also in the ponderous and costly hardware of war, the fleets of warships, bombers, tanks, nuclear missiles and so on.



The responsibility of scientists and engineers



Science cannot claim to be guiltless: In Eisenhower’s farewell address, he warned of the increasing power of the industrial-military complex, a threat to democratic society. If he were making the same speech today, he might speak of the industrial-military-scientific complex. Since Hiroshima, we have known that new knowledge is not always good. There is a grave danger that nuclear weapons will soon proliferate to such an extent that they will be available to terrorists and even to the mafia. Chemical and biological weapons also constitute a grave threat. The eradication of smallpox in 1979 was a triumph of medical science combined with international cooperation. How sad it is to think that military laboratories cultivate smallpox and that the disease may be reintroduced as a biological weapon!



Tribalism



The institution of war seems to be linked to a fault in human nature, to our tendency to exhibit altruism towards members of our own group but aggression towards other groups if we perceive them to be threatening our own community. This tendency, which might be called “tribalism”, was perhaps built into human nature by evolution during the long prehistory of our species, when we lived as hunter-gatherers in small genetically homogeneous tribes, competing for territory on the grasslands of Africa. However, in an era of nerve gas and nuclear weapons, the anachronistic behavior pattern of tribal altruism and intertribal aggression now threatens our survival.



Fortunately, our behavior is only partly determined by inherited human nature. It is also, and perhaps to a larger extent, determined by education and environment; and in spite of all the difficulties just mentioned, war has been eliminated locally in several large regions of the world. Taking these regions as models, we can attempt to use the same methods to abolish war globally.



Governance at the global level



Abolition of the institution of war will require the construction of structures of international government and law to replace our present anarchy at the global level. Today’s technology has shrunken the distances, which once separated nations; and our present system of absolutely sovereign nation-states has become both obsolete and dangerous. My own belief is that our best hope for a peaceful future lies in strengthening the United Nations by converting it into a federation with the power to make and enforce laws that are binding on individuals. The amount of money available to the UN and its agencies, such as the World Health Organization and the Food and Agricultural Organization should be increased by a factor of at least 50. This goal could be achieved through the Tobin Tax, a very small tax on international currency transactions. The volume of these transactions is so great that the Tobin Tax could give a strengthened UN adequate financial resources for global governance.

The growth of global consciousness



Besides a humane, democratic and just framework of international law and governance, we urgently need a new global ethic, – an ethic where loyalty to family, community and nation will be supplemented by a strong sense of the brotherhood of all humans, regardless of race, religion or nationality. Schiller expressed this feeling in his “Ode to Joy”, a part of which is the text of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. Hearing Beethoven’s music and Schiller’s words, most of us experience an emotion of resonance and unity with the message: All humans are brothers and sisters – not just some – all! It is almost a national anthem of humanity. The feelings that the music and words provoke are similar to patriotism, but broader. It is this sense of a universal human family that we need to cultivate in education, in the mass media, and in religion. We already appreciate music, art and literature from the entire world, and scientific achievements are shared by all, regardless of their country of origin. We need to develop this principle of universal humanism so that it will become the cornerstone of a new ethic



On our small but beautiful Earth, made small by technology, made beautiful by nature, there is room for one group only: the family of humankind.

The peace negotiation session discussed the possibility to include the SRF in the potential central government structure. They also discussed issues such as national identity and constitutional reform through a national consultation. They discussed issues that have not been addressed during previous sessions including the situations of El Kanabi, North Kordofan, and the position of Sudanese capital, as well as the criteria of wealth and national resource allocation.

This round of negotiation is expected to continue for the coming three days and then suspended for the Eid El Fitr holiday that marks the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. They are be resumed on May 27. Security arrangements in Darfur will be discussed until June 2.

The government delegation for the peace negotiations expects to sign the final peace agreement by June.

Mohamed El Taayshi, Member of the Sovereign Council and spokesman for the negotiating delegation expressed his hope and conviction that the negotiating parties will possibly reach an agreement by June 20, due to the willingness and determination of both parties.

El Taayshi also stressed that the negotiations aim to address national related problems to create a new social contract between the Sudanese people based on equal citizenship, and the objectives of the December revolution 'peace, justice, and freedom' and address the roots causes of war and marginalisation in Sudan.

In this context, the Global Focal Point for the Rule of Law (GFP) provides a powerful tool that brings together United Nations entities, agencies, funds and programmes to address deficits in the rule of law and security sectors of countries in conflict and fragile settings.

Since its inception in 2012, the GFP arrangement has offered focused and timely rule of law support to some 24 conflict-affected countries and territories. In 2019, it gained new momentum with an increased number of expert deployments and assessments to Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic (CAR), Gabon, Haiti, Cameroon, Mali, Malawi, Darfur, Libya, Liberia, Sao Tome and Principe, and Somalia. Joint rule of law programmes exist in various settings, including in CAR, Darfur, Libya, Mali and Somalia. Since March 2020, in response to unfolding COVID-19 crisis, the attention of the GFP has shifted, based on strong demands from the field, to mitigate the spread of the virus in rule of law institutions, especially in prisons and places of detention.

By linking up with UNDP’s rapid response mechanism, the GFP is now maximizing its support to state authorities, and meeting critical needs identified by United Nations peace operations and United Nations Country Teams. In CAR, GFP assistance together with WHO and ICRC enabled the provision of PPE to mitigate C-19 impacts in prisons and protect detainees and staff. The formalization of an innovative partnership with the NGO Health through Walls under the GFP umbrella will benefit all GFP partners by tapping into a broader network of dedicated medical expertise that can be called upon to offer guidance in real-time, online. More resources and country examples of coronavirus response by GFP partners can be found here.

Another imperative aspect we wish to highlight is our strategic engagement to implement the Women, Peace and Security agenda in close partnership with UN Women, OHCHR, the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict, and others. Under the GFP umbrella, partners provide technical assistance to strengthen women’s access to justice and ways of addressing sexual and gender-based violence, including in CAR, Liberia and Malawi. In Libya, the joint UNDP – UNSMIL Programme on Policing, Justice and Security supports efforts to enhance the role of women in law enforcement and identify entry points to buttress institutional responsiveness to address violence against women.

As the Assistant Secretaries-General of the entities responsible for GFP, we are committed to consolidate the success achieved by the GFP arrangement thus far, and to contribute to further enhance the GFP’s capacity to act as a coherent, efficient and field-driven United Nations rule of law service delivery platform.

We hope you will join us to discuss these topics in greater detail on 29 June at 09.15 EST in the session “The Global Focal Point for the Rule of Law: A joint approach across the UN system” held as part of UNDP’s Annual Meeting “Strengthening the Rule of Law and Human Rights for Sustaining Peace and Fostering Development , Virtual Meeting | June 29 – July 1. The meeting aims to promote an exchange between Member States, UN technical experts, practitioners, and civil society representatives on the rule of law, security and human rights.","Since its inception in 2012, the GFP arrangement has offered focused and timely rule of law support to some 24 conflict-affected countries and territories.
Joint rule of law programmes exist in various settings, including in CAR, Darfur, Libya, Mali and Somalia.
By linking up with UNDP’s rapid response mechanism, the GFP is now maximizing its support to state authorities, and meeting critical needs identified by United Nations peace operations and United Nations Country Teams.
In CAR, GFP assistance together with WHO and ICRC enabled the provision of PPE to mitigate C-19 impacts in prisons and protect detainees and staff.
The meeting aims to promote an exchange between Member States, UN technical experts, practitioners, and civil society representatives on the rule of law, security and human rights."

It was a swift change of fortune, even by the standards of Pakistan’s typical ups and downs with the United States. By February 2020, when the U.S.-Taliban peace deal was signed, Pakistan had not only propelled itself back into America’s good graces, it was testing out an ambitious new approach to foreign policy, hoping that it could begin to shed its image of a state associated with terror. The pandemic has paused this new phase somewhat, as Pakistan and others have had to turn inward, but that may be temporary.

A return to relevance

When Zalmay Khalilzad was appointed U.S. envoy to the Afghan peace process in September 2018, Pakistanis were worried. Khalilzad, a former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, was known for his skepticism on Pakistan. Over the next year and a half, almost each one of Khalilzad’s trips to the region included a visit to Islamabad.

Tracing his statements over time, you can see his reliance on Pakistan increasing, and his tone softening. In many ways, Pakistan was uniquely positioned to take advantage of the two-phase structure of the peace process — the Taliban refused to negotiate with Kabul until a U.S.-Taliban deal was signed — because of Pakistan’s relationships with both the U.S. and the Taliban. It seems to have done so masterfully, producing Mullah Baradar, the deputy leader of the Taliban who had been in Pakistani custody, and engaging in behind-the-scenes maneuvering that the U.S. has repeatedly acknowledged (and appreciated). Pakistan helped bring the Taliban to the table, ultimately resulting in a deal. Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi was present at the peace deal signing in Doha on February 29, warmly congratulating both sides.

Perhaps a deal would have been signed anyway. The Taliban got everything it wanted, securing — in its eyes — a U.S. surrender for an absolute minimum in promises. President Trump, meanwhile, had his mind set on exiting Afghanistan, and wanted a deal before the election. That may cast doubt on how much Pakistan did, or why. Regardless, it was Pakistan sitting at the table alongside the two parties to the deal in the end. Having long worried about other players in Afghanistan, mainly India — indeed its calculations on Afghanistan are based precisely on that worry — that was exactly what Pakistan wanted.

Trump and Pakistan’s prime minister Imran Khan’s relationship got off to a somewhat rocky start. A few months after Khan’s election in July 2018, the two populists exchanged a war of words on Twitter over U.S. aid to Pakistan and the country’s role in the war on terror. But by December, soon after Khalilzad’s first trip to the region as U.S. envoy, Trump had written Khan a letter asking for his help in the Afghan peace process. There was a key confluence of interests on the Pakistani side: Khan has long opposed an American military presence in Afghanistan and favored a negotiated settlement with the Taliban; the Pakistani army, meanwhile, recognized that an ascendant Taliban meant that any power-sharing arrangement accompanying a peace deal would likely align with Pakistan’s vision of “strategic depth” in Afghanistan (i.e. a Pakistan-friendly government in Afghanistan). These factors prompted Pakistan to help get the Afghan Taliban to the table. In January 2019, Senator Lindsay Graham visited Pakistan and met with Khan to talk about “reconciliation with the Taliban.”

Graham then paved the way for Khan and Trump to meet. They personally hit it off at their White House meeting in July 2019, and have met multiple times since, including on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The relationship seems to have been reset.

Foreign policy ambitions

At the same time that Pakistan made itself useful to the United States in Afghanistan, President Trump toned down his rhetoric branding Pakistan a terrorist state. Pakistan also received an IMF bailout, and its status with the Financial Action Task Force — an international watchdog — stayed constant at a warning “grey” level.

A more confident Pakistan began trying out an ambitious, proactive new approach to its foreign policy. In the fall of 2019, after meeting Trump at the U.N., Khan offered to mediate between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Pakistan has long balanced its relations between those two countries, but inserting itself in the middle so publicly and deliberately suggested a new tack.

After the U.S. killing of Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani in January, Pakistan lost no time in inserting itself diplomatically in the U.S.-Iran conflict. Khan said he would be happy to mediate; the chief of army staff urged “maximum restraint” and de-escalation in a phone call with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and much the same in a phone call with Secretary of Defense Mark Esper; and Foreign Minister Qureshi promptly visited Saudi Arabia, Iran, and the United States.

Pakistan’s efforts at the time seemed evocative of the country’s foreign policy under Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in the 1970s, with its principles of nonalignment and a special relationship with Muslim countries.

As the country began dealing with the health and economic fallout from the pandemic, Khan sent out a call, on behalf of all developing countries, to industrialized nations and multilateral institutions for debt relief. The G-20 and International Monetary Fund have agreed to suspend all debt payments for developing countries through the rest of the year. Khan’s government claimed this as a victory, saying Khan had led the charge for relief on behalf of other developing nations.

What of China and India? With China, Pakistan’s closest ally, Pakistan’s relationship remains constant. With India, Pakistan has limited itself to strident rhetoric since the revocation of Kashmir’s autonomy, and no more; nevertheless, tensions at the border have been running high.

The question that remains is: Will Pakistan’s approach to militant groups — the Haqqanis in particular — substantively change? The suspicions post-9/11 on Pakistan’s notorious double-game — giving haven to terrorists while also cooperating on counterterrorism with the United States — run deep. To answer this, it is worth understanding what Pakistan wants in Afghanistan.

What Pakistan wants in Afghanistan

There are two things Pakistan does not want in Afghanistan. The first is a hasty American withdrawal. To Pakistan, that evokes the time period after the Soviet-Afghan war, which fueled its sense of and narrative of abandonment, setting the stage for many of Pakistan’s subsequent destructive behaviors.

Pakistan also does not want an unfriendly government in Kabul — to be precise, it does not want a government that is more friendly with India than it is with Pakistan. And it is no secret that it has had a rough relationship with the current Afghan government.

Thus, one could conjecture that Pakistan wants some kind of power-sharing arrangement to emerge in Afghanistan. If the Taliban has a large enough role, the government is likely to be friendlier to Pakistan. But I would caution against assuming that Pakistan wants the Taliban in complete control in Afghanistan. For one, Pakistan’s relationship with the Taliban is not seamless. Two, Pakistan does not want an Islamic emirate in the vein of 1990s Afghanistan on its western border. That didn’t work out well for Pakistan — and a sequence of events led to it becoming the target of terror for years.

In some ways, the status quo is working for Pakistan. It seeks to sustain its status as a key player in some form through the second phase of Taliban-Kabul talks, with a slow U.S. withdrawal. Of course, that status is not guaranteed during intra-Afghan talks, given Pakistan’s tough relationship with Kabul. But its chief of army staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa visited Kabul recently, meeting both President Ashraf Ghani and High Council for National Reconciliation leader Abdullah Abdullah, and those relationships seem to have improved in some ways.

A road to redemption?

Will any of this change Pakistan’s fundamental calculus in the long-term, or alter the strategic imperatives that have led it to rely on militant proxies? Will Pakistan ultimately let go of its support for the Haqqani network? The short answer is that it hasn’t proven yet that it will. The State Department, in its latest country reports on terrorism, notes that the Haqqanis and the Afghan Taliban still have safe haven in Pakistan.

Pakistan would need a wholesale redefinition of policy to let go of its (existential) insecurities (vis-à-vis India, that lead it to “invest” in militant proxies on both its western and eastern borders). This is easier said than done, since the military thrives on those insecurities. As long as the military, the prime architect of Pakistan’s jihadist foreign policy to date, remains the most powerful institution in Pakistan, it is hard to argue that anything will change. Worryingly, Pakistan’s military has significantly consolidated its hold on the civilian government in the last two years. Domestically, it is increasingly cracking down on dissent. And Pakistan’s laws and educational policies that have given rise domestically to extremism remain intact as ever. Its prime minister, too, engages in narratives sympathetic to terrorist groups; he did so again on June 25, when he alarmingly referred to Osama bin Laden as a martyr.

But Pakistan has also enjoyed the benefits of being back at the table, and it badly wants to shed its image associated with terrorism. It knows that cracking down on terrorist groups brings economic and soft-power benefits — directly, via its status with the Financial Action Task Force, and more broadly as well. Ultimately, if the benefits of this newer approach start to outweigh the net benefits Pakistan perceives from hedging its bets and from relying on militant proxies, Pakistan’s long-term policies could slowly start to shift.

What the United States can do

The United States can nudge it along that path by raising both the costs of Pakistan’s old behaviors and the benefits of its new ones. The obvious way to do this in one move would have been to condition Pakistan’s seat at the table for the Afghanistan talks on it definitively denouncing the Haqqanis, with proof — but that did not happen. Going forward, Pakistan’s Financial Action Task Force status should be tied more closely to it cutting its ties to the Haqqanis. And two potential carrots are the best bet to incentivize good behavior on Pakistan’s part: First, Pakistan appreciates and closely follows any positive diplomatic language and attention it receives from the U.S., so the State Department and White House should praise Pakistan when it behaves well (as the Trump administration has done to some extent). Pakistan indicated, for instance, its “disappointment” with the State Department’s recently released country reports on terrorism, including by saying the report had not acknowledged the full scale of its help with the Afghan peace process. Secondly, more than aid, Pakistan wants to increase its trade with the United States. Trump promised a great deal more trade with Pakistan in his first meeting with Khan. The U.S. can now condition any expanded trade on Pakistan’s good behavior. And the U.S. government should privately be absolutely clear with Pakistan on what behaviors it is rewarding, and what it is punishing.","A return to relevanceWhen Zalmay Khalilzad was appointed U.S. envoy to the Afghan peace process in September 2018, Pakistanis were worried.

Her speech comes after several nights of looting and destruction across the city left businesses small and large in ruins.

As the mayor spoke, hundreds of protesters peacefully marched on the city's North Side calling for justice for George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis last week after an arresting officer knelt on his knock as he pleaded for air in a scene that was captured on cellphone video.

His killing has sparked protests and unrest not just in Chicago but in the suburbs and in cities across the country.

Read Lightfoot's full address below.

Good evening, my fellow Chicagoans.

Tonight, I want to discuss the events that have unfolded across our city over these past few days.

The steps forward that our great, resilient, and strong city will be taking to recover and to heal in the weeks and months ahead.

And the hope I feel about the future—despite this most difficult moment.

Over the last few days, like many of you, I have experienced a series of difficult emotions: anger, frustration, despair, intense physical and emotional fatigue, and yes…also hope.

Let me first address the heartbreak many of us are experiencing. I have watched all of the video coverage of George Floyd’s encounter with the four, shameful Minneapolis police officers who took his life.

I say all four, and not just the one who had his knee on his neck. All four were complicit. None followed their training, none intervened, and all felt entitled to abuse the privilege and honor of their badge to rob George Floyd of his humanity, his future and his life.

None shied away from the brazenness of their conduct even as Mr. Floyd cried out for his life. Thank goodness for the bystanders who stopped, trained their cameras on this obvious injustice and preserved that moment for the rest of us to bear witness.

The collective trauma and outrage arising from George Floyd’s murder have reverberated in our city and across our country.

For Black Americans—our history is paved with the racism and violence of the original sin of slavery, the open wounds from the slave masters’ whips, the rope marks from the lynching tree, blood spilled by the billy club, the dogs and the fire hoses—to all of that, we now must add a knee to the neck to the list of violence intended to break us.

Here in Chicago, the murder of George Floyd evoked a long history of violence against African-Americans in this country.

More specifically here in Chicago, it is about Laquan McDonald.

Quintonio LeGrier.

Rekia Boyd.

And Jon Burge.

And if we’re being honest, it goes back at least as far as the Red Summer in 1919, and many other events before and since.

It’s about a fear that I confess I still feel, when I think about how the world will see my young Black daughter.

It’s for that very reason that I stand with those who are sick and tired of the lack of fundamental change. Change that results in the respect, dignity, and freedom that Black people deserve in this country.

To the thousands of people here in Chicago and across the country who engaged in peaceful, non-violent protests for change, I stand with you.

To those who have come out to express our shared righteous indignation in ways that give honor to George Floyd and are consistent with the life and legacy of Mahatma Gandhi, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King and so many others who believe in the power of non-violent social change, I stand with you.

However, I must draw a sharp line between the righteous and the wrong, the hopeful and the cynical. We cannot conflate legitimate First Amendment expression with criminal conduct. Those acts are separate.

We support and uplift what’s right and strongly condemn what’s wrong.

• I will never stand for letting our pain spill over into violence and destruction against our communities. • I will never stand for stealing the dreams and livelihoods of our neighbors. • I will never stand for abandoning our values and our love of this city.

My heart is broken over what has happened here in the city that I love.

I have seen firsthand the piles of shattered glass and empty shelves.

I do not mourn for that glass, or for those shelves.

I mourn for the son in Hyde Park who’s piecing back together the 50-year-old store that his parents built in the face of racism from Jim Crow.

I mourn for the daughter whose father’s dream of a family-owned shoe store that has supported his family for the past fifty years turn into a nightmare overnight.

I mourn for our young people who are clearly hurting, who don’t see a future, for whom the light of hope in their eyes is dimming . . . and is in danger of being extinguished.

My resolve is certain and clear. We will not leave our neighbors behind. As a city, I charge us to stop at nothing to ensure that the businesses we have lost come back to serve and support our neighbors, that the dreams of our young people are not lost, and that our path toward a more fair and just world remains within our reach.

But I don’t forget about the other part of my heart that is broken. It’s broken over a different form of violence, a form that is always with us, a form that produces the desperation and despair that boils up in moments like these.

It is what Bobby Kennedy called “another kind of violence, slower but just as deadly, destructive as the shot or the bomb in the night…the violence of institutions; indifference and inaction and slow decay. This is the violence that afflicts the poor, that poisons relations between men because their skin has different colors. This is a slow destruction of a child by hunger, and schools without books and homes without heat in the winter.”

We see it throughout our city. It manifests as a life expectancy gap that is exposed within a 15-minute drive between adjoining neighborhoods. As a city where 44% of all households don’t earn enough to cover essentials like housing, child care, food, transportation and health care.

We must recognize that this has deep roots in our history. These are the products of a system of violence buried deep in our institutions, that must be rooted out. It calls us to look deep into our organizations, our decisions, and our hearts to reconcile and account for the sins and harms of those before us. Because if we don’t, we bear the weight. We feel the pain. We live with the destruction.

I love this City deeply. It has been over 30 years since I first began my life here. This is the place that made me the woman I wanted to be. Just as it has for millions of others today and throughout our history. I am a Chicagoan.

And as a Chicagoan, I am a fighter. I don’t back down from a challenge. And I protect what I love.

This is our challenge. We know what we must do. We have always known. Full justice, true justice—equity and inclusion amongst all human beings is the only solution. And I am hopeful because of what I have also seen from many of fellow Chicagoans over the past few days through their resilience, hope in moments of despair, and dedication to our City. And here I must thank thousands of our own city workers—including police, transit, sanitation, and others—along with millions of others who have fought to keep us afloat during these trying times. There is no short-cut to get to our better place. It is not one thing, it is not one program. It is not one event, it is not one person. It is everything. And it will require all of us.

The opposite of violence is not security.

The opposite of violence is justice.

Justice is not something we can only look to find in law enforcement or in the courts. Justice makes a demand of all of us. Every part of our city.

So tonight, my sadness, my anger, my frustration…they are met by my righteous hope. Hope that we own this moment.

There are things that are difficult, but we know what we must do.

It is our role as elected officials to roll up our sleeves and work in service of our communities regardless of whether we created the problem or not.

On May 10, 2018, over two years ago, when I presented myself to you – the residents and voters of Chicago – as a candidate for mayor, I spoke then, and I am committed now, to equity and inclusion. I called them our North Stars. That commitment is even more crucial today because of what we have experienced in these last ten weeks and especially these last few days.

I am not here with you tonight to just share reflections, some flowery prose, without concrete solutions…that would be a meaningless or cynical gesture.

I am here to again talk about solutions. Here’s where we start:

Regarding police reform and accountability, yes, we are under a consent decree, but the process of reform has been too slow and too narrowly focused.

I will share with you now, the directives that I have given to Superintendent Brown for some immediate necessary next steps on our journey toward reform.

It means implementing the police accountability reform measures I laid out as the head of the Police Accountability Task Force—ones that build bridges between police and community. I will be working with the Superintendent and department leadership to implement a number of these measures within the next 90 days, ones critical to resolving our crisis. These include: • Better and different training for police officers which brings the community into the academy as teachers. This means training for district law enforcement on the history of neighborhoods taught from the perspective of community members. Expanding on programs like M3 (My Block, My Hood, My City) that provide youth-led tours of neighborhoods, so that officers understand the history of the people they are required to serve and protect.

• Implementing a real officer wellness program and completing the Officer Support System/Early Intervention System pilot that provide supports for officers in crisis, improving our peer support program and providing counselors to those in need—because we all know hurt people hurt people. Our officers must have better tools to manage the trauma and stress they see every day.

• Mandating crisis intervention and procedural justice training for all officers. Providing real tools for officers and community members to deescalate challenging situations.

• Establishing a new recruit program on police-community relations and community policing with views from the community about what works. 90 days. Let’s get it done and the Superintendent and the Department must be totally transparent in these efforts. This is just a start, not the end of our journey for police reform and accountability. On top of these crucial reform measures, we need additional concrete solutions now to help our neighbors and businesses recover…

That means funds for small businesses that have been hit hard recently, but that have always been neglected. So we will continue working to isolate grant funds to support those businesses that have suffered most and need to recover.

That means immediately setting up a new fund for small businesses that have been

hit hard recently, but that have always been neglected. The City will dedicate at least $10M of funds to help support businesses that have been most harmed in recent days. The funds will be provided city-wide, with an equity weighting that focuses on South and West sides.

It also means that I will use every tool at my disposal to push insurance companies to do the right thing by their business customers. We are continuing to push and will soon have an announcement on insurance support for businesses. Now is the time to cut through red tape, stop hiding behind small print, get your adjusters out into the neighborhoods and start cutting checks.

And it means comprehensive investment in mental health resources and healthcare. Which as I announced recently, includes $1.2 million in funding at the communitybased level to expand access for our residents experiencing serious mental illness; investment in a telemedicine platform to increase access; and a website dedicated to wellness and self-care open to all Chicagoans.

I also want to speak to our young people right how. I want you to know that we hear you and we see you. I know that you are concerned and hurt and angry and traumatized as we all are. But my ask of you is this—be an example for us adults, in the way that you are with each other.

Be examples in the way that you process the hurt and the fear that you’re experiencing. Be leaders for us and stand up.

And for my fellow adults, I say this all the time: Our children are watching. My hope is that they see all of us standing up in this moment, and standing tall because we need to be there for them now more than ever. Even in this difficult and scary time.

So we will clean up these broken windows, but we can’t stop there. We must also clean up and repair our broken systems.

Not just by ending the violence we’ve seen here, but by reimagining our city, and what our city means for every neighborhood and every community.

Because as we repair this damage, as we mend these broken windows, and clean our streets, we have an opportunity to ensure that we do the same for those wounds that are not immediately visible, for the harm that has been done over many generations, and for the cracks in our society that we have ignored.

We can do this, and we will do this. This is a start, not an end. Much more needs to be done. But I am committed, and I need you to be with me.

That is the dream we must fulfill. That is the task now at our hands. If we work, we can do what James Baldwin described, we will have ""in the teeth of the most terrifying odds, achieved an unassailable and monumental dignity.""

My brothers and sisters, even in the midst of our broken hearts from our brother George who was ruthlessly taken away, and so many here in our city, before and after Laquan McDonald, we need to remember and cherish our great strength: that is of course our diversity.

77 neighborhoods strong, each unique and beautiful.

140 plus languages, but we all speak in unison.

We hail from many backgrounds, worship different Gods, but we are all united as Chicagoans.

We cannot fail, we will not fail.

We will not be distracted by those who are not pure of heart and mind. They are not us and we are not them. We will and must be united together around a singular vision that we rise and fall together.

If there is to be an uprising, let it be for peace. I call on all people of good will, young, old, black, brown, white, Asian, from all faith traditions, to rise up with me for peace.

Stand for peace.

Thank you.

God bless you.

And God bless this great City of Chicago.","Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot addressed city residents Tuesday in a speech aimed at contextualizing ""events that have happened in recent days.""

As the Chronicle went to press, protests and dangerous encounters have continued, but tensions have eased somewhat as the city's leaders, activists, and institutions grapple with how to respond and move onward.

After Justin Howell suffered head injuries after being struck with a beanbag round and falling to the pavement, his brother Joshua responded to Manley’s offers to pray for the victim’s family: “We aren’t interested in your prayers. We are interested in you appropriately using the responsibilities with which the people of Austin have entrusted you. Prayer is not an excuse to abdicate responsibility.”

In addition to the ongoing investigation into the death of Mike Ramos after being shot by APD Officer Christopher Taylor, the department is now conducting similar probes into at least three shootings of peaceful protesters, leading to life-threatening injuries, by riot-armed officers using ""less lethal impact munitions"" near APD's own headquarters at I-35 and Eighth Street. The adjoining highway overpass was overtaken multiple times by crowds over the course of the protests; according to police Chief Brian Manley, blocking the highway was an unacceptable outcome that put the safety of the whole city in jeopardy. After clearing the highway on Saturday using dozens of officers at street level, APD on Sun­day used tear gas (CS gas, along with smoke canisters) to disperse protesters more quickly and safely, in Manley's assessment.

According to city officials, around a dozen people were hospitalized with injuries sustained during the protests; Austin EMS spokespeople told us they estimated the department responded to 29 protest-related incidents (some treated at the scene, some transported) Saturday and Sunday. Most severely, 20-year-old Justin Howell suffered head injuries after being struck with a beanbag round and falling to the pavement; he underwent surgery on Tuesday at Dell Seton Medical Center. Howell's brother Joshua edits the opinion section of the Texas A&M University student newspaper, The Battalion, and in a column he responded to Manley's offers to pray for the victim's family. ""To which my family, a deeply religious one, says this,"" Joshua Howell wrote: ""We aren't interested in your prayers. We are interested in you appropriately using the responsibilities with which the people of Austin have entrusted you. Prayer is not an excuse to abdicate responsibility.""

A pregnant woman struck in the stomach by munitions fired by APD did not lose her baby, as many had feared. Saraneka ""Nemo"" Martin was retreating under fire when hit, according to her husband Kenneth: ""Horrif­ically Nemo got shot with projectiles in her abdomen and in her back while pregnant,"" he wrote on a GoFundMe he organized to raise funds for the family's medical and legal expenses. ""Our baby is miraculously ok, as far as we know, but we will definitely need another check up. We are in a safe place, resting and recovering."" Kenneth Martin says any leftover funds from the appeal – more than $18,000 had been raised as of press time – would be donated to relevant organizations.

Another GoFundMe has raised more than $120,000 for Brad Levi Ayala and his family; the 16-year-old was hit in the head at nearly the maximum range of the ""less lethal"" beanbag rounds, on the hill on the east side of I-35 at Eighth Street, more than 50 yards from the crowds on the highway. At press time, he remains hospitalized, reportedly in serious but stable condition.

Boots on the Ground

APD provided reporters with information on 24 arrests on protest-related charges (including four by Department of Public Safety troopers at the Capitol) over the weekend, as well as at least 15 for burglary in what have been described as looting incidents. DPS Director Steve McCraw told reporters at a Tuesday news conference that ""organized antifa"" had broken into the Target at Capital Plaza on I-35 at 51st Street, miles from the protests, but did not provide further clarification; APD reported four burglary arrests there Saturday night.

While McCraw joined other local and state law enforcement leaders in deploring the murder (his word) of George Floyd, he also identified outside agitators from the left and right as well as apolitical criminals who had used Texas protests as an opportunity for mischief. Manley also made reference to ""infiltrators"" at his Monday evening press conference, but was generally more circumspect, distinguishing peaceful protesters from those wishing to cause harm but not blaming unrest on outside forces. His officers engaged with less force with protesters at APD headquarters Monday and Tuesday evening, and in fact brought the crowd within its perimeter guarding the building early Wednesday morning after two different motorists circumvented barricades along the I-35 frontage road, with the apparent intent of running into the crowd.

Protesters on Saturday at APD headquarters and on Sunday all over Downtown, including the Texas Capitol and City Hall, told the Chronicle that they could be peaceful and very angry at the same time. One Black woman, who declined to be identified, said on Sunday afternoon as she marched with a group down Congress Avenue, ""I'm here for justice because we are tired as Black people at this point. We marched, we rallied, we protested in peace. Nothing has happened. ... I'm here standing on behalf of my people and I'm angry. I want peace, but I want justice first.""

Was she afraid to protest after the violence seen Saturday both in Austin and around the country? ""I don't walk in fear. The only person I fear is God. I'm practicing my First Amendment right, that's why I'm here. There's no reason to fear. We're human, just like everybody else out here. People are angry. If you protested peacefully for years and nothing has happened, now you got people crying out.""

On the west side of the Capitol grounds, one female protester held a sign that read ""White Supremacy is a Looter: BLM, black lives matter."" She implored the stone-faced officers to look within themselves and said, ""We are not asking you to revolutionize the police department, we are asking you to be human.""

During the protests and marches through Downtown, people on bicycles and one-wheel boards and on foot made their way through the crowd sharing food and water. Legal aid observers (in green hats) monitored the crowd to render assistance as needed during confrontations with police, and members of the grassroots organization Street Medics Austin provided treatment for those with heat exhaustion, pepper spray exposure, scrapes, and contusions.

""We understand and recognize that in situations like this, it's very difficult for emergency services to get down here for a variety of reasons,"" said Toby Heidel, Street Medics member. ""If we can take some of that load and provide some support on the ground ... it keeps the stress off of that system.""

Walking a Very Narrow Line

Manley, who was named chief to succeed Art Acevedo (now leading Houston's police) after community praise for APD's response under his watch to the 2018 bombings, has resisted demands that he resign since last fall's revelations of racism in his executive ranks; those calls have gained further strength since the killing of Mike Ramos and, now, the events of this week. The chief fought back tears – which some critics dismissed as inauthentic – as he discussed with reporters the ""tragic incidents ... that did not go the way they should have gone."" Describing the Ramos shooting as ""a very concerning and critical incident here,"" Manley defined APD's mission as ""creating space"" for necessary dialogue. ""The community wants to have those conversations, and that opportunity was truly taken away from them this weekend,"" Manley said, placing the onus for the weekend's violence on ""others who joined that group for reasons other than peaceful protest.""

On Wednesday afternoon, City Manager Spencer Cronk – the only person with the authority to fire Manley – issued a lengthy statement addressing the week of unrest. In it, he sought to walk a fine line: ""I personally have struggled with the complexity of this moment and realized that our feelings can't and shouldn't be limited to one or two choices. I believe that we can condemn the disgusting abuse of power, authority, and trust by some officers, while at the same time respect and appreciate those who choose policing as a calling and treat others with the dignity and respect we all deserve.""

He acknowledged that ""for far too many in our community, lived experience has left them feeling hopeless, afraid, and convinced that nothing will ever change,"" and said that he, his leadership team, and Manley are all committed to ""finding a way forward that rebuilds that loss of trust while improving our police force to ensure it is reflective of the community values Austin holds dear.""

At the state level, Abbott also did not take the opportunity to catastrophize the unrest that had been presented to him and his fellow governors by President Trump in a Monday morning call one participant described as ""unhinged."" Abbott declined to invite U.S. military forces to deploy to Texas, nor has he sent the state's forces (DPS, National Guard, and others) to bolster the get-tough tactics employed elsewhere. Though he deplored violence and committed to restoring order as expected, that ""does not complete our test,"" Abbott said. ""We will not end until fairness, justice, and equality are a reality in every corner of our state.""

The governor, who has also been the state's attorney general and a justice on its supreme court, described Texas as a leader in criminal justice reform, noting that the legislation named for some of its prior victims of injustice – Timothy Cole, Sandra Bland, James Byrd, Michael Morton – passed with bipartisan support, and promising more of the same in 2021. ""We are up to the task of doing both, restoring justice and ensuring safety in our communities. We can seize this moment to bridge the divide in this state.""

As Abbott spoke with reporters in Dallas, the Austin City Council met for the first time publicly since the protests began; Natasha Harper-Madison, Council's sole Black member, told her colleagues, ""We cannot continue to stick our fingers in our ears and just wait for the next eruption of anger. ... I would ask for forgiveness for sounding angry, but I don't need forgiveness for sounding angry. I am angry. And I am hurt and I am sad! And you should be too. And if you're not, then I don't know what to tell you. It didn't start with Mike Ramos! I could name names all day and that's a damn shame, y'all. We should all be sad and mad right now.

""We have got to act,"" she concluded. ""If we don't do anything else with our time, we have got to act and in a way that people know that we see them and we hear them now, loud and clear.""

In a message to the Conference, UN Secretary General António Guterres admitted to having “a love affair” with the Sudanese, lauding them as “a wonderful people, a generous people”, who always held their doors open, sharing all that they had.

As the Transitional Government implements political and economic reforms, a strong consensus emerged to support the country’s transition in building peace, democratic governance and inclusive economic recovery as well as in progressing towards debt relief.

“We need to mobilize massive financial support”, the UN chief said, which, among other things, is needed to “remove any hiccups that still exist between Sudan and international financial institutions”.

“It is not only because the Sudanese people deserve it…[but] because the world needs a stable Sudan, a democratic Sudan”, he continued.

Pledged support

Underlining the necessity of political partnership and economic support, at the end of the conference, the participants issued a joint communiqué pledging $1.8 billion – to which the World Bank committed to an additional pre-arrears clearance grant, of up to $400 million.

These funds will be used to enhance macro-economic stabilization and the Sudan Family Support Programme – providing vital assistance to millions of vulnerable people, enhancing Sudan’s COVID-19 response capacity and, more generally, supplying humanitarian assistance and development cooperation.

“This Conference marks the start of a process, which will be followed by subsequent engagement by the international community to take stock of the progress made by Sudan in implementing reforms and to allow its partners to adapt their support accordingly”, co-hosts the UN, Germany, European Union and Sudanese Government said, in a joint press release.

Lawrence J. Hogan Jr. (R) commended Baltimore City demonstrators and law enforcement officers Wednesday for a streak of peaceful protests after the death of a black man in police custody in Minnesota last week.

“I think we learned a lot of lessons,” Hogan said during a State House news conference. “We sort of wrote the book on how to deal with these things in 2015 and now, it’s even better.”

Baltimore City has seen days of mostly nonviolent demonstrations following the death of George Floyd at the hands of four Minneapolis police officers last week, which Hogan called “senseless.”

Five years ago, the city saw multiple days of unrest when Freddie Gray died after he was held in Baltimore City Police custody.

The governor sang the praises of Baltimore City protesters, who he thanked for keeping the peace and “showing the power of a strong, compassionate and united community.”

“I’m incredibly proud that during this difficult time, the people of Baltimore City have set an example for the rest of America,” Hogan said.

Hogan’s remarks echoed those of House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones (D-Baltimore City) during the opening of the weekly Joint COVID-19 Response Legislative Workgroup earlier Wednesday.

Jones told her fellow lawmakers that demonstrations organized by the state’s youth have “modeled for the rest of the country what peaceful protests look like.” She also said she’s ready for a shift.

“Do not mistake what people are protesting and what we are fighting for — change in a systemic, racial injustice that has hurt, killed and held down so many black Americans,” Jones said. “The House is committed to passing systemic policing reform in the 2021 legislative session.”

Over the weekend, Jones announced that she and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Luke H. Clippinger (D-Baltimore City) would be creating the Workgroup to Address Police Reform and Accountability in Maryland, which is set to begin meeting this summer.

Comprised of 13 House lawmakers, the workgroup will review misconduct and body camera and use of force procedures, among other policies.

Hogan said he’d be “certainly more than happy” to review the workgroup’s recommendations.

Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) described this workgroup as a meaningful activation of the legislative process.

“There are a lot of questions about the future; about what our democracy looks like; about our institutions,” Ferguson said Wednesday. “And it is processes like this — it is the legislative branch that is reviewing and overseeing the emergency alongside of the executive that is essential to restore faith and trust in the institutions that we are all a part of.”

At the start of Wednesday’s Board of Public Works meeting, Lt. Gov Boyd K. Rutherford (R), explained that while he has “the utmost respect” for law enforcement agents, including the relationships he has forged with Maryland state troopers assigned to his security detail, he stands with people protesting the death of Floyd.

“Unfortunately, though, there are too many men and women across the country that look just like me, who instead of feeling safe and protected when they see a law enforcement officer they feel anxious, and, in some cases, afraid,” Rutherford said. “And while I know there are thousands of hardworking and dedicated and caring law enforcement officers across the country doing great things in their communities every day, their positive work can be overshadowed in an instance by those who will abuse their power and authority that they had received by having a badge and a uniform.”

Rutherford said he was born in Washington, D.C., three years after the historic Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision on racial discrimination in education. “No stranger to discrimination,” he explained that as a young man he experienced mistreatment at the hands of Prince George’s County police.

After condemning agitators who have caused violent protests in other cities, Rutherford praised Baltimore City protesters for remaining peaceful during the days and nights of demonstration seen in the city — noting an instance where protesters found and turned over a man to police who had thrown fireworks over the police line Monday evening.

“I hope Maryland can continue to be model for the country on how you can protest, demonstrate and express your concern in a peaceful manner and not allow outside agitators to take over or hijack the message that we’re trying to send.”

State Treasurer Nancy K. Kopp (D) told the board that she participated in civil rights protests half a century ago, and is “ashamed [she] didn’t continue doing it.”

“Protest is a wonderful American institution,” she said. “To hear the president of the United States apparently regard it as the next thing to insurrection and revolution is frightening and wrong, and I think the state of Maryland, thus far, has shown that to him.”

President Trump has been harshly critical of the protests happening across the country, recently threatening to involve the military.

Comptroller Peter V.R. Franchot (D) criticized Trump’s decision to clear a peaceful protest near the White House with tear gas and rubber bullets so he could take a photograph holding a bible in front of St. John’s Church Monday evening.

“That’s pretty unprecedented,” said Franchot. “In a time where our economy is crashing and tens of millions of Americans are unemployed as we speak; when over 107,000 people have perished from the deadly pandemic; when there are riots and looting in dozens of cities around the country; when there’s innocent, commendable protests against police brutality all over the country; How exactly is this being described as making America great again?”

Asked if the use of pepper spray on non-violent crowds is an abuse of power, Hogan said it’s “almost the complete opposite” approach that Maryland has taken, noting very few instances of altercations seen in the past few days.

“I wouldn’t certainly have taken that approach,” he said.

While the governor may be winning praise for the peaceful state of the protests, he has caught a fair amount of flack for deploying members of the Maryland National Guard to monitor the monuments at D.C.’s National Mall.

In a statement, Dana Vickers Shelley, executive director of the Maryland ACLU, called it “an embrace of President Trump’s tactics that endanger the lives of Black people.”

Hogan said that he decided to deploy members National Guard after Dr. Mark T. Esper, the U.S. secretary of Defense, called him in an appeal to not have to deploy the military.

The governor explained that D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) does not have control over the National Guard and that she approved the mission. Maryland Matters reached out to her office to confirm but has yet to receive a response.

Hogan, who said that he opposes activating the military in this scenario, consented, qualifying that their deployment “had nothing to do with the things that took place” during Trump’s Monday night photo-op.

“It was after that,” he said.

After close to two years of a stagnating peace process, the Myanmar government, its military and ethnic armed groups signatory to the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement resumed negotiations aimed at holding a Panglong-21 peace conference later this year. The peace process will then enter hibernation while national elections take place.

Why does it matter? Recent negotiations have focused mainly on ensuring that the peace process continues after the election. But genuine progress toward ending Myanmar’s long-running ethnic conflicts is unlikely to be made without a decisive change in approach, particularly from the government.

What should be done? With the National League for Democracy likely to win another term, the government, military and ethnic armed groups should use the hibernation period constructively to review causes of the current impasse, rebuild trust through sustained informal dialogue, and take steps to reinvigorate the peace process from 2021.

Executive Summary

A flurry of negotiations among Myanmar’s government, its military and ethnic armed groups belies deeper problems in the country’s moribund peace process. The government and armed groups that have signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) are eager to hold a Panglong-21 peace conference before electoral dy­namics take precedence later this year. As a result, two prominent armed groups that had suspended their participation have formally re-entered the peace process. Although these are positive developments, even if it takes place the conference would be largely symbolic and do little to address the fundamental obstacles on Myanmar’s road toward sustainable peace. By putting formal negotiations on hold for at least six months, the election and subsequent transition period constitute a unique opportunity for a rethink. All parties involved should use this window to examine blockages that have hindered genuine progress so far, multiply informal meetings to rebuild trust and examine ways of reinvigorating the peace process from 2021.

Although negotiators have made some modest progress, conflict has intensified in Shan and Rakhine States, and the government has been unable to convince the country’s most powerful armed groups to sign the NCA.

When Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) took office in March 2016, hopes were high that it would consolidate the peace process launched under her predecessor, Thein Sein, in 2011. The results, however, have been disappointing. Although negotiators have made some modest progress, such as agreeing on 51 points for a future Union Peace Accord, conflict has intensified in Shan and Rakhine States, and the government has been unable to convince the country’s most powerful armed groups to sign the NCA. Formal political negotiations with the ten armed groups that have signed the agreement have stalled, culminating in the temporary withdrawal of the two most important of them – the Karen National Union and Restoration Council of Shan State – from the peace process in late 2018. Although the NLD administration initially said peace negotiations were its top priority, it has shown neither the determination nor the capacity to take the process forward. Since 2017, its focus has shifted increasingly to other issues better suited to the project of shoring up political support among its ethnic Burman base.

The approaching election, slated for November 2020 but now subject to possible coronavirus-related delays, has given new impetus to the peace process. Informal talks over the past six months have encouraged the Karen National Union and Restoration Council of Shan State to return to the peace process, and formal meetings with all signatories have been convened since January with the aim of holding a Panglong-21 conference before election dynamics come to dominate the political landscape in the second half of the year. The COVID-19 outbreak is likely to make this original timeline impossible, but negotiators on both sides are intent on holding the conference before the vote. Despite this renewed commitment, the primary objectives for both sides are modest. The NLD sees the Panglong-21 meeting mostly as a way to boost its political campaign, while ethnic armed groups want to ensure that the peace process continues after the vote, regardless of who comes to power.

The election will bring further risks for ethnic conflict and the peace process.

The election will bring further risks for ethnic conflict and the peace process. Aung San Suu Kyi’s popularity with the Burman majority is likely to ensure that the NLD wins enough seats to select the president and form the next government, but ethnic minorities are increasingly aggrieved at her government’s Burman nationalist tone and the overwhelming Burman dominance in political institutions. The discontent is most evident in Rakhine State, where the political marginalisation of the Rakhine ethnic minority under the NLD has boosted support for the Arakan Army insurgency. Armed conflict and insecurity are likely to result in the cancellation of voting in some constituencies in minority areas, particularly in Rakhine State, which will only deepen local minorities’ alienation. The election period, however, will also be an opportunity to reflect on how to take the peace process forward. The formal negotiations will likely be put on hold for six to twelve months, until after the next cabinet is sworn in (scheduled for late March 2021). The current government, the military and ethnic armed groups should use this period to review their own strategy and goals, ramp up informal dialogue and examine crucial issues that have so far been put aside, such as the growth of the illicit economy and the mounting might of military-aligned militias. Even if the COVID-19 pandemic delays the Panglong-21 conference, there will still be a significant period during which formal peace negotiations will not take place. This downtime constitutes a unique opportunity for all parties to reflect on how to restart the process with a more constructive approach in 2021. If the NLD forms the next government, as appears likely, it should use its second term in office to reinvigorate its leadership of the peace process. Overcoming the deadlock in negotiations toward a political settlement requires a fundamental shift in approach. As a first step, Naypyitaw should overhaul institutions like the National Reconciliation and Peace Centre, to rely less on former government bureaucrats and instead draw in new negotiators and advisers from a range of backgrounds, such as business, academia and civil society. The key to substantive progress, however, lies in renewed political commitment from Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD to the peace process, a stronger sense of empathy with the grievances of ethnic minorities, and a clear vision for where the peace process is going. Yangon/Brussels, 19 June 2020

I. Introduction

In 2011, President Thein Sein’s new government launched a peace process aimed at ending decades of conflict by reaching a political settlement with Myanmar’s ethnic armed groups. His administration quickly signed bilateral ceasefires with most groups, eight of which also signed a Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) in October 2015. Negotiators then drafted a framework for a political dialogue process, and convened the first Union Peace Conference in January 2016, shortly before Thein Sein left office.

Thein Sein’s administration was unable to convince the most powerful armed groups to join the process.

Facebook Email



Thein Sein’s administration was unable, however, to convince the most powerful armed groups to join the process. The government’s exclusion of three other groups from signing the NCA had raised concerns among potential signatories about the agreement’s inclusivity. Some also had reservations about giving Thein Sein a political boost shortly before the 2015 elections. Ten groups did not sign the NCA, and as a result could not participate in the launch of the political dialogue.

The National League for Democracy (NLD) government that came to office in March 2016 thus inherited a complex, two-track process: political dialogue with NCA signatories, and ceasefire negotiations with non-signatories aimed at getting them into the political dialogue process. It also inherited a valuable, albeit fragile, trust with ethnic armed groups, some of which had been fighting the Myanmar military for many decades. There were clear opportunities for progress, but as Crisis Group warned in a June 2017 report, “the path toward a negotiated end to Myanmar’s conflicts remain[ed] fraught with difficulties”.

Since then, these difficulties have come to the fore, to the extent that the peace process has now stalled for the past two years. Aung San Suu Kyi’s NLD government has been unable to steer the political dialogue process forward or convince non-signatories to sign the NCA, and the ceasefire monitoring mechanism designed to resolve disputes between the military and ethnic armed group signatories has proven largely ineffective. The trust that once existed has long since dissipated and the peace process now faces an uncertain future. The next twelve months, during which Myanmar is scheduled to hold elections and swear in its next government, offer an opportunity to reset and recalibrate.

This report examines some of the reasons why the peace process has stumbled and proposes concrete initiatives that all parties can undertake to kickstart negotiations in 2021, when the new government will come to power. A reboot will require not only technical fixes to the peace process architecture but more importantly reestablishment of trust through a fresh approach and shift in attitude, particularly from the government and the military. The report focuses primarily on the political dialogue process and implementation of the NCA with current signatories, rather than negotiations with non-signatories, as unless progress is made on both these aspects first, there will be little incentive for most of these groups to sign the national ceasefire.

This report is based on Crisis Group research since January 2020, including interviews with members of the government’s peacemaking team, officials from peace process bodies, ethnic armed group representatives, diplomats, donors, civil society organisation staff, and local researchers and analysts. Due to the emergence of COVID-19, planned travel for the report was not possible. Interviews took place in Yangon, some in person and others by phone or videoconference.

II. The Peace Process in Disarray

When Aung San Suu Kyi’s NLD came to power in March 2016, hopes were high that it could lead the peace process forward. Aung San Suu Kyi’s political authority, her stated commitment to the peace process and the prospect of more friendly relations with China, which has leverage over some of the armed groups near its border, provided a strong base to build on her predecessor’s work. The NLD moved quickly to install a new peace team, convene a Union Peace Conference – rebranded as Panglong-21 – in July 2016 and encourage the remaining armed groups to sign the NCA so that they could join the political negotiations.

Progress was much slower and more difficult than the NLD had anticipated.

After the initial optimism that followed the election, however, progress was much slower and more difficult than the NLD had anticipated. Aside from underestimating the scale of the challenge, the NLD made some significant miscalculations, including its choice of negotiators and its prioritisation of formal talks over informal discussions. It also viewed itself as a neutral actor in the process, seeing its role as mediating between the military and ethnic armed groups – a fundamental misreading of how many ethnic minorities perceive the party and government more broadly, dominated as they are by ethnic Burmans.

Efforts to convince non-signatory groups to sign the NCA quickly stalled, and most of them soon joined forces under the leadership of the country’s largest armed group, the United Wa State Army, to reject the ceasefire outright and call for fresh negotiations. They still have not signed the NCA and as a result have yet to formally join the political dialogue, except occasionally as observers. Two other armed groups that were not part of the United Wa State Army-led bloc, the New Mon State Party and Lahu Democratic Union, signed the NCA in April 2018, but they have few combatants and little political heft.

Signatories, who were already concerned at pursuing political dialogue in the absence of the country’s most powerful armed groups, also grew increasingly frustrated at the NLD’s bureaucratic approach to negotiations, its inflexibility and its unwillingness to challenge the military’s positions. The majority of them have come to see the NLD’s position on power sharing as being broadly aligned with that of Myanmar’s military, in that they both represent the interests of the Burman Buddhist majority and are unwilling to make significant concessions to ethnic minorities (see Section IV for details).

The NLD’s initial eagerness to pursue peace negotiations was based largely on its belief that such talks would be the easiest way to achieve its desired changes to Myanmar’s military-drafted constitution. The military – which holds an effective veto over changes to the charter through its presence in parliament – has said resolving Myanmar’s conflicts is a precondition for any substantial constitutional reform. Since the peace process was supposed to lead to a political settlement with armed groups and the introduction of some form of federalism, requiring significant changes to the constitution, the NLD hoped to use the opportunity to simultaneously introduce additional amendments that reflected its other ambitions, in particular the dilution of the military’s political role. But as the scale of the peace challenge became increasingly clear, the government shifted focus, pursuing constitutional change through parliamentary channels and prioritising grassroots economic development, another of its core electoral promises. In the process, it ended up neglecting the peace negotiations.

Sensing that disarmament of ethnic armed groups is increasingly unlikely, Myanmar’s generals have also become less enthusiastic about the peace process and hardened their position.

This perceived lack of commitment from the NLD has created resentment and mistrust among ethnic armed groups, while other factors further undermine progress. Deteriorating personal relations and political competition between Aung San Suu Kyi and Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing have weakened coordination between the government and military. Sensing that disarmament of ethnic armed groups is increasingly unlikely, Myanmar’s generals have also become less enthusiastic about the peace process and hardened their position that signing the NCA is a prerequisite for participating in political dialogue. Some of the military’s actions, particularly the building of strategic roads through Karen National Union territory in Kayin State, have significantly undermined trust and confidence in the NCA. Expanding conflict in Rakhine and northern Shan States, discussed in more detail below, has also created new challenges for political dialogue with NCA signatories and ceasefire negotiations with non-signatories.

The inability of the Joint Ceasefire Monitoring Committee (JMC) to resolve such disagreements between the military and NCA signatory groups has further eroded trust. Although the JMC showed some initial promise, its structural shortcomings gradually came to the fore. Particularly problematic is the fact that all JMC bodies, from the national to local levels, are chaired by military officers, with ethnic armed groups only able to appoint vice chairs. Further, the civilian appointees, who are supposed to be neutral, have struggled to mediate between the different sides. The military has rejected proposals from ethnic armed groups to revise the JMC’s structure or include international representatives in the ceasefire monitoring process as observers or advisers – a prospect that was envisaged in the NCA text.

Another factor that has undermined the peace process is the failure to implement the “interim arrangements” section of the NCA, which had been anticipated as one of the agreement’s major peace dividends. The ceasefire proposes “coordination” on “programs and projects” in ethnic armed group-held territory in a range of areas, including health, education, socio-economic development, environmental conservation and drug eradication. This section of the NCA could have facilitated on-the-ground cooperation and trust building between the government and ethnic armed groups, but disputes over interpretation have stymied progress: the government’s National Reconciliation and Peace Centre has demanded ethnic armed groups seek permission for all such activities, while ethnic armed groups argue that it should be a partnership where projects and initiatives are agreed jointly. At the same time, the government has been accused of introducing laws, policies and programs – such as new laws on land acquisition – that affect people in ethnic armed group areas, without any consultation.

As a result, the peace process has been at a standstill since 2018. The government has been able to hold only three Panglong-21 peace conferences since taking office – despite the political dialogue framework specifying that one take place every six months – and the most recent, in July 2018, was largely symbolic. To make matters worse, two key NCA signatories, the Karen National Union and Restoration Council of Shan State, suspended their participation following a disastrous “high-level” meeting with the government and military in October 2018.

Clashes between the Arakan Army and the military in Rakhine State escalated dramatically.

Facebook Email



Shortly afterward, in January 2019, clashes between the Arakan Army and the military in Rakhine State escalated dramatically. The fighting has since spread and intensified into the bloodiest conflict that Myanmar has experienced in recent decades. It shows no sign of abating. With political dialogue negotiations on hold, the government and military have tried to reach bilateral ceasefires with the Arakan Army and three related groups – the Kachin Independence Army, the Ta’ang National Liberation Army and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army – as a precursor to signing the NCA. But the proposal required these groups to accept major restrictions on their areas of operations, including an Arakan Army withdrawal from Rakhine State. This unrealistic demand ensured that the talks failed and even helped stoke conflict in northern Shan State: in an effort to shake up negotiations, the newly formed Brotherhood Alliance – comprising the Arakan Army, Ta’ang National Liberation Army and Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army – launched deadly attacks along the region’s main highway in August 2019.

When the NLD came to office, there was optimism that support from China could be an important asset for driving the peace process forward. Although China has gradually become more involved, it has limited its role mainly to facilitating talks with non-signatory groups operating along its border. Its only significant intervention in the political dialogue process has been to enable the attendance of non-signatories at Panglong-21 conferences. China’s interest seems to be primarily in ensuring stability in border areas, in part to support its economic ambitions, not in facilitating the peace process as a whole. Increasingly, it appears sceptical of the prospects for a political settlement to Myanmar’s conflicts. Instead, it is promoting economic development and integration as a way to end the fighting.

III. Preserving the Peace Process in an Election Year

As Myanmar entered an election year in 2020, prospects for substantive progress appeared dim. The two most important signatories to the NCA, the Karen National Union and Restoration Council of Shan State, had suspended their participation in the peace process more than a year earlier. Negotiations with non-signatories to the NCA had stalled amid heavy fighting in Rakhine and northern Shan States. Negotiators from the government and ethnic armed groups agreed that formal discussions would be unlikely after June 2020, as the government would be consumed by preparations for the vote and armed groups would be unwilling to do anything that could give the NLD an electoral advantage.

Despite these hurdles, the election has also created some renewed impetus for the peace process with NCA signatories.

Despite these hurdles, the election has also created some renewed impetus for the peace process with NCA signatories. In 2015, the NLD told voters that ending the country’s long-running conflict would be one of its three priorities while in office. Embarking five years later on a re-election campaign with the peace process in disarray could make it easy prey for critics and political rivals, particularly in ethnic minority areas. For all the complaints about the status of negotiations, there is also genuine concern among ethnic armed groups that the process could collapse due to either armed conflict, a change in government or a lack of momentum, threatening nearly a decade of effort. “Nobody wants the peace process to die. But this is a treacherous stretch because of the election”, said one peace process observer.

In an effort to salvage the process and show results before the electoral campaign, in late 2019 the government took the initiative of arranging a semi-informal dialogue with NCA signatories. Its apparent willingness to negotiate and address some of the perceived roadblocks, for example by clarifying some key terms in the NCA, encouraged the Karen National Union and Restoration Council of Shan State to return to the process. Since January, a series of formal meetings have taken place with all ten signatories, with the objective of holding another Panglong-21 peace conference before the election. Negotiators on both sides worked hard to stick to the tight deadlines so that the conference could take place in late April or May, although the COVID-19 pandemic has now forced negotiators to postpone it to July or August at the earliest.

In preparation for these discussions, the NCA signatories resolved some of their own internal differences. Within the signatories’ coordinating body, the Peace Process Steering Team, the more powerful members had long chafed at being treated on par with groups that have few armed forces and little political influence. In early December, the group agreed to new terms of reference for the steering team that gave the Karen National Union and Restoration Council of Shan State more authority. The leader of the Restoration Council of Shan State, Lieutenant General Yawd Serk, is now heading negotiations with the government, but it is the Karen National Union that is essentially driving policy for the NCA signatories.

Sensing their renewed political leverage with the government, the NCA signatories have pushed for an ambitious suite of agreements in exchange for participating in a Panglong-21 conference. These include an addendum to the NCA that defines some of its key terms and a broader framework for the establishment of a “federal democratic union”, with timelines for implementation. The signatories argue that these agreements, which would be approved at the Panglong-21 conference and then by the national legislature, are necessary guarantees for them to feel confident about how the process will move forward post-election.

The outcome of negotiations is likely to be more modest than the armed groups initially hoped. The government has pushed back against some of their proposals, including the idea of timelines, and the short window available before the conference takes place, the lack of capacity on all sides and the impact of COVID-19 are likely to constrain what can be achieved. Still, the talks probably will result in at least some progress toward agreements to address some of the issues that have been stumbling blocks over the past four years. At a minimum, a Panglong-21 conference will take place – COVID-19 permitting – and the peace process will be preserved for resumption at some point after the election. As an analyst close to ethnic armed groups said:

There’s a will and intention to hold a Panglong-21 conference. The question is less whether it will happen than what the purpose and outcome will be, as there’s a huge range of potential outcomes … but it’s also positive if at a minimum the parties recommit themselves to continue the process. That’s significantly different from what some of them were saying a year ago.

Although positive, the return of the Karen National Union and Restoration Council of Shan State to the peace process and the prospect of a Panglong-21 conference should not be interpreted as any kind of major breakthrough. The recent negotiations that facilitated these developments aim to address mostly technical problems within the peace process. Others, such as the government’s lack of vision and commitment, or its highly centralised decision-making process, and the unwillingness of the government or military to cede any control, will continue to undermine progress toward a peace settlement until they are addressed. These are discussed in more detail in Section IV.

There are a number of issues that could stymie even the modest goals of the government and NCA signatories.

There are also a number of issues that could stymie even the modest goals of the government and NCA signatories. The first is the lack of clarity over the position of the Myanmar military, and in particular its commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, on the recent talks. The NCA signatories’ key demand – clarification of some terms in the ceasefire accord – could encounter pushback from the military, particularly if its leadership wants to deprive the NLD of political mileage ahead of the election. Even while talks were taking place, the Myanmar army has clashed with both the Karen National Union and Restoration Council of Shan State, both NCA signatories. Military obstruction was also partly to blame for the Restoration Council of Shan State’s leader, Lieutenant General Yawd Serk, being unable to travel to a meeting in Naypyitaw in late October, which delayed the resumption of formal talks with NCA signatories.

The election is also likely to amplify the ethnic grievances that underpin Myanmar’s armed conflicts. Aung San Suu Kyi’s NLD is expected to win enough seats to choose the president and form the next government, thanks to her popularity with the Burman majority, but ethnic minorities are increasingly aggrieved by her government’s Burman nationalist tone and Burman dominance in political institutions. Rather than curb its ambitions in ethnic minority areas to defuse tension, the NLD has redoubled its efforts to win seats there, forming an Ethnic Affairs Committee to spearhead its campaign. The government has also relaxed residency requirements for voting, which has angered ethnic parties because it means that more Burman migrants living in ethnic minority areas ­– who are likely to support the NLD – will be able to cast ballots. Although an important step for ensuring universal suffrage in practice, it is perceived as an attempt to shore up NLD support in minority regions. The Union Election Commission is also expected to cancel voting in parts or whole constituencies in minority areas due to armed conflict.

This dynamic is most evident in Rakhine State, where marginalisation under the NLD has caused many ethnic Rakhine to lose faith in the political process. Although the main local political formation, the Arakan National Party, performed strongly in the 2015 election, winning the majority of elected seats in Rakhine State at both the local and national level, the NLD refused to let it form the state government, instead appointing one of its own members of parliament as chief minister. In January 2018, police opened fire on a crowd that had gathered in the ancient city of Mrauk-U to mark the anniversary of an independent Rakhine kingdom’s fall to the Burmans. They killed at least seven people. Days later, the government arrested the state’s leading political figure, Dr Aye Maung, and sentenced him to twenty years’ imprisonment for high treason. These events badly dented Rakhine faith in electoral democracy and fuelled support for the Arakan Army insurgency that has raged across the state since January 2019, leaving hundreds dead and at least 78,000 displaced in Rakhine and southern Chin States.

The other factor creating uncertainty is the COVID-19 pandemic.

The other factor creating uncertainty is the COVID-19 pandemic. Although Myanmar has had only a limited number of confirmed cases at the time of writing, the government has introduced a range of social distancing measures, such as bans on large gatherings, in order to mitigate the contagion’s potential spread. The Restoration Council of Shan State has already been forced to cancel a planned “national-level political dialogue” between the group and other Shan stakeholders to gather input for the Panglong-21 conference. Negotiators in the peace process have also since agreed to push back the national peace conference to July or August. Given how little is known about the pandemic’s possible evolution in Myanmar, these dates should be treated with caution. But those involved in the peace process say all sides are committed to convening the highly symbolic conference at some point this year.

IV. The Need for a Decisive Shake-up

The Panglong-21 peace conference would mark the conclusion of the formal peace negotiations under the current government’s term, after which attention will turn to the elections. The hiatus could last anywhere from six to twelve months, and there would likely be a similar break even if COVID-19 concerns delay Panglong-21. The elections themselves could also be postponed on account of the pandemic, but whenever they take place the NLD is likely to win enough seats to again select the president and form the new government. The NLD could thus resume talks almost immediately after the polls, though it is more likely to wait until it swears in a new cabinet, expected (under the current schedule) in late March 2021. All sides should use this period of downtime constructively, both to re-examine their positions and to address weaknesses in their strategy and approach.

The government has a particular responsibility to set the tone and direction of future peace talks.

The government has a particular responsibility to set the tone and direction of future peace talks, and to use its political authority to drive the process forward. If the peace process is to make progress from 2021, the NLD will need to show newfound levels of leadership, commitment, empathy and flexibility. The party has a major asset in the person of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, who still enjoys immense political capital, but this advantage alone will not be sufficient: the NLD government will need a decisive change in approach to rebuild damaged trust with ethnic armed groups, particularly the NCA signatories involved in formal negotiations toward a political settlement.

Key steps the government could take to relaunch the process include:

Key to this vision is what a future federal democratic union might look like in practice.

Facebook Email



Articulate a new vision for the peace process. The NLD approached the peace process in 2016 as a means to an end – achieving its desired constitutional reforms – and the hollowness of its commitment soon became apparent. Both in public and in private, government officials and peace negotiators also show a lack of empathy for the legitimate grievances of ethnic communities, and a misunderstanding of how Burmans – particularly Burman elites – are perceived by many minority groups. In order to gain the trust of ethnic armed group negotiators, the NLD should articulate a vision that goes beyond the platitudes that presently dominate its statements and more clearly distinguishes its own position from that of the military. Key to this vision is what a future federal democratic union might look like in practice, in particular how it would address the grievances of minorities and reduce the longstanding Burman Buddhist dominance over levers of power.

Back up this vision with short-term actions. The 2008 constitution is a barrier to decentralisation of power in the short term, because it establishes a centralised governance structure and can only be amended with the military’s backing. Nevertheless, the NLD could do much more under the current framework to signal its commitment to granting more autonomy to ethnic minorities. It could start immediately after the next elections: rather than repeat its actions in 2016, when it selected its own parliamentarians as chief ministers of Rakhine and Shan States despite not holding pluralities in those state legislatures, it should appoint chief ministers based on these assemblies’ composition following the polls scheduled for November 2020. The NLD could also use its control of government and the national parliament to undertake decentralisation measures that do not require constitutional change, such as providing more autonomy to the current state and region administrations and boosting their capacity. Such short-term actions will build confidence in its long-term vision for a political solution to Myanmar’s conflicts.

The NLD should look to overhaul and expand its current team.

Facebook Email



Overhaul and expand the peacemaking team. Many of the government’s current negotiators lack the commitment and desire to lead the peace process, and appear to have little understanding of the conflicts or the ethnic grievances that underpin them. Below the leadership, most of the staff at the National Reconciliation and Peace Centre are former bureaucrats or government staff on secondment. Many of them see working on the peace process as a career detour, and their instinct is to place a high priority on protocol and formalities rather than the actual negotiations. Although some civil servants are capable and committed, the most effective members are often those who come from outside the government and party. The NLD should look both within its own ranks and its broader network to overhaul and expand its current team by bringing in full-time members and advisers from diverse backgrounds, including business leaders, political representatives, civil society leaders and academics, who have the commitment and vision to help the government drive the process forward.

Empower peace representatives. The government’s decision-making process is highly centralised in the office of Aung San Suu Kyi. The representatives it sends to negotiate are not empowered to make decisions and instead have to relay proposals back to headquarters. “We are like messengers”, said one negotiator. “We note down what the ethnic armed groups say and give it to [the State Counsellor’s Office]”. Although this issue is primarily one of delegating responsibility, it may help to remove the National Reconciliation and Peace Centre from the state counsellor’s office and create a new, more independent, ministerial-level peace body. This step would not only improve coordination between the government’s top peace negotiator and other ministries, but also send a strong signal that the government is committed to the peace process. It is essential, however, that this body be genuinely empowered to streamline decision-making and implementation, not created simply as a public relations stunt.

Prioritise genuinely informal dialogue. The Thein Sein administration’s peace team developed trust with ethnic armed group leaders in part through regular informal meetings at which issues could be discussed openly. When the NLD took over, it dispensed with this approach, focusing on formal talks and performative set-piece ceremonies. More recently, the government has recognised the importance of more open dialogue, but it has yet to pursue genuinely informal talks. “The government’s definition of informal isn’t really that different from previous formal meetings. It’s still structured, rigid, with all the trappings of a formal meeting”, said one source close to ethnic armed groups. The looming downtime around the elections offers a good opportunity to resume such gatherings away from the pressure of deadlines and formal negotiating positions. When it becomes possible, donors could help arrange retreats or study trips with less strict schedules to allow for mingling and discussions.

In parallel, the military should:

Halt infrastructure projects in ethnic armed group territory. The military’s construction of a strategic road through Karen National Union-held territory in Kayin State – and the inability of the Joint Ceasefire Monitoring Committee to resolve the dispute – was one of the key reasons that the Karen National Union withdrew from the peace process in 2018. More recently, the Karen National Union has accused the military of using drones to undertake reconnaissance of its bases. Both are contrary to the spirit (if not the letter) of the NCA and have severely undermined confidence in the agreement. Fighting sparked by the road construction has resulted in civilian casualties, which also represents a likely violation of the NCA. The military should immediately stop building infrastructure in areas under the control of ethnic armed groups.

Immediately demarcating territory would rebuild some trust and create more confidence among ethnic armed groups.

Facebook Email



Demarcate territory with NCA signatories. The military has argued that building the road in Kayin State is not a violation of the NCA in part because territory has not yet been demarcated. But the absence of demarcation is largely the result of military obstruction: when ethnic armed groups have raised the issue during negotiations, the military has refused to discuss it. Immediately demarcating territory would rebuild some trust and create more confidence among ethnic armed groups that the military is genuinely interested in a negotiated solution, rather than using the NCA to weaken the ethnic armed groups’ hold over their territory, as has often been the case in the past.

Together, the government and military should:

Strengthen the joint nature of the peace process. The peace process is supposed to be co-managed by all parties, but the government and military have been reluctant to genuinely share control with ethnic armed groups. In key peace process institutions such as the Joint Ceasefire Monitoring Committee and the Union Peace Dialogue Joint Committee, which oversees the political dialogue process, the government and military have appointed the chair and ethnic armed groups are left to appoint the deputies. Introducing a rotating leadership, particularly for the Joint Ceasefire Monitoring Committee, would send an important message that these bodies are “joint” in practice and not merely in name, and could help to make them more effective.

Strengthen the ceasefire and adhere to its terms. The failure to implement some ceasefire terms – for example, the stipulation that the military and ethnic armed groups meet within fourteen days of signing to set timelines for implementation – or to jointly define terms in the text such as “ceasefire areas” and “interim period”, have sapped confidence among signatories and discouraged other ethnic armed groups from signing. The government’s perceived failure to stick to the “interim arrangements” section – for example, in not consulting signatories on changes to Myanmar’s land laws – has also undermined the agreement. The government and military should work with NCA signatories to clarify key sections of the ceasefire accord and begin implementation of the interim arrangements, such as those that specify coordination on health, education and social development. Most pressingly, they ought to coordinate on measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Adopt a more flexible policy toward NCA non-signatories. Presently, ethnic armed groups that have not signed the NCA are unable to formally participate in political dialogue negotiations toward a Union Peace Accord. Given that some of these groups are among the country’s largest and most active, this requirement is a major barrier to progress in achieving peace. Without their participation, the process lacks legitimacy and inclusivity. The government and military should adopt a more flexible policy ­– for example, allowing them to participate in political dialogue once they have reached a bilateral ceasefire, but prior to signing the nationwide ceasefire, which will inevitably require time since most groups will not sign until some of the terms are amended.

For their part, ethnic armed groups should:

Ethnic armed groups have yet to clearly articulate what they want from the peace process.

Facebook Email



Clarify policy positions on key issues. Ethnic armed groups have yet to clearly articulate what they want from the peace process beyond statements covering broad ideals. The lack of clarity is understandable: the signatories are diverse and struggle to develop consensus positions. But it hinders both progress in negotiations and leaders’ efforts to delegate authority to negotiating teams. Most urgently, ethnic groups should detail the powers they would want ethnic minority-dominated areas to have under a federal system.

Sequence demands to build trust. Ethnic armed groups that have signed the NCA should give careful consideration to how they approach negotiations after the election. Immediately pushing for significant political concessions, such as the withdrawal of the Myanmar military from politics, even in the expectation that they will ultimately scale back their demands, could further harm relations with senior government and military leaders. A better approach may be to focus on less controversial topics – for example, land law reform or cooperation between government and ethnic-run systems in the health and education sectors – in order to build trust and avoid a backlash, and then make progress over time on the bigger issues of federalism, power sharing and integration of armed forces.

Meanwhile, all parties to the peace process should:

All parties should review the political dialogue structure.

Facebook Email



Simplify the peace process structure. The present architecture is overly complex, particularly the aspects dealing with the political dialogue process (see Appendix B). In their attempt to generate a genuinely “bottom-up” dialogue, the drafters of the framework for political dialogue created an extensive consultation process that included a wide range of stakeholders. Although the objective was laudable, the end result has proven largely ineffective and an unmanageable staffing burden for all sides. All parties should review the political dialogue structure, particularly the usefulness and practicality of the numerous thematic working committees, supervisory committees and national-level dialogues. The aim should be to streamline the process while maintaining a reasonable level of consultation and participation. Donors should assist this review, if requested, without being wedded to the current architecture just because they supported its development.

Enhance women’s role. Despite commitments in the NCA and framework for political dialogue that women would be given a significant role, the peace process remains dominated by older men. Although the proportion of women representatives at Union Peace Conferences has increased steadily, from just 7 per cent of attendees at the first meeting in January 2016 to 22 per cent at the July 2018 talks, they remain underrepresented and their capacity to influence decisions extremely limited. Away from these large conferences, women hold even fewer positions on key peace process institutions, such as the Joint Ceasefire Monitoring Committee or Union Peace Dialogue Joint Committee. This lack of participation belies the fact that women play an influential but often informal role in politics and civil society, including peacebuilding initiatives and dispute resolution at the community level.

Many women in Myanmar have valuable political experience as mediators, facilitators, negotiators and peacebuilders but are excluded from formal processes. Drawing on this practical experience would not only ensure that women’s perspectives are heard – and women’s rights reflected in potential peace agreements – but also bring fresh thinking to help reinvigorate the stalled negotiations. All parties should create opportunities for women to meaningfully participate in every aspect of the peace process and future governance, not just peace conferences.

Finally, donors and non-governmental organisations should help all parties to:

Begin examining the economics of conflict. To date, the peace process has focused on reaching political solutions to Myanmar’s conflicts. On their own, however, these are unlikely to suffice. Armed groups, including Myanmar military-aligned Border Guard Forces and militias, rely on various sources of mostly illicit income and almost certainly will not give up their arms without a viable plan for replacing at least some of what they are earning now with revenues from licit businesses. The explosion of crystal methamphetamine (or “ice”) production in northern Shan State over the past few years highlights the risks of ignoring the issue. Armed groups may not be as resistant to giving up these revenue streams as they might initially appear. Illicit income entails a range of significant risks, among them the possibility of upsetting the political balance among different non-state armed groups.

Finding sustainable alternatives to this illicit economy will inevitably be a long process.

Facebook Email



Finding sustainable alternatives to this illicit economy will inevitably be a long process. Given the limited available capacity within the government, military and ethnic armed groups, they are likely to focus instead on more pressing issues that are being discussed at the negotiating table. In parallel, however, donors could begin supporting non-governmental organisations, think-tanks and independent researchers to undertake detailed studies on the economic dynamics underlying the conflict. These studies could then be used by decision-makers in consultation with armed groups to come up with income substitution solutions. One example is informal trade, from which many armed groups profit by running their own unofficial border crossings. Most of the goods that pass through these gates – everything from cattle to liquor and detergent – are not outright illegal, but regulations encourage traders to use non-official crossings. A roadmap to revise these regulations and give ethnic armed groups time to make the transition to licit businesses could substantially reduce illicit trade.

Similarly, the next six to twelve months offer an opportunity for the same groups to devote time and resources to studying other important but overlooked political economy issues that are affecting or will affect the peace process. One example is the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative), which could entrench the role of armed groups in the political economy, particularly in Shan State, and aggravate underlying ethnic grievances toward the government. Another is the rarely discussed role of the thousands of pro-military militias across Myanmar that are not included in the peace process. Although some of these are small village defence units with little clout, others have developed into fighting forces with more political and military influence than many of the ethnic armed groups involved in the peace process. They have built themselves up primarily by engaging in illicit economic activities, including running casinos, as well as smuggling narcotics and other goods.

V. Conclusion

Discussions over the past six months among the NLD government, the military and signatories of the National Ceasefire Agreement have confirmed that all stakeholders want the peace process to continue after the general election tentatively slated for November this year. Given the alternatives, even a mostly symbolic Panglong-21 conference would be welcome, and all sides should work toward this short-term goal. But the peace conference should not be seen for more than what it is: an attempt to keep the peace process alive into 2021. Over the last two years, progress has largely stalled, and tensions have increased among the three key stakeholders. It was only the government’s electoral imperatives and the prospect of the ceasefire collapsing that brought key ethnic armed groups back to the negotiating table.

Nevertheless, the elections offer an important chance for a reset after the missed opportunities and disappointments of the NLD’s first term. The peace process will be put on hold for at least six months after the Panglong-21 conference due to the elections, and the parties should use this time to lay the groundwork for greater progress in negotiations when they start again in 2021. Even if the spread of COVID-19 necessitates further delays for convening the next Panglong-21 (and potentially also the elections), there will still be an equivalent period of downtime during which formal negotiations will not take place. All sides should use this period to review their positions, address their internal weaknesses, and build trust and confidence with each other away from the pressure of meetings and deadlines. All should make the most of this opportunity, but the primary responsibility rests with the NLD, which is likely to remain in power for another five-year term. The onus will then be on the NLD government to articulate a new, more inclusive vision for the peace process and to exhibit the political will to make it a reality.

(Bloomberg) -- Robert Fritzshall had to be pushing 80, Bethany McLean thought, so she was a little surprised to hear him talk about expanding his law practice.His office was a bit dusty and cluttered with papers. There were files on the floor. She was concerned that he didn’t see the need to carry malpractice insurance. But she doesn’t remember anything being a red flag.“He was charismatic, enthusiastic,” she said. “A little eccentric.”Besides, she needed the job.The global financial crisis hadn’t eased up. Despite graduating near the top of her class and serving on the law review, she’d been biding her time at a Chicago-area WhirlyBall, booking children’s birthday parties.And he needed some help. Fritzshall & Associates comprised only Fritzshall, a legal intern, and his legal secretary, after the previous associate departed suddenly.McLean was thrilled when he extended her an offer, even if it was part time. When he agreed to get malpractice insurance, she accepted.It looked like her break.But within weeks, McLean would realize that Fritzshall was no longer capable of managing his practice. His cases were in disarray. Expanding was a fantasy. She recognized the signs of dementia from her grandmother’s decline.The experience would be the most harrowing and painful of her career. But it’s one that’s becoming a growing challenge confronting a profession in which many are working into their 70s and 80s.Over the last ten years, the number of lawyers practicing over the age of 65 has increased more than 50%. In 2020, roughly 14% of American lawyers were over 65, compared to 7% of workers generally. Meanwhile, more than one in nine people over 65 are diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, the most common type of dementia. The risk increases dramatically with age.Recent, comprehensive data on how often disciplinary bodies and lawyer assistance programs confront the issue is non-existent, and there’s no way of knowing how often colleagues intervene without assistance from a professional organization.But Diana Uchiyama, executive director of the Illinois Lawyers’ Assistance Program, says she’s seen a significant increase in outreach related to cognitive decline in the last year. She’s had at least two such calls in recent months as lawyers emerge from a year of pandemic-induced isolation.Lawyers who are relatively high functioning in early stages of dementia are often in denial about the need to step down, said Alex Yufik, a forensic psychologist who has worked on such cases. They’re adept at hiding it, tapping their intellectual reservoirs to redirect conversations when they’re confused or unable to answer questions, he said.Lawyers and other professionals often develop “routines, practices, conversational and social skills over many years, which are reinforced and rehearsed over a career to the point where they can function almost automatically,” said Kendra Basner, a partner at O’Rielly & Roche LLP who counsels clients on legal ethics.Colleagues are generally ill-equipped to distinguish between signs of of normal aging and something more. And the decision to intervene can be a heartbreaking and even risky one, especially if the aging lawyer is a friend, mentor, boss, or someone powerful in the profession.Getting involved in a case of substance abuse or mental health problems can mean saving someone’s career. In the case of progressive dementia, intervening almost always means ending one.“Even when the issue is right in front of their faces, many find excuses to avoid having the uncomfortable conversations and making the hard decisions,” Basner said.Tish Vincent, chair of the American Bar Association’s Commission on Lawyer Assistance Programs, said it’s partly a cultural issue of lawyers tending to think they’re invincible.Lawyers “need to stop encouraging denial,” said Vincent, who is both an attorney and a clinical social worker.Spotting the IssueFrederick Emery Jr., an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Maine, was within a year of retirement when his colleagues started to notice something wrong.When they elevated their concerns to agency officials, they were told that “if there were no appreciable performance issues,” they should just “monitor the situation as the AUSA progressed toward retirement,” according to a 2015 ruling by a U.S. district court in Maine.Much of Emery’s case load was transferred to another attorney within a few months. But it was already too late.He had botched an IRS dispute with a bankrupt taxpayer because of dementia, the government said in an appeal asking the district court to set aside Emery’s loss. The underlying case involved more than $500,000 in tax liabilities.The government eventually confirmed that Emery had been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, coupled with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. Three physicians agreed that the onset was prior to the summary judgment proceedings, the court said.But it still declined to undo the bankruptcy court’s summary judgment order discharging the debt. The government’s argument about Emery’s mental decline came too late. The IRS ultimately abandoned its efforts to challenge the bankruptcy court’s ruling.Emery had been “a responsible and highly respected member of the bar and the bankruptcy court for many years,” the court said.Cognitive ReservesForensic psychologist Yufik handled a case involving an 85-year-old attorney, whom he said he couldn’t identify for confidentiality reasons, when he worked at the Elder Abuse Forensic Center in Los Angeles.An auditor reviewing financial documents noticed signs of neglect in an estate the lawyer was managing. The lawyer’s daughter also called the center, saying her father was bouncing checks and falling behind on monthly bills. She was worried that her father might be the victim of financial abuse.She was right: Yufik said he soon discovered that two former clients had persuaded him to sign documents handing over control of his finances. When his daughter presented the documents to her father, he told her he didn’t recognize them.The lawyer could chit chat with strangers and recite poetry—which in his younger days, he composed—and was able to dress himself appropriately and prepare meals. But his bedroom was in “complete disarray,” Yufik said. There was uneaten food accumulating, and dirty laundry strewn about. It smelled of urine.Although the lawyer could explain basic legal concepts and understood things like his obligation to pay taxes and the importance of health insurance, he was unsure of where his money was held, how much income he was earning, or whether his bills were being paid. The cognitive decline rendered him an easy target, Yufik said.RoutinesRobert Fritzshall would put on a suit every day and take the train to downtown Chicago like he had for years.He was a creature of habit, lunching at the same restaurants over and over. He would regale McLean, his new associate, with old stories and introduce her to acquaintances around town.Part of the self-denial common to lawyers in the early stages of dementia has to do with how closely their identities are hewed to their careers and professional status. “It’s where they have found success, it’s where their friends are, it’s where they are comfortable,” Basner said.One’s identity as a lawyer is “so intertwined with their sense of self,” Vincent said, they will cling to their professional identities “until their dying breath.”Fritzshall had been a respected member of the Chicago area’s legal community—the prosecuting attorney for the Village of Skokie for 13 years, an arbitrator for 12 years, and president for a time of the North Suburban Bar Association. He also served on Skokie’s Village Board of Trustees, Planning Commission, and the theater board for the Performing Arts Center.But that had all been before McLean met Fritzshall.SidewaysPersonal injury and workers’ compensation cases were the bread and butter of Fritzshall’s practice when McLean joined in July 2010. She was unfamiliar with those areas of law, but didn’t have to study his files for very long to realize something was wrong.He was missing irretrievable deadlines and failing to tell clients about significant developments. He didn’t know several cases had been dismissed for failure to prosecute.In one instance, after he accepted a settlement and opposing counsel filed an affidavit indicating that the parties had reached agreement, Fritzshall denied it.McLean said she found opposing counsel were often frustrated and seemed to think he was playing games with them.Before long, she discovered that about half a dozen attorneys had preceded her at Fritzshall & Associates and quickly left, some within weeks.When she raised her concerns, Fritzshall was aloof.McLean reached out to the Illinois Lawyers’ Assistance Program. Although there were plenty of resources and protocols for lawyers struggling with substance abuse or mental health disorders, she found the state bar at the time seemed to lack any systematic approach for dealing with Alzheimer’s or age-related dementia.“It would have been easier if he had been a drug addict,” she said.Ethical ResponsibilitiesA lawyer’s duty to report or otherwise intervene when another lawyer is impaired varies by state. At least a dozen states have ethics opinions on the topic, applicable whether the impairment is due to substance abuse, mental health issues, or age-related decline, and the American Bar Association has issued its own guidance. Case law may also come into play, depending on the jurisdiction.The ABA’s Model Rules provide at least a rough proxy for most jurisdictions.Among other things, rules may require lawyers to report misconduct that calls fitness or truthworthiness into question. They also demand that supervising attorneys take reasonable steps to ensure subordinate attorneys comply with ethical rules, while prohibiting blind reliance on a supervising attorney’s direction.Most states have adopted some version of the relevant rules. But there are notable exceptions. California, for example, has rejected the mandatory misconduct reporting requirement, which the state’s bar journal once referred to as the “snitch” rule.Even if not required, larger law firms often have protocols in place, including internal reporting systems and monitoring when necessary. But for lawyers working alone or who only have subordinates, it’s a lot less likely there will be anyone able to intervene informally, if at all, before serious issues arise.The Last ResortMcLean eventually gave up on the lawyers’ assistance program and started calling the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission’s ethics hotline. But she hit a dead end there, too.She knew filing a formal complaint would likely end Fritzshall’s career, and wondered what the consequences would be for her own future. But his clients were real people, and she said she couldn’t just abandon them.Less than three months after she was hired, McLean mustered the courage to tell Fritzshall she intended to resign and report him to the disciplinary commission.“I figured, if going to the ARDC would do me in, this wasn’t the career for me,” she said.She had him on speaker phone, with his intern at her side. The intern had been working for him for about a year and adored him, McLean said. At her fingertips was a list of his active cases—at least 20—detailing the errors she’d identified, along with approaching deadlines.She told him she was confident that the ARDC would know whether her concerns were warranted.“He turned on me,” she said.DenialIn his formal response denying the allegations, Fritzshall stated, in essence, that McLean was inexperienced and simply didn’t know what she was talking about.She remembers reading it and feeling disheartened, like it had all been “a stressful waste of time.”The ARDC administrator filed a petition against Fritzshall alleging incapacity in August 2011. Fritzshall was initially responsive, but after he stopped appearing at conferences or otherwise complying with the investigation, the allegations were eventually deemed admitted.McLean didn’t hear from the ARDC again until they called to ask her to testify at his hearing in June 2012. By then, Fritzshall had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s-type dementia, according to a letter from his physician that’s referenced in the hearing board’s report.More issues had surfaced. Another associate quit after three weeks when Fritzshall couldn’t afford to pay her. He’d stopped paying rent on his office space. He’d overdrawn his trust fund account multiple times. He’d even bounced a check for $31.71 to a court clerk.His wife had been encouraging him to retire, to no avail, according to testimony at the hearing.When McLean testified before the hearing board, she remembers one member asked something to the effect of, “You left the clients? You just quit?”I called you first, she said.HindsightIn hindsight, there were perhaps earlier signs of Fritzshall’s cognitive decline.In 2005, he’d been suspended for six months, stayed by probation after one month. He’d mismanaged client funds, failed to pay medical lienholders in a timely manner, and misrepresented to an administrative law judge that he had authority to settle a matter when he didn’t, according to the disciplinary findings.Fritzshall told the hearing board that he didn’t remember making the misrepresentation, but admitted he lacked his client’s authorization at the time.Although the misrepresentation was ultimately found to be dishonest, he wasn’t found to have engaged in any fraud or deceit. His trust account had never gone negative, and he’d never written a bad check. Although there were a handful of significant delays in paying lienholders retained for client cases, they all ultimately received the money they were owed.No clients complained or testified against him. The client whose case he’d settled without permission ultimately accepted the same amount of money. When her bankruptcy estate paid him about $16,600 in fees, he cut her a check for about $10,700. He told the hearing board he just wanted her to have it.His mismanagement of client funds was attributed to bad bookkeeping.The review board cited numerous mitigating factors in issuing him a lighter penalty than the conduct otherwise warranted. It was Fritzshall’s first disciplinary action in his 50 years of practicing law. He had already modified his bookkeeping practices and reduced his caseload.The commission also considered the implications of a lengthier suspension: Fritzshall had told them that at his age, he’d be unable to rebuild his practice if suspended for a year.His probation, which he completed successfully, was conditioned on implementing new trust account procedures.The Last ActIn May 2013, Fritzshall was finally placed on disability inactive status. He died in hospice care in October 2015. He was 86.While the hearing board report and Illinois Supreme Court order adopting the board’s recommendations are public, the underlying record of Fritzshall’s proceeding is sealed. The ARDC, citing confidentiality rules, said it couldn’t comment.By the time of the hearing, Fritzshall—with the help of his wife, who was by then his power of attorney—had sold his practice and moved to Wisconsin.The lawyer who purchased his practice had spoken to him after taking over. She told the board that sometimes he was still “very lucid and at other times not.”Two weeks before Fritzshall’s hearing, the Illinois Supreme Court had modified its rules “to allow lawyers facing minor misconduct charges to petition the Court for permanent retirement status.”The change was made “in response to the challenges presented by an increasing population of aging lawyers” in order to provide “a reasonable and dignified option for senior lawyers who should retire from the practice of law while preserving their dignity and hard-earned reputations,” according to the ARDC’s 2012 annual report.But given the seriousness of the ultimately uncontested allegations against Fritzshall, it’s unclear whether he would have been able to take advantage of the new rule even if he had petitioned for permanent retirement status.‘A Preventable Mess’Bud Rubenstein, now 93, knew Fritzshall for most of their lives. Their fathers were law partners. When they joined the military, they were stationed together in Japan for almost a year. They sold shoes together and even attended the same law school, the University of Illinois at Chicago.Rubenstein said he had no idea that Fritzshall had been living with dementia. Fritzshall visited after Rubenstein moved to Arizona, but he doesn’t think they talked much after 2000.“It’s a terrible thing to practice when you have that disease,” he said, “but you’re not sure when you’re in it.”Rubenstein said he voluntarily retired his own license in 2012.Steven Fritzshall, Robert’s son, still practices law near the same courthouse where his father spent so many years advocating for his clients. Steven didn’t know how his father’s career ended until Bloomberg Law contacted him. He said he was shocked. They had been estranged since 1990, he said.Steven recalled seeing his father on a crowded street near the courthouse once, long after they had stopped talking. Robert didn’t say hello.“He walked right past me,” Steven said. He wondered aloud if his father recognized him.“The whole thing is sad,” he said.“We have an obligation to represent clients to the best of our human ability and with a competent state of mind,” he said. “There’s no excuse, zero tolerance—these are innocent people.”Steven said he hoped his father would have said the same thing.McLean still practices law, as an assistant public defender in Kane County, Ill., just west of Chicago.As frustrating as it was at the time, McLean said she’s not bitter about the ordeal. Ultimately, the ARDC pursued the matter, and she recognizes now that there had to be due process, which takes time. She said she just wishes there had been better resources and another way to intervene quickly.She said she feels badly when she thinks about the impact on Fritzshall’s legacy.“He had this whole career, and I was seeing it in its final throes,” McLean said. “It seemed like a preventable mess.”To contact the reporter on this story: Holly Barker in Washington at hbarker@bloombergindustry.comTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Bernie Kohn at bkohn@bloomberglaw.com; Jay-Anne B.

In their peacetime, Black people are killed with impunity. In the time they are anxious to go back to – the time which helicopters and riot police and armies are sent to bring back by force – Black people are killed with impunity. In their regular order, Black people are killed with impunity. In their time of laughing loudly in cafes, Black people are killed with impunity.

In the times when videos of Black people being killed fall out of the news cycle, Black people are killed with impunity. In the time when this president is in power, Black people are killed with impunity. In the time when this president is not in power, Black people are killed with impunity. In their “counter-looting“, Black people are killed with impunity. In their prisons, their hospitals, their streets, their police stations, Black people are killed with impunity.

In their riots, Black people are killed with impunity.

Their peace, their regular order is a place where Black people are killed with impunity.

I do not wish them peace.

Peace is never peaceful in a colony. The peace of the slave master is not the peace of the enslaved. The slave master finds placid the view of the masses of enslaved people working for him under the whip of the overseer. The enslaved finds peace in a plantation on fire.

Our peace is not their peace. Their peace has been when we accepted, quietly, the corpses of Black people thrown against our screens. Our peace is when they stop killing us. Our peace is when they lose faith in the certainty of impunity. When they have to live the rest of their lives straining to decipher every eerie sound in the wind, hoping it is not bad luck. Our peace is when they are forced to pause, and for the first time since the passage of the Act on the Casual Killing of Slaves, wonder whether they might face a consequence.

It is not peaceful in the prisons, in the slums, under parole, under-employed, or under arrest. They have assumed their peace to be universal. They mistake the security of their families, the leisure with which they live their lives and the fire in which we live ours as good order, as peace all around. They look out at the incessant waves of our deaths as they would out a window to the beach.

When their innocents die, they launch wars. Their protests to their innocents dying are wars on countries they say harbour terrorists and wars with countries they say look like they harbour terrorists. Their protests are with artillery, with 20-year wars, with the violent removal of regimes, the remaking of societies in their image, the Shock and Awe that is to serve as a message to the entire world that they will not be suffering this again.

Their protest is a full course meal. When they are finished with it, they give us the “peaceful protest”, the bones and gristle and entrails of their protest, thrown out like chicken feed to the slave cabins. I am not that hungry.

In the peaceful protest, those targeted by a half-millennium’s worth of pogroms must learn to colour within the lines. We must be flanked by the people we are protesting against who are there to ensure that we do not step on the grass. We must pause for photos taken of them embracing us. We must be chided by those cheering when they take a knee and be told that this is hopeful.

We should not be suspicious; we must abide a hearts and minds campaign. Our protests against the police must be policed. The mode of our opposition must be kettled. The order to be peaceful, for many of us, feels like a police officer with gun drawn commanding us not to move – because that is what it is.

The peaceful protest does not suffer looters – looters being a racist and classist slur that, like the “roving bands of Negro youths” before it, aims to make those who resist legitimate targets of state and civilian shooting.

In fact, peaceful protests win praise when the protesters become the police and the “troublemakers” are nabbed and handed off to the waiting officers on the sidelines. The good, peaceful protesters are the protesters who believe the police will treat troublemakers fairly. They have either forgotten the activist Joshua Williams of the Ferguson uprising made captive at Pacific’s Missouri Eastern Correctional Center, or, perhaps, they believe he belongs there.

The “troublemakers”, the disobedient, the “rioters”, the “vandals” are to be expelled as mischievous thugs by the good and peaceful protesters. To them radicals say what Joshua Williams said to the president: “Those people who you call thugs, those people who you call criminals, are my people.”

It would be interesting to hear what the good protesters think about the Black radicals’ chant to “free all prisoners of war”, and “free all political prisoners” and whether they would think this chant is reason enough to report them to the authorities.

The civilising of the uprising into a protest, the deradicalising of it, the transforming of it into the peace of the misremembered non-violent “civil rights campaign”, is at the same time an invitation to flood it with good protesters-turned-police, informers and future turncoats. It is difficult to imagine the masses in the street in the early days of the Algerian revolution or the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa handing “vandals” and “looters” over to the colony’s police. The liberal’s language of “peaceful protests” is a warrant for arrest.

To order that our protests must be peaceful is to demand that when we ask to be injured less, it is in a tone that is respectful and polite. To praise the peacefulness of a protest is to assert the right of those resisted to determine the ethics of resistance – their right to command and to direct it, their right to lay out how resistance must be conducted.

The right to command Black people – even in their resistance – is so absolute in white supremacist society that media personalities and police officers, in full confidence, take it upon themselves to determine when the protest against them is “marred” and to sort out the good resistance from the bad.

A revolution cannot be marred. An uprising cannot be marred. A peaceful protest always is.

If a protest can be marred, it is not a protest, it is a performance that stands in for protest. It is the theatre of pleading, performed in front of an audience who may or may not choose to listen. That is not a protest; that is a prayer.

If, in this colony, protests that “air grievances” are the only legitimate places to contest injustice; if the defence of Black lives must conform to white supremacist civil order; if the fight to exist unmolested must be reduced to a performance of respectability, then the protest must be abolished.

This is just as well as the “George Floyd protests” are not protests. It is an uprising that is beaten so badly by rubber bullets and kneeling cop photos that the pulp which remains can be mistaken for a solemn, toothless demonstration. But it is not. It is an uprising. An uprising about George Floyd but it is also about the unnamed.

It is about Black people who were not killed on camera, or in the news cycle of Amy Cooper and Ahmaud Arbery, or by an officer who did not bother with plausible deniability, or those who were not men, or were not heard in the terrors of death, or were not killed during the social upheaval of the coronavirus, or who were not, for whatever reason, deemed enough to spark a revolution.

Reducing the uprising to “anger over George Floyd’s death” is like reducing the Arab Spring to “anger over Mohamed Bouazizi’s death”. In both Tunisia and Minnesota people angry at a killing marched into the streets, clashed with officers and faced down tear gas. The US press calls one the Tunisian revolution, it calls the other the “George Floyd protests”. One has its “violence” spoken of as the predictable consequences of oppression; the other’s “violence” is seen as marring a peaceful protest, or, proof of the protesters’ criminality.

The US press cannot admit the “protest” is an uprising because that uprising might be directed at the anti-Black colonial order to which the press owes its existence and the defence of which is its purpose. By calling it a protest over George Floyd’s death, they are able to represent a fight against the entire order of anti-Blackness, racists, and their Negrophobic paramilitary institution, as an outpouring of anger at George Floyd’s wrongful death and a tide pushing for “criminal justice reform”.

Framed as a public mourning, the “protests” will be allowed the time of mourning only (if the firing of rubber bullets and the throwing of tear gas canisters can be thought of as giving people space to grieve). Soon officials will say “we have heard you, we will reform, but to do that, we have to return to regular order”. Or, if more conservative, “Get back to work!” And we would return, bitterly, to the status quo knowing our time is up.

Unlike peaceful protests that are seen to be about a specific grievance, however, revolutions have no deadline. So, like police escorting the peaceful protest, the press must flank the narrative of the revolt, claiming to protect it while leading it by the bit away from the vulnerabilities of the anti-Black colony. They must defuse the uprising. The language of peaceful protest handcuffs the revolt.

Protests are not peaceful; they are pacified. They are uprisings put down, revolts tamed. Barack Obama’s speech, news anchors’ performances of outrage, the reframing of revolutionary action as a modern civil rights movement strips the work of the “dangerous” radicals who led the uprisings in Minnesota, and Baltimore, and Ferguson etc, and hands it to the people who want reform.

The gritty mobile phone videos of activists with megaphones on top of cars are replaced by the polished photographs of people who cheer and raise their fists in salute to kneeling cops. The work of “getting the pigs off the block” is pacified into the work of recognising our mutual humanity. The goalpost of ending Negrophobic sport-killing will be moved so that it will seem that the goal was always to be heard.

This accomplished, people would go home, “conversations and dialogue” would begin, perhaps some institutes would be set up and new hires made, and the regular order of negrophobic killing – the state of anti-Blackness – would be, to everyone’s relief except the original activists and the targeted, preserved. Their peace is a racist peace. Their feelings of rosy, universal love is our holding cell.

At this moment racists are biding their time. They are hoping for a quick return to regular order. They are waiting for the return to the kind of peace where Black people are killed with impunity. At this moment, famous liberals are on the world stage attempting to strong-arm the narrative of an uprising from radical activists like Sabaah Folayan, Damon Davis and Ferguson’s Brittany and Alexis.

They are hoping for a quick compromise with the white supremacists: a promise to reduce excessive, public police killings and possibly the most egregious inequities in the criminal justice system, in an exchange for a return to the regular order where Black people are killed with impunity. Then they will offer us this plea-deal-for-the-innocent, in hopes that there is no one among us as radical as Kalief Browder.

Their peace is a racist peace. Their regular order is a place where Black people are killed with impunity. The media, the police and liberal society are coalescing into a repression that aims to put down a radical uprising against the colony of anti-Black killing. They are diverting a march towards the end of colonialism into a march towards an opened dialogue. Something we have not asked for. We spoke with fire.

We are in revolutionary times now. Disregard what you have heard. It is time for a different peace. In our peacetime every prison is an anachronism; every police officer is in the wrong era. Pro-police TV shows with their funny Black sidekicks, books and films that tell the story of Black suffering to tell the story of American redemption, settler flag-waving and all settler-colonial institutions are now as out of place as seeing a man walking down a street in Boston in full King George III attire.

The Reverend Al Sharpton warned that it is a different time and a different season. True. And Black radicals have seized that time.

In their peacetime Black people are killed with impunity. In ours they are not. Look outside. It is a beautiful day.

65,https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/06/29/how-reverse-uss-shockingly-low-global-peace-index-ranking,"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Common Dreams,How to Reverse the US’s Shockingly Low Global Peace Index Ranking,"In recent weeks, peaceful demonstrators across America have been confronted by National Guard troops in the nation’s capital and by militarized police in cities, armed with tear gas and rubber bullets. Meanwhile, heavily armed militias have taken it upon themselves to counter-protest, calling to mind the rifle-toting protestors that stormed the Michigan Capitol in May to demand an end to the state’s stay-at-home order.

It doesn’t come as a surprise, then, that a recent report by the Institute for Economics and Peace validates that America is a dangerous place. Peace was deteriorating pre-COVID, and the current health, racial, and economic crises compounded have put the country at greater risk of continued internal violence.

The 2020 Global Peace Index is now in its fourteenth year of ranking 163 states and territories according to their level of peacefulness. It defines peace “in terms of the harmony achieved by the absence of violence or the fear of violence… described as Negative Peace.” Its complement is Positive Peace, which are the “attitudes, institutions and structures that create and sustain peaceful societies.”

For years funds have been insufficiently allocated to healthcare, housing, education, and other essential services to prioritize national security and defense, which has ultimately eroded the public’s trust in American leadership.

The GPI measures peace in three domains: Societal Safety and Security, Ongoing Domestic and International Conflict, and Militarization. Some findings for this year are unsurprising: Iceland is ranked first in peacefulness, a position it has held since 2008, while Afghanistan is ranked the least peaceful country in the world for the second year in a row.

What may be controversial to some is the ranking of the world’s largest economy. The United States is ranked 121st in peacefulness out of 163 countries for the second year in a row, coming in lower than China, Bolivia, Chile, and France, which have experienced violent protests in the last year, and El Salvador, which has the highest number of homicides per 100,000 inhabitants. Our culturally similar neighbor to the north, Canada, is ranked the 6th most peaceful country in the world.

The United States’ ranking isn’t so remarkable considering that military spending accounts for 15 percent of all U.S. federal spending and more than half of the discretionary budget. Only North Korea, Russia, and Israel are higher on the GPI’s “militarization” ranking. The report uses seven indicators to measure the degree of militarization of a society, including military expenditure as a percentage of GDP and the volume of arms exports and imports per 100,000 people. Though the militarization domain did improve globally in the last year due to reductions in military expenditure, the U.S., Russia, Germany, France, and China still account for 75 percent of total weapons exports, while the U.S. alone accounts for 32 percent.

This spending has fueled America’s endless wars and the arming of foreign governments in brutal conflicts in the Middle East. This includes the $3.3 billion in military financing to Israel as it continues to launch attacks on the Gaza Strip and eagerly plans its annexation of the West Bank, and the over $100 billion in military sales to Saudi Arabia as it leads coalition airstrikes in Yemen which have led to catastrophic civilian death tolls.

Afghanistan, after trillions in spending and two decades of American military presence — the longest war in U.S. history — has the highest total number of deaths from internal conflict in the world.

In addition to covering internal violence and militarization, this year’s report includes a crucial new section: an analysis of the effect of COVID-19 on peace in societies. This section uses eight Positive Peace pillars that describe the institutions and structures of a society, including “well-functioning government,” “sound business environment,” and “low levels of corruption” to assess how well a country has dealt with the pandemic. The GPI notes that “countries with strong Positive Peace have higher resilience to absorb, adapt, and recover from shocks, such as COVID-19 and the ensuing recession.”

The United States’ weakness in the “well-functioning government” and “high levels of human capital” pillars explain why such a small proportion of the population was tested during the initial weeks of the outbreak. As of April 10, 2020, with fewer than 10,000 tests per million residents, the U.S. had tested fewer people than other developed countries, including Canada, Australia, and Norway. Lithuania, Italy, and Latvia had also tested more than the U.S. The capabilities described by “well-functioning government” enable authorities to quickly implement lockdown measures to flatten the epidemiological curve, and “high levels of human capital” allow a society to withstand the stress on its health system.

The report’s other pillars are also helpful in explaining the U.S.’s poor handling of the pandemic, and their underdevelopment points to signs of even further deterioration of American peace in the future. A combination of lockdown measures and insufficient rescue funds for small businesses weaken the U.S. “sound business environment” pillar. A severe lack of testing and personal protective equipment across the country, and especially among low-income and black and Hispanic neighborhoods where the virus already has a disproportionate impact, expose a broken healthcare system and America’s poor performance in the ""equitable distribution of resources"" pillar.

For years funds have been insufficiently allocated to healthcare, housing, education, and other essential services to prioritize national security and defense, which has ultimately eroded the public’s trust in American leadership. The weakening of each of these pillars helps illustrate how we arrived at the current moment of a frustrated society and anti-racist protests taking place in cities across all 50 states. Overwhelmed American hospitals, weeks of civil unrest, and a contracting economy have exposed how fragile the systems that uphold the United States truly are.

Those who favor militaristic policies often characterize their position as seeking “peace through strength.” Yet the GPI report and the failed response to COVID-19 expose the faulty logic behind this. Peace and security at home cannot be achieved merely by projecting military power abroad—and in fact, the U.S. insistence on global military domination has actively undermined both domestic and international peace.

The consequences of America’s long-standing bipartisan tradition of supporting increases to the Pentagon budget while ignoring other crucial departments and government functions, compounded by the Trump administration’s cuts towards health and environment agencies, have now been made apparent with the current administration’s disastrous handling of the COVID-19 crisis.



If we are to avoid the repetition of this catastrophe in the future, America must reorient a significant portion of its federal budget away from defense spending and towards public health and social services to build greater internal peace and resilience. American leaders must rethink national security to center around the well-being of its people rather than the pursuit of military dominance abroad.

The true long-term consequences of COVID-19 on peace in American society are still unknown. However, if the U.S. cannot improve its handling of the virus and rapidly reassess its governing priorities, it is likely that the United States’ ranking as the 121st most peaceful country in the world will sink even further in future GPI reports.","The 2020 Global Peace Index is now in its fourteenth year of ranking 163 states and territories according to their level of peacefulness.

Summary

Influence operations are organized attempts to achieve a specific effect among a target audience. In such instances, a variety of actors—ranging from advertisers to activists to opportunists—employ a diverse set of tactics, techniques, and procedures to affect the decisionmaking, beliefs, and opinions of a target audience.

Yet much public discourse has failed to paint a nuanced picture of these activities. Media coverage of influence operations often tends to be negative, stoking fears about how influence operations might undermine the legitimacy of liberal democracies. But the purpose behind such campaigns must be considered when assessing their effects. In electoral settings, influence operations can refer not only to coordinated state efforts to influence a foreign election but also to positive advocacy campaigns such as those designed to encourage people to vote. That being said, governments and industry actors face growing pressure to do something about malign influence operations, but these campaigns must be clearly understood to be addressed effectively.

In reality, influence operations are neither inherently good nor bad, and it is up to societies themselves to decide what conduct and responses are and are not acceptable. The question of whether some influence operations are acceptable or not is highly ambiguous because it is so hard to ascertain the motives driving the actors behind them. This analysis examines a case study involving an online influence operation originating in Israel and targeting audiences in a host of countries including Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The operators of this content mill push highly politicized online content and gain access to foreign audiences, at least in part for apparent financial gain.

Elise Thomas Elise Thomas is a freelance journalist and researcher working with the International Cyber Policy Center at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Her writing has been published in Wired, Foreign Policy, the Daily Beast, the Guardian Australia, SBS, Crikey, and the Interpreter of the Lowy Institute.

This study explores the difficulties in making simple assessments about influence operations, and this particular case study serves as a basis for analyzing publicly available information about social media community standards and government legislation aimed at countering influence operations, for the purpose of identifying gaps in and challenges for the solutions proposed so far. This study ultimately points to the need for clearer consideration of what constitute acceptable persuasive techniques and tactics of online engagement, and it further highlights the lack of clear existing guidelines for policy development.

Key Takeaways

Influence operations defy easy categorization. Influence operations often fail to fit neatly into boxes outlined by individual policies or legislation. They are run in a complex environment where actors overlap, borders are easily crossed and blurred, and motives are mixed—making enforcement challenging. In this case study, actors share highly politicized online content but also appear to benefit financially from their actions, making it difficult to ascertain whether their motives are primarily political, commercial, or both.

Influence operations often fail to fit neatly into boxes outlined by individual policies or legislation.

In this case study, actors share highly politicized online content but also appear to benefit financially from their actions, making it difficult to ascertain whether their motives are primarily political, commercial, or both. Relevant policies by social media platforms tend to be a patchwork of community standards that apply to individual activities of an influence campaign, not the operation as a whole. Policies published by social media companies often focus on individual components of influence operations. This approach attempts to neatly categorize and distinguish actors (foreign versus domestic), motives (political influence and profit), activities (including misrepresentation, fraud, and spamming behavior), and content (such as misinformation, hate speech, and abuse). This piecemeal approach to enforcement raises questions about whether officials within social media platforms fully understand how influence operations work and how such campaigns are more than the individual behaviors that compose them.

This piecemeal approach to enforcement raises questions about whether officials within social media platforms fully understand how influence operations work and how such campaigns are more than the individual behaviors that compose them. Social media networks have more opportunities to counter influence operations through their platform policies than governments do with existing legislation. Social media companies have implemented various policies to govern how their platforms are used, providing opportunities for combating influence operations. They also have greater access to information about how their platforms are used and have domain-specific expertise that allows them to create more tailored solutions. Fewer avenues exist for countering such influence operations using government-led legal mechanisms. This is not only because of the relative paucity of laws that govern online activity but also because law enforcement requires attribution before they can act, and such attribution can be difficult to ascertain in these cases. This means that governments have generally done little to help private industry actors determine what kinds of influence operations are unacceptable and should be combated. In the absence of such guidance, industry actors are de facto drawing those lines for society. Governments could do more to help guide industry players as they determine the boundaries of acceptable behavior by participating in multi-stakeholder efforts—some of which have been set up by think tanks and nonprofits—and by considering legal approaches that emphasize transparency rather than criminalization.

The influence operations uncovered by media scrutiny are not always as easy to counter as those writing about them might hope. Savvy influence operators understand how to evade existing rules, so that their activities and content do not breach known policies or legislation. Media coverage that showcases examples of influence operations seldom explains whether and how these operators violate existing platform policies or legislation. This is a problem because distasteful influence operations do not always overtly violate existing policies or laws—raising questions about where the lines are (and should be) between what is tolerable and what is not, and, moreover, who should be determining those lines. Even when existing policies clearly do apply, these questions persist. Stakeholders should more clearly assess what constitutes problematic behavior before rushing to demand enforcement.

Introduction

Influence operations are organized attempts to achieve a specific effect among a target audience. Such operations encompass a variety of actors—ranging from advertisers to activists to opportunists—that employ a diverse set of tactics, techniques, and procedures to affect a target’s decisionmaking, beliefs, and opinions. Actors engage in influence operations for a range of purposes. Covert political influence operations originating from foreign sources have been the subject of intense scrutiny in recent years and have stoked fears about how influence operations might undermine the legitimacy of liberal democracies. However, influence operations can also be motivated by commercial interests rather than conviction.

At times, there is no neat line dividing the two, a point that the case study featured in this analysis demonstrates. Churning out political content can be profitable, as the infamous Macedonian fake news industry, which captured headlines in the wake of the 2016 U.S. elections, demonstrated.1 The more outrageous, divisive, or hyperbolic the content, the more clicks it drives and the more money website owners can earn from advertisers. The fact that this conduct is motivated by profit rather than political conviction does not reduce the potential political or social implications, including the possibility of inciting tensions or causing harm.

Some forms of influence operations (state-linked ones) are easier to handle. When state-linked covert information operations are discovered, they are likely to be in violation of online platforms’ terms of service and therefore removed. Platforms like Facebook and Twitter have also taken to publicly disclosing their efforts to remove state-linked influence operations. The associated publicity imposes reputational costs on governments, political candidates, and other high-profile actors whose involvement in an influence campaign is discovered. These reputational costs may discourage them from trying again (at least in the same manner or immediately following public attribution of such ties).

Natalie Thompson Natalie Thompson is a research assistant with the Technology and International Affairs Program.

More ambiguous forms of influence operations are harder to parse. Mixed-motive operations, in which operators benefit financially from sharing highly politicized content and the goal is therefore neither unambiguously commercial nor purely political, present a challenge for platform operators and regulators. When such campaigns are operated by private citizens with no official political affiliations, the costs of public disclosure may be much lower. Such an individual may not have a significant public reputation to maintain, and in some cases their activities may not technically violate a platform’s terms of service without compelling evidence of particular motivations, which can be difficult, if not impossible, to discern. And though media organizations are often quick to decry this behavior and call for enforcement, it is not always entirely clear if the behavior of mixed-motive operators is necessarily problematic. Some may argue that these actors have simply found clever ways to profit from the design of social media platforms, which reward highly engaging content.

Beyond this, the profit motive is a powerful one. Operators may have already sunk substantial time, efforts, and costs into establishing their so-called businesses. Strong incentives to continue are likely to make mixed-motive operations resilient, tenacious, and recidivist problems for social media platforms. This is especially true if the perpetrators suffer no real consequences after their operations are exposed (beyond, perhaps, some temporary disruptions as they replace the social media accounts they employ).

In either case, determining when an influence operation becomes problematic requires stakeholders to think holistically about the context in which an influence operation occurs, the actors who perpetrate it, the goals of their operations, the means by which they accomplish them, and the scale at which they operate. Influence operations can be problematic when operators attempt to disguise their identities or their aims, when they rely on false or misleading information, or when they cause real-world harm to their target audiences. In the absence of compelling ways to measure the effects of influence operations and their countermeasures and the lack of a whole-of-society approach to determining acceptable techniques of persuasion, influence operations continue to provoke much confusion and anxiety.

The case study examined here targets existing far-right, xenophobic, and anti-Muslim audiences on social media in an operation that appears to have both political and profit-driven elements. This case study highlights the way in which mixed-motive campaigns can fall through the cracks of existing regulatory frameworks, especially when they leverage preexisting and largely authentic social media audiences. The campaign centers on a set of thirteen websites that produce low-quality, inflammatory content that is then shared synchronously across a network of at least nineteen social media pages. The operators have gained moderator privileges on social media pages targeting audiences in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (among other countries) to share their content and drive traffic to the domains. Given characteristics shared by the websites, it is likely that they are run by a single operator or set of operators. Because the content produced by the domains and shared on social media platforms is often highly politicized and because the operators likely profit from advertising revenue from the domains, it is unclear whether they are motivated by political interests, commercial interests, or both.

This case demonstrates the limits of current ways of addressing this type of mixed-motive influence operation. Past reporting on this content mill identified it as part of a network of at least nineteen anti-Muslim Facebook pages pushing out synchronized posts,2 resharing the same content within seconds of one another.3 The posts tend to use Blogspot links to cloak the true sources of such content, such as freepressfront.com and speech-front.net.4 The network was in part established by Israel-based Facebook accounts, which then approached users manning pages in other countries, offering to provide content to their audiences in exchange for also being made administrators on those pages.5 This activity was linked by the Guardian to an individual named Ariel Elkaras in Israel; in the past, this individual had posted on search engine optimization and web marketing forums under the username Ariel1238a, seeking advice on how to monetize content.6 When approached by journalists, Elkaras denied knowledge of or involvement in the content mill.

However, shortly after this exchange, several of the domains and a large amount of content were taken down.7 (This study has not independently verified the attribution to Elkaras and will continue to refer to the group or individuals responsible for the content mill as the operators.) In response, Facebook appears to have removed a number of pages directly operated by the campaign, but it has not taken action against multiple other Facebook groups infiltrated by the content mill and its owners.8 Many of the domains (some of which were briefly taken down following the Guardian’s 2019 reporting) are still active, and their content is still being widely shared across Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and Gab. In short, the problem is far from over.

The Anatomy of an Online Content Mill

The business models of online content mills like the one featured in this case study rely on generating large amounts of low-quality web content (often either cheaply produced or simply plagiarized) to entice internet users to visit their websites, allowing the organizers of these sites to generate advertising revenue. The operators of content mills commonly use social media to drive traffic to their sites.

As of February 2020, the content mill in question still appears to be an active threat. Some of the domains it uses that were temporarily taken down appear to have been reinstated. And while Facebook removed the pages controlled directly by the content mill to promote its content, the campaign’s operators are still active as administrators on a number of other far-right and anti-Islamic Facebook pages and continue to use them to churn out problematic online content. To understand how the content mill operates, it is vital to understand not only the content it produces and the domains it uses to host it but also the social media channels it employs to amplify its reach and attract readers.

The Content Mill’s Content and Reach

Before delving deeper into the inner workings of this content mill, it is important to give a sense of the type of content it produces. The articles that the operators are publishing on the website domains they control have a relatively consistent format. Many of them are composed of between two and five paragraphs and relate to an embedded tweet or YouTube video from a range of sources. These low-quality articles consistently present Islam, in general, and Palestinian Muslims, in particular, in an overwhelmingly negative light.

Most of the content is not necessarily overtly false, but it tends to be misleadingly slanted, cherry-picked, or otherwise taken out of context. Like much low-quality content online, the overall approach seems to be to present the most inflammatory narrative possible (see screenshot 1). And while there is little evidence to suggest that outright deception is the intention, the operators also do not seem to care whether the information they present is true.

The freespeechfront.net homepage

For example, in September 2019, an article titled “Arab-Muslim Father Terrorizes his Infant Son With Gunshots” was posted on free-speechfront.info.9 The article was based on a tweet from the Australian Jewish Association, commenting on a video of a man abusing an infant. The article reads:

Arab-Muslim father decided to terrorize his baby son and share the video on social media. Instantly the video went viral and sparks outrage all over the world.



The video posted on Twitter with the following description:



“NEVER TOO YOUNG WHEN BORN FOR JIHAD! . . . Shocking video. Arab/Muslim father decides to acclimatise his newborn son to gunshots! . . . This is ‘Palestinian’ culture where hatred of Jews exceeds the love of children. Children are weapons of jihad, used as human shields and taught terrorism . . .”



One of the top comments on the video referred to a famous statement by Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, who said: “ . . . We can forgive the Arabs for killing our children. We cannot forgive them for forcing us to kill their children. We will only have peace with the Arabs when they love their children more than they hate us . . .”

The video in question was real but had no actual connection to Palestinians or Palestine. In reality, the incident took place in Saudi Arabia, and the perpetrator—believed to be the baby’s brother—was arrested.10 It is unclear whether the article’s framing, which misplaces the video in the context of broader Arab-Israeli and Palestinian relations, is a case of accidental misinformation or intentional disinformation, or whether it was developed initially by the Australian Jewish Association or amplified by free-speechfront.info. The actual facts of the case would have been easy to establish, not least because multiple Twitter users replied to the initial tweet to point out that it was incorrect. What is clear is that tens of thousands of social media users were exposed to this misleading information. According to metrics from Buzzsumo, a proprietary research and analytics tool that provides information about the social media reach of online content, the free-speechfront.info article received over 39,900 engagements on Facebook, including 24,800 reactions, 7,300 shares, and 7,800 comments.11

Another illustrative example of the content mill’s typical posts is an article posted on free-speechfront.net in November 2018, titled “Shock as Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia and Greece Declare War Against Radical Islam, the UN and the EU as They Join Forces With Israel.”12 The content of the article is a somewhat disjointed mash-up. The first half relates to Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu’s meeting at the Craiova Forum summit early that month with the leaders of the four countries, including his efforts to rally their support for Israel’s positions in the United Nations (UN) and European Union (EU) on issues like Palestinian recognition and statehood.13 (The article includes two embedded tweets from Netanyahu’s official @IsraeliPM Twitter account.)

The second half of the piece is an attack on the UN and the abuse of Christian populations in Muslim-majority countries (including a paragraph lifted without attribution from a speech by Netanyahu on persecuted Christians in Iran).14 This part of the article appears to have been copied from an earlier article on the since-deleted freespeechtime.net, which was part of the previous generation of domains connected to this particular content mill.

This example sheds light on the cheap, dubious ways content mills mass-produce and promote low-quality content. It demonstrates how content mills recycle stories—the aforementioned article uses Netanyahu’s visit to the Craiova Forum as a news hook and then fills out the rest of the story with old and unrelated content. The same technique, and the same filler content, was used again for an article on politicsonline.net a few months later.15 This article also demonstrates how content from the website is laundered through the broader information ecosystem. In addition to generating over 6,600 engagements on Facebook, 393 shares on Twitter, and hundreds of likes and retweets,16 the article’s content also spread across multiple other fringe and far-right blogs.17

Using the service Social Insider, this investigation identified the posts that received the highest engagement on Facebook pages infiltrated by the operators of the influence campaign (a tactic that will be discussed in more detail below).18 Social Insider is a proprietary online tool that analyzes social media posts to identify which posts generate the most user engagement.

As an example, the most popular post (from February 14) on the “Guardians of Australia” Facebook page in the thirty days prior to February 24, 2020 linked to an article on thepolitics.online (see screenshot 2).19 The article claimed, “A father from Afghanistan, barely making ends meet, sold his own daughter to a 55-year-old cleric for a goat and some food. Footage doing the rounds on the Internet shows the moment local women gave him a beating,” and it included video of the Russian state-backed media conglomerate RT’s coverage of a story from 2016. The opening paragraph of the article was found verbatim on numerous other websites including those of RT and former footballer turned conspiracy theorist David Icke.20 At the time of the original RT story, the Washington Post ran an article on a similar subject stating that the girl had been rescued and was “in a shelter, while the man [had been] arrested and jailed,” according to Afghan officials.21

The most popular “Guardians of Australia” post (February 2020)

The most popular post by a Facebook page called “Never Again Canada” for the same period featured an article about Auschwitz (as of May 2020, this group’s Facebook page has been removed).22 (The content mill often promotes pro-Israeli pieces in addition to overtly Islamophobic ones.) The group’s second-most popular post promoted another thepolitics.online article containing a video titled “Watch: Adult Iranian Muslim Man Marries a[n] 11-Year-Old Girl.”23 The opening paragraph of this piece was also found on other websites such as trump-train.com, a so-called news site aimed at Americans but registered in India.24

The introduction was nearly the exact same as a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFERL) article, which went on to note that the marriage had been annulled due to public backlash.25 For its part, the article on thepolitics.online reported, “The girl is said to be around 11. The man is reportedly 33. They were recently wed in a remote southwestern Iranian province with a video of the ceremony posted online.” By comparison, RFERL stated, “The girl is said to be around 11. The man is reportedly twice her age. They were recently wed in a remote southwestern Iranian province with a video of the ceremony posted online.” According to Google search return dates, both the RFERL and thepolitics.online pieces were published on September 4, 2019. This mishmash of directly copied or slightly reworded content taken from other sources is typical of the content published on the content mill’s domains. This strategy is not unique to the operators—plenty of low-quality content online is derived from other sources—but the content mill does demonstrate consistency across domains in terms of the quality of the content shared.

Given that both of these examples are stories that were covered by more reputable media outlets, it appears that the content is not entirely false, per se. Rather, the operators tend to mislead by not specifying that both cases were resolved and the victims protected—follow-up information that was most likely available when the pieces were posted. Indeed, in the first example, over three years had lapsed between the Facebook post and the publication of the original article.

The Content Mill’s Web Domains

Beyond the sort of content that the content mill seems to churn out, it is also worth examining the web domains on which the content tends to be published. The content mill operation is based on a series of domains dating back to at least 2017. There appear to have been several generations of domains, which were mostly Blogspot sites in the beginning but later became mostly independently registered domains. For example, the online content eventually migrated from sites like on-linepolitics.blogspot.com and freespeechtime.blogspot.co.il to ones like thepolitics.online and freespeech-time.com.

At least thirteen relevant domains were active as of February 10, 2020, and many of them appear to be interconnected. Ten of these domains use the same Google Analytics tracking code, which indicates that they are controlled by the same actor(s) (see table 1).26 Google Analytics helps website owners track their web traffic. When website owners run Google Analytics on their sites, a unique eight-digit identification number linked to their Google Analytics account is inserted into the source code of the sites. One Google Analytics account can be used to track multiple sites. For example, one website could be marked UA-XXXXXXXX-1, with the repeated Xs representing the eight-digit identification number, while a second related website would be identified with the number UA-XXXXXXXX-2, and so on. These identification numbers can be used to discern which websites are likely run by the same set of operators.

That is not all. An eleventh domain, thetruthvoice.net, uses a different Google Analytics code, but a close investigation of thepolitics.online (one of the initial ten linked domains) in February 2020 found that both websites share a different common identifying feature. At the time, they were both using the same MGid JavaScript, another type of analytics tracking script as seen below (see screenshots 3 and 4). This script appears to have since been removed from one of the domains (thepolitics.online).

Two additional web domains share a different Google Analytics tracking code from the initial ten domains but also appear highly likely to be a part of the content mill. The content from politicsonline.net and speech-point.com is highly consistent in tone and subject with the content shared by the other identified domains and often is shared by the same social media accounts. There is an obvious similarity between some of the domain names—between politicsonline.net and thepolitics.online, for instance, and between speech-point.com and speech-point.net; these striking parallels echo the similarities between other domains such as free-speechfront.info and freespeechfront.net. The speech-point.net domain also uses the exact same wording in its cookie and privacy policy as five of the other domains.27 Most obviously, speech-point.net, speech-point.com, speechline.net, free-speechfront.info, freespeechfront.net, and thepolitics.online all contain the sentence “First, Our blog [sic] designed to share legitimate political views while exercising our rights to freedom of expression and freedom of speech,” and they all also include an invitation to contact the site owners at “the following email” without listing an email address.28

There is further evidence of some overlap in content between the domains. For example, an article titled “U.S. Cuts All Funding and Announces Withdrawal From U.N.’s Cultural Agency Over Pro-Islamic Bias” was published on politicsonline.net on April 4, 2019.29 The same article appears to have been previously published on freespeech-time.com in November 2018, although it has since been removed.30 While these two domains have not been definitively proven to be part of the operation, it is possible that they are linked.

Most of these domains present themselves as news sites, with no overt information about who is responsible for running them. The exceptions to this are politicaldiscussion.net, a discussion forum, and thepolitics.online, which has an About Us page that describes the site as an “anonymous blog written by Israelis” and denies that it is a news site (see screenshot 5).31 Despite this disclaimer, the site seems to be presented to look like a news site.

Overall, it appears plausible to conclude that these domains are run by the same actors. The similarity of the content in terms of style, tone, and subject matter as well as the repeated sharing of content across sites provide ample circumstantial evidence. The use of shared analytics accounts gives even stronger weight to the hypothesis that these domains are operated by the same individuals. These details demonstrate that, at the very least, eleven of these domains are connected through a single Google Analytics account, meaning that if there are multiple operators, they are working in coordination with the other sites.

The “About Us” page of thepolitics.online

For research purposes, the authors of this study used Uberlink to designate these domains as seed pages and conduct hyperlink network analysis of outbound and inbound links to these websites. Uberlink employs a web-based software known as VOSON to track and analyze when web pages link to one another through hyperlinks;32 using the content mill domains as seeds, or points of origin, the software identifies all of the domains that link to the seeds or to other domains in the network.

In the case of the content mills’ domains, this analysis returned a network of 143 domains with 239 connections between them. The visualization tool Gephi was subsequently used to create a network mapping of these websites, which is featured below (see figure 1). The mapping displays the relationships among the identified domains, all of which trace back (through some number of nodes) to the content mill domains.

This visualization reveals some surprising curiosities about the web domains that appear to be affiliated with the content mill. While the content mill has clearly targeted Western countries like Australia, Canada, the UK, and the United States, it does not target those countries exclusively. Nearly one-third of all the domains found in the hyperlink network analysis contained .in, the internet’s top-level country code domain for India. Why would that be the case?

There are no definitive answers, but given the rise in sectarian violence targeting Muslims in India, it is possible that the operators see the country as a market for Islamophobic content or that India happens to be a serendipitous market for the purveyors of this inflammatory content.33 Together with the websites speech-point.com, therealnews.net, and politicsonline.net, these websites formed a distinct community in the network marked by the color teal in the center of the network. Even though those India-centric domains form the biggest cluster in the network analysis visualization, this study focused on the content mill’s activities in the West because the majority of the Facebook pages’ content and domains in question were aimed primarily at American, British, and Canadian audiences, even if they were consumed by other audiences.

Another smaller community centered on the domain i-supportisrael.com, which is one of nine domains (6 percent of the total) that contained the term “i-supportisrael.” A dozen domains (or 8 percent of the total) contained the term “Israel.” This community is displayed in blue in the top right corner of figure 1.34

But the vast majority of domains in this network appear unrelated in nature to the content pushed by the seed websites. The primary purpose of these secondary domains may not be to spread content produced by the mill, but they are part of an ecosystem that helps boost such content in online search returns by increasing hyperlinks to them. Many of the connected domains appear to be directories listing and hyperlinking to other websites (such as www.toplist.co.in, www.linkedbd.com, and www.infolinks.top); this method of adding backlinks is one way to boost a website’s search returns (and therefore advertising revenue).35 This could further the claim that this operation at least partially is financially motivated rather than solely driven by political motives, but a group that wants to spread its content for political reasons might face similar motives to further its reach, underscoring the difficulty of determining the intent of online actors.

The Content Mill’s Facebook Page Infiltration

But the influence operation depends not only on the inflammatory content it creates and the domains that host it: it also relies on social media networks to help promote its work and attract readers. Internet archives show that the content mill previously operated its own Facebook pages, including pages linked to the free-speechtime.com and freespeechtime.net domains (in the latter case, the Facebook page was titled “We Love Israel”).36 The social media giant has since removed these pages.

Yet things did not stop there. Previous reporting by the Guardian uncovered evidence that the content mill operators have switched to using more covert tactics, infiltrating existing Facebook pages and using them to drive traffic to the content mill’s domains. According to the Guardian, the operators of the campaign systematically contacted the moderators of established right-wing, pro-Israel, and anti-Islamic Facebook pages.37 Posing as passionate volunteers, the operators offered to assist the moderators in operating these pages. On being given administrator privileges, the operators co-opted these pages to post content from their own domains.38

The content mill appears to have begun employing this strategy in 2016 using pages in the United States and Israel, before expanding over the course of 2018 and 2019 to include at least nineteen pages, according to the Guardian.39 (BuzzFeed’s reporting pointed to twenty-five pages.)40 The campaign’s operators are mainly targeting audiences in Australia, Canada, the UK, and the United States, though Austrian, Israeli, and Nigerian audiences have been targeted as well. To give a sense of how prolific the influence operation has been, the Guardian’s analysis found that the network posted 5,695 coordinated posts in October 2019, a month’s worth of posts that generated 846,424 likes, shares, or comments over that period. According to reporting from December 2019, “the network [had] published at least 165,000 posts and attracted 14.3 million likes, shares or comments,” according to the Guardian team.41

BuzzFeed has reported on the campaign’s use of link redirection on some of the Facebook groups based in the United States and Canada.42 Their investigation found multiple Facebook pages using links from Google’s Blogger platform to disguise the real domain that hosts the content. For example, on Facebook, a link might appear to be from fpf-blog.blogspot.com, but when the user clicks, they are redirected to freepressfront.com instead. Experts that spoke to BuzzFeed suggested that this tactic might be an effort to evade detection by Facebook.43

This problematic behavior has not yet been stopped in its tracks. As mentioned previously, the BuzzFeed and Guardian investigations into the content mill were published in April and December 2019, respectively. As of February 2020, Facebook pages directly controlled by the operators appear to have been taken down, but other groups that the operators have infiltrated are still running and still promoting their content. For instance, according to Facebook’s transparency data (see screenshot 6 below), half of the eight administrators for the page “Guardians of Australia” are based in Israel. The page routinely shares content that has nothing to do with Australia, including posts from the content mill domains (see screenshot 7).44

Unrelated inflammatory content on the “Guardians of Australia” Facebook page

Interestingly, the surviving Facebook pages also often share content from Hananya Naftali, an influential Israeli social media figure and social media adviser to Netanyahu (see screenshot 8). While the content mill operators have a clear profit motive for driving traffic to their web domains, the intent behind their sharing of Naftali’s content is more ambiguous. Such sharing could reflect a genuine desire to share the content, an effort to build a bigger audience for the pages by sharing popular content, or both.

The Content Mill’s Other Social Media Outreach

While Facebook appears to be by far the most significant element of the content mill’s social media operation, its operators do appear to be active on other platforms, including Twitter, Reddit, and Gab.

On Twitter, there are at least two accounts that appear likely to be a part of the content mill. One of these, @TimeSpeech, uses the same branding as freespeech-time.com and the group’s now-removed Facebook page (see the screenshots 9 and 10 below).

@TimeSpeech Twitter account

The website header of freespeech-time.com

The @TimeSpeech Twitter account shares content not only from freespeech-time.com but also from the other domains in the network (including speech-point.com and truthvoice.net). This reinforces the conclusion that they are likely part of the content mill even though they use different Google Analytics tracking codes).

Another domain, i-supportisrael.com, links to a Twitter account called @ISupport_Israel, which uses the same branding as the website. Both the @TimeSpeech and @ISupport_Israel Twitter accounts have pinned tweets promoting politicaldiscussion.net, a discussion forum that uses the same Google Analytics tracking code as the other content mill domains. The @ISupport_Israel account also shares content from all the content mill domains. Based on this evidence, it seems reasonable to conclude that these accounts are likely part of the content mill operation.

Three additional Twitter accounts are worth mentioning. All three use women’s names—Sheila Berger (@SheilaB16315388), Alicia (@Alicia05972932), and Liza Rosen (@lizarosen101)—and have set a Star of David as their profile images. Most content that the three accounts share comes from the content mill domains, and they sometimes retweet one another, as do the @TimeSpeech and @ISupport_Israel accounts. However, based solely on the simple facts that they often tweet content from the mill and retweet one another, there is not enough evidence to definitively conclude that these accounts are part of the content mill.

Meanwhile, four accounts on Reddit—unislamic, andynushil, Alisa1554, and lizalol151665—similarly appear to be dedicated to posting content almost entirely from the content mill domains.45 They tend to post in conservative-leaning subreddits including r/Republican, r/The_Donald, r/HillaryForPrison, r/Conservative, r/IslamUnveiled, r/Australianpolitics, and r/exmuslim. The emphasis on U.S.- and Australia-focused right-wing subreddits echoes the influence campaign’s choice of targeted Facebook pages.

The andynushil account is interesting for several reasons. It is the oldest of the four, dating back to 2017, and it is the only one with a verified email.46 It uses the display name “FreeSpeechTime.” The andynushil account broke character once in November 2019, posting in the Electronic Dance Music Production subreddit.47 It is the only one to share videos from a YouTube account named “Free Speech Watch.”48 This YouTube account was created in November 2019 and appears likely to be the content mill’s first venture onto the video-sharing platform (see screenshot 11).

Interestingly, AndyNush is also the name of an account on Gab, a social media platform that markets itself as a place for “political speech protected by the First Amendment” and that has become a popular online home for far-right web users.49 This account almost exclusively has shared content from the content mill domains.50 At least one other Gab account, using the name Rachelrose,51 has also been dedicated entirely to sharing the content mill’s articles. The influence operation’s apparent activity on Gab is a further indication of a tendency to target right-wing audiences.

In summary, the content mill is a persistent operation using at least a dozen or so domains and multiple social media platforms and accounts to spread inflammatory and misleading anti-Islamic and anti-Palestinian content. The evidence suggests a strategy of targeting right-wing and far-right audiences, but given that the operators stand to gain financially from driving traffic to their domains, they have clear commercial interests at stake as well. Despite multiple efforts by journalists to expose the group’s activities, the content mill has not been significantly disrupted. Its content has been shared widely and continues to play on and contribute to existing social tensions.

Prospects for Public and Private Enforcement

What enforcement options do social media platforms and government actors have for addressing the kinds of influence operations that this content mill and others like it have employed?

Industry actors have put forth the most extensive options, yet even these measures are a patchwork of community standards that tend to apply to individual elements of an influence campaign without addressing the operation as a whole. Still, given the abundance of data available to social media platforms and their wealth of experience attempting to deal with malicious actors online, their policies are better tailored and specifically formulated to navigate the intricacies of online influence operations.

State-driven legal mechanisms for countering such influence operations are far less robust for a number of reasons: a paucity of laws that govern online activity and are well-suited to address influence operations, the difficulties of attributing malicious activity, and jurisdictional hurdles that may negate legal solutions even when perpetrators can be identified.

Platform Policies

Several problematic behaviors demonstrated by the operators of this influence campaign could be addressed by various existing Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or Reddit policies. Those activities include:

posting content that inflames social, political, or economic tensions;

cloaking web addresses and surreptitiously redirecting online traffic to paid advertisements;

using fake accounts to co-opt existing communities; and

coordinating activities of ambiguous authenticity across platforms.

Reviewing the ways that social network platforms’ existing policies could be used against the content mill operators could lead to a better understanding of the current opportunities, as well as gaps, for combating this type of influence operation. This analysis draws on publicly available information published by social networks and platforms. (Only platforms that this study found the content mill to be using were analyzed.)

The policies published by Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit were similar enough to warrant combined analysis. The policies put forward by Gab, on the other hand, are extremely lax. Gab’s terms of service are designed expressly to mirror the First Amendment protections of the U.S. Constitution, even though the amendment only restricts government actors, meaning that censorship by private parties like online platforms cannot actually violate or preserve such protections. As a result, while Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit prohibit or reduce attempts to distribute or amplify hate speech, harassment, and false or misleading information, Gab allows such inflammatory and skewed content to flourish largely unchecked.

Gab’s prohibited uses and content standards are minimal, going only slightly further than simply prohibiting conduct and content that are unlawful.52 Gab prohibits obscenity, sexually explicit or pornographic content, certain commercial activities involving trade and financial instruments and sales involving animals or animal abuse, “unwanted advertising,” and other unlawful acts, including unlawful threats or incitement to imminent lawless action. But its impersonation policies are loosely written to echo the broad protections of the First Amendment, making any kind of test of user authenticity or legitimacy seemingly impossible, and the policy on commercial spam “is not thought to encompass reasonable commercial use of a Gab feed by a commercial entity or individual to advertise your own commercial products.”53 These protections make Gab an ideal hub for extremist content that has been pushed off platforms like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit.54

Posting inflammatory content: The operators of content mills like the one featured in this case study appear to violate (in at least some instances) online platforms’ policies on dangerous organizations, bullying and harassment, violence and incitement, and/or hate speech. Because of this, these policies are one potential avenue for countering the online actions of such parties. Yet such policies can be challenging to enforce, as many savvy influence operators know how to create content that falls below the threshold of enforcement but is nonetheless harmful.

Apparent ties between the content mill’s operators and extremist organizations could be grounds for enforcement, but proving such connections conclusively is no easy feat. The team of reporters from BuzzFeed and the Toronto Star that first reported on this influence campaign pinpointed ties between the operation and the “Never Again Canada” Facebook page, which had ties to a noted right-wing extremist organization known as the Jewish Defense League.55 These reporters highlighted that Facebook had previously removed this extremist organization from its platform citing its dangerous organizations policy. Twitter and YouTube similarly prohibit violent extremist content, meaning that any overt ties to extremist groups would be enforceable across all three platforms.56 In the case of this content mill, however, evidence of ties to extremist organizations appears to be mostly circumstantial, making many of these policies on dangerous organizations largely inapplicable in this instance.

Beyond circumstantial ties to an extremist organization, the operators’ online posts could potentially run afoul of platforms’ policies against harassment, the incitement of violence, and hate speech, though enforcement of those standards has been uneven. The posts the operators have shared on Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit appear to have routinely expressed anti-Muslim sentiments that could be subject to policies concerning bullying and harassment, violence and incitement, or hate speech. It is worth noting that these platforms enforce policies on restricting hate speech, violence, and incitement even when such words are not targeted at a specific individual—the wording of all four of the platforms’ policies makes explicit reference to content that targets groups of people based on protected classes. These protected classes or characteristics vary between platforms but typically include race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sex/gender, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, and disability. Other broader identifying markers are sometimes included too, such as age, diagnosis of a serious disease, veteran status, immigration status, and status as a victim of a violent event or such a victim’s kin.57

It is worth looking a bit more closely at each specific company’s policies. Facebook’s bullying and harassment policy covers “unwanted malicious contact” and other harms that fall short of violent threats or hate speech.58 The social media giant’s policy on violence and incitement covers statements that aspire to, condone, or intend violence, and Twitter’s policy covers statements of “intent to kill or inflict serious physical harm on a specific person or group of people.”59

Facebook’s hate speech policy categorizes various tiers of harmful content. The most egregious content contains violent or dehumanizing speech and targets individuals or groups based on protected characteristics or immigration status.60 Second-tier content involves generalities or statements that express a group’s inferiority or contain targeted cursing.61 The third tier, perhaps the one most applicable to the content posted directly by the pages associated with this influence campaign, includes calls for political, economic, or social exclusion on the basis of protected characteristics, including “race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and diagnosis of a serious disease or disability.”62 Facebook policy prohibits all three types of hate speech.

Meanwhile, Twitter’s hateful conduct policy forbids individuals from promoting violence against, threatening, attacking, or inciting fear on the basis of a protected category, as well as using language that dehumanizes individuals on the basis of religion.63 And their policy on abusive behavior forbids users from wishing serious harm on others and using “aggressive insults with the purpose of harassing or intimidating others.”64 YouTube platform policy similarly prohibits “content promoting violence or hatred against individuals or groups” based on protected categories.65 Reddit’s policy against threats, harassment, and bullying is quite expansive and includes “anything that works to shut someone out of the conversation through intimidation or abuse, online or off[line],” and includes menacing or directing abuse at an individual.66 It is worth noting that platforms enforce policies against hate speech, violence, and incitement even when such words are not targeted at a specific individual—all four of the platforms’ language makes explicit reference to content that targets groups of people based on protected classes.

The content promoted by the content mill in question is often inflammatory, offensive, and deeply skewed. Yet, absent a specific threat, call to violence, or element of dehumanization, the content can often evade detection and enforcement under online platforms’ policies. The Guardian found that the operators behind this campaign targeted violence against Australia’s first female Muslim senator, Mehreen Faruqi, as individual followers launched a torrent of aggressive comments against the politician on Facebook.67 Incidents like these would likely warrant enforcement under Facebook’s policies on hate speech, violence and incitement, or harassment, and the other platforms have similar prohibitions on targeted harassment.68

Whether or not the policies more broadly apply to the bulk of the content visible in the archived links is somewhat debatable, as the posts use false or misleading information to suggest negative stereotypes or characteristics but fall short of outright dehumanizing or hateful language. That said, as the Guardian report mentioning Faruqi put it, “the posts stoke deep hatred of Islam across the western world and influence politics in Australia, Canada, the UK and the US by amplifying far-right parties.”69 Given the ambiguity of some of the policies mentioned above, perhaps there is a case for arguing that the content in question creates a pervasive culture of hostility toward a protected group that could justify enforcement.

While platforms can escalate enforcement options in response to repeated offenses—Twitter, for example, suspends accounts that repeatedly violate its platform rules70—this consequence occurs in cases where clear violations have taken place. There is little to suggest that existing platform policies are meant to address cumulative harms. Enforcement on these grounds would likely require a reinterpretation of existing rules and guidelines, which largely focus on individual instances of harmful content or coordinated behavior, regardless of content. This may be easier for platforms like Reddit, for example, whose policies are vaguer than those of Facebook and Twitter, as Reddit may have more latitude to interpret the rules according to specific harms.

Cloaking URLs and redirecting traffic to paid advertisements: Operators of this content mill and others like it also may be violating online platforms’ terms of use by disguising the web addresses (also known as uniform resource locators or URLs) of their content to covertly siphon off web traffic and boost their advertising revenues.

Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit explicitly prohibit the practice of URL cloaking and redirecting users to websites that appear irrelevant to the posted content. Facebook outlines this stance under its spam policy, labeling it both “cloaking” (the bait-and-switch tactic of showing one link and then redirecting users to a different site) and “misleading content” (showing a link that promises a certain kind of content but delivering another kind instead).71 Reddit also bars “posting content that includes link redirects as a way to circumvent an existing domain block and/or disguise a link’s source.”72 Twitter’s policy explicitly prohibits commercially motivated spam, which would appear to be the closest approximation of the behavior exhibited by the operators in this case study and should easily apply to the offense in question.73

Using fake accounts to co-opt existing online communities: When the operators of this influence campaign reached out to existing online communities and requested administrator access to their Facebook pages and groups, it appears that they may have done so using inauthentic Facebook accounts.

Facebook has two existing policies that could prevent a threat actor from using fake accounts to gain editor privileges on popular pages: its misrepresentation policy and its inauthentic behavior policy. The misrepresentation policy bans users from creating inauthentic profiles and prohibits individuals from recreating profiles that have been taken off the platform.74 The inauthentic behavior policy further prohibits users from “mislead[ing] people or Facebook about the (1) identity, purpose, or origin of the entity that they represent; (2) popularity of Facebook or Instagram content or assets; (3) purpose of an audience or community; [or] (4) source or origin of content.”75

The other social media platforms—Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit—have similar prohibitions on inauthentic or misleading activity, but they vary in stringency. Because Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit do not explicitly require users to share their true identities, users are free to potentially have multiple accounts. Problematic behavior arises when these multiple accounts claim to be representing individuals or organizations they do not actually speak for or when they are used to engage in harmful behavior or artificially generate engagement on the platform. Twitter refers to such tactics in its policy on “platform manipulation,” writing that the use of multiple or fake accounts to “engage in spamming, abusive, or disruptive behavior” or to “artificially influence conversation” is prohibited.76 Similarly, YouTube forbids individuals and channels from impersonating other existing channels and from posting content designed to appear as though it originates from someone else.77 Reddit prohibits the impersonation of individuals or entities in a “misleading or deceptive manner.”78

Given the nuances of each of these policies, whether they might reasonably be applied to the case at hand depends on several factors. Assuming the individual profiles that were used to contact Facebook page editors were fake accounts, Facebook’s misrepresentation policy might apply. If they were operated by real individuals who sought not to promote Israeli content as claimed but to drive traffic to dubious websites for financial gain, Facebook’s inauthentic behavior policy might still have been violated. The counterargument is that if the actors in question are Israeli and seek to promote pro-Israeli content, it is difficult to prove that their primary intent is to benefit financially and not truly to promote a viewpoint.

Twitter’s policy on platform manipulation might apply insofar as the accounts engage in harmful behavior, but the sole act of creating fake or multiple accounts does not appear sufficient to violate the policy, as the platform recognizes the legitimacy of accounts created for expressing distinct identities, parodies, commentaries, or fan tributes.79 Similarly, YouTube and Reddit make no presumption that its users are accurately representing their true personal identities on their channels, and individuals are free to operate multiple channels or accounts, as long as none of them impersonate other existing channels or accounts or falsely claim to be representative of some other actual person or organization.

Coordinating inauthentic behavior across platforms: Another possible opportunity for pursuing enforcement against the content mill’s activities relates to the group’s “coordinated inauthentic behavior,” which can include the use of fake or misleading accounts. The specific term coordinated inauthentic behavior is used predominantly by Facebook, but Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit have similar policies in place.80

Facebook defines coordinated inauthentic behavior as the use of multiple accounts, groups, or pages to engage in inauthentic behavior. The key to this policy is that it involves not just a single instance of misrepresentation but multiple instances intended to work in tandem.81 Considering that at least nineteen Facebook pages were found to be amplifying the content related to this influence operation, often seconds after a new post was added, it is likely that the group is engaging in such coordination and potentially in violation of this policy.82 Facebook may be able to see if the same accounts are acting as administrators across multiple pages to coordinate posts, but that information is not publicly available.

Twitter’s platform manipulation policy also prohibits inauthentic engagements and coordinated attempts to “artificially influence conversations through the use of multiple accounts, fake accounts, automation, and/or scripting.”83 Twitter’s rules around automation, however, may complicate this argument, as Twitter does permit automated retweets and automated sharing of content. All the standard Twitter rules, including those related to spam and misrepresentation, apply when developing automation tools, but such tools are technically permissible.84

While Reddit’s policies around the authenticity of content differ slightly from those of Facebook and Twitter, their policy on spam would seem to cover this type of behavior too. The platform prohibits repeatedly posting the same content across threads, a subreddit, or subreddits as well as the repeated posting of unrelated, off-topic, or link-farmed content.85 YouTube’s policy on repetitive content applies both to videos and to comments but similarly falls under its spam policy. The policies of these two platforms seem to place greater emphasis on the volume of content being published than the authenticity of the content.

The content mill’s behavior does appear troubling under both policies that focus on authenticity and policies that focus on engagement volume. If the content is primarily distributed for financial gain under the guise of political concerns, then it lacks authenticity; meanwhile, if the content is distributed nearly instantly across multiple platforms, then it raises concerns about engagement volume.

Taken together, these policies might address specific aspects of the content mill operators’ problematic behavior. Facebook’s enforcement priorities provide for the removal of content and the removal of accounts that repeatedly engage in problematic behavior, and its enforcement report on community standards claims that they prioritize fake account enforcement against those who “seek to cause harm and find many of these fake accounts are used in spam campaigns and are financially motivated.”86 Twitter also removes content and temporarily or permanently suspends accounts that engage in problematic behavior, while Reddit and YouTube ban users that repeatedly violate their respective terms of service.87 All of the platforms ban individuals and accounts that have been suspended or terminated from creating new accounts to prevent them from seeking to circumvent bans.88

These policies provide platforms with several avenues for tackling the techniques used in the content mill’s influence campaign. But the policies lack a holistic approach to assessing why certain content is problematic when combined with certain behaviors. The campaign in question is troubling not merely because actors are monetizing attention but because they are potentially misrepresenting themselves and disseminating content that relies on false or misleading information, polarizes political debates, and, therefore, pollutes the information environment.

For instance, in the case of the “Never Again Canada” Facebook group, the group’s “page transparency” details (provided by Facebook) indicated that, while the vast majority of group administrators were located in Canada, there were sixteen others located outside the country (see screenshot 12). This raises questions about distinguishing between foreign and domestic actors in a hyperconnected world: who has the right to influence politics in a given geographic region?

The domestic and foreign administrators of a Canadian Facebook group

This case study highlights the difficulty of applying one-dimensional policies to a multidimensional problem. Without such a coherent framework, an effective strategy for resolving this kind of campaign will be elusive. Too many fundamental questions remain about identifying authentic actors from inauthentic ones, distinguishing foreign users from domestic ones, and contextualizing actors’ motives.

The policies social media platforms have on the books are inadequate to fully deal with actors that use a variety of borderline-permissible techniques in coordination to achieve unfavorable outcomes. A better approach might be to consider how a single actor or group could use an array of problematic tactics to conduct influence operations whose effects violate the norms of platforms and, indeed, of democratic societies (at least). By analyzing the data related to individual policy enforcements more holistically over time, platforms may be able to identify patterns of problematic behavior that might be indicative of illegitimate influence operations. Such progress could enable online platforms to move against them before external researchers and media alert them of such issues.

Still, the case study highlights how platforms are asked to prioritize different levels of harm in their enforcement efforts. Although platform manipulation policies can and do cover the kinds of harms outlined above, they are also meant to deal with arguably more serious cases in which governments employ influence operations meant to shape an entire information space, not just drive clicks. At the same time, the persistence of the kind of harmful content distributed by the content mill operators could have a cumulatively negative effect by making it seem normal to encounter inflammatory, misleading content that privileges a worldview associated with anti-Muslim sentiments. Online platforms have been put in a position to outline these enforcement priorities, absent adequate, coherent guidance from governments or civil society.

Treaties and International Law

There are few, if any, international laws or treaties governing influence operations, particularly when such activities are conducted by civilians or proxy organizations and not directly orchestrated by one state against another.89 But there are important principles enshrined in international law that support some relevant national policies.

For example, the UN Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention and Interference in the Internal Affairs of States asserts that “states and peoples” have the right “to have free access to information and to develop fully, without interference, their system of information and mass media.”90 This declaration goes on to mention that states will not conduct “any defamatory campaign, vilification or hostile propaganda for the purpose of intervening or interfering in the internal affairs of other states.”91 Moreover, it underscores that states have the right:

to combat, within their constitutional prerogatives, the dissemination of false or distorted news which can be interpreted as interference in the internal affairs of other states or as being harmful to the promotion of peace, co-operation and friendly relations among states and nations.92

Likewise, Article 20 of the UNInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights prohibits “any advocacy of national, racial, or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility, or violence,”93 which much of the inflammatory content pushed by the influence operators in this case arguably attempts to do.

Nonetheless, given that the UN is a multilateral organization, it is unlikely that a sizable enough majority of its member states would judge the influence activities outlined in this case study to be in breach of either document. After all, there is no conclusive evidence that the operators behind this campaign are acting at the behest of the Israeli government. Moreover, targeted countries would need to deem these activities sufficiently dangerous and important to raise this subject at the highest level of international diplomacy. That being said, individual countries could pass new domestic legislation enshrining some of the language mentioned above to regulate online communications or attempt to rely on some existing national laws to do so in the ways outlined below.

National Laws

The content mill’s online activities span several countries with differing legal systems, with actors in Israel targeting audiences in Australia, Canada, the UK, and the United States through what appear to be willing local partners. Examining the legal provisions of the various jurisdictions affected by this conduct may therefore provide insights into how the governments of these countries are seeking to deal with this kind of influence campaign, demonstrating perhaps that in some cases the principles underpinning existing laws can be translated in some respects to meet the threat at hand. Countries have proposed new legislation or used existing laws to deal with online harms, but many of these laws face implementation challenges because of the necessity of attribution and the problem of extraterritoriality. Because many of these laws attempt to blame actors or platforms for engaging in harmful behavior or failing to stop others from engaging in harmful behavior, these kinds of legal solutions may prove an ill-suited tool for countering influence operations. Comprehensive legislative approaches might instead encourage platforms to share information about online harms.

Australia

Australia has at least three relevant laws that might apply to the influence campaign in question. The first, the 2015 Enhancing Online Safety Act, created an e-safety commissioner position with the power to demand that social media companies take down harassing or abusive posts (as well as material that is otherwise illegal, such as content involving child abuse).94 The powers under this act were expanded in 2018 to include revenge porn, a development with implications for deepfakes, which are “hyper-realistic video, audio, or images of someone appearing to do and say something they didn’t do or say.”95 Yet this law tends to deal more with cyber bullying and targeted attacks than the type of general discriminatory speech exhibited in the case of the content mill, with the exception of the directed attack on Faruqi mentioned earlier.

The second law was adopted in 2019 in the wake of the Christchurch terrorist attacks. The Sharing of Abhorrent Violent Material Act lets the government fine social media companies and exposes executives to the risk of jail time if they fail to rapidly remove “abhorrent violent material” from their platforms.96 While the content shared by the content mill operators in this case might be hateful and misleading, it likely does not meet the law’s threshold for violent material.

Finally, Australia’s 1975 Racial Discrimination Act has been used to address “offensive behaviour” based on race, color, or national or ethnic origin. The law prohibits acts conducted in a public place that are likely to “offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people” based on the characteristics written above.97 The law was applied in a 2011 case involving a political commentator and two articles that made offensive comments about members of the country’s aboriginal community, which the court said “were not written in good faith and contained factual errors.”98 The law defines a public place as “any place to which the public have access as of right or by invitation, whether express or implied and whether or not a charge is made for admission to the place.”99 Applying this law to the case of the content mill and others like it would require a determination that a social media platform constitutes a “public place” under this definition and that the content was harmful enough to be likely to cause offense, insult, humiliation, or intimidation. In one 2002 case, the Australian Federal Court adjudicated an appeal involving a website promoting anti-Semitic content and found that the site violated the Racial Discrimination Act, meaning that the law could apply to online content.100

Canada

Canada has one relevant law, the Canadian Criminal Code, that criminalizes some offenses related to hate speech and propaganda, but it does not define hate speech. Offenses related to hateful propaganda include “advocating genocide,” “public incitement of hatred,” and “willful promotion of hatred . . . against any identifiable group,” including one distinguished by its religion.101 The law stipulates that this public information must be published deliberately and not carelessly.102 The content pushed through by the content mill’s influence campaign arguably aimed to foster Islamophobic sentiments, actions that could be deemed the promotion of willful hatred against a religious group.

The problem is that, to prosecute a crime under this law, the perpetrator must be known. If they are neither located in Canada nor Canadian, such limitations likely would prevent the law from applying. A further hurdle in Canadian jurisprudence is that most of Canada’s existing laws on false or misleading information (that is distinct from its legislation on hate speech) apply to radio or television broadcasters but exempt social media platforms and their users.103

Israel

Israel has at least three laws or bills that deal with propaganda, including messaging from foreign sources. These laws focus specifically on elections and would not apply to the circumstances of the content mill case.104 Moreover, these laws are focused on the targeting of domestic Israeli audiences and do not necessarily govern propaganda activities undertaken by Israeli citizens targeting citizens in other countries. Israeli lawmakers proposed two other laws targeting social media companies in 2016 and 2018, bills that demanded the removal of any content that incites violence or acts of terrorism.105 It is unclear if these legal provisions have been adopted. Given that the operators of this influence campaign have been attributed by other sources to Israelis targeting citizens in other countries,106 it is unlikely that these laws, should they be passed, would prohibit this activity unless international pressure were applied to Israel to push its citizens to curtail this conduct.

United Kingdom

Though the UK has criminalized terrorist-related online content, its laws on hate crimes and discrimination are scattered throughout the legal code and many of them are too outdated to deal effectively with online conduct and social media platforms. The UK’s 2019 Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act made it illegal to post, share, or download terrorist-related material.107 The content posted by the operators of the content mill in question, while troubling, falls outside the realm of terrorism. Sharing content from the Jewish Defense League would not qualify as sharing terrorist content in the UK, as the group is not on the government’s list of “proscribed terrorist groups or organisations.”108

That said, other British laws governing hate crimes and discrimination might apply.109 Racial and religious hatred is defined under these laws “as hatred against a group of persons by reason of the group’s colour, race, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origins or religion (or indeed perceived religion).” Should a person posting online be “threatening, abusive or insulting,” it is possible that legal action might be taken against them.

However, even in the case of these laws, legal complications abound. This approach is highly subjective in terms of determining what speech might qualify, to say nothing of the need to know exactly who is behind the post and whether British law would even apply to them. Moreover, as one report from the Home Affairs Select Committee in the UK House of Commons noted, most of the relevant pieces of legislation that might govern hate speech and abuse are “spread across a number of different Acts of Parliament and each was passed before social media were mainstream tools, and some Acts were passed even before the internet itself was widely used.”110 These limitations make these laws woefully outdated for combating digital influence operations.

United States

U.S. constitutional provisions make it very difficult to take legal action against those who perpetuate hateful and inflammatory content, except in very narrow circumstances. The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution renders prosecuting hate speech extremely difficult. This amendment protects free speech, including that which might be perceived as hateful, subject to very narrow exceptions.111

One group of exceptions involves speech that creates the realistic risk or threat of physical violence. For example, a true threat to physically harm someone can be prosecuted, as can incitement to imminent lawless action, or so-called fighting words—speech so offensive that it risks provoking an immediate breach of the peace (such as starting a fight). The thresholds for meeting each of these exceptions is very high and would almost certainly not apply to any of the content at issue here. After all, even general advocacy of violence is protected under the First Amendment.112

Other First Amendment exceptions might allow private parties to sue the operators of this content mill on various grounds. An individual falsely depicted in a social media post may be able to sue the operators for defamation, provided the author was negligent or reckless in posting the false information (which often appears to have been the case).113 A legitimate news site whose language has been extensively copied verbatim—such as Radio Free Europe—could sue the operators for copyright infringement. (The aggrieved news site could also rely on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to issue a takedown request to the platform or web host serving up the plagiarized content).114

In addition, a social media platform could perhaps sue the operators for breach of contract (due to terms of service violations) or perhaps fraud. Platforms are slowly beginning to experiment with civil suits against exceptionally bad actors. For example, Facebook recently sued a company that was cloaking the true destination of its links to trick Facebook users into installing malware.115 However, like in the cases of other aforementioned national laws, any of these legal avenues would ultimately require identifying the operators. And if the operators do not reside in the United States or have U.S.-based assets, any legal judgment against them in U.S. courts would have limited effects.

Notably, U.S. law offers no mechanism for legally applying pressure to social media platforms for the removal of such content. The Communications Decency Act of 1996 might have been used to counter hate speech, but Section 230 seems to absolve social media companies of responsibility for content that other people publish on their platforms.116

In the case of influence operations involving foreign actors, the U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), which regulates the lobbying influence wielded by foreign actors over U.S. institutions, has recently been applied. FARA is a transparency statute that requires foreign agents to register with the U.S. government, report their activities, and conspicuously label informational materials as the work of a foreign agent.117

Though rarely used in recent decades, the law has experienced a revival in the last few years. Former special counsel Robert Mueller used FARA to charge the Russian operatives behind foreign influence activities discovered during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.118 Given that there are clearly foreign operators engaging with U.S. audiences, FARA might be one avenue for prosecution if the operators continue refusing to register and label their material according to the statute’s provisions. Yet the relatively novel use of FARA to combat social media influence activities faces the same hurdles as other legal avenues: it is challenging and resource-intensive to identify perpetrators and may be impossible to hold them accountable in U.S. courts.

Overall Observations

Many of these various national laws deal with two challenges: attribution and extraterritoriality. Using almost any of the legal tools outlined above would require attributing malign activity to a specific actor, a task that is often difficult to do when identities are easily obscured online. Furthermore, even when a reliable attribution can be made, it is often difficult to marshal the resources necessary to hold an actor accountable. Part of this problem stems from concerns about extraterritoriality—that is, whether a country’s law applies to citizens outside of the country itself. In some cases, like in Australia, courts have ruled that when online content can be viewed by Australian citizens, it is subject to Australian law, regardless of where the creator resides or the data is hosted.119 In practice, even this interpretation would likely be difficult to act on, as it may require extradition, and prosecutors may well decide to pursue less resource-intensive cases.

Of course, attempting to identify laws that deal specifically with influence operations presupposes that such laws do or should exist. On this point, expert opinions can differ, as it is too early to say whether reliance on existing laws is sufficient or whether new, more comprehensive laws are needed. One way of assessing some of the laws that could apply to influence operations is to say that policymakers are ill-equipped to use legal instruments to this end, given the slow pace of legal change, the difficulty of attribution, and the uncertainty surrounding which laws might, in practice, be most appropriate for countering influence operations. Because many of these laws focus on criminalization, rather than promoting information sharing or transparency, they fall short of the goal of creating a healthy online environment, even when they do apply. However, another way of looking at things might be to recognize that a comprehensive legislative solution that attempts to delineate what is acceptable or unacceptable content is ill-suited to dealing with influence operations. Before putting forward new, comprehensive laws to deal with influence operations, policymakers may favor laws that emphasize transparency and disclosure, rather than criminalization, to help better understand and manage the proper balance between state-driven and platform-driven solutions.120

Those caveats notwithstanding, the creative ways that policymakers have been applying existing law to influence operations—like the use of FARA in the United States—may suggest that the principles related to inauthenticity and harmful content that underpin influence operations can be found in existing law and applied when sufficient harm has been done and resources can be mustered.121

Conclusion

The case of this content mill highlights the many challenges facing researchers, social media platforms, and governments trying to understand how best to counter influence operations.

First and foremost is the question of what precisely, if anything, is most troubling about what online actors like the operators of this content mill are doing. Pertinent fundamental questions include whether the behavior demonstrated and the content promoted by the operators are truly problematic, if so why that behavior and content are worrisome, and who gets to make those determinations. There is an argument to be made that the operators are simply using, rather than abusing, online social network platforms. The fact that divisive content can be monetized may not be a flaw as much as a feature of the design of social media platforms. As of now, at least one of the authors of this study remains deeply ambivalent about whether or not the described behavior should be considered problematic, and it would not be a surprise to hear that many in the influence operations community are wrestling with similar thoughts. At the very least, there is not yet a consensus on what constitutes appropriate online behavior in such situations.

Much of the media coverage of this influence operation was problematic. News coverage did not adequately clarify that national statutes and international law do not regulate many or most of the objectionable activities in question. In the relative absence of suitable government regulatory frameworks, media organizations tend to simply assert or imply that online platforms must contain or stop such behavior. But media coverage of this case and others like it all too often has not explored the sorts of enforcement dilemmas that platforms face. News consumers are, as a result, being unrealistically primed to expect platforms simply to identify and stop the behavior.

Media pressure, in tandem with unclear guidance from governments and civil society, forces social media platforms to draw lines in the sand and to grapple with difficult questions: Is it acceptable for foreign actors to work in tandem with domestic administrators of online communities in other countries? Is omission a form of disinformation when it comes to covering such news stories responsibly? Is it acceptable to make money pushing politically charged content? What characteristics push some content over the line into hate speech? Many of these questions were contested even in an analog environment, and they have only become thornier in the age of digital media.

More specifically, this case study exposes a few limits in the policies of online platforms related to inherent ambiguities in online discourse, including the difficulty of determining motives, especially when dealing with anonymous actors. The way the operators have been using fake accounts to gain access to editor privileges on Facebook pages raises questions about distinguishing between foreign and domestic actors and assessing the intent behind actors’ online behavior. As others have pointed out, the fact that the owners of these pages and groups are citizens of the countries against which the content is being directed complicates the platforms’ efforts to determine authenticity, which is at the heart of many of their policies related to influence operations.122 Their decision to cede control of these pages highlights the risk that operators of this and other content mills could co-opt legitimate actors as proxies to promote their agendas.

Even before posing questions about the policies of social media platforms, there are more fundamental matters at stake: what is it about efforts to shape public perceptions on issues of international concern that makes certain behavior problematic? If it is deceptive practices, then the focus returns to the difficulty of assessing the intent of online actors. How can corporate actors and government officials be sure that the primary motivation of a given network is financial gain and not influence over international public opinion? How important is it to distinguish these motives if the real-world impact of the behavior is the same regardless of why the content is promoted?

Assuming the behavior is problematic, social media platforms must gauge whether such conduct is appropriate largely by measuring authenticity or engagement volume. But absent any real way of determining the operators’ motives, authenticity is an inherently unidentifiable characteristic. The content of the posts and the behavior of the operators point to mixed motives—the operators may truly believe in the content they are sharing and may simply be fortunate to have found a way to monetize their deeply held beliefs; on the other hand, the operators may also be exploiting divisive political issues primarily for financial gain. In many cases, it can be difficult to tell.

Assuming the content is problematic, social media companies often look for explicit calls for violence, threats, or otherwise harmful content before they will take action. These platforms have already devised technical and human solutions for dealing with actors that commit clear offenses.123 But sophisticated, malign online actors are aware of platform standards and generally avoid committing clear offenses to ensure that their content is not taken down, employing a constantly shifting repertoire of techniques.

Social media platforms’ piecemeal approaches to dealing with individual aspects of influence operations raise questions about whether these platforms are looking at this problem systemically and whether government officials and civil society are giving them the guidance they need to prioritize certain harms over others. Surely, each type of policy infringement by malign influence operations generates a wealth of data over time that platforms can use to identify and pinpoint behavioral patterns associated with such campaigns. Are social media companies, given their preference for focusing on individual policies, holistically connecting all the dots?

The answer appears to be no. As this case study shows, social media platforms, at least as far as their public-facing policies are concerned, are focused more on individual activities and not the sum of objectionable behaviors that comprise influence operations. Assessing the actors, motives, and techniques in isolation precludes these platforms from robustly analyzing the interconnections that could make influence operations easier to detect.

A more holistic approach would entail, first and foremost, developing metrics to understand the overall impact of influence operations; exploring potentially effective countermeasures; and sharing that information with researchers, civil society members, and government officials. One of the largest hurdles to effectively countering influence operations is the lack of an agreed-upon methodology for measuring and evaluating impact. Better data would help platforms make sense of contextual factors, repeated behaviors, and severity of harm.

Beyond the responses of online platforms themselves, some national laws that might be applicable are constrained by a traditional framework that requires clear acts of deliberate criminal activity to be reliably attributed to their perpetrators. This very narrow framing leaves a lot to be desired, especially given how easily actors can obfuscate their true identities and locations. Traditional criminal legal systems may not be well equipped to deal with influence operations. Nor is it clear that they should be.

There are reasons why liberal democracies, which are particularly susceptible to influence operations and highly value principles of free expression, have so far refrained from enacting more stringent legislation to combat them. The consequences of potential missteps are too high a price to pay in the eyes of many citizens. And legislative approaches in other parts of the world have backfired and in some cases allowed governments in some countries (including Singapore) to take action against opposition figures under the guise of such laws.124 Alternative approaches, such as norms or laws that deal with disclosure and transparency, might be better suited in such situations, but those standards would also need to be articulated.

While online platforms have borne the brunt of much of the public pressure to deal with influence campaigns, many of these questions are also important for society in general to contemplate and should not be answered by industry actors alone. In the rush to do something about influence operations, societies might do well to first convene a coalition of cross-sector, multidisciplinary stakeholders to determine what the lines in the sand are. Some of this work is already under way: operational researchers, academics, think tank scholars, and others have devoted considerable time and effort to studying influence operations and starting to address relevant policy questions.125 These stakeholders might also take pains to better understand the impact of online content on those who engage with it. While metrics about how many users engage with a given piece of content are available, they say little about whether or how such engagement affects individuals’ beliefs or behavior. Any approach to dealing with problematic behavior or problematic content should be based on an understanding of the potential consequences of its spread.

Once stakeholders have achieved a foundational understanding of the impact of such influence operations, have developed greater consensus, and have established guiding principles or practices, private- and public-sector entities should test their responses in adversarial exercises. Because the tactics of influence operators are constantly shifting, any overly rigid attempt to draw lines in the sand will be met immediately with threat actors that want to wipe those lines away. The danger in publicly promulgating a policy is that doing so gives threat actors a clear sense of what techniques must be avoided to remain undetected. Rather than relying on the presumption that users will interpret standards in the broadest possible sense, platforms should assume that users will interpret them in the narrowest sense and that fair enforcement will do the same.

This case study admittedly highlights more questions than it answers. Nonetheless, it is intended to reveal the difficult quandaries that citizens, social media platforms, and governments face as influence campaigns inspired by often unclear motives continue to prey on social divisions. Answering such questions will require the concerted efforts of this full range of stakeholders.

EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT THE LIFE OF THIS GREAT LEADER AND GREAT VISIONARY MODI – JUSTICE BALAKRISHNAN

New Delhi, May 30 : In a unique web launch, with dignitaries present in two countries, India and the US, a comprehensive and holistic biography of the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi – Harbinger of Prosperity & Apostle of World Peace, was released by Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, former Chief Justice of India to mark the completion of six eventful years of Narendra Modi as the Prime Minister here yesterday.

The book is co-authored by Dr. Adish C. Aggarwala, Senior Advocate, President of the International Council of Jurists, and Chairman of All-India Bar Association, and Elisabeth Horan, an eminent American author and poet.

At the exceptional and exclusive launch, Justice Balakrishnan, who released it, said that every citizen, including the common man and woman, wants to know about the life of this great leader and great visionary. He added, “Every citizen has to be a good one to tide over the current difficulty (related to the pandemic). I am sure that the Indian Prime Minister will lead us, and help the people to tide over it.”

The launch was attended by several luminaries such as spiritual gurus, politicians, RSS and BJP personalities, and the two authors.

Baba Ramdev, a well-known yog guru, added, “Yoga and Karma Yoga provide a solution to all problems. Mr Modi is a Karma Yogi, who is an optimist, who is never perturbed, thinks anew, does innovative things, walks ahead with courage, and takes huge decisions, some of which are fraught with dangers.”

Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, a renowned spiritual guru, said, “He (Modi) is a leader with vision, and resolve, to bring in reforms. Not just in India, but in the international arena, his connections and role have been notable. Whether it is at the United Nations, Summit for Climate Change, and G-20, he has made a mark, and is leading the world towards a more peaceful benevolent society – a better world.”

A senior official of the RSS, Ram Lal, who is in-charge of publicity and information of the organization, said, “In the near future, the government, civil institutions, and society will create a new India that will not only stand on its own feet, but give a direction to the world.” This is because of relentless efforts, initiatives, and policies of the Prime Minister.

Indresh Kumar, Member, Executive Committee, RSS, looked at the current times to praise the Prime Minister. “During the Corona pandemic, the leadership of Narendra Modi has spread and blossomed across the globe. He is the only ‘Tall Leader’, which gives confidence and consolation to all. While the world grapples with economic recession, he gave the blueprint to traverse from recession to self-reliance.”

One of the co-authors, Dr Aggarwala, quoted the Prime Minister to indicate the kind of leader he was. On October 2, 2019, on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi’s birth anniversary, the Indian Prime Minister quoted the world-famous scientist, Albert Einstein’s reflections on the Mahatma: “Generations to come, it may well be, will scarce believe that such a man as this one ever in flesh and blood walked upon this Earth.”

Aggarwala confidently added, “I can safely say that similar words of tribute will be showered on Modi himself in the coming decades, thanks to the legacy of transforming India into a global force.”

Former Union Minister, Yogendra Makwana, explained, “Prime Minister Modi has become an important international figure in a multi-polar world. Today, along with the USA, European Union, Russia, China, and Japan, India’s views on diplomatic and geopolitical issues are given appropriate weight.”

Bhubaneswar Kalita, a senior politician from Assam, had this to say about Modi. “He is not only an inspiration for India, but the world, on several issues, be it the war against Corona, be it on economic issues, and be it on diplomatic issues. Particularly because of his bold steps like abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution, he has ensured that India is one nation, India is one Constitution, and India is one flag.”

Shyam Jaju, National Vice President, BJP, was more reflective. “The book is a great work to take the image that the Prime Minister has, to the Indian people, and to the world.”

Eminent American author and poet, and a co-author of the Prime Minister’s biography, Elisabeth Horan, read out the poem she had written on the Indian Prime Minister a few hours before the occasion.

With rare photographs of Modi’s childhood and early life, the biography traces his stunning personal and professional trajectory from being a boy who served tea to becoming the country’s Prime Minister for the second time. It includes little-known and lesser-known facts and anecdotes.

The book is available in two formats, hardcover and e-book, and in 20 languages – 10 foreign ones including English, Arabic, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Mandarin, Russian, and Spanish and 10 Indian including Hindi, Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu.

The book includes messages and forewords from several leading public figures. These include:

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh wrote: “He is a leader who is decisive, pragmatic and determined.”

Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari’s message was: “Prime Minister pursues his goals relentlessly, lays down the framework meticulously, and ensures the best of minds are engaged to fulfil the vision.”

BJP National President J.P. Nadda said: “The strong and decisive leadership provided by Shri Narendra Modi has enhanced India’s stature globally and its role in international affairs. “

UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath wrote: “Prime Minister is committed to take India to a $5 Trillion economy.”

Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s foreword: “Modiji has delivered on his promises, and has done tremendous ground work for further progress.”

Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal said: “Modiji has shown that he has the vision and fortitude to take the sort of decisions that India needed to tread through the global slowdown.”

Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani wrote: “Modiji, who restructured Gujarat, is now the game-changer of India and the world.”

Information & Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said: “Prime Minister has continued to live up to the massive expectations people of India have shown in him.”

Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat’s foreword: “Trans-border strikes on terrorist launch pads, followed by the action taken in Balakot, are glaring examples that India will not tolerate any meddling in its affairs or, security.”

Human Resource Development Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal said that the people see a reflection of their everyday resilience and spirit in the indomitable Modiji, and that aspect has struck a chord.

Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal said that Prime Minister’s uncompromising stands have ingrained genuineness in governance; authenticity in administration and ushered in a polity of performance.

VHP Vice-President Champat Rai said that Modiji played very practical role in solving the Ram Janam Bhumi dispute and construction of Ram Temple.","Balakrishnan, former Chief Justice of India to mark the completion of six eventful years of Narendra Modi as the Prime Minister here yesterday.

Negotiators of the armed movements are hopeful that the peace talks will soon be concluded.

Upon arrival on Thursday, South Sudanese mediator Dieu Mathok told reporters at Khartoum International Airport that the visit aims to discuss a number of outstanding issues in various files with Khartoum. ""The mediation team felt that it could propose some ideas to the Sudanese government delegation that could cause a breakthrough in the remaining peace talks.""

Tut Galuak, head of the South Sudanese mediation team, handed the letter to El Burhan on Friday.

After the meeting, Galuak told reporters that they decided to travel with a delegation of armed struggle movements to Khartoum for a two-day visit, to discuss outstanding issues, and to confirm that a comprehensive peace agreement will be achieved in the near future.

The initial signing of the peace accord will be in the South Sudanese capital Juba, where the negotiations are held. The remaining ceremonies will take place in Khartoum.

Talks in Khartoum

The negotiators of the rebel movements discussed the remaining power-sharing issues concerning membership of the Sovereign Council, the Council of Ministers, and the Forces of Freedom and Change, with the authorities in Khartoum.

After their meeting with Lt Gen Mohamed Hamdan 'Hemeti' at his home in Khartoum on Friday, Ahmed Tugud, Chief negotiator of the Justice and Equality Movement reported progress on the ""few remaining issues"".

During the indirect talks via teleconferencing because of the Covid-19 crisis, many peace files were dealt with, he said in a press conference at the premises of the Sudan News Agency (SUNA). Yet, there remained a limited number of issues that needed ""direct political decision-making"".

According to Yasir Arman, deputy head of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North faction under the leadership of Malik Agar (SPLM-N Agar), the meetings in Khartoum confirmed ""the strong possibility for achieving peace in Sudan"".

He denied rumours that the negotiations are about quotas at the various government levels, and expressed his hope that the June 30 commemoration marches will be ""the beginning of a broad rational dialogue between all political components and civil society in Sudan"".

Khartoum and the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF) rebel alliance agreed in end April, that four seats will be added to Sudan's Sovereign Council in favour of 'the peace bloc' of the Darfur armed movements.

Mohamed Bashir, Chief negotiator of the Sudan Liberation Movement faction headed by Minni Minawi (SLM-MM) said that their coming to Khartoum enhances trust between the negotiating parties. ""We are optimistic about a solution for the outstanding issues,"" he said.

Splits

In mid-May, the SLM-MM withdrew from the SRF alliance and formed a new rebel alliance under the same name 'Sudan Revolutionary Front'. Minawi claimed that the mainstream SRF ignored his constant demands for structural reform within the group. The Justice and Equality Movement faction led by Bakheet Abdelkarim (aka Dabajo) joined the new alliance.

As for the SPLM-N faction under the leadership of Abdelaziz El Hilu in South Kordofan, the separately held peace negotiations reached a stalemate in December last year, as the rebel faction adhered to its long-standing position on self-determination. The talks resumed in mid-January, but no progress has been reported so far.

The mainstream SLM, led by Abdelwahid El Nur in Darfur withdrew from the SRF when the rebel alliance opted for a peaceful solution instead of continuing the armed struggle. El Nur says he will only join peace negotiations after Khartoum has restored stability and security in Darfur.

By Ayo Onikoyi

Star humour merchant and Sustainable Global Peace Ambassador, Francis Agoda, famously known as I Go Dye has written to the embattled governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki who was disqualified by his party, All Progressives Congress, APC to contest in the June 22 Governorship Primary Election to embrace peace and drop further confrontations with members of the party perceived to be behind his plight. I Go Dye made a copy of the letter available to Vanguard.

“Please, drop these confrontations and work out peace with all concerned. Lastly, let me remind you that they can’t shave someone’s hair in his absence, so the verdict against you was done on a collective basis by different institutions bigger than Oshiomole. Please walk away from further confrontations, so that tomorrow your profile can still be kept intact as a technocrat,” a part of the letter reads.

“At this moment, you should understand that money doesn’t buy true loyalty. Look beyond pride and ask for reconciliation with every member of your party. You have done what you feel is right and I will advise that you should. Let go of these confrontations. Further damage is avoidable if you take some moments of silence to ignore some of the issues raised. Please, you shouldn’t listen to those who have made you go through this with their wrong advice. Please, don’t allow them to deceive you into greater confrontations by luring you to decamp to another party,” he added.

The comedian went further by chronicling his closeness to the governor and the National Chairman of the APC, highlighting his connection and commitment to the Edo State government.

The letter reads:

“Sir, I respect your knowledge and I am a man of firm belief in justice, fairness and truth. This belief made me stand with Adams Oshiomole when his mandate was stolen from him, till we found justice.

In the course of my career, I have met and performed for you and Oshiomole. I was never an appointee or beneficiary of any contract while he was there as governor, which you are aware of, I am always on my professional standard. In view of my belief in justice for all, I do solemnly request that if you know that your rights were abused, and the issues raised by the screening committee were not correct, you have a right to challenge it anywhere. I will stand by you on that note, but if you truly know within your conscience, that they are correct, please don’t bring yourself to public ridicule.

I had met you closely just three times, the first encounter was when the idea of your becoming the governor started. You told me your plans of transforming Edo State to a mini Dubai. We had a warm chat when you started consultation with different persons and groups, thereafter I met you again at the victory party hosted by Oshiomole for you at Ring Road. On that occasion, I told you I will speak out,if things went right or wrong. Not long ago, I met you in Abuja and gave you my observations about some of your projects.

READ ALSO:

As Sustainable Global Peace Ambassador, I had met with your Deputy, Philip Shaiubu, at the onset of this issue with your party and the National Chairman, which also prompted me to write Comrade Adams Oshiomole on your behalf, trying to find a path to a peaceful reconciliation.

Sir, one of the issues against you in the public domain is the non swearing-in of the 14 House of Assembly members even after the Senate and House of Representatives intervention. It’s not too late for you to do even now, so as to put your name in the Hall of Fame as a man of integrity and peace.

This issue is above the interest of the National Chairman, more stakeholders in your party were being offended in the course of this agitations, even with several peace committees being set up . You have a great mindset but many people are of the opinion that you have allowed the advice and egocentric attitude of those closer to you , some of whom are envious of your position as the governor today, becloud your reasoning.

Your close friend, Adams Oshiomole is not a saint, but he has been able to negotiate peace and loyalty of friendship with almost every one that he had issues with while forcing you against the wish of his party members years ago. But you have not won any of your aggrieved friends or party members to your side in the last two years. The gap between you, your fellow Benin brothers and kinsmen continue to expand. As a sign of respect to our Royal Majesty, the Oba of Benin, please call all your brothers together and apologise to them, it will go a long way to strengthen your prosperity and future happiness.

I stand to be corrected, none of you involved in these confrontations is right or wrong, what is missing is that sweet friendship of childhood ,that has been challenged by western civilization. All the subjects in this land belong to one royal stock and indivisible family under the leadership of Oba Ewuare II , the great Oba of Benin.

Please take time to be alone for sometime, stay away from many people and accept the truth to yourself, that it was grace that brought you this far, not knowledge or the power of any man. Appreciate those who God used to fulfill his destiny in your life.

A lot can still be attributed to your name, so, you still have a chance to achieve more infrastructural development than your predecessor, by elevating the standard. As a Global Goals Ambassador, I would love to see a road project better than Airport Road with international standards. This is part of the landmark projects that will speak in your absence, otherwise nothing might be used to celebrate your tenure.

At this point I will remind you to try and complete some of the projects that you have embarked upon with an attitude of excellence. The ongoing Ekewan Road, Amagba and Irrirhi Roads are too narrow without futuristic insight. The residents in those areas will suffer erosion in no distant time please do this so that history will not taint your legacies. Once more, please take it upon yourself to promote peace, there is no time too late to achieve lasting peace.”

I Go Dye has become popular for his public letters to Nigerian leaders. On different occasions, he has written letters to President Muhammadu Buhari, Atiku Abubakar, Emmanuel Uduaghan, to mention a few.

U.S. security, economic, and political interests demand a greater focus on countering corruption internationally. The next administration could substantially increase U.S. impact on anticorruption through taking the following measures:

Defending against the weaponization of corruption

Expose the ways foreign powers are deploying “strategic corruption” to buy influence and undermine sovereignty

Bolster vulnerable allies by encouraging transparency measures, sanctioning corrupt actors, and amplifying pro-reform narratives

Within multilateral bodies, defend anticorruption standards when they are under attack

Reinvigorate international cooperation via the Open Government Partnership (OGP) and institutionalize OGP implementation domestically

Providing politically responsive anticorruption assistance

Prioritize support to countries experiencing a window of opportunity for governance reform, including through a new Anti-Corruption Action Fund

Help societies at risk of backsliding on governance and democracy resist the pull of authoritarian kleptocracy

Establish a governance-themed public-private partnership to strengthen the business climate in strategic markets

Mainstreaming anticorruption

Direct a greater share of global health assistance to strengthening the governance of health systems

Develop and adopt a global standard for corruption risk mitigation in disaster assistance

Weigh corruption risks as part of security assistance and defense export decisions

Prioritize corruption considerations in intelligence collection, analysis, and operations

Enabling U.S. leadership

Empower a senior representative to elevate anticorruption issues among relevant agencies and to develop U.S. action plans for priority countries

Build a cadre of in-house experts who can assist U.S. embassies in addressing corruption locally

Elevate the interagency anticorruption agenda at the National Security Council

Address gaps in campaign finance and anti–money laundering legislation that undermine U.S. credibility and enable stolen assets to be harbored in the United States

Enhance global enforcement of U.S. anticorruption laws in order to level the playing field for U.S. businesses and prompt greater enforcement by other jurisdictions

Introduction

U.S. policymakers used to view international corruption largely as an issue relating to economic development. However, in recent years, they have come to recognize that it in fact affects a much wider set of U.S. interests. The United States’ main geopolitical competitors are deploying corruption as a hybrid weapon: China seeks to win influence in Africa and other parts of the world dealing with weak governance, and Russia aims to undermine its neighbors’ sovereignty. Globally, corruption-riddled governance drives migration and drug trafficking, while hindering the ability of border officials to enforce the law. Violent extremists exploit grievances around corruption to fuel recruitment and enable operations, while counterterrorism units are undermined by self-dealing. Corruption also slows progress on climate change: regulations can be bypassed through bribery, and massive energy projects are vulnerable to leakage.

Economically, 25 percent of firms worldwide expect they will need to pay a bribe in order to secure government contracts. In such markets, U.S. businesses that abide by antibribery standards are at a competitive disadvantage. Corruption also perpetuates low tax collection, which deepens dependence on foreign assistance in the Global South. The World Bank estimates that, globally, $1.5 trillion in bribes are paid each year, which amounts to ten times the value of total official development assistance.

In the political domain, corruption scandals have sparked mass protests in thirty-two countries over the past three years. This turbulence has had an effect: 10 percent of all countries experienced a corruption-fueled political change between 2013 and 2018. The overall surge in global protests, which have increased by 11.5 percent every year since 2010, indicates that governments are ignoring—or perpetuating—corruption at their own peril. For the United States, this is a particular concern because international partners that lack domestic legitimacy are less stable and less reliable.

Pandemic Implications

The coronavirus and its associated disease, COVID-19, have only heightened the centrality of anticorruption to U.S. interests overseas. In countries where graft is rampant, citizens who cannot pay bribes likely will be locked out of treatment—accelerating the virus’s spread and duration. The flood of pandemic-related spending, currently estimated at $9 trillion, is at serious risk of theft and misuse, which has already been reported in countries ranging from Slovenia to Ecuador. If corruption in domestic procurement increases over the long term, it will further disadvantage U.S. companies and lower the quality of supplies procured. On its current trajectory, corruption could cause thousands of unnecessary deaths globally—and we can expect similarly dire effects when the next crisis hits.

In addition, public anger at government malfeasance in the face of COVID-19 could topple regimes, weaken multilateral alliances, and embolden authoritarian populists. The extent to which democracies will be able to fend off the rise of authoritarianism depends in part on their ability to deliver the services and safety that their citizens seek. Rampant corruption impedes that ability to deliver and undermines government credibility, as seen in the early days of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. Bolstering democracy globally requires fighting corruption.

U.S. Posture

Historically, under both political parties, the United States has shown its capacity to lead on anticorruption. The groundbreaking passage of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in 1977 and the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010 inspired similar legislation in other countries. The United States boldly promoted strong international norms, including via the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Anti-Bribery Convention in 1999, the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) in 2005, and the OGP, a government–civil society partnership that the United States cofounded in 2011. Since 2010, the U.S. Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative has frozen more than $3.2 billion in stolen funds. Through it all, bilateral diplomacy and foreign assistance to countries around the world have tilted governance equilibria in favor of reform.

Yet U.S. leadership on anticorruption has declined in recent years. The administration of President Donald Trump has repeatedly attempted to slash foreign aid, including programs focused on anticorruption. Although Congress has held budgets steady, these attempts signal to frontline officers a shift in priorities. In 2017, Congress voted to scrap regulations implementing Dodd-Frank’s provisions on transparency in oil, gas, and mining; and the Trump administration’s 2020 replacement rule fell well below global standards. The United States has failed to prioritize anticorruption during its chairmanship of the G7. Senior U.S. engagement in anticorruption multilateral forums has faded, as reflected in the United States’ lackluster OGP plan in 2019—and has dropped off more dramatically in the case of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. The beneficiaries of this withdrawal have been China, Russia, and others who want to weaken governance norms in order to legitimize their own form of crony authoritarianism.

In addition, U.S. credibility on corruption has been damaged by domestic allegations of self-dealing at the White House and throughout the administration, by major gaps in the U.S. anti–money laundering architecture, and by attacks on independent media and the judiciary. More broadly, free-wheeling politicized rhetoric around corruption in the United States, where the term is invoked to describe bureaucracy or deride opposition politicians, distracts from actual abuses of power. When everything is “corruption,” nothing is “corruption.”

The bright spot has been the persistent efforts of career officials—at the working levels of the Department of State, the Department of Justice, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and elsewhere—who have sustained anticorruption technical assistance, visa sanctions, law enforcement, and educational exchanges. Nevertheless, these efforts may have been dampened by hesitation to press diplomatically on corruption overseas in light of the administration’s repudiation of former U.S. ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, after she and her colleagues raised hard-hitting corruption concerns with their Ukrainian counterparts.

The next administration will have the opportunity to significantly ramp up U.S. anticorruption efforts and make them proportionate to U.S. interests. This paper provides a blueprint for seizing that opportunity. It specifies how U.S. leadership could be reasserted to defend against the weaponization of corruption for geopolitical purposes, reshape anticorruption assistance to better adapt to a politically volatile world, and incorporate corruption considerations into international health, economic, security, and intelligence decisions. It concludes with recommendations for strengthening U.S. leadership on anticorruption at home, a vital part of a larger strategy. The proposals in this blueprint would all require serious political muscle and focus to be fully implemented. But they have the potential to achieve significant positive impacts across a wide range of U.S. foreign policy interests.

Defending Against the Geopolitical Weaponization of Corruption

In a growing number of countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, powers like Russia and China are exploiting and exacerbating homegrown corruption, intent on buying influence as a means of advancing their foreign policy. As they do so, these powers propagate a model of authoritarian kleptocracy, in which officials capture and then disburse state resources to a small circle of elites, whose allegiance helps keep the regime in control in spite of its lack of public accountability. This model, while disastrous domestically, becomes even more dangerous when harnessed for geopolitical ends by a malign foreign state. As the National Endowment for Democracy explains, “corrosive capital and strategic corruption differ from other forms of corruption in that they are backed, and sometimes orchestrated, by a state power for political rather than economic goals—or to advance a comprehensive authoritarian agenda with inseparable political and economic objectives.”

In this way, illicit finance can be a tool of hybrid warfare. As the State Department has acknowledged for years, “our adversaries increasingly intertwine criminal and political ends, and exercise coercive power without resorting to overt, traditional military action.” In a prescient warning about this rising threat, a 2009 open letter from a group of central and eastern European leaders to president Barack Obama reported that Russia was conducting “overt and covert means of economic warfare, ranging from energy blockades and politically motivated investments to bribery and media manipulation in order to advance its interests.” In countries such as Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Serbia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, the cycle often unfolds as follows: Russia bankrolls the candidacy of rising politicians; once in office, these chosen individuals advance pro-Russia policies, undermine oversight, and direct lucrative contracts to Russia’s preferred partners; and Russia then “reinvests” some of the profits from these contracts as bribes and campaign contributions to secure further political and economic influence. The openness of democratic societies—including Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States—can be exploited by malign actors who use political donations, lobbyists, and well-connected lawyers to worm their way into the policy process.

The countries most vulnerable to such tactics are places where corruption has become so prevalent that it reflects not a proverbial bad apple but a plagued orchard. In these settings, a foreign power has its pick of soft targets. For instance, in strategically located Kenya, officials overseeing construction of a major railway rejected several lower-cost options in favor of the most expensive bid—the Chinese proposal—which raised suspicions of kickbacks. Now the project’s massive cost overruns have produced soaring debt (to China), while the railway remains incomplete. Eventually, officials from both China and Kenya were prosecuted for corruption. Meanwhile, in Greece, China was awarded a massive contract to develop the strategic port of Piraeus—at a price apparently five times above the market value. If evidence from Malaysia is any indication, the bid may have been inflated deliberately to pay for kickbacks to Greek politicians, who simultaneously started assertively defending Chinese interests in the European Union. These interventions build a new international network of oligarchs, all beholden to China.

Whatever the operating environment, corruption is the lubricant that enables Russia and China to amass foreign influence. The U.S. government could take several steps to respond to this challenge:

Expose the threat: support independent researchers and journalists in documenting the methods of strategic corruption and publicizing results locally in targeted countries. These reports can activate domestic civil society and patriotic forces within a government intent on protecting national sovereignty against attempts at economic and political capture. An influx of U.S. support to investigative groups could accelerate the impact of a sector already leveraging cutting-edge technology and international networks to uncover grand corruption. For example, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists’ Panama Papers, published in 2016, triggered investigations in eighty-two countries. Likewise, the Sentry and C4ADS have conducted groundbreaking exposés on kleptocratic corruption in the security sectors of several African countries. Additional support for investigative journalism, especially in environments where corruption has geopolitical implications, could be transformative.

Target the corrupt: maximize the use of U.S. visa restrictions and asset freezes as powerful means of punishing and deterring corruption. In addition to sanctioning Russian and Chinese officials engaged in corruption, the United States should also target oligarchs and officials in third countries who accept Russian or Chinese bribes. Such actions show Russia and China that the United States is watching and show others that there is a price to selling off sovereignty. In countries like Georgia, where Russian-backed oligarchs are currently gaining ground, corruption-related sanctions could have a powerful impact.

Bolster vulnerable allies: increase the resiliency of partners, including those in the western Balkans and the Caucasus, whose fragile gains have been threatened by weaponized corruption. U.S. diplomats could urge countries to reduce their vulnerability to strategic corruption through campaign finance transparency, asset disclosure and conflict-of-interest rules, and procurement reform.

increase the resiliency of partners, including those in the western Balkans and the Caucasus, whose fragile gains have been threatened by weaponized corruption. U.S. diplomats could urge countries to reduce their vulnerability to strategic corruption through campaign finance transparency, asset disclosure and conflict-of-interest rules, and procurement reform. Strengthen countervailing forces: amplify locally led narratives that champion the value of sovereignty as a rationale for countering corruption. Such work should elevate the voices of domestic actors, rather than the U.S. government directly, in order to maintain credibility and increase domestic demand for reform.

In addition to supporting countries targeted by strategic corruption, the United States could multiply its impact by joining with other willing partners. For example, it could partner with the United Kingdom and Canada on their recently launched fund to protect investigative journalists who expose corruption and other wrongdoing. Within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the United States could work with other members to expand the organization’s ability to track nontraditional corruption threats, in partnership with civilian institutions. In addition, to have greater collective impact, the United States could press the European Union and Australia to pass Global Magnitsky–style visa sanction laws that include corruption (not just human rights violations) as grounds for sanctions.

Leveraging Multilateral Mechanisms for Anticorruption Impact

Another important means of pushing back against weaponized corruption and protecting democratic values is to compete in the arena of anticorruption norms. In bodies like the UNCAC Conference of the States Parties (COSP), U.S. diplomats face strong headwinds from China, Nigeria, and Russia, which are attempting new treaties on asset recovery and return that would undermine existing standards and ongoing asset recovery efforts, and from Iran, which is raising sovereignty objections over the FCPA’s broad jurisdiction. China, Pakistan, Russia, and Turkey have objected to the participation of civil society observers in the COSP, and countries such as the United Arab Emirates have been granted the privilege of hosting recent COSP meetings in spite of a track record of civil society repression. These sort of efforts to decrease UNCAC transparency and roll back standards aim to legitimize corrupt practices and distract from governance failures. Junior U.S. staffers have been working diligently to fend off such attacks but lack sufficient authority to fully rebut the opposition and shift the conversation. Senior-level public leadership from the United States would help protect vital anticorruption norms.

A future administration should also signal at the highest levels that OGP is again a policy priority. This effort must start with strengthening the institutionalization of OGP domestically, including more effectively insulating it from political transitions. Internationally, the administration could integrate OGP country priorities into senior diplomatic engagements—both to cultivate a circle of high performers and to push laggards to deliver on their OGP National Action Plans. USAID could sustain technical assistance to help countries deliver on their commitments and leverage OGP as a vehicle for exchanging lessons learned internationally. And as part of OGP’s subnational program, the United States could launch an Integrity Cities Initiative, a race-to-the-top effort for municipal leaders where they commit to more rigorous standards for open contracting and oversight. Such an initiative could give U.S. businesses attractive new venues for investment while improving local procurement and service delivery.

To further strengthen international cooperation on anticorruption, the United States should push for the reestablishment of internationally supported anticorruption commissions such as the UN-authorized International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala and the Organization of American States–backed Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras. The United States could also provide expert assistance to countries interested in developing such institutions to maximize their potential for success.

Providing Politically Responsive Anticorruption Assistance

The recent rise in protests against corruption has produced political transitions in many countries. Yet the optimism that protesters, and the international community as a whole, felt in the wake of those transitions has now been tempered by realism, as transitions from Guatemala to Tanzania fail to deliver. That can mean the United States is left with the downsides of political instability—market volatility, disrupted development, unchecked criminality—without the upside of anticorruption reform. Window-of-opportunity moments still provide the best chance for significant governance reform, but progress is far from guaranteed.

At the same time, backsliding on governance and democracy in places like Brazil, Hungary, and the Philippines is continuing at a dizzying rate. In some cases, illiberal populists claim to be advancing anticorruption, promising clean government in exchange for civil liberties. Yet in practice, authoritarians often depend on the capture of state resources to sustain their grip on power, leaving their citizens deprived of both democracy and governance. When populists co-opt the language of anticorruption to advance their own cynical agendas, they make it harder to build momentum for genuine reform campaigns in the future.

The United States must play both offense (catalyzing reform in window-of-opportunity environments) and defense (lessening the pull of authoritarian kleptocracy in places at risk of backsliding). U.S. assistance is still most likely to have an impact in environments where there is already political will for reform, so positive openings deserve the bulk of assistance, but playing defense in strategic locations is also vital—especially when done in partnership with allies.

Across both kinds of work, the common thread is a politically responsive approach to anticorruption, where resources are directed toward places at a critical juncture on governance. These are moments of elasticity, where the governance equilibrium is being contested and renegotiated. Sometimes, it is not entirely clear whether a critical juncture will be positive or negative—such as in the election of an antiestablishment candidate promising to clean up government—and the United States may be able to tilt the trajectory in a constructive direction. During these brief, precarious moments, it is vital for the United States to:

surge technical and political support to new or embattled government reformers;

help sustain civic unity and journalistic capability to bolster bottom-up pressure for reform;

encourage other diplomatic and multilateral actors to reinforce these efforts; and

support donor coordination to ensure international efforts are effective and synergistic.

Adapting U.S. assistance to a politically turbulent world would be a significant departure from the status quo. The U.S. anticorruption budget is currently modest (at $115 million annually), static (with assistance planned two years in advance), and geographically rigid (with most funds preassigned to country accounts). As a result, attempts to cobble together new assistance in response to a political opening require bureaucratic gymnastics if they happen at all. Constraints on flexible resources mean that substantial new funding is only likely for exceptionally important bilateral partners. This risks limiting the horizon of U.S. ambitions to what is administratively feasible and explicitly requested, rather than looking proactively at how the United States can maximize governance opportunities in a wide range of strategic locations.

Take the example of Malaysia, where the long-time ruling party was driven from office in 2018 in the wake of a massive corruption scandal. After the transition, governance-related U.S. assistance seems to have been limited to one USAID program, in spite of calls from leading U.S. analysts to more holistically redeploy resources to “ensure that the first democratic political transition in modern Malaysia's history succeeds.” Thin U.S. support led Anwar Ibrahim, a leading Malaysian politician, to wonder publicly why the fledging new government was not receiving more U.S. aid, especially as Malaysia sought to free itself from China’s dominance: “We are democrats, we are true to the ideals of the United States…Now having achieved some measure of success, you should support that.”

Even standard foreign assistance is not necessarily aligned with governance priorities following a political opening. In South Africa, the largest U.S. trading partner in Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa took office in early 2018 on bold promises to root out state capture. Instead of expanding anticorruption support during this historic moment, the Trump administration entirely cut assistance for the International Narcotics Control & Law Enforcement and Democracy Assistance accounts in its Fiscal Year 2019 and 2020 budget requests.

Legislation pending in Congress would help address these gaps. The Countering Russian and Other Overseas Kleptocracy (CROOK) Act (H.R.3843/S.3026) would establish an Anti-Corruption Action Fund to rapidly deploy support to countries experiencing a historic opening to tackle corruption. By providing dedicated resources for this purpose, the Fund would empower U.S. officials to act externally during the precious months following a transition, rather than spending that time in an ad hoc bureaucratic scramble for limited resources. The executive branch could support this bipartisan, budget-neutral bill and implement it vigorously, drawing on lessons from USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives. The Act, which has been endorsed by leading anticorruption advocates, could strengthen the legitimacy of FCPA enforcement and reduce pressure on U.S. companies to pay bribes overseas. Complementary actions could be taken to allocate more funds toward global accounts that can respond flexibly to places at risk of backsliding, drawing on new data tools.

Alongside the Anti-Corruption Action Fund, the U.S. government could establish a governance-themed public-private partnership (PPP). As previously discussed, U.S. companies bear the brunt of corruption in terms of lost bids and inhospitable markets and have a vested interest in reducing corruption. A new PPP would strengthen the business climate in strategic markets experiencing a window of opportunity for anticorruption reform, helping the country transition from a reliance on crony capitalists to more partnerships with clean investors.

In some places, COVID-19 may trigger substantial shifts in governance conditions, whether in a positive direction (such as by prompting reforms to procurement systems or generating new civil society coalitions) or in a negative direction (such as emboldening autocrats to further restrict civic space in the name of disaster response). Either way, the pandemic has only reinforced the need for U.S. anticorruption assistance that is better equipped for a volatile world.

Mainstreaming Anticorruption

The impact of U.S. anticorruption activities depends on its ability to break free from the democracy and law enforcement siloes and be mainstreamed across other U.S. priorities—namely, global health, economic relief, security assistance, and intelligence.

Global Health

Entrenched corruption is like a preexisting condition that worsens the severity of a pandemic. Health systems hollowed out by years of graft are ill-equipped to mobilize for an emergency. New aid flows are highly vulnerable to diversion in settings with even less transparency and accountability than usual. Government attempts to convey public health messages ring hollow when corruption has destroyed trust in the state.

Sadly, many of these lessons about corruption risk surfaced during the Ebola crisis but were not internalized. Now they are reappearing in the COVID-19 crisis, with even graver consequences. The United States dedicates a whopping $9.5 billion to global health assistance annually, yet the vast majority goes to treating specific diseases rather than strengthening the transparency, accountability, and resilience of local health systems. USAID has long acknowledged the need to address the root causes of health failures rather than just chasing symptoms, yet its 2015 guiding document on health systems strengthening contains few specifics on the topic and is now out of date. USAID recently released a list of illustrative programmatic approaches for how corruption could be dealt with as part of the pandemic response, but it is short on specifics.

This pandemic should be the impetus for the U.S. government to finally rebalance its health assistance toward a more politically sensitive, financially efficient approach. The next administration should direct a meaningful share of health assistance—perhaps 25 percent—toward health systems strengthening, in line with calls from Senate Democrats. The cost-savings generated by reforming local logistics and procurement practices and improving oversight can save lives and move aid recipients toward self-reliance. This shift in resources could be complemented by more bureaucratic cooperation between U.S. officials working on health and those working on governance.

Economic Relief

As the United States applies an anticorruption lens to its pandemic assistance, it should urge international financial institutions to do the same in their stimulus packages. Unconditional budgetary support for corrupt governments subsidizes corruption. A recent World Bank paper found that approximately 7.5 percent of international aid is subject to “elite capture,” with the funds largely being diverted to offshore bank accounts.

Risks associated with corruption are only heightened during a pandemic, when protocols are lax and oversight is weak. Recommendations for increasing corruption controls in assistance have been put forward by U4 and Transparency International, Human Rights Watch, Freedom House, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and others, but the next U.S. administration could work with partners to develop, adopt, and secure international support for a global standard on corruption risk mitigation in disaster assistance. Such a standard could consolidate good practices and help donors prioritize the kinds of reforms they need to make, while retaining context-specific flexibility.

Security Assistance

Countries with endemic corruption lack domestic legitimacy and therefore are inherently unstable partners. Providing weapons, defense articles, and training to these countries poses serious risks—not just of wasting taxpayer dollars but also of endangering U.S. security (for example, if the weapons are sold on the black market and later used against the United States).

As detailed elsewhere, the United States can mitigate these threats by instituting mandatory corruption risk assessments, conducted by independent experts, akin to those required by the Leahy Law. Problems discovered in these assessments could be addressed through assistance to improve military budgeting, contracting, logistics, and personnel systems—work that deserves at least 1 percent of total U.S. security assistance for a given country, as referenced in the draft 2019 State Authorization bill. Integrating anticorruption practices into defense institution building in this manner would help avoid situations such as that encountered by Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi in 2015: as he prepared to take on the self-proclaimed Islamic State, he “discovered 50,000 ghost soldiers on the government payroll costing Iraqis $380 million a year.”

Yet capacity building is only as good as the political will behind it. Thus, a future administration should use the “carrot” of security assistance to incentivize the kind of anticorruption reforms needed for that assistance to be effective. In particular, the United States could condition the provision of train-and-equip support and arms exports on governments undertaking security governance reforms, including greater transparency in military budgets, whistleblower protections, and oversight of the security sector by parliaments and civil society. This sort of conditionality, which has been recommended by counterterrorism experts, could build on lessons from the U.S.-Africa Security Governance Initiative. Such an approach may require withstanding pressure from the defense industry, especially during an economic downturn, in order to ensure that U.S. assistance effectively advances joint security goals rather than enriches criminal entities.

Intelligence

In some instances, “governing is not the government’s objective.” Instead, governing is a front for criminal activity in which state coffers are a key source of private revenue for leaders and their elite supporters. When intelligence gaps fail to expose these cases of state capture, U.S. diplomats and those making assistance decisions are flying blind. In the absence of contrary information, these officials will likely assume that public servants are genuinely committed to serving the public rather than their own personal interests. This can lead the United States to inadvertently enable corruption through its assistance, diplomatic interactions, or rhetorical support, thereby undermining U.S. interests and increasing public hostility toward America. Furthermore, a lack of attention from the intelligence community toward corruption issues, and the popular grievances associated with it, can lead to blind spots in U.S. political analysis, as occurred with the Arab Spring in 2011.

While some improvements have been made, U.S. officials can do more to elevate corruption in the National Intelligence Priorities Framework and reflect that prioritization in collection, analysis, and operations. This includes incorporating corruption information into profiles of foreign officials and mapping foreign “networks of corruption,” as Congress has required in the last three appropriations bills.

The National Security Council should also assist with overcoming a major interagency gap whereby intelligence agencies rarely use their tools to vet prospective recipients of USAID funding, while USAID often makes decisions on aid allocation without consulting classified information on foreign counterparts. This gap could be overcome by increasing intelligence vetting of assistance recipients over a certain monetary threshold. Interagency consensus should also be reached before funds from the intelligence community are provided directly to foreign officials, with particular scrutiny in highly corrupt settings. These steps would reduce the risk that the United States will again be implicated, as in Afghanistan, in fueling corruption while simultaneously attempting to fight it.

Enabling U.S. Leadership

The ability of the United States to lead on anticorruption internationally depends on the extent to which it gets its own house in order, in terms of both internal organization and domestic policy.

Bureaucratic Innovation

To give anticorruption the prominence it deserves in U.S. foreign policy, internal structures would need to be updated. Three components are essential: increased prioritization of the issue, capability to support a more robust scope of work, and enhanced coordination of the many bureaus and agencies with anticorruption equities.

Prioritization . To begin with, the next administration should rapidly fill existing senior-level positions, including the relevant under secretary role at the State Department, which still lacks a confirmed appointment. More ambitiously, a future administration could designate a special representative or senior adviser on anticorruption, as the United Kingdom established in 2004. Ideally a former ambassador, this individual and their staff could rally high-level attention and drive collaboration across bureaus and agencies. In addition, the secretary of state could ask regional bureaus to each identify a deputy assistant secretary to oversee the development of country-level anticorruption strategies, building off previous efforts in the Europe bureau. Together, these senior champions would signal to the diplomatic corps that the administration has their back and realizes that, ultimately, you cannot fight kleptocracy without upsetting kleptocrats. In the course of doing so, diplomats may lose some access to counterparts—normally a prized currency—but that should be expected and not seen as a demerit. This new norm can be reinforced through messages from senior leadership and performance metrics, as well as through incorporating anticorruption modules into pre-deployment training for ambassadors and USAID mission directors. The special representative could even convene regional “ambassador circles,” in which chiefs of mission can compare notes and share lessons on elevating governance and democracy issues at their posts. At the country level, ambassadors could host private quarterly anticorruption advisory meetings involving civil society and investigative journalists.

Staffing on anticorruption across the U.S. government would need to be scaled up to execute a more ambitious agenda. In particular, the State Department currently lacks a centralized team of subject matter experts with the mandate and resources to assist embassies in strengthening their anticorruption efforts. In the future, a cadre of experts from across the State Department and USAID could serve as in-house consultants who deploy to conduct anticorruption assessments, support embassy strategy development, and assist with implementation—especially for bilateral priority countries. These officers would engage proactively with designated anticorruption points of contact at each embassy.

These officers would engage proactively with designated anticorruption points of contact at each embassy. Coordination. Although the 2015 establishment of a Working Group on Anti-Corruption at the State Department was a sign of progress, cross-bureau coordination is frequently still ad hoc. One remedy would be for the anticorruption special representative to start convening these working group gatherings with a focused agenda. In addition, to achieve the mainstreaming goals referenced above and respond to windows of opportunity in strategic locations, the national security adviser should identify a senior White House official with the mandate and bandwidth to drive this agenda forward. This individual could sit in either the international economics or democracy directorates, as long as they would be on equal footing with regional senior directors and be able to raise key issues at deputies’ meetings. Their staff could facilitate development of whole-of-government approaches to priority countries—addressing a gap named in a recent Congressional Research Service report. The National Security Council could formalize commitments via a Presidential Policy Directive and coordinate regular briefings with the Hill and with the advocacy community, which would help sustain this agenda.

Leading by Example

U.S. credibility on anticorruption falters when counterparts point to the rampant opportunities for self-enrichment in the U.S. financial and political systems. Some of these gaps relate to the lack of transparency and influence of foreign contributors in the U.S. campaign finance system. Others involve the protection of inspectors general and ethics considerations outlined in the For the People Act of 2019 (H.R.1). The next administration would do well to address these concerns, as well as robustly implement Dodd-Frank’s requirements on transparency in oil and mining payments.

An even greater credibility problem stems from the role of the United States in directly enabling foreign corruption. The level of financial secrecy in the United States is on par with the Cayman Islands, allowing kleptocrats, terrorists, and criminals to stash their funds stateside with relative ease. To start with, the next administration could push forward pending congressional legislation that would curb the formation of anonymous shell companies, as done by Argentina, Nigeria, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, and others. The next step would be to close loopholes that exempt lawyers, accountants, and real estate agents from the know-your-customer regulations applied to banks. The United States can also deploy powerful financial tools, such as the USA PATRIOT Act, to isolate corrupt officials or jurisdictions.

Finally, the United States could significantly deter foreign corruption by enforcing U.S. anticorruption laws even more vigorously. Given the broad jurisdiction of the FCPA, the majority of large enforcement actions to date have actually been against foreign-registered companies. The United States certainly should continue encouraging other countries to implement their FCPA equivalents, but success depends on the political will of foreign actors. Unilaterally, the U.S. government could expand the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Justice units that handle FCPA and asset recovery cases, which would help U.S. businesses compete internationally and potentially shame other countries into enforcing their own laws. Shifts in this direction should be taken in a transparent and equitable manner, objectively targeting the biggest offenders regardless of nationality. Expanded cooperation with the Global Anti-Corruption Consortium could funnel tips from civil society into law enforcement channels (in cases where the United States has extraterritorial jurisdiction), increasing the prospects that corrupt actors will face legal accountability.

Conclusion

The next administration has an opening to advance the anticorruption agenda at a time of profound importance for global health, politics, economics, and security. Although corruption poses grave risks and has been appropriated for geopolitical ends by foreign competitors, a new wave of civic mobilization presents opportunities. Dynamic U.S. assistance could amplify the voices of reformers and increase their effectiveness during critical junctures. With a whole-of-government approach that mainstreams and elevates anticorruption across foreign policy, and domestic reforms that bolster U.S. credibility, the next administration could play a transformative role in curbing corruption and advancing U.S. interests.

Occurring in the midst of a global pandemic, the protests have exposed the wide reach of systemic racism in many Western democratic societies, particularly within policing and criminal justice institutions. More broadly, the protests have revealed that deep trust deficits exist between Black communities and their governments. If Western democracies wish to maintain some credibility as lead advocates for human rights and democratic governance, they must seek to fully understand and address the role that racism plays in undermining the legitimacy of their institutions.

The Soft Underbelly of Democracy

The global narrative on the use of police violence against Black people rightly centers around the problem in the United States: the country’s incarceration rate is the highest in the world, Black people make up one-third of the entire prison population but only 12 percent of the total population, and the recent murder of George Floyd has accentuated a history of brutal killings of Black people. Moreover, Floyd’s death finally seems to have moved public opinion. In a recent survey by the Pew Research Center, two-thirds of Americans now express support for the Black Lives Matter movement.

Yet focusing exclusively on the United States neglects the extent to which systemic racism deeply permeates law enforcement and criminal justice in other highly developed Western democratic countries. A study in Canada on fatal police encounters from 2000 to 2017 found that Black people made up nearly 37 percent of the victims in Toronto, even though they comprised only 8 percent of the population. In Australia, Black Lives Matter solidarity protests sparked protests against the police killings of indigenous Australians, who are also grossly overrepresented in Australia’s prisons relative to their small population size. And like in the United States, there is rarely any accountability for police brutality; in the United Kingdom, for example, there has not been a successful prosecution for a death in police custody in over fifty years.

Racial profiling of Black people is also widespread, even in countries often held up as models of democratic governance by the international community. For example, for the last three years, Freedom House has rated Finland as one of the freest countries in the world, earning a perfect score in the Freedom in the World Index. However, according to the “Being Black in the EU” survey, administered by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights across all twenty-eight EU member states in 2018, Finland recorded the highest rates of race-based harassment and violence. Participants in a separate three-year study of racial profiling in Finland described in detail their experiences of being stopped in public spaces predominantly because of their race or ethnicity—including in railway and metro stations, cars, shops and parks, and restaurants and bars and on the way to work and school. The study notes the variety of state security actors engaged in profiling, including the police, border guards, and customs officers, as well as private security guards, bouncers, and salespeople. Such pervasive levels of harassment and surveillance of Black people in many Western democracies stand in sharp contrast to the accolades often given to these “free” societies.

In the United States, racial bias in policing and the violence it can generate have eroded the state’s relationship with Black communities, diminishing trust and lowering expectations for what residents of a democratic country should expect from their government. There are signs that similar trends are also occurring in other Western democracies, where Black people who experience policy brutality or other kinds of racial discrimination feel they have no recourse. According to the “Being Black in the EU” survey, a majority of victims of racist physical attacks by police officers did not report the most recent incident because they felt doing so would not change anything or because they did not trust or were afraid of the police. Because of a lack of trust, Europeans of African descent are also not reporting incidents of discrimination, such as being unable to obtain access to employment or housing. According to the survey, only 14 percent of victims of race-based harassment reported their experiences to the police, human rights institutions, or any other authority, despite knowing about such institutions and the relevant antidiscrimination laws.

The Data Problem

The collection of data related to racial issues is a serious shortcoming in numerous Western democracies. The European Union’s Racial Equality Directive of 2000 prohibits discrimination based on racial and ethnic origin in its member states, but a dearth of official data make it difficult to monitor the implementation of antidiscrimination laws. In Germany, ignoring racial issues has been a conscious choice, borne from a fear of the ways that Nazis used race science to try to prove the superiority of white people. Discussion of race has been so intimately tied up with World War II atrocities that Germany and many other EU member states do not collect official statistics on race or ethnicity. France stripped the term “race” from all of its laws in 2013 and imposes criminal penalties on the use of the concept in employment—though it does have strong policies to combat hate speech and discrimination. In other countries such as Denmark, there is little political support to collect racial or ethnic data because of the belief that discrimination is not a problem there. European civil society organizations informally collect and monitor data related to discrimination, harassment, and violence against minority communities. But the limited amount of available data only provides a snapshot of potential discrimination patterns.

The lack of racial demographic data limits governments’ ability to accurately identify and prevent patterns of race-based discrimination, as well as to address the social, public health, and economic needs of certain communities that may be deeply impacted by structural racism. It ensures, in fact, that structural racism goes unseen. And the damaging effects of this failure are evidenced by, for example, the higher coronavirus infection and death rates among Black populations. Canada, which has not been gathering racial demographic data on coronavirus infections, is now facing increasing pressure to change its color-blind data collection policy, which health officials say disadvantage minority communities likely to be more directly impacted. Brazil’s government only began to collect coronavirus-related data by race in late April, well after the Ministry of Health flagged high death rates among Afro-Brazilians. As in the United States, structural racism in employment, healthcare, and housing have dramatically influenced the virus’s impact on Brazil’s Black communities.

Measuring How Democracies Perform in Addressing Racism

The limited data on racial discrimination and systemic racism in many Western democracies is one reason that highly regarded global indices, such as the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Global Democracy Index and Freedom House’s Freedom in the World report, lack indicators or do not track data on institutional racism. As a result, this measure of democratic governance is overlooked and Western democracies are credited with high scores that do not account for key nuances in their treatment of racial minorities. Global democracy supporters must do more to measure and assess the impacts of systemic racism when evaluating the performance of democracies.

Germany is now taking steps to more holistically understand the experiences of its Black population, estimated to be nearly 1 million people. Its Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency launched a #AFROZENSUS survey this year to collect basic demographic data as well as data on people’s experiences with discrimination. If the government can draw on this data to improve its responsiveness to the distinct challenges facing minority communities, Germany may be able to demonstrate that with appropriate protections, the government can be trusted to use data in the service of human rights and more inclusive governance.

The High Stakes of Leaving Racism Unseen

The breadth and depth of global protests have demonstrated that governments can no longer stay silent on systemic racism. Democracies will continue to lose credibility and legitimacy in the eyes of an increasing number of citizens if they fail to take concrete action to eliminate state violence against racial minorities and to hold those that perpetrate it accountable. In a democracy, the state should be held to a higher standard.

The rise of far-right political movements in many Western democracies has also highlighted the risks of staying silent. Racialized politics have increasingly gained currency in many countries through powerful actors who have weaponized it for political purposes. But these actors are only successful because the racial discourse is grounded in unconscious racist bias or explicit racist beliefs that still exist in democratic societies, institutions, and culture. Racism is a breeding ground for fascism, oppression, and the abuse of human rights. To be credible and effective advocates for global democracy, Western democracies should work urgently to repair their social compacts with minority communities and address racism within their institutions.","Occurring in the midst of a global pandemic, the protests have exposed the wide reach of systemic racism in many Western democratic societies, particularly within policing and criminal justice institutions.

Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks to the Security Council open video-teleconference on the maintenance of international peace and security: implications of COVID-19, in New York today:

I thank the German Presidency for convening this important discussion. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to profoundly affect peace and security across the globe. The consequences can be seen even in a number of countries traditionally seen as “stable”. But, the impacts are particularly apparent in countries already experiencing conflict or emerging from it — and may soon engulf others.

The risks are diverse. Tensions are rising as a result of the severe socioeconomic fallout of the crisis. Trust in public institutions is being eroded further in places where people perceive that authorities have not addressed the pandemic effectively or have not been transparent about its impact. As pre‑existing grievances and vulnerabilities become more accentuated and entrenched, the potential for instability and violence only grows.

The pandemic is exacerbating gender inequalities, as women make up the vast majority of the sectors most affected. There has been an alarming spike in gender-based and domestic violence, and it is increasingly difficult for victims to report abuse, seek shelter and access justice.

In some countries, fragile peace processes could be derailed by the crisis, especially if the international community is distracted. In Darfur, for example, the pandemic and other challenges have led to the repeated extension of the deadline for the completion of the Juba peace process.

In other places, conflict actors — including terrorist and violent extremist groups — see the uncertainty created by the pandemic as a tactical advantage. In Somalia, Al-Shabaab continues to launch frequent attacks, with no noticeable impact of COVID-19 on its operational tempo. Rather, there is a risk that Al‑Shabaab could increase such violence while security forces focus, by necessity, on the pandemic.

Many countries have had to consider how to move ahead with elections slated for 2020 while trying to manage the health crisis. Since March of this year, 18 elections or referenda have been held since the onset of the pandemic, 24 have been postponed and the initial dates for 39 elections have been maintained to date. In the Central African Republic, there are tensions due to attempts to use the pandemic as a pretext to postpone the holding of elections planned for the end of the year.

Decisions on postponing or indeed proceeding with elections raise complex legal, political and public health challenges. Difficult as they are, such decisions are best made on the basis of broad consultations with all stakeholders, to avoid fuelling political tensions or undermining legitimacy.

COVID-19 has also made diplomacy more challenging. Mediation can be a very personal endeavour — an almost-tactile reading of a person or a room. With movement restrictions limiting such contacts, and with online discussions often the only alternative, it can be harder to establish the trust and nurture the willingness to compromise that are at the heart of preventive diplomacy.

The pandemic also highlights the risks of bioterrorist attacks and has already shown some of the ways in which preparedness might fall short if a disease were to be deliberately manipulated to be more virulent, or intentionally released in multiple places at once. So, as we consider how to improve our response to future disease threats, we should also devote serious attention to preventing the deliberate use of diseases as weapons.

The Biological Weapons Convention codifies a strong and long‑standing norm against the abhorrent use of disease as a weapon, and now has 183 States parties. I urge the 14 States that have not yet joined the Convention to do so without any further delay. We also need to strengthen the Convention, which lacks an oversight institution and contains no verification provisions, by enhancing its role as a forum for the consideration of preventative measures, robust response capacities and effective countermeasures.

Fortunately, the best counter to biological weapons is effective action against naturally occurring diseases. Strong public and veterinary health systems are not only an essential tool against COVID-19, but also an effective deterrent against the development of biological weapons. All of these issues must be on the agenda next year at the Convention’s Review Conference.

At the moment, the Secretary-General’s Mechanism, established by the General Assembly and endorsed by the Security Council, is the only instrument that provides a framework for an investigation of alleged use of biological weapons. Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) and its follow-ups remain a key component of the international non-proliferation architecture and have provided an overarching framework to prevent the nightmare scenario of bioterrorism.

Given the speed at which pathogens spread in an interconnected world, we must ensure that all countries have resilient and appropriate capacities to respond quickly and robustly to any potential global and deliberate biological event.

I am also concerned that the pandemic is triggering or exacerbating human rights challenges. My Call to Action for Human Rights is more relevant than ever and requires robust follow-up.

We have seen the excessive use of force to police lockdowns, curfews and other confinement measures. There are growing manifestations of authoritarianism, including limits on the media, civic space and freedom of expression. Populists, nationalists and others who were already seeking to roll back human rights are finding in the pandemic a pretext for repressive measures unrelated to the disease.

Meanwhile, stigma and hate speech are on the rise. And an epidemic of misinformation online has run rampant. To help counter the spread of untruthful and harmful information, the United Nations has launched the “Verified” initiative, to increase the volume and reach of trusted, accurate information surrounding the crisis.

Yet another risk for the long term is the shifting of resources away from gender‑equality initiatives, education and other economic sectors. Indeed, this could have intergenerational impacts, including on women’s rights and participation in political and peace processes.

And most immediately, humanitarian needs have surged. More than 1 billion children are out of school. More than 135 million people could be on the brink of starvation by the end of this year. Routine immunization services are being disrupted on an unprecedented scale, raising the likelihood of major outbreaks of diseases like measles and polio.

The already acute vulnerability of refugees and internally displaced persons has grown more pronounced — particularly those living in confined and congested camps and detention facilities. And health-care workers and humanitarian personnel have themselves been targeted for unconscionable attacks. The health pandemic has fast become a protection crisis. These wide-ranging risks require an urgent and united response, including from the Security Council.

One hundred eighty Member States plus one non-member observer State have endorsed my call for a global ceasefire, as have more than 20 armed movements and other entities, and more than 800 civil society organizations. The call yielded some positive results, but these have since expired or in some cases broken down. The Council has an important role to bring its voice and influence to bear on these situations, and I welcome your support, expressed in the resolution adopted yesterday.

Our peacekeeping operations and special political missions continue to bring hope and stability to all corners of the world, supporting national authorities and vulnerable communities, including by ensuring that missions themselves are not a vector of contagion. We have put in place a number of medical and other support measures to mitigate the spread of the virus within our missions and to protect our personnel. We have also adapted the rotations of our uniformed personnel, for which we are grateful to troop- and police-contributing countries.

We are also adapting our tools to the new circumstances. In Colombia and Libya, for example, we have been able to maintain a good level of engagement with the parties and other actors using virtual and other means.

The Office of the Special Envoy for Yemen carried out a first-of-its-kind large-scale virtual dialogue with more than 500 Yemenis — 30 to 35 per cent of whom were women — on the opportunities and challenges for peace in the country. And through a Global Humanitarian Response Plan, we are addressing the most urgent health and humanitarian needs in 63 countries — although the plan is just 21 per cent funded and much more is needed.

Since the beginning of the crisis, the United Nations family has mounted a comprehensive response — providing medical and material support on the ground, advocating for a global economic and financial rescue package, and offering policy analysis across the key dimensions of the emergency.

The pandemic has brought us all to a wide-ranging reckoning. Collective security and our shared well-being are under assault on many fronts, led by a relentless disease and abetted by global fragilities. Our challenge is to save lives today while buttressing the pillars of security for tomorrow. I remain ready to support the Security Council in any way possible as this body carries out its essential part of the response.

This post is authored by Nicole Smith, a Senior Global Communications Officer for the International Rescue Committee, and MA candidate in Global Affairs at New York University.

The United Nations recently announced that almost 80 million people were forcibly displaced around the world last year due to war, conflict, or persecution. As COVID-19 continues to spread across borders and calls for a global ceasefire go unheeded, there is an urgent need not only for peace, but to build back better. Returning to normal after a crisis does not work for more than half the world’s population, if ‘normal’ includes discrimination against women, and if planning for recovery excludes them. At the same time, as the pandemic has exacerbated threats to peace and security around the world, there is an urgent need to ensure that progress towards building inclusive and sustainable peace is not lost. This requires women’s meaningful participation. A recent study by masters’ students at New York University’s Center for Global Affairs in partnership with the Global Network of Women Peacebuilders, explored the effectiveness of gender provisions in peace agreements in terms of their influence on women’s political and economic participation after conflict. The findings take on new urgency as countries around the world look for ways to strengthen their societies during a global pandemic, a crisis that invokes aspects of social disruption associated with conflict.

We know that peace negotiations typically do not include women (they average about 10 percent of negotiators), but when women are at the table, the resulting agreements are more likely to include gender provisions. Once these agreements are finalized, what are the outcomes for women years later? To learn more, the researchers used a database created by Monash University Professors Jacqui True and Yolanda Riveros-Morales, which catalogued 98 peace accords from 55 countries signed between 2000 and 2016. The dataset is designed to identify whether the peace agreements contain gender provisions: references in the agreements that acknowledge the gendered experiences of conflict and pertain to post-conflict issues and transitional justice, the participation of women, violence against women, women’s economic empowerment and development, and international women-specific legal or human rights mechanisms.

The first quantitative analysis found that in 37.4 percent of cases where women participated in peace negotiations, gender provisions were included in the final agreement. This finding is in line with previous research confirming that women matter at the negotiating table. The finding does, however, raise questions about the effectiveness of women’s participation. This is in line with other studies that demonstrate that the ways in which women are included matter for the quality of their participation. For example, if women are included in a tokenistic manner, are disconnected from feminist networks, or not in touch with support systems that could supply useful analysis, their participation may be more of a symbolic presence than one that leads to lasting influence.

In looking at the longer-term political participation for women in post-conflict countries, the researchers found that quotas are better predictors of improved outcomes than gender provisions. Specifically, quotas predict a 9.2 percent increase in women’s political representation. In most post-conflict contexts, women use each successive election to increase their share of parliamentary seats. In assessing the different types of quotas and which are most effective for women, it was not surprising that reserved seats are most likely to guarantee female representation in parliament. However, just as women simply being at the table during peace negotiations does not necessarily lead to better outcomes for them, having women within parliament, particularly when seats are reserved to be filled by a ruling party, does not ensure effective representation of gender equality concerns.

In analyzing gender-sensitive provisions specific to women’s economic outcomes, the researchers found that women’s labor force participation and their share of gross national income do not improve five years post-conflict. Peace agreements rarely address women’s livelihoods, much less the structural reforms necessary to create truly inclusive economies. Analysis of 660 peace agreements by Edinburgh Law School Professor Christine Bell found that only 36 included economic provisions specifically mentioning women. This makes systematic and meaningful inclusion of women in decision-making on post-conflict economic recovery less likely. Yet, inclusive recovery is of paramount importance to create more sustainable systems after a conflict or crisis–such as COVID-19.

Fragile economies, weak governance, and high levels of corruption, particularly in extractives-based economies, that afflict most post-conflict countries, make recovery difficult for everyone, but women face particular challenges moving beyond subsistence agrarian livelihood systems in these situations. They may be denied the right to land and other property or they may be running households on their own (female household headship tends to increase in post-conflict situations). Interestingly, the research found that gender quotas are associated with better outcomes in terms of labor force participation than other gender provisions in peace agreements. However, they do not make up for the lack of dedicated provisions on economic inclusion.

While gender-sensitive agreements had disappointingly little effect on women’s post-conflict economic prospects, the inclusion of women in peace processes consistently predicted better economic outcomes for women five years after the signature of the agreement, compared to when women were not involved. The research also addressed the consistent failure of international funding to support women’s economic empowerment as a principal target of aid funding. Using OECD DAC data, the researchers found that in Burundi, Sierra Leone, and Nepal such funding was less than 2 percent of total aid and primarily went to project-based interventions with limited prospects for long-term income security (candle-making, basket-weaving, sewing etc.).

For women to have the opportunity to reach their full potential, women’s economic empowerment in post-conflict countries must be a bigger priority for governments and donors. Despite the growing recognition of the humanitarian-peace-development nexus, economic empowerment continues to be perceived as a development rather than a peacebuilding issue. It is crucial to address it as a priority during peace negotiations and in the immediate aftermath of the conflict.

Secondly, there remains a strong need to guarantee women’s sustained meaningful participation in the implementation of peace agreements, including through their formal inclusion across the range of implementation mechanisms established in support of the agreement. The United Nations and Member States should put pressure on governments that have signed peace agreements to ensure full and swift implementation.

The time is now to disrupt the status quo. Not only is the full and meaningful participation of women morally the right thing to do, but it has never been more necessary with record-numbers of displaced people, longer-lasting conflicts, and economies devastated by COVID-19.","View all newsletters >The first quantitative analysis found that in 37.4 percent of cases where women participated in peace negotiations, gender provisions were included in the final agreement.
In looking at the longer-term political participation for women in post-conflict countries, the researchers found that quotas are better predictors of improved outcomes than gender provisions.

Addressing rights violations as warning signs of conflict is even more urgent in the COVID-19 era, the United Nations senior human rights official told the Security Council in a 7 July videoconference meeting*, as she spotlighted the role peacekeepers can play in monitoring virus-related stigma, hate speech and the impact of containment measures on vulnerable groups.

Michelle Bachelet, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, noted the impact of COVID-19 on health, societies, economies and development gains around the globe, welcoming the 15-member Council’s recent adoption of a resolution calling for a global ceasefire amid the pandemic (see Press Release SC/14238 of 1 July). She also underlined the importance of human rights components in 12 of the organ’s peace operations, stressing that such work brings missions closer to the people they serve and helps Governments advance inclusive development, the rule of law and peace.

Pointing out that protecting human rights also prevents future conflicts by addressing the grievances that underpin them, she said COVID-19 has made tackling such drivers of instability even more critical. It is crucial to assess the effectiveness and enforcement of virus containment measures, monitor increases in stigmatization and address the pandemic’s impact on marginalized groups. The importance of the Secretary-General’s Call to Action for Human Rights cannot be overemphasized, as its “Agenda for Protection” helps ensure that human rights serve as a shared — and effective — basis for the United Nations’ work.

Around the globe, she said, the human rights components of peace operations support good offices functions and help host countries pursue political and peace processes. In Afghanistan, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA)’s reporting on civilian protection helped build the Mission’s credibility as an impartial interlocutor and opened doors to the conflict parties. In the Central African Republic, human rights staff work to counter hate speech and support the country’s innovative Special Criminal Court. Meanwhile, in Iraq, their monitoring efforts contributed to the significant restraint shown by security forces during recent protests.

Human rights staff also assist in strengthening national capacity and building up rule of law institutions, she continued. In Haiti and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, United Nations police and human rights staff have worked with national authorities to strengthen the inspector general, in order to better address cases of human rights violations. Such work also underpins the United Nations’ conflict prevention strategy by helping to curb intercommunal violence.

Drawing attention to the Organization’s human rights due diligence policy on support provided to non-United Nations security forces, she noted that the Council is increasingly mandating regional engagements to counter security threats. Alongside the African Union, her office developed a compliance framework comprising a package of prevention, mitigation, response and remedial measures to reinforce the protection of civilians. It has supported the Group of Five (G5) for Sahel joint force — tasked with combating terrorism — since 2018, she said, noting that human rights measures are crucial to inspiring confidence in the communities the force serves.

“There is no better guarantee for prevention than for Member States to meet their human rights responsibilities,” she said. Conversely, unresolved human rights issues and underfinanced implementation of human rights recommendations result in a fragile — and ultimately untenable — peace, as well as prolonged United Nations engagement. In that context, she called for redoubled investment in structures that identify and address grievances “before they fester into violence”, as well as adequate mandate financing and robust political support.

Dismas Kitenge Senga, President of the non-governmental organization Groupe LOTUS and Honorary Vice-President of the International Federation for Human Rights, briefed the Council from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He recalled that the peaceful transfer of power to President Félix Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo in 2019 gave rise to new hope, as well as to an opening of the country’s political space. “But to this day, the behaviour of the security forces is characterized by the practices of the previous Government,” he said.

In State-controlled areas, he said, security and defence forces face unity-of-command challenges, dysfunction, a lack of resources and an inability to effectively defend territory against military forces from neighbouring countries. Describing grave atrocity crimes committed by some armed groups, he said that, in such a fragile context, human rights violations require urgent attention. Citing such challenges as impunity and difficulties in implementing necessary reforms, he described instances of arrests and illegal detentions, torture and inhumane and degrading treatment by the security forces. Around 50 human rights defenders have been arrested since a state of emergency was declared during the pandemic.

He said the fight against impunity and corruption — a priority of President Tshisekedi’s five-year plan — is also impeded by a lack of clear and coherent policy. “The economic and social rights of the population, which are already difficult to put into practice, have been made even more fragile by COVID-19,” he said, noting the downward revision of the national budget as well as infringements on the right to work, access health care and pursue education.

As part of its mandate, he said, the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office — a component of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) — monitors human rights violations committed throughout the country. It also supports partners in Government and civil society as they conduct promotion and protection efforts, while helping to protect human rights defenders and advising on efforts to fight impunity. Despite facing resource challenges and a series of office closures, the Joint Human Rights Office continues to support non-governmental organizations as they seek to bring human rights violators to justice.

Noting that COVID-19 has affected the work of such non-governmental groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, he said information collection, training and advocacy have been declining as a result of resource constraints and travel restrictions. MONUSCO’s human rights component continues to provide logistical support, interface with the Government and — most importantly — raise awareness about fundamental human rights in the context of the coronavirus. He also described MONUSCO’s support to him, personally, when his life was threatened because of his human rights work.

Such support from MONUSCO have helped Congolese communities better understand the essential nature of human rights, he continued. Listing several recommendations, he called for more support for the good offices work of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General; increasing the resources and presence of the Joint Human Rights Unit across the country; improving the professionalization of military and police officers through more human rights training; continued follow-up with the Government on protection of civilians; support to victims of human rights violations; and support for local elections and democratic reforms.

As Council members delivered remarks, many supported the existing human rights components of peace operations, with some calling for their universalization among all mandates. Several speakers warned against the inclusion of human rights as a “token add-on” lacking real impact, advocating instead for their integration into force generation, mission planning, management and oversight. Some struck a different tone, voicing concern over the Council’s continued politicization of human rights and demanding that the principle be applied universally and without bias or selectivity.

Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Minister for Defence of Germany and Council President for July, spoke in her national capacity, noting that the task of universalizing human rights is far from complete and will remain so as long as it continues to be questioned — even within the United Nations. “As a defence minister, let me be very clear — human rights have to be a first concern in peace operations,” she said, stressing that they must never be put aside for the sake of operational effectiveness. The Council has a special obligation, in conjunction with States, to guarantee the protection of human rights in its peace operations. Blue helmets must be trained in human rights even before deployment and serve as role models. In that vein, Germany will make human rights a mandatory element of training it provides to the United Nations. It also plans to hold a high-level conference on peacekeeping, human rights and the protection of civilians.

The representative of France said achieving sustainable peace requires parallel progress on development, security and human rights. Human rights must be an integral part of the strategies spearheaded by Special Representatives or Special Envoys. Underlining the importance of inclusive dialogue among all segments of society, he commended the human rights components of peace operations for their monitoring or “early warning” work, their support to national authorities and their integration into local communities. He also praised their support for victims, noting that France contributes to reparations through the Global Fund for Survivors. Missions should be given the skills, resources and budgets to carry out such crucial work, and they must adhere to their own zero-tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse.

The Dominican Republic’s delegate emphasized that there can be neither peace nor progress in societies where human rights are not protected. Citing the link between human rights, accountability and reconciliation as key to eradicating conflict, she said child and women protection advisers in peace operations play critical roles and must be given the funds and seniority needed to carry out their work. She joined others in spotlighting the Secretary-General’s 2018 Action for Peacekeeping initiative and the Declaration of Shared Commitments arising from it, noting that more than 150 countries have vowed to build on their commitments. She went on to underline the role of training — which must be tailored to specific peace operations — and to stress that human rights principles must prevail amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The representative of Belgium said human rights are not an add-on for United Nations peace missions, but rather core business. In Afghanistan, UNAMA’s human rights component contributed to building confidence between conflict parties and conditions for inclusive intra-Afghan negotiations. Spotlighting the consolidation of human rights components into mandates and resource negotiations – as well as their translation into operational “human rights readiness” for military personnel — he said training blue helmets before and during deployment is essential. The European Union has extensive human rights components in civilian and military missions. Noting that the African Union also integrates human rights, he encouraged the G5 Sahel joint force to strengthen the implementation of the Human Rights Compliance Framework supported by the Office of the High Commissioner.

The representative of the United States, pointing out that COVID-19 has required missions to reprioritize their mandates, expressed support for the human rights divisions, joint protection teams and mixed-gender engagement teams deployed to various peace operations. While some Council members attempt to cut their funding, the United States will continue to advocate for their retention. Welcoming the work of human rights units in South Sudan, Mali and the Central African Republic in particular, she joined other speakers in spotlighting the United Nations Human Rights Due Diligence Policy. She also stressed the need to increase women’s meaningful participation in peacekeeping, noting that they can make peace operations with civilian protection mandates more successful, and said there is still room for greater integration among civilian and military mission components.

Estonia’s delegate underscored the need for cooperation between human rights officers and military and police staff, as well as strong mission leadership. Human rights should be part of the mission management at the highest level, he said, joining other speakers in calling for sufficient, practical predeployment training. In the context of COVID-19, human rights training and knowledge helps missions provide better support to countries in dealing with the pandemic, he added.

South Africa’s representative said the inclusion of human rights elements in mission mandates reflects the Council’s general acceptance of the principle’s relevance to peace and security. However, it has not escaped the organ’s political dynamics and continues to be applied selectively. While some members advocate for human rights components in peace operations, he voiced regret that such enthusiasm is conspicuously absent from other missions, such as the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). “We must not put ourselves on the wrong side of history by allowing our narrow interests to trample over the interest of the majority of world citizens,” he warned, calling on the Council to implement protection of civilian mandates “without fear, favour or prejudice”.

The representative of Viet Nam echoed those points, emphasizing that peace operations must be carried out in line with the basic principles of political impartiality, consent of parties and non-use of force except in self-defence and defence of mandate. Human rights promotion and protection remain primarily the responsibility of host countries. Peace operations should play a supporting role and base their work on accurate, unbiased, balanced and verifiable information. Missions should also pay considerably more attention to the rights of refugees and internally displaced persons, he said, calling on peace operations themselves to strictly observe United Nations strategies related to misconduct and discipline.

China’s representative agreed that peace operations have played an important role in upholding the rights of people in their host countries, including creating the conditions for realizing the right to development. The objective of such missions is to support the political settlement of hotspot issues, and whether to include human rights protection in their mandate depends on the circumstances of each situation. For example, in Mali and South Sudan, human rights issues are not the main drivers of conflict. The human rights components of those respective missions should, therefore, serve — and not divert from — their central tasks. Underlining the need to respect countries’ ownership of human rights mandate implementation, he said peace operations must strictly follow Council resolutions, communicate with Governments and respect countries’ unique circumstances. Peace operations should also support States’ responses to COVID-19 and protect people’s rights to life and health.

The representative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines said peace operations provide crucial support to conflict-affected countries as they realign and reconfigure social norms, build new institutions and re-establish State authority. However, she warned against universalizing human rights components in a manner that disregards local cultures and traditions — thereby undermining national peace efforts — and stressed the need to respect a host country’s sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity. She echoed the sentiment that blue helmets themselves must never engage in human rights abuses, recalling that in Haiti acts of sexual exploitation and abuse left behind deep-rooted trauma and a general distrust of the United Nations.

David Shearer, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for South Sudan and Head of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan, also briefed the Council.

Also participating were the Minister for State of the United Kingdom, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, and the representatives of China, Niger, Russian Federation and Tunisia.

Thank you to Germany for convening this important meeting and we wish you well for your Presidency of the Security Council.

And it is important that we convene together to discuss this subject. And in doing so, I join others in paying tribute, particularly at this time of a global pandemic, to the leadership of the Secretary-General, and thank ICRC president Mr Maurer and Mrs Elfadil Mohammad for their very helpful and constructive briefings this morning.

We all now know that with COVID-19 we face a crisis of unprecedented scope and indeed complexity. Across the world it has triggered health, humanitarian, economic, development and security challenges, with ramifications that are both immediate and indeed long-term. These challenges are interwoven. They require a coordinated, collaborative response.

Therefore, may I first welcome the adoption unanimously of UN Security Council Resolution 2532 yesterday and in doing so wish to thank both France and Tunisia for their efforts in this respect.

Mr President, the full extent of this pandemic is still unfolding before our eyes. I know we all fear its impact as it spreads in states that are both vulnerable or affected by conflict.

As we see around the world, in places such as Yemen, Libya and the Central African Republic, contested or fragmented government authority severely restricts local capacity to respond effectively to the spread of this pandemic. Health systems are overstretched and under-resourced and cannot detect and indeed monitor the spread of the disease.

As the impact becomes clearer, so we see evidence of COVID compounding existing problems, such as in the Lake Chad Basin and in the Sahel. Our efforts to prevent or resolve conflict, they are complicated by COVID-19. Peacekeepers themselves are quarantined, humanitarian access is restricted and impeded and peace processes have been paused. So it is important we must both act to tackle the pandemic and to give an effective response to prevent or resolve conflict.

We must ensure a strong international health response led by the World Health Organisation. And in this regard, the United Kingdom has already committed 764 million pounds to support humanitarian and public health needs. We must ensure development and equitable distribution of a vaccine. And in this regard, the United Kingdom has already pledged over 300 million pounds in funding for research into vaccines, tests and treatment. And as many of you know, last month we hosted a very successful Global Vaccine Summit that raised over $8.8 billion to support immunisation of 300 million children against coronavirus and indeed other vaccine preventable diseases.

At the same time, we must, of course, redouble our efforts on peace and security. This Council, the Security Council, has a key role to play. We welcome the Secretary-General’s call for a global ceasefire and we should all stand firm on our peacekeeping troop contributions and, importantly, the resources they need.

The devastating impact of COVID-19 on fragile societies underlines the moral duty of outside parties that influence conflicts in Syria and indeed elsewhere. Importantly, everyone must come together to support peace.

We need to also act smartly to prevent new peace and security crises from emerging. The pandemic has clearly demonstrated the importance of the coordinated and multi-dimensional international responses for which the UK has long argued. The United Nations must work smarter across its pillars and with partners. And we commend the UN system for delivering under immense pressure. I think we all acknowledge that more is needed to deliver a holistic response that limits instability in the face of complex challenges.

We therefore recommend three actions: Firstly, UN responses must be more sensitive to conflict risk and build this into strategic planning, prioritisation and financing.

Secondly, there needs to be a joint risk assessment and planning with the international financial institutions to combine macroeconomic, social and political considerations.

And thirdly, we need to focus on what works to build a country’s resilience to shocks. Strong, inclusive and accountable institutions, the rule of law, good governance and human rights are the fundamental basis of that very resilience.

We need to see this in our coordinated response and in our planning to build back better.

Mr President, this pandemic has brought into sharp focus the urgent need for the development objective and sustainable peace and security cannot be solved as separate issues, and they cannot be solved alone. Together, we have this expertise. Together, we have the resources. We must use them and respond to this challenge. And together, we will succeed.

Thank you.","Thank you to Germany for convening this important meeting and we wish you well for your Presidency of the Security Council.

Listen to article

The Executive Director of the Institute for Democratic Governance (iDEG), Dr. Emmanuel Akwetey, has called on the National Peace Council and the Independent Governance Institutions (IGIs) to create a common platform for all political parties to dialogue for peace as the December 7 elections approach.

He made the call during a one-day conference organized by the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs under the theme: “Independent Governance Institutions and the 2020 Elections in Ghana: Some Reflections” to help deepen the relationship between the ministry and the IGIs.

It is also to strengthen and consolidate Ghana's shining democracy under the Fourth Republic, with true separation of powers and independence of governance institutions.

According to the iDEG boss, from the onset of the EC's decision to compile a new voters' register, major political parties have taken strong positions on whether to maintain or discard the register.

“The National Peace Council must now live up to its responsibility and join hands with the Independent Governance Institutions to bring all political parties, especially the ruling New patriotic Party(NPP) and the largest opposition party, to one table and iron out differences that will place the interest of the nation above any other interest,” he stressed.

Mr. Akwetey said by so doing, Ghanaians would most likely enjoy peace before, during and after the 2020 general election even though the stakes are very high.

The Commissioner for the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ), Joseph Whittal, in his submission, strongly supported the call by the Executive Director of iDEG, stressing that high level of mistrust could threaten and undermine the general election.

He advised the EC to be circumspect in the exercise of its discretionary powers and to build consensus on issues that affect the fate of political parties. He emphasized the need to ensure that no eligible voter is disenfranchised, adding that the EC must provide backup machines at the polling stations in case of malfunctioning voting devices.

Besides, he warned the media to be very circumspect in their reports in the run-up to the elections and make sure that they churn out very accurate reports and desist from sensationalism.

The Minister of Parliamentary Affairs who is also the Majority Leader, Osei Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu, said the government must make sure that new Vigilantism and Other Related Offences Law is effectively enforced during the general election.

He said the EC must effectively collaborate with the police and the Ghana Armed Forces to ensure that there is adequate security at the centres to ensure peaceful registration exercise and to clamp down on any individuals or groups who have any plans to disrupt or mar the registration exercise.

He said the ministry was also considering bringing all political parties under one umbrella to dialogue on how there could be peace before, during and after the general election.

A New Brunswick mom whose seven-year-old was hospitalized after eating what he thought were Oreo cookies is calling for a crackdown on cannabis-product packaging. Tobi Russo, who lives on Eel Ground First Nation southwest of Miramichi and is recovering from surgery, says she was having a rest on the couch Saturday morning when her youngest son, Moises, came upstairs to tell her he wasn't feeling well. Russo said it was plain to see he was in distress — his pupils were dilated and he was having heart palpitations — and she asked him what had happened. He told her he'd eaten some cookies, and she asked him to bring her the package. Russo was astonished: the packaging looked strikingly similar to the packaging for Oreo cookies, right down to the distinctive shiny blue cellophane wrap, and the font on the image of a chocolate creme cookie against a splash of white cream in the background. Except that they were in fact Stoneo cookies, by ""Dabisco,"" which is not a legal product, and contained a total of 500 mg of THC. For comparison, a typical legal edibles product for sale at Cannabis NB contains between 2.5 and 10 mg of THC. Moises had eaten both of the cookies in the package. Alarmed, Russo called the poison control line and an ambulance. Moises was taken to Miramichi Regional Hospital, where he was diagnosed with an overdose and was hospitalized and monitored for 24 hours. He's home now and safe, and is not expected to have any long-term health issues because of the incident, but it has left Russo badly shaken. Stoneo cannabis cookies are sold in packaging that is almost identical to Oreo cookies packaging. (Weed Deals ) Cookies brought into home without her knowledge Russo said she had no idea the cookies had been brought into the house. ""I live a drug- and alcohol-free life,"" said Russo, who has worked as an addictions counsellor. ""If I would have known they were in the house, I would have destroyed them."" There are adult relatives and four children, including teenagers, in the house, and there are friends who come and go, Russo said. She is quick to point out that she isn't trying to spark a ""witch hunt"" in her household or in her community. If anything, she said, she blames herself. ""I am his mother and I'm responsible for what comes into this house,"" Russo said. Her real beef is with the companies that appear to directly target children with packaging that is dangerously similar to that of products they love. Stoneo cookies, by Canadian online dispensary Weed Deals, are just one example. There are Stoner Patch Kidz gummies, whose packaging mimics the distinctive packaging of Sour Patch Kids gummy candies, Fruit Gushers medicated gummies, Nerds Rope candy, and others. All of them mimic the original candies, from the packaging colour to the font to the graphic design. Oreo brand tries to stop 'misappropriation' ""These big corporations should have a responsibility to not make it so inviting"" to children, Russo said. ""Adults would buy these products whether they had fancy packaging or not, they would buy it for the effect, so there's really no need to make it look all fun and fanciful."" CBC News has reached out to Weed Deals, which sells the Stoneo cookies and other edibles, but did not immediately receive a response. On Tuesday, Mondelez International, which owns Oreo and many other snack brands, said in a statement that it takes the misuse of its products and brands seriously and ""will act as necessary to protect consumers from actions that misrepresent"" them. ""In this case, the misappropriation of our OREO name and our packaging to sell THC-containing products is particularly troubling as the use of our designs may make the products more attractive and appealing to children,"" the statement said. ""While we have reported the misuse to various agencies globally, we feel strongly about taking action to defend the OREO brand and to prevent its use by third parties to sell unregulated and infringing products. …Our products are safe to consume."" Oreo cookies packaging. (Mondelez International) First Nation dispensary drops products The sale of cannabis in Canada has had some grey areas from the start. While Cannabis NB is the only legal retailer of cannabis in New Brunswick, First Nations leaders have argued that their communities weren't consulted when the Cannabis Act was being established, and that they do in fact have the right to sell cannabis in their own territories. Federal cannabis laws will come up for a three-year review this fall, giving First Nations an opportunity to make a new deal with the Canadian government that would allow them to sell legally. Cannabis NB does not sell Stoneo or other edibles that do not conform to Health Canada's quality control standards and guidelines, including packaging and THC levels. But such products are available online and at some dispensaries throughout the province, including some First Nation dispensaries, and calls for something to be done about their packaging are mounting. On Monday night, the co-owner of a cannabis dispensary on the Eel Ground First Nation, also known as Natoaganeg, posted a statement on Facebook announcing it will be dropping all products that employ the brand-mimicking tactic in the wake of Moises' accidental overdose. Although we may not be able to convince a company to alter their marketing strategies, we can make a difference by choosing not to offer these products in our store. - Devin Ward, co-owner of Lefty's Canna dispensary Lefty's Canna did not sell the Stoneo product in question, Devin Ward noted in his statement. However, he said, distributors have a responsibility to ensure that ""incidents like the one this past weekend are avoided."" ""Ultimately, we are a collection of families that operates Lefty's. We have kids of our own and really sympathize with this unfortunate situation,"" he said in the statement. ""Although we may not be able to convince a company to alter their marketing strategies, we can make a difference by choosing not to offer these products in our store."" In an interview Monday night, Ward, himself a father of young boys, explained that Moises' hospital scare ""hit close to home."" ""Moises is the same age as my son, they were in kindergarten together a few years ago. We know them on a personal level, so it was upsetting,"" he said. Devin Ward, with wife Kayla and their sons, Dexter, left, and Jackson. Ward co-owns a dispensary on the Eel Ground First Nation and said Monday night that the dispensary will be dropping all products whose packaging mimics brands known to children.(Submitted by Devin Ward) Public Health to discuss incident with Health Canada In an email Tuesday, New Brunswick's Public Health department said it was not aware of the packaging, but now plans to share the information with Health Canada. ""We will share with Health Canada colleagues for followup as they are responsible for packaging,"" department spokesperson Bruce Macfarlane said. He noted individuals can also report concerns to Health Canada, via the Cannabis Reporting Form section on Health Canada's website. Health Canada said Monday that it is looking into the matter. MLA commends Russo for coming forward Michelle Conroy, the People's Alliance MLA for Miramichi, also knows Russo and Moises. On Monday, Conroy called Moises' close call ""horrifying,"" and questioned how companies can be allowed to blatantly target children in their marketing of adult products. ""We've been seeing posts about Doritos bags, candies and gummies, all of which are pointed towards children's treats. … it's very concerning."" Conroy praised Russo for sharing her story, knowing that she would face online trolling and posting hurtful comments.

Myanmar litigation at the International Court of Justice and ways forward.)

In recent years, international institutions such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and others have finally formally responded to protracted persecution and large-scale violence committed against ethnic minority groups – particularly the Rohingya – in Myanmar. This forum recognizes that these institutional responses are significant, and my colleagues’ contributions highlight how international accountability can illuminate ways forward toward justice and the rule of law in Myanmar. This article recaps the various forms of accountability – judicial and otherwise – that have emerged and considers how these various efforts could contribute toward a more comprehensive approach to secure lasting peace and democratic development in Myanmar. To those ends, I suggest that efforts to secure justice internationally must be linked to grassroots domestic initiatives aimed at strengthening inclusion, nondiscrimination, and the rule of law in Myanmar.

Background

Myanmar is home to some of the world’s longest-running civil wars, partly stemming from the fraught process of gaining independence from British rule in 1948. These conflicts cover large swathes of the country, including the Shan, Chin, Kachin, Kayin, and Rakhine states, with armed groups seeking greater equality and autonomy in a nation that has been dominated by the majority Bamar ethnic nationalist Burmese military. Over decades, human rights and humanitarian groups have documented the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people, with the military accused of systematically targeting civilians, burning villages, committing sexual violence, and killing men, women, and children. The COVID-19 pandemic has only intensified fears for ethnic groups, particularly in the midst of the world’s longest internet shutdown in Rakhine and Chin States.

Impunity for military leaders has remained a constant, even as the country embarked on an ostensibly democratic transition in 2011, releasing political prisoners, including then pro-democracy leader and now de facto head of government Aung San Suu Kyi, among other reforms. As colleagues in this forum point out, foreign actors, including certain United Nations agencies, largely overlooked military abuses, including the worsening plight of the Rohingya minority in Rakhine State, as donors and investors calculated that they could incentivize the reform process by not pushing too hard for accountability.

In 2016 and 2017, decades of persecution foreseeably culminated in large-scale violence when the Myanmar military responded with overwhelming force to attacks on police posts by a small Rohingya armed group. The exodus of over 740,0000 Rohingya to neighboring Bangladesh, creating the largest refugee camp in the world, could not be downplayed. A slew of international accountability measures – including cases at the ICJ and International Criminal Court (ICC) – emerged in a remarkably compressed period of time.

International Accountability Initiatives

At least eight international accountability initiatives regarding Myanmar are briefly reviewed below, including the ICJ case. All have come about on the basis of evidence of atrocity crimes, including crimes against humanity and genocide.

Independent International Fact-Finding Mission for Myanmar (IIFFMM). In March 2017, the U.N. Human Rights Council launched an independent international fact-finding mission “to establish the facts and circumstances of the alleged recent human rights violations by military and security forces, and abuses, in Myanmar.” The mission submitted its 440-page report in September 2018, which detailed clear patterns of human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law in Kachin, Shan, and Rakhine states. It called for the investigation and prosecution of military leaders for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, the latter in connection with violence against the Rohingya minority in Rakhine state. Permanent People’s Tribunal of Myanmar (PPT). Established in 1979 and based in Rome, Italy, the PPT was modelled after the Russell Tribunals on Vietnam and Latin America of the 1960s and 70s. It is an independent non-governmental body with the aim “to give visibility and legitimacy to the authority of peoples when states and the international bodies fail to protect their rights.” It hears complaints submitted by victims or their representatives. All parties concerned are invited to make arguments, and a panel of judges drawn from an international network of experts hear the sessions and render judgements, thus far totaling 47. The session on State Crimes Committed against the Rohingyas, Kachins, and Other Groups took place in Malaysia in September 2018. Myanmar officials chose not to appear. The panel concluded that the state of Myanmar is guilty of genocide against the Rohingya and has the intent to commit genocide against the Kachin and other Muslims in Myanmar. Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (IIMM). In September 2018, the U.N. Human Rights Council established the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (IIMM), which received the IIFFMM’s report. The IIMM’s mandate is to collect evidence of the most serious international crimes and international law violations, and prepare files for criminal prosecution in national, regional, or international courts or tribunals that have or will in the future have jurisdiction over these crimes. Its mandate is not limited to crimes against any single ethnic group and it pledges to conduct outreach with civil society and victims’ groups. As the IIMM is an investigative body whose work is ongoing, it has not issued any significant reports or other documents summarizing what it has found thus far. International Criminal Court (ICC). On November 14, 2019, Pre-Trial Chamber III of the ICC authorized the Prosecutor to proceed with an investigation of alleged crimes against Rohingya victims within the court’s jurisdiction. While Myanmar is not a state party to the ICC’s Rome Statute, Bangladesh is a state party. Accordingly, the ICC’s investigation is limited to alleged crimes against humanity of deportation across the Myanmar-Bangladesh border and associated acts of persecution against the Rohingya population, as at least part of these crimes appear to have been committed on the territory of Bangladesh. The ICC currently lacks jurisdiction over crimes committed completely in Myanmar, however further crimes connected to the exodus of Rohingyas fleeing to Bangladesh could be added. International Court of Justice (ICJ). Also in November 2019, Gambia initiated proceedings at the ICJ, alleging that Myanmar violated the Genocide Convention. Former Gambian Justice Minister and former attorney at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, Abubacarr Tambadou, spearheaded Gambia’s case. In January 2020, the ICJ granted Gambia’s request for provisional measures requiring Myanmar to prevent any acts that contribute to genocide, avoid destroying related evidence, and report on measures taken. On May 23, 2020, Myanmar submitted its report to the Court. The report was not made public, but observers note that Myanmar has issued three Presidential Directives seeking to prevent official hate speech, and ordering compliance with the Genocide Convention and preservation of evidence. The government commissioned an Independent Commission of Inquiry, which referred admissions regarding war crimes to military justice procedures “if there is credible evidence.” Activists also claim that Myanmar has nonetheless continued attacks on Rohingya villages since the ICJ’s January decision. Worsening conflict between the Myanmar military and ethnic Rakhine Buddhists further raises doubt about government commitment to prevent genocide and other atrocities. Argentinian Universal Jurisdiction Case. Also in November 2019, and in line with the IIFFMM’s call for countries to pursue universal jurisdiction cases against members of Myanmar’s Tatmadaw military for crimes against the Rohingya, the Burmese Rohingya Organization UK (BROUK), represented by prominent Argentinean human rights lawyer Tomás Ojea Quintana, filed a petition in an Argentinian court to open an investigation into the role of Myanmar’s civilian and military leaders in committing genocide and crimes against humanity against the Rohingya. On June 2, 2020, the court requested information from the ICC to ensure the case in Argentina would not duplicate justice efforts in the Hague. U.S. Investigation and U.S./EU Sanctions. In spring 2018, the U.S. State Department surveyed over a 1,000 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh to document atrocities committed during military operations conducted in Myanmar in 2016 and 2017. The resultant report characterized relevant events as “ethnic cleansing,” but received criticism for avoiding the legal labels “crimes against humanity” and “genocide.” In August 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed economic sanctions on four Myanmar military and border guard commanders and two military units. In July 2019, the State Department issued travel bans against four top military commanders, including commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing, and their families. In April 2020, the EU decided to maintain existing sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, against 14 top-ranking Myanmar security officials. Corporate Responsibility. In line with the recommendations of the IFFMM, outside organizations have launched boycott campaigns and petitions in efforts to force individuals and organizations to cease doing business with military-owned corporations in Myanmar. In February 2020, Japanese beverage corporation Kirin began to review its association with the Myanmar military. In 2018 and 2019, Facebook and Twitter suspended the accounts of General Min Aung Hlaing and others for using the platform to spread hate speech against the Rohingya. Corporate responsibility is nonetheless stubbornly anemic in light of the scale of crimes allegedly committed.

From International Justice to Peace: Limitations and Leverage

On the one hand, the range of accountability responses to the plight of the Rohingya and other ethnic groups in Myanmar described above is impressive, and is a testament to the coordinated advocacy on the part of transnational Rohingya and other Burmese activist networks. Arguably, the main mechanism still missing would be a judicial body with jurisdiction to prosecute atrocity crimes committed wholly within Myanmar. Such a body could be constituted either through a U.N. Security Council referral of the situation in Myanmar to the ICC, or through the creation of a special ad hoc tribunal, as Burmese human rights defender Khin Omar advocated at the U.N. Security Council in mid-July. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Myanmar is a member, could also have played a more robust role all along. A 2019 ASEAN declaration encouraged progress in finding a “comprehensive and durable solution,” but was criticized by rights groups for avoiding the term Rohingya and lacking “teeth.”

However, as colleagues in this forum recognize, these accountability processes are not a panacea for holistic justice and peacebuilding. These processes can take years, with uncertain outcomes which are difficult to enforce. As Nadira Kourt asserts, “The cost of simply waiting for the final judgment [at the ICJ] is too high.” While the ICC could theoretically convict and imprison one or more individual perpetrator(s) (assuming an arrest warrant could be executed and personal jurisdiction obtained), as a criminal court, the ICC cannot amend Myanmar’s Constitution, eliminate discriminatory laws, provide restorative justice among divided communities, or change hearts and minds. The ICJ could potentially order reparations, but enforcement depends on Myanmar’s compliance. International accountability must therefore be viewed as complementary to and not a substitute for long-term solutions.

Advocates can nonetheless leverage the various justice-seeking processes under way to reduce atrocity risks, and work toward lasting peace and rule of law in Myanmar. Whatever their eventual outcomes, together, these accountability measures are creating a strong record of documented abuses in a context in which narratives remain vehemently contested. They also put all parties to a conflict on notice that they could be held liable for atrocity crimes. They sustain discourses of justice that go beyond whether individuals go to prison, even as those discourses might simultaneously highlight the limitations of legal accountability. For instance, in a May 2020 op-ed, Rohingya youth leaders made clear that:

For us, justice means going home as soon as possible. It means being given rights and citizenship in Myanmar. It means security, and the ability to call ourselves ‘Rohingya.’ We do not need an international court to tell us that what happened to us was a genocide. We know it was genocide. The world knows it was genocide. The world has already heard our story and knows our pain.

The sheer breadth of international accountability initiatives thus denotes the gaping lack of access to justice, security, and basic rights for minorities in Myanmar of which the Rohingya youth leaders speak. As colleagues in this forum suggest, the way forward toward an improved situation in Myanmar – and meaningful compliance with the ICJ’s provisional measures order to prevent genocide – requires addressing these gaps. While the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum has noted that the Genocide Convention “does not elaborate on what the obligation to prevent genocide entails,” a basic consideration of genocide risk factors and common sense point to, as forum contributor Param-Preet Singh elaborates, guaranteeing access to health care and humanitarian assistance, and repealing the web of discriminatory laws and policies that have denied the Rohingya citizenship and other minorities basic rights, among other measures. Kourt meanwhile, rightly mentions “safe return.” Finally, as Grant Shubin points out, “unless and until Myanmar addresses root causes of the ongoing acts of violence and persecution being committed against the Rohingya – and discrimination against all of Myanmar’s ethnic minorities – the risk of atrocities will persist and the rule of law will languish.” These recommendations in turn imply a link between fulfilling obligations to prevent genocide and establishing conditions for peace and rule of law.

All forum contributors further recognize that legal compliance – and creating conditions for peace and rule of law – depends on political pressure and political change. Kourt emphasizes that other states must make a “political decision” to live up to their own obligations to prevent genocide and enforce Myanmar’s compliance with the ICJ’s order. Political pressure must build to impose steeper economic costs on the Myanmar government, to compel other states to increase refugee quotas, and to develop a diplomatic strategy to hasten a peace process that enables safe return.

The international community clearly has a political role to play, but a closer examination of how international accountability relates to domestic political dynamics is also critical, as lasting solutions will depend on social and political change within Myanmar. In framing the plight of victims in terms of nondiscrimination and accountability for abuses of state power, these international processes help to legitimize domestic advocacy that genuinely seeks peace, rule of law, and equity among ethnic groups in Rakhine state and within Myanmar more generally.

Domestic initiatives have increased to promote concepts of transitional justice, reconciliation, and shared identity in order to lay the foundation for structural changes required to end atrocities and sustain peace. As Shubin notes, persecuted ethnic groups have expressed solidarity with each other’s struggles in the past, but members of diverse groups are also seeking to work toward inclusive identity, “de-imagining” the exclusionary, divide-and-rule politics inherited from the British colonial system. For several years, some groups, though compelled to keep a low profile, have sought to promote interfaith harmony and pluralism. Rohingya and ethnic Rakhine activists appeared together for the first time on a July 2020 panel to support reconciliation between their communities. Remarkably, the Rakhine activist insisted that his community “cannot deny the genocide” perpetrated against the Rohingya, including the role of some ethnic Rakhine participants therein. A Rohingya activist asserted that “I am proud to call myself Arakanese,” referencing the pre-colonial period Rakhine state (which remained the independent Arakan Kingdom until approximately 1785), where diverse religious and ethnic groups coexisted and prospered. The IIFFMM, and conflict and rule of law scholars, have affirmed the importance of amplifying these inclusive visions within Myanmar – along with deepening commitment to legality and more substantive conceptions of rule of law that prominent Burmese lawyers such as the late U Ko Ni have championed. Strengthening these basic values can shift public consciousness to help bring about legal reforms favoring ethnic autonomy and equal access to citizenship and other rights – reforms that would help to prevent genocide.

Bridging International and Domestic Efforts

The international community has institutionalized its solidarity with persecuted groups in Myanmar through diverse accountability measures, ranging from U.N. treaties and mechanisms, to international courts, to the creation of investigative bodies. Increasing focused support for domestic initiatives favoring inclusive national identity and substantive rule of law improvements, and emphasizing the agency of victims and those in Myanmar most directly affected by ongoing violence and impunity, would give fuller expression to the same ideals of atrocity prevention, non-discrimination, and peace that underlie the Genocide Convention and these other international institutions. Building these bridges between international commitments to atrocity prevention and protection of marginalized groups and domestic movements for peace, nondiscrimination, and rule of law becomes ever more urgent in a world worryingly beset by polarization and nationalist ideologies.

We met at Freedom Plaza. This was my first protest since the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. People of all ages, abilities, genders, races and ethnicities were there to stand up for justice.

With an impassioned call to action from one of the organizers, the crowd headed toward Capitol Hill chanting, “No Justice, No Peace.” I fell in line toward the back, taking in the moment and the movement.

As we walked, I noticed a dad and his son, no more than 3 or 4, walking with us. They were white. As the protest went on, the dad explained each chant to his son, encouraging him with the rhythm of the crowd. “Breonna Taylor.” “George Floyd.” “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot.” I remember thinking, if every non-Black person did this with their children, then maybe, just maybe, my children will not have to march in their lifetime.

I lost sight of the boy and his father, but not of the feeling they gave me. Hope.

A few days later, social media was flooded with a video of 7-year-old Wynta-Amor Rogers invoking our ancestors with her rallying cry, “No Justice, No Peace.” But this time, I didn’t feel hope.

There is no doubt in my mind that by the time she graduates high school, Wynta-Amor will have experienced firsthand all that it means to be Black in a virulently anti-Black society, an experience uniquely different from her white peers. I cannot say the same for the little white boy at Freedom Plaza. He will not be given “the talk.” No, not the one about the birds and the bees, but the one that I got from my parents, and they got from their parents.

Oppression has robbed Black youth of their childhood for centuries. Beverly Daniel Tatum, the author of “Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?” remembers the conversation she had with her son at age 3 when a peer attributed his dark skin to drinking too much chocolate milk. Tatum’s explanation and the conversations she had with him throughout his life leads to a bigger question: Why do Black children have to learn about racism before they learn cursive?

In “We Want to Do More than Survive,” Bettina Love talks about “spirit murdering” of Black youth — a constant attack on a Black child’s soul — a loss of protection, safety, nurturance and acceptance due to racism. These attacks, Love says, lead to a life of exhaustion and doubt in which your only coping skill is to survive until the next day. But don’t our Black youth deserve more than just a life of survival, even if only for a little bit?

Adultification

Rogers became an overnight sensation. The media hailed her as the “the voice of the movement,” forgetting that as a 7-year-old it is not her responsibility to be the voice of a movement to end state-sanctioned violence against Black bodies. Especially not a Black child.

This conversation is not new — the adultification of Black children, especially Black girls, has been around since the start of chattel slavery. Yes, slavery. It always goes back to slavery. Anyway, Monique W. Morris, author of “Pushout: The Criminalization of Black Girls in School,” argues that Black girls never really get to be “girls.” From an early age they are seen as Black women, and as Black women they are branded with all the good and bad that comes with that: loud, bossy, overtly sexual, “grown,” aggressive, etc. The adjectives used to describe Wynta-Amor include brave, fierce, strong. But why should a 7-year-old NEED to be strong?

I think this is the time for the “strong black woman” trope to enter into the conversation. Spoiler alert: This goes back to slavery as well. In “How the Expectation of Strength Harms Black Girls and Women,” Seanna Leath writes how her research finds that among Black women and girls, they see their strength as a “birthright.”

Many Black women look to their strength as a way to survive, a coping mechanism for the legacy of slavery, colonization, disenfranchisement and rape of the Black woman in this country. A history that Black youth should not have to bear, not yet — not ever. This “burden of strength,” Leath says, on Black girls and women can lead to social, emotional, mental and physical health issues.

Let me be clear, this is by no means a criticism of the adults in Wynta-Amor’s life who made the choice to bring her to the protest. Black Americans have struggled and fought for freedom and the recognition of their humanity for so many generations that resistance has become something akin to a generational culture. “We must show the kids of the world the right way and I will start with mine,” said Lakyia Jackson, Wynta-Amor’s mom via her social media.

Black youth deserve more than just a life of survival, but if America cannot guarantee that, could there at least be a little bit of a reprieve from the reality when they are children?

As I reflect on that day at Freedom Plaza with the little boy and his father, I realize now the hope I felt wasn’t for them, myself, or even this country … it was for Wynta-Amor and all Black youth. Hope that they can live a life not characterized by resistance, but of opportunity.

I am committed to defending Black life. I am committed to justice for Black lives. I am committed to doing this without sacrificing the spirit and the joy that still lives in our Black youth. Our joy, our spirit is our greatest revolution.

By Laura E. R. Peters

Is the world doomed to be ever-more tumultuous? For years, headlines have suggested that climate change causes or acts as a threat multiplier for violent conflicts. For example, climate change-influenced drought has been labeled a cause of the Syrian conflict and the war in Darfur. Natural hazard-related disasters (“disasters”) like earthquakes that are not related to climate change have also been connected to an increased risk of violent social conflict and political instability. The narratives are often that disasters displace people who then put pressure on already-strained resources and infrastructure in receiving areas, and that disaster-stricken people fight over limited resources in their struggle for survival.

However, every so often a hopeful headline suggests that these same types of disasters can bring people together and inspire altruism in times of crisis and encourage cooperation and peace between adversaries.

So which of these seemingly incompatible outcomes holds true? Do disasters cause conflict, or do disasters lead to increased cooperation and peace?

Across studies and geographies, the findings are unsatisfyingly inconclusive. Even meta-studies on these topics disagree with each other about the fundamental relationships between disaster, conflict, and peace. Why is it so challenging to reach a consensus?

In the International Journal of Disaster Risk Science, I write with Ilan Kelman that this question will never lead us to a definitive answer, because the reality is much more complex. We argue that disasters do not create new conflict or peace, but disasters can reflect, reproduce, or rearrange ongoing processes of peace and conflict—and their undercurrents.

Revisiting the foundations of disaster research, conflict research, and peace research

Disasters and conflicts are often depicted as distinct and extreme events that “strike” or “erupt.” But, disasters are more than storms. Conflicts are more than battles. And peace is more than the signing of a peace agreement. Disaster, conflict, and peace events like these are merely the tip of the proverbial iceberg, and we can and must dive deeper to see the dynamics and processes beneath the surface

We know that disasters are not natural, inevitable, or random occurrences, nor are they exogenous to the local settings in which they occur. Disasters are created through long-term societal processes, histories, and patterns. Natural hazards, including those related to climate change, do not cause disasters: human action and inaction turn a hazard event into a disaster. Simply put, people need to be located in harm’s way and be susceptible to that harm in order for a disaster to occur.

Conflict and peace are also woven into the fabric of society. Conflict is an inherent part of human interactions, and occurs when people perceive that they have different and incompatible objectives. Conflict can be pursued violently or nonviolently, and conflict can even be a driving force behind positive societal changes.

Peace is often thought of as the termination or absence of violence that may be marked by the signing of a peace agreement or ceasefire, but expanded understandings of positive peace—“the attitudes, institutions and structures that create and sustain peaceful societies”—go beyond the absence of violence to take into consideration things like social justice and cooperative relationships. The concepts of conflict and peace are not mutually exclusive, and indeed each can be observed even where one predominates. For example, anti-war or peace movements can occur in the midst of war.

Building bridges between concepts

These foundational concepts are not new, but we argue that they are often overlooked by disaster-conflict and disaster-peace research seeking to isolate simple cause-effect relationships that play out in short timeframes. For example, it is problematic to wholly define disasters, conflicts, and peace by the events associated with them and to measure them solely via death and damage figures that are offered in disaster and conflict datasets like EM-DAT, the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), and UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset. Event-based analysis can lend itself toward advancing understanding, but only insofar as it is situated in a long-term process of change that extends well before and after events take place. “Returning to normal” from disasters and conflicts is often seen as the goal of recovery, but recovering the status quo often recreates the same vulnerabilities and inequalities that led to disaster and conflict in the first place.

Disasters and conflicts are often seen as purely destructive, but both have the potential to lead to positive changes in societies. Indeed, disasters may even offer a “window of opportunity” to resolve conflicts. A field of research called “disaster diplomacy” asks the core questions of how and why disasters and disaster-related activities before, during, and after disasters do and do not influence different forms of conflict and peace. This body of literature has found that disasters and their related activities such as disaster risk reduction and disaster recovery may provide short-term opportunities to create peace, but pre-disaster conditions play a strong guiding role in determining post-disaster outcomes. These findings take us a step closer toward understanding how disaster impacts conflict and peace from a more process-oriented lens. But much work remains to develop more detailed and nuanced questions about co-occurring forms of conflict and peace that take place at overlapping scales of analysis.

Embracing complexity to reduce risks

The evidence is increasingly mounting that disasters and conflicts are bound in complex systems of risk embedded in long-term and slow social processes of change and inertia. That change can be destructive, or it can be positive, moving away from cycles of disasters and conflicts and toward capacity building and cooperation. We need to reframe questions away from assuming fatalistic or deterministic relationships (for example, that disasters and climate change cause conflicts) and start asking questions that illuminate specific pathways that reduce disaster risks while building peace.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned, “…We are in a world in which global challenges are more integrated, and the responses are more and more fragmented. And, if these are not reversed, it is a recipe for disaster.” One of the problems with securitized approaches to disaster management is that they fragment responses by treating people as risks and not assets. Disasters do not unilaterally unleash disorder or harmony on societies; the systems we create and the decisions we make determine disaster risks and the cascading consequences for ongoing conflict and peace processes. Thus, to realize a more peaceful world, disaster risk reduction and response must strengthen integrated systems, institutions, and decision-making that bring people together and promote social justice, human rights, and social-environmental wellbeing. Could disaster-related activities, including disaster response, be used as starting points for reducing the vulnerabilities and building the capacities we need to flourish in a changing world? This is well within our capacity—it is a matter of choice.","Natural hazard-related disasters (“disasters”) like earthquakes that are not related to climate change have also been connected to an increased risk of violent social conflict and political instability.

These voters, we were told, were plagued by economic anxieties and turned off by what has been derided as “identity politics”—in essence, anything that acknowledged the existence of groups that have historically been excluded from accessing the opportunities and protections offered to straight, white, Christian men. And so, the story goes, these voters entrusted the solution to their woes to an inveterate conman.

This week’s Democratic National Convention has been a decisive rejection of that strand of conventional wisdom. It rejected the false premise that in order to run a politically viable campaign, Democrats needed to abandon the party’s focus on fairness. Democrats chose to position the party to speak for all Americans, rather than obsessing about how to speak to particular Americans.

If there has been a consistent thread in the erratic administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, it is the marriage of white nationalism with plutocracy. His populist political trick—from that first speech after descending the escalator in Trump Tower to announce his candidacy—has been to blame Black and brown people for the economic and social dislocations that were, in fact, the product of Reaganite economic policies and the costs of a misbegotten war. Trump and his accomplices in the U.S. Congress have deployed this populist scapegoating (a tired old trick) to distract from their use of the federal government to serve the short-term interests of corporations and the superrich, further exacerbating the economic inequality that hamstrings the country’s future. Much has been said about the evils of this approach to governing, but what Democrats (and a very few Republicans) have realized is that in choosing to plant his own and his party’s flag in a moral abyss, Trump ceded all higher ground.

The convention speeches of party leaders have been complemented by poignant vignettes of families and individuals to lift up and give life to so-called kitchen table issues such as creating jobs, supporting farmers and small businesses, and securing affordable health care and education. Former Vice President Joe Biden’s commitment to stewarding a recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and its attendant economic devastation and to “build back better” is a consistent theme of his presidential campaign. Tuesday evening’s segment with testimonials from national security leaders featured a former Republican senator and secretary of defense, the U.S. point person for the anti-Islamic State coalition, the former deputy secretary-general of NATO, and career diplomats who have served in multiple Republican and Democratic administrations.

What was less predictable was the way that Democrats have leaned into—even doubled down on—issues of racial, social, and environmental justice.

This part of the Democrats’ message was clear and predictable: Trump has abandoned the core responsibilities—foreign and domestic—of governing. Biden is promising to bring a lifetime’s experience, a competent team, and seriousness of purpose to the work that drives the country’s prosperity and security.

What was less predictable was the way that Democrats have leaned into—even doubled down on—issues of racial, social, and environmental justice. Most speakers talked about the divisions in the United States and the need to invest in unity in order to bring Americans together. And as they did so, they didn’t suggest that the path to unity involved sidestepping issues of racial or social justice in order to arrive at some kind of lowest common denominator. Rather, they made an argument that addressing the country’s shortcomings on racial and economic justice was itself a cause around which Americans ought to unify—and raise their expectations of the future. Democrats didn’t just reaffirm that Black lives matter, that gun violence is an epidemic, that climate change is an existential crisis, or that caregivers deserve a living wage—they effectively married those progressive priorities to the broader promise of an American renewal.

And that broader promise is at once expansive and essentially conservative—as exemplified by former President Barack Obama’s speech on Wednesday evening. He spoke from Philadelphia, the birthplace of the U.S. Constitution, and began his speech invoking that document. His remarks were a paean to Americans’ founding values and to the potential of their democracy, a pep talk to the downtrodden, a corrective to the cynic. He marshaled the full force of his (almost surreal) oratorical talents to deliver a patriot’s plea to believe once more in the promise of a more perfect union.

In the end, instead of fashioning a narrow argument tailored for swing-state voters, the Democrats argued for recommitting to making the reality of America match its ideal. They planted their flag on the moral cause that inspired the country’s founding and confidently asserted the capacity of that cause to deliver for the white unemployed factory worker in the Midwest just as much as for the Black front-line worker in a coastal city. In response to a current president who has so damaged the United States’ institutions and reputation, the Democrats have said: Let’s go back to the foundations and trust that if we purposefully build an America that is fairer for everyone, it’ll work better too—and gain broad popular support.

And that is also the America that engenders the world’s respect—sometimes hopeful and admiring, sometimes begrudging. It is the America that dictators and populists fear for the way it exposes the lies that underwrite their power. For when Americans show what they can do with the institutions and values of which Obama spoke, they animate the promise of pluralistic liberal democracy for all the world to see.

If one issue’s treatment has been most striking at the convention, it is arguably the consistent embrace of immigrants. After all, this is perhaps the issue on which the purveyors of conventional wisdom would have urged the most caution. We know that it is central to what Trump believes makes his own candidacy attractive: From the racist anti-immigrant rhetoric of his 2015 announcement speech, to his unfulfilled promise to build a wall on the southern U.S. border, to the scaremongering about a so-called migrant caravan that he deployed in an attempt to sway the 2018 midterm elections, Trump has bet big on anti-immigrant sentiment.

In response, Democrats made immigrants a focus of the convention. They have been featured prominently, not just in vignettes about immigration reform but also in segments about small business and health care. They appeared as eloquent spokespeople for their home states in the genuinely delightful roll-call vote on Tuesday night. And U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, Biden’s running mate, introduced herself at the convention not only as a Black woman but as the daughter of two immigrants.

The Democrats took the people whom Trump has tried to dehumanize and portray as monsters and instead projected their humanity.

The Democrats took the people whom Trump has tried to dehumanize and portray as monsters and instead projected their humanity. And, as with other issues, they linked this embrace of immigrants and refugees to a recommitment to the founding ideals of their country.

Nearly 32 years ago, as he closed his oft-quoted farewell address in the Oval Office, then-President Ronald Reagan shared his own paean to the United States, invoking 17th-century Massachusetts Governor John Winthrop’s vision of America as a “shining city on a hill”:

“And how stands the city on this winter night? … After 200 years, two centuries, she still stands strong and true on the granite ridge, and her glow has held steady no matter what storm. And she’s still a beacon, still a magnet for all who must have freedom, for all the pilgrims from all the lost places who are hurtling through the darkness, toward home.”

That last sentence is a stunningly beautiful line. And at this week’s convention, Democrats have shown that they are the party that still believes it.

A failure to do so would cause a ripple effect globally.

Afghanistan is at a critical stage in its decades-long conflict. A combination of factors has led to a deterioration of the country’s security. These include political corruption, dysfunctional institutions, patron-clientelism and social instability. Violence has intensified in recent years, causing numerous causalities of civilians and troops.

Can the Taliban and the Afghan Government Make Peace?

READ MORE

Washington has been a key supporter of the Afghan political system ever since the Taliban regime was overthrown in 2001, when NATO invaded Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks in the US. Since then, the US has sought to strike a deal with the Taliban, who have led an insurgency against NATO and Afghan security forces.

Making Peace

The US-Taliban peace deal — which the Afghan government is not a party to — was struck on February 29. If successful, it could help bring an end to the longest war in US history. The deal, which was signed in Doha after mediation by the Qataris, was the result of months of talks between Taliban officials and Zalmay Khalilzad, the US special envoy to Afghanistan. The agreement aims to pave the way for the end of US military involvement in Afghanistan and the withdrawal of foreign forces from the country if the Taliban uphold their side of the deal.

The accord has been met with opposition due to continued attacks by Taliban militants against Afghan forces and civilians. On March 10, the Taliban and the government in Kabul were due to enter intra-Afghan peace talks for a separate agreement. However, an attack on a hospital maternity ward in May, which caused the death of mothers, midwives and newborns, threw the idea of peace in Afghanistan up in the air. As a result, the government resumed offensive operations against Taliban militants soon after the attacks. Afghan officials have since confirmed that peace talks are set to begin in September.

“This is cradle-to-grave terrorism,” says columnist Max Boot in an op-ed for The Washington Post, referring to the attack on the hospital. Nonetheless, US officials, including President Donald Trump, have stressed their desire for Afghans to take charge of their own security rather than relying on US and NATO forces. The US insists on intra-Afghan negotiations and is in a hurry for there to be a political settlement between the government and the Taliban.

Based on its continued stance, there is no doubt that the Trump administration is committed to the Doha deal and its withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, whatever the circumstances or consequences. This makes it more unclear what the US-Taliban agreement could lead to and, more importantly, how much influence the Taliban would have on Afghan politics and society as a result.

Ending Decades of Conflict in Afghanistan

Ever since the Soviet invasion in 1979, Afghans have witnessed violence. Many young people are fed up with warlords who have destroyed the country and profited from its misery. Yet there is optimism that a political solution will emerge from the Doha agreement. This could have a lasting and positive impact if certain conditions are addressed.

In this context, a number of local, regional and global factors are crucially significant to bring an end to the longstanding conflict and ensure a durable political settlement in Afghanistan.

First, Afghans need to work on a local and national consensus. In a divided and diverse country like Afghanistan, the people must build strong social networks that include all factions and ethnic groups. They must work on a general consensus pertaining to a power-sharing structure.

That said, the power distribution should be based on citizenship, not ethnic and religious lines. In the long term, stability and development are likely to be ensured if power-sharing is based on Afghan citizenship. Aside from this, the government needs to support such community networks, strengthen key institutions, continue to empower Afghan security forces and clamp down on widespread corruption.

Second, under the auspices of the United Nations, a shura (council) should be created that consists of all sociopolitical elites, including political, tribal and community leaders, to lead the Afghan peace process. This shura needs to negotiate a ceasefire as a first step. Holding direct talks between rival groups is the second step. This would involve the government, the Taliban and former mujahideen commanders.

To carry out the talks, the shura needs to form an inclusive and consultative negotiating team from all ethnic and political groups to be able to address the deeper grievances in the country. These issues should be aired by the people and addressed under Afghan legal frameworks and the rule of law.

The shura needs to help all opposition groups resolve their differences and conflicts through dialogue. For a peace agreement to succeed, the Afghan government, the Taliban, all Afghan leaders, ambassadors of regional states, representatives of major Muslim countries and members of NATO must be a party to the deal. These stakeholders would need to guarantee that they would abide by any conditions in the settlement, and regional states would have to agree to end all meddling in Afghan affairs.

Third, there is a need for economic and political pressure at a regional level. Considerable pressure should be imposed on influential states like Pakistan and Iran. These two countries are considered to be the root of the problem in Afghanistan and have been accused of harboring and supporting insurgents. Hence, it is necessary that Islamabad and Tehran assure the Afghan government that they will not provide safe havens for terrorists and that anyone doing so will be brought to justice.

It is also vital that Pakistan and Iran own up to their covert interventions in Afghanistan’s internal affairs. Both of these nations should be transparent about such operations with the Afghan government and external stakeholders. Furthermore, regional states must recognize the political independence, territorial integrity and the rights of Afghan people to self-determination in their choice of political system.

The assurances and regional consensus also need to be based on a commitment by the Afghans. In other words, in order to ensure an end to meddling in Afghan affairs, the government in Kabul must remain impartial when it comes to the political situation of other regional states.

In addition, Kabul needs to assure regional states — Iran and Pakistan, particular — that their legitimate interests in Afghanistan will not be harmed. The Afghans must pledge to be active partners in trade, transit and energy resources. This would be a gamechanger for the region. There would be a shift away from the destructive intervention of neighboring states toward regional connectivity and an economy-focused approach that would benefit all nearby nations.

Fourth, once a peace deal is reached, the international community could transform a treaty into a sustainable settlement through political and economic assistance. With this in mind, once a peace agreement is ratified, Kabul should engage with the US, the European Union, the World Bank and other international partners to design and implement nuanced development programs that could lead Afghanistan toward greater physical and economic stability. This would create job opportunities for all civilians and even militants, who would, presumably, put down their guns.

In the first phase after a peace deal is enforced, a clear future plan needs to be implemented so members of opposition groups can be appointed in official positions. In this regard, the rights and obligations of the political forces of militant groups would be on the same footing as other Afghan citizens in a democratic and fair manner. The aim would be to reintegrate opposition groups and to encourage dialogue to prevent future conflict. Furthermore, the international community, alongside the shura, should persuade all parties — including the Taliban’s political wing — to participate in free and fair elections.

If Peace Isn’t Possible?

These measures would strengthen and consolidate the peace process to ensure that weapons are put down and stay down. A failure to address these conditions could lead to an intensified proxy war. As a result, non-state actors like the Taliban would step up with their insurgency, leading to an escalation of violence. This would not only bury any possible political settlement, but it would also derail global security.

The stunning announcement that Israel and the United Arab Emirates had brokered what came to be known as the Abraham Accord through the Trump Administration has brought the small Jewish community of the Emirates into the limelight of global interest.The resilience of the Jews of the UAE is one of the most interesting stories in light of the anti-Jewish (or anti-Israel) sentiment and demise of many Jewish communities in the Middle East. It is the story of individuals from various backgrounds who, one by one, came to Dubai or Abu Dhabi and formed a community that played an important role in the developing deal.Some of its first members were Sharon and Simon Eder, Ranna and Giacomo Arazi and Michael and Martine Nates, all coming in about 2008. There certainly were others, but they apparently had remained under the radar.The UAE is located on the Gulf at the northeastern end of the Arabian Peninsula, bordering Oman to the east and Saudi Arabia to the south and west. As the name implies, it is a federation of seven political territories, each independently governed by its own emir.The Emirate of Abu Dhabi, which serves as the capital, is joined by Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah, Sharjah and Umm Al Quwain. (Qatar and Kuwait, although emirates, are not part of the UAE.)The seven entities are represented in the world community by their highest constitutional authority, the Federal Supreme Council.Its president is one of the seven rulers. The current president is Abu Dhabi’s crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, ruler of the Emirate of Dubai, is vice president and prime minister of the UAE.The largest population among the Emirates is in Dubai, with some 3.3 million people. Abu Dhabi’s population stands at 1.5 million.Sharon and Simon EderAmong the first known Jews to reside in Dubai in the 21st century were Sharon and Simon Eder, both born and raised in the United Kingdom.Sharon’s mother was from Libya and her father from Iraq. Simon’s parents, both of Ashkenazi descent, grew up with strong Jewish identities. Sharon attended Hebrew school and Simon observed the Sabbath.“Shock and negative reaction” is how Sharon describes the response by friends and family to the Eders’ decision to move to an Arab country, where Simon was offered a job in the conference industry.“We were absolutely the first. I’m sure there were Jews there, but they didn’t really congregate,” Sharon tells The Media Line.“Prior to leaving London, we received three different phone numbers [of couples known to be moving to Dubai]. Then we realized the three numbers were the same, and all belonged to Ranna and Jack Arazi, who also moved from the UK around the same time.”Upon their arrival in the Gulf, the two families connected and began sharing traditional Friday night Shabbat dinners. The discussions always turned to the idea that there must be other Jews living there, too.“We always spoke like the TV series Lost – there must be another part of the island,” Sharon says. “My husband would say randomly, ‘That person looks Jewish,’ and often we would get it wrong.”Finally, a good friend of the Eders’ from London introduced them to another Jewish couple while they were slowly meeting others by chance. That was the starting point of the community.“In 2009, I fell pregnant, and that played a big part for Simon and me. We’re really happy here; we both had strong Jewish identities; how long can this go on?” she recalls thinking at the time.“At the time I got pregnant, I was traveling all over the world for my job, working for Bacardi, heading up the region from a local office in Dubai,” she relates.“I was five months pregnant [in 2010] and we decided to fly to Sri Lanka for Passover. As chance would have it, we went to Chabad and the rabbi said, ‘This is crazy, I never knew anybody from Dubai,’ but [the previous day] a man [had come] to him from Abu Dhabi,” she says.Sharon explains to The Media Line that the man had been in the Middle East for decades. He was the head of an institution in Abu Dhabi and spoke 12 languages flawlessly.“We decided to call him up,” she says.“At that point, I was due in August,” she continues, “and we basically would stay in Dubai for the holidays and try to get a rabbi to come. He knew other Jews and enabled [them to practice their Judaism]. We sent out emails and asked if anyone was interested in getting a rabbi for the holidays.”They contacted the Chabad rabbi in Sri Lanka, who came for Yom Kippur, staying a week.“It was held in an apartment and was a big success, with 35 people attending,” she says. “After that, Sabbath dinners were held in different homes. There was a lot of excitement because either people had been practicing in secret for many years or hadn’t practiced for many years in the Arab nation.”Sharon notes that the community was so diverse that “if we got together, the traditions followed were based on the host family.”They were meeting people, Jew by Jew.The Eders had two children born in Dubai and had to fly in a mohel to perform the ritual circumcision. Ironically, the night before the brit mila ceremony, they received a call from a Jewish person living in Lebanon who also needed a mohel. A day later, the couple and their child flew into Dubai for their own circumcision ceremony.Sharon shares another story of Jew-connecting-to-Jew.“My German obstetrician said he had a Jewish patient ‘who tells me she is German, but I think she is 100% Jewish,’” she says.“Her name was Inbal. I said to my doctor it was an Israeli name and to tell her it means ‘inside of a bell [clapper],’” she relates.“Quite surprised, Inbal finally gave in to the German doctor, who introduced us. The morning of the evening of Yom Kippur, I called [her] and said these are the details, and please join us if you want,” she goes on.“Inbal was shocked. She was driving on [a highway] and almost had an accident,” she says. “She came in while her German husband stayed in the car outside – he thought it was a set-up.”Sharon remembers being heavily pregnant as she and Simon were shopping alongside a man also loading up on baby items. As they left the shop, Simon said to Sharon, “He’s 100% Jewish,” to which Sharon said: “Not again, the last one ended up being Iranian.”Simon quickly introduced himself.“The guy was from New York,” Sharon says, with nothing being mentioned about religion.Six months later, they received an email from the man.“I don’t know if you remember me but from the moment I met you, I couldn’t stop thinking you were Jewish but didn’t have the courage to ask,” he wrote.The man added that he had been practicing his Judaism privately and finally had become so upset about it that he did a deep Google search. The next Friday night, he was sitting at Sharon and Simon’s Shabbat table for dinner.Sharon tells The Media Line that in the early days, the Jews living there were nervous about organizing, and nothing in the way of Jewish groups was established.“It grew organically,” she explains.The Eders moved back to London in 2013 and had their third child there.“We were very much there at the beginning and the first ones to step out on the ice,” she says. “By the time we left, we had well-established traditions. We celebrated Jewish holidays, the Sabbath, even Hanukkah, camping in the desert. We brought the community to the next level.”Ranna and Giacomo Arazi“Giacomo [Jack] was [approached] for a job in finance in Dubai. Of course, I was hesitant at the beginning – knowing that no community or Jewish life existed there did make it a bit daunting,” Ranna Arazi tells The Media Line.“With a background in communications and media, and Jack’s in economics, in the first few years we started our own multi-brand exhibitions company for luxury motor shows and property exhibitions held in malls and international financial centers,” she states.Giacomo was born and raised in Italy. His mother was from Lebanon, his father from Syria. Ranna’s parents were both born in Tehran.“It was like one big holiday in the beginning,” she notes. “I had friends from the UAE through travel, and other friends. The Emiratis are well educated and worldly.”The Arazis were introduced to the Eders via mutual friends from the UK. They decided to get together regularly, and also wondered if there were other Jews living in Dubai.“We seemed to be like a magnet. People would call us up and say they were traveling through Dubai, were religious, and could they come for dinner,” Ranna says.“The Jewish community grew organically. We had nothing, no prayer books. Our prayers were all on iPads. But there must have been Jews in the UAE for many years prior and I presume they didn’t feel safe enough to come together. … It wasn’t something we were planning on making public at all,” she recalls.“We lived in a very large villa, hosting all the large festivals, and would invite Jewish people in the community and travelers. The Eders, and Jack and I, were the pillar-founding families, then others joined in. Sixty to 70 people were at our Seder table,” Ranna says.“Ross and Elli Kriel came for one of the holidays, and Ross, being a religious man, was interested in an Orthodox … minyan [where a quorum of 10 is required for public prayer]. However, we would all partake in [the] host’s home and respect each other’s religious observance,” she states.The Arazis have a son, Marco, and a daughter, Sara, who was born in 2009 in Dubai – although she could not obtain UAE nationality or a passport. Nationality is conferred only by blood or through marriage.“Marco was turning 12 and it was really important for us – and especially for Jack and his family – that he have a proper bar mitzvah,” Ranna says.“We didn’t want to bring up two teens in an Arab country,” she goes on. “I left Dubai a few months earlier than Jack, back to London, and Ross asked Jack if [he and Elli] could use our villa for the holidays, and then if they could kosher the kitchen. We introduced them to the landlord, and that is how our home became ‘The Villa’ in Dubai.”Elli and Ross KrielA mixture of South African and Greek, Elli Kriel was raised on the east coast of South Africa, near the city of Durban. Husband Ross grew up in Johannesburg in a completely secular home.“My grandfather was an enlightenment Jew,” Ross, an in-house lawyer for ENGIE, an energy company, tells The Media Line. “I turned 18 and realized I didn’t have a Jewish identity. It bothered me. Now, 30 years later, I am an Orthodox Jew living in Dubai.”Elli and Ross are a dynamic couple who anchor the Jewish community. When they arrived in 2013, they were the only religiously observant Jewish family in the area.“We were completely on our own: no rabbi, no synagogue, no parents as influencers. It generated the most exciting version of Judaism,” he reflects.“Thirty or 40 Jews lived in the community. We built it up brick-by-brick and created the Jewish Council of the Emirates,” he says.There is no resident rabbi. When a baby boy is born, the child’s family flies in a mohel to perform the circumcision.“The minyan began in my lounge, and then I leased The Villa on behalf of the Jewish Council of the Emirates in 2015,” he explains.The Villa serves as a community center, the Kriels the community backbone.“I have been the de facto leader of the community for many years, and the community has been gathering since 2010,” Ross says.Formally established in 2019, the Jewish Council of the Emirates is the umbrella body for all of the area’s Jewish communities, as well as the official link to government.The Kriel children were born in South Africa and came to Dubai when they were three and four years old, respectively. Today, they are among 90 children in the first through the seventh grades and attend the International School.Synagogue attendance has been suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic, but plans are in formation for a larger place of worship.Ross explains that while the Jewish community has remained below the general public’s radar, it is well known to Emirati officials.“We made every effort to communicate our presence and were received with a warm welcome,” he states. “Here we discovered our Judaism. Our amazing story is about our ability to rise to the circumstances. … Our presence here [is] the beginning of something hopeful about the way Jews, Muslims and Christians can work together.”Elli’s Kosher KitchenFor travel to Dubai as a kosher Jew when Elli and Ross began their journey, a wide range of basic staples including flour, oil and tuna were available. But, according to Elli, “there was nothing anyone could eat.”Elli, who holds a doctorate in the sociology of religions and ironically studied exclusion and inclusion in multicultural contexts, began a takeout establishment from her home, offering full, hearty meals to local Jews and visitors. She would feed many of her customers in her home, eventually sending food packages to more than 400 travelers listed in her database.“I’m self-taught,” she tells The Media Line, “and learned my love of cooking from my grandmother. I have all of her hand-written recipes. I was also influenced by my community in South Africa, and a lot of women share their recipes with me regularly.”Elli sees the Jewish community in South Africa and how social change impacted on the experience as an example of the thesis she wrote for her doctorate. She explains that identity and belonging are key underlying themes.“My life in Dubai seems to be an extension of these ideas,” she says proudly.When the UAE hosted the Interfaith Global Conference for Human Fraternity, attended by Pope Francis, Elli catered for the Jewish delegates. Weeks later, her business was launched. From babkas and Grandma’s matzah ball soup to zatar-and-olive challah and aubergine borekas, her offerings are loved by Emiratis.Elli was featured recently in the National, a Gulf newspaper, where she describes her food fare as “kosherati” – kosher cooking with an Emirati twist.Elli’s Kitchen has plans to expand and establish a restaurant that will be able to handle incoming tourists and local trade. She is also looking forward to importing kosher food products to the Emirates.Alex Peterfreund“I saw an opportunity to move but was very concerned that, because of my religious background, I was moving not only to a physical desert but to a spiritual one and would find myself in a little room eating a traditional gefilte fish for Shabbat,” Alex Peterfreund tells The Media Line.A 54-year-old divorcee and businessman who is originally from Antwerp and works in the diamond industry, Alex instead found himself sharing his first Friday night dinner with the Kriels at their home, not having known that a fellow Orthodox Jew lived in Dubai.During the meal, Ross asked Alex about his plans for the next morning. When Alex replied “I’m praying in my home in the morning,” Ross responded by suggesting: “If you’re praying in your home and I in mine, why shouldn’t we pray together?”It became a practice.“Every Sabbath morning, we prayed as though we were 200 people praying with the Torah,” Alex says. “Eventually, a third Jewish guy from Canada of Moroccan descent came, and then a fourth – his father taught in a French school when he was a child – and suddenly a miracle happened. We had a minyan.”The community has since outgrown The Villa and is seeking funding to establish a cultural, religious and business center where all denominations can pray and gather.“We see the center as the Jewish business card of the Emirates,” he states.When asked about a Jewish cemetery, he says there is none – “but it’s an interesting question!”London’s Marble Arch Synagogue donated the Orthodox community’s first Torah, the handwritten scroll of the Five Books of Moses.“Today we are a community of somewhere between 200 and 300 people, and on the Sabbath, maybe 30. The community is made up of people from many professions, including lawyers, doctors, businessmen and people in media,” he explains.“We as Jews have always been discreet in the UAE, and people listen to the rules of this country and to the authority,” Alex says.“We pray for the rulers of Dubai and Abu Dhabi, just as Jews do in England, Paris or New York for their home country of residence,” he proudly tells The Media Line.Beth Margolis Rupp: Leading the Way in Abu Dhabi“In 2008, my husband, David, our children and I visited Abu Dhabi for the first time to determine if we could live there and feel safe as a Jewish family, to live and learn about the Gulf region, and to give our youngest son a chance to learn about the region. But the 2008 economic downturn was a challenge for architects,” Beth Margolis Rupp tells The Media Line, referring to her husband’s profession.Beth had worked in Jewish education in the previous decades and was founding director of the Satell Teen Fellowship for Leadership and Social Activism. She designed and implemented numerous programs on conservation, environmental and social justice for Philadelphia youth both in the United States and in Israel. She also taught about the universal lessons of the Holocaust.“I did all this with both Jewish and secular lenses in America,” she says.It was an easy transition for Beth to work remotely for Satell, so in 2009, they made the move with their youngest child after a second scouting trip.“Our child was seven years old then and went to Jewish preschool and synagogue in Philadelphia while our older children were in college. How do you tell your child to keep religion private without shame?” she says. “When we first moved to the UAE, it was a time when Jewish people were not revealing their identity. We sought out the Jewish community.”Professionally, husband David became project director for award-winning buildings, including The Gate, The Sun and Sky Tower, and eventually the Louvre Abu Dhabi.“I was still working in the US remotely as director of the Satell Fellowship…, then got a job with New York University and subsequently worked at the American Community School in Abu Dhabi, where my son attended. I was also a research associate for the Institute for International Security at Khalifa University,” she notes.“Before connecting with many Jewish families in Abu Dhabi, we traveled to Cairo for our first Passover in the [region]. We needed a place to keep [the] Passover [laws and rituals],” Beth says. “Abu Dhabi was still somewhat lonely for us that first year. Our son asked the Four Questions at a Seder [the Passover ritual meal] in Cairo.”In 2009, when NYU President John Sexton announced that a university campus would be hosted in Abu Dhabi, he invited the school’s Jewish chaplain, Rabbi Yehuda Sarna, to join him in interviewing young high school students seeking admission, albeit without revealing Sarna’s Jewish identity.Starting in 2010, the rabbi began traveling to the UAE “once or twice a year.” In 2019, he became the UAE’s first chief rabbi.Traveling to the UAE “roughly every other month” since taking up the post, he tells The Media Line he “had no idea” that the Abraham Accord was going to happen. He now predicts that the UAE will have “several full time rabbis” in the coming years.Beth wrote to Sarna to learn how Jewish faculty and students would observe Jewish life while living in the Gulf, and requested a meeting upon his visit to the Gulf. They met when he accompanied Sexton on one of his visits.Meanwhile, she wanted to find other Jews in the Emirates.“As we met people, we invited them for Shabbat. We met Sharon and Simon, and through them, Elli and Ross. We collected people and families over time. We met Jewish people from around the globe,” she explains.“We created a Jewish women’s group, and several times the women would come to Abu Dhabi to see… our way of life. AJC [the American Jewish Committee] sent a group of young Jewish college women to Ziad University, and I took them around and gave them an understanding of life in Dubai,” she relates.Educating their son in Judaism was important to the Rupps.“We had a mezuzah,” she says, referring to a religious scroll attached to the outside of a home’s doorpost, where it is seen by passers-by. “But it was on the inside of the door.”She recalls that on one Rosh Hashana, her son took apples and honey to school. Dipping slices of apple in honey is a traditional way people wish one another a sweet year during the holiday.“Another boy noticed it and asked if he, too, had eaten it at home [the previous] night. They became friends, and years later studied for their bar mitzvas together,” she says.At the same time that Beth was home-schooling her son in Jewish studies, a Jewish woman was offering instruction in Hebrew.Prof. Joel Bernstein was recruited early on by NYU to teach chemistry in Abu Dhabi. His life partner, Tzipi Springer-Eynot, was an Israeli born in Kazakhstan who had landed in Israel by way of a post-war German DP camp. She went with him on their scouting trip.“On the flight, I noticed Israel was not part of the map of the Middle East and I told Joel I don’t want to go to place which doesn’t recognize Israel as a country,” Tzipi tells The Media Line. “When we arrived, we met staff and were taken for a tour. I [nevertheless] found the place intriguing and unique.”Having a background in teaching, Tzipi was asked to provide instruction for a student from Hungary who wanted to continue his studies of the Hebrew language. Suddenly, there were 15 students from around the world, including Yemen, Jordan and Morocco, who wanted to learn Hebrew.“I taught them bi-weekly,” she says. “They had a willingness to learn, and curiosity. I taught them about the Jewish holidays as well.”The ‘tale of the wandering Jew’ and the need for Jews to find one another is illustrated by Beth Margolis Rupp’s anecdotes of the people who have traveled through, and those who have sought each other out. It turns out that she, too, was a player who was being noticed without her knowing it.“I was honored to be invited to the home of Sheikh Nayhan bin Mubarak Al Nayhan, the minister of culture, youth and social development, to his Eid majilas – events in the homes of the leadership in the country where they make themselves accessible and converse on various topics, offering the sheikhs the opportunity to hear from the people,” she relates. “I was with the sheikh for a few minutes, and then escorted back to the women’s section for dinner.”Meanwhile, Beth’s work at NYU was in researching NGOs, governmental institutions and religious institutions and the way they were meeting the needs of societies.“I saw the religious institutions providing comfort and resources to [the] people,” she states. “I spent time speaking to imams, with various churches, and went to Hindu temples.”Beth describes as “unnerving” a telephone call she received from Rev. Andrew Thompson, head of Abu Dhabi’s St. Andrews Anglican Church, who was seeking out someone who knew what was going on in the city’s Jewish community. Not surprisingly, though, after several meetings, the reverend became an invited guest at the Rupp’s Shabbat table.“It takes three cups of coffee to become friends with someone, and that’s the way it was in Abu Dhabi,” Beth says.In 2013, Rev. Thompson convened a meeting of religious leaders in the home of the deputy chief of mission at the United States Embassy, Ethan A. Goldrich.Representatives showed up to talk about their community, and the concept of a book on tolerance evolved. The reverend knew the crown prince, sheikhs and government officials, and he brought the concept to them. Several years later it became Celebrating Tolerance.The Rupps left the UAE to be with Beth’s dad, who was getting on in years.“I helped build an amazing, vibrant Jewish community,” she says. “It was rich, not one denomination – not only Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, Reconstructionist or secular. I also realize how grateful I am to Ross [Kriel] and the Orthodox Jewish community, and the deep importance of the need to have a minyan. These people held the principles of Jewish life together and created the opportunities for everybody to be there.”Would she go back?“I’d move back,” she says, “in a heartbeat.”Jean CandiotteBorn and raised in Bethpage, New York, a writer and producer of video content for multimedia platforms, Jean Candiotte told her lawyer husband Barry Greenberg one snowy January morning in 2014 that she had a chance to do a Skype call for a job in Dubai. Barry, too, was seeking his next big gig.Jean had been working with multinational entertainment companies, including News Corp, Viacom and NBC Universal. This was an opportunity to be a creative director for OSN, a Dubai-based direct-broadcast company.“I interviewed in January, signed a contract in February, and two months later, we were in Dubai. The flight was on a Friday, we arrived on Saturday, and I began working on Sunday,” she tells The Media Line.“On Monday night, my husband Barry and I were partaking of a communal Passover meal, the Seder. Elli and Ross [Kriel] and other community members were at one of two Seders,” she relates.Jean’s mother was raised Orthodox, and her father, if asked, would state “I’m Sephardi!” The family attended a Conservative synagogue, where Jean had a bat mitzvah. Barry had less of a Jewish experience growing up.Jean notes that “many of us arrived in Dubai not wanting to make our Jewish identity known” to the wider public.“For me it started changing during the past year or so because of the Year of Tolerance, which the UAE government announced in 2019, and [because Crown Prince] Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed announced plans for the Abrahamic Family house, which would be a multi-faith campus and educational center consisting of a mosque, a church and a synagogue,” she explains. “The UAE is proving how progressive they have been in this area.”In 2016, Beth Margolis Rupp, together with Jean and Ross Kriel, were asked to write and edit the chapter dedicated to the UAE’s Jewish community in Celebrating Tolerance, which by this time had been commissioned by a government ministry.“Our story of ‘coming out’ and being accepted was [in a] chapter celebrating 12 minority religious communities in the UAE,” she says. “It was published in 2019, and a copy was given to Pope Francis during his visit to the UAE – his first to a Gulf country – when he signed the Document of Fraternity.”Jean notes that a quote in the chapter “expresses [their] sentiment.” It says: “We are neighbors here, and if you look back, you’ll see that we are actually each other’s family from long ago. You may see us wearing our Hand of Miriam as you wear the Hand of Fatima. We are grateful for our lives here, for the opportunity to be recognized by the UAE government, and for being able to share our story.”Jean says: “We felt acknowledged in a wonderful way. It acknowledged our community and I felt great about living in a community doing so much about tolerance.”In March 2020, she was asked to speak to the European Parliament in Brussels as part of a conference about tolerance. Rev. Thompson was one of several speakers. The keynote speaker was H.E. Dr. Ali Rashid Al Nuaimi, chairman of Hedayah, the International Center of Excellence for Countering Violent Extremism, and a member of the UAE Federal National Council based in Abu Dhabi. He traveled from Abu Dhabi to attend along with his staff.“These points got us over the mountain to the place we are today,” she states.“It’s been personal growth that has kept me here, and for my husband a great career opportunity,” Jean says. “The overall experience in the UAE has been exciting, and made us want to stay.”Rebecca and YoniAustralia-raised Rebecca – who prefers to keep her family name private – was born in Botswana to Israeli parents, who then moved to New Zealand and finally Australia, where she spent her adolescent years.Rebecca moved back to Dubai a second time because of a job opportunity. She also missed life in the Middle East.The family of her husband, Yoni, had moved to Singapore from Israel. Yoni’s father was born in pre-state Israel. His mother came from an Orthodox family. Yoni himself was raised on Kibbutz Bror Hayil near Ashkelon, founded by Egyptian Jews.Rebecca is Sephardi on her Tunisian mother’s side and Ashkenazi on her Polish father’s side. Her dad grew up attending synagogue but the family was not fully observant.Yoni and Rebecca met in Australia, where they were married in a civil ceremony. Three months after arriving in Dubai in 2012, they traveled through Jordan to Israel, where they underwent an additional ceremony.During their first time living in the UAE, Yoni was hired as a design researcher for NYU Abu Dhabi, and Rebecca, a trained psychologist, worked at a well-known clinic in Dubai. There was no formal Jewish community then, but according to Rebecca, NYU’s chaplain, Rabbi Sarna, “directed us to the blossoming Jewish community in Dubai, where we would come and spend Shabbat with Elli and Ross [Kriel], and often stay with them.”As the community began to establish itself, the couple left to raise their two children in Australia. But missing the Dubai clinic, which in the interim had grown, Rebecca was anxious to return, which the family did in 2019. Yoni is now head of design for an online real estate portal.Raising their young daughters in the UAE, they spend a lot of time with the Kriel Family, among others, celebrating Shabbat and holidays.“Online Jewish lessons, as well as online Shabbat services because of COVID-19, maintain our Jewish identity,” Rebecca tells The Media Line.“The government here has been working hard with Ross [Kriel] to establish a place of Jewish worship. The community development authority has to issue a license for the Jewish community to have its space and to be able to practice, as it does for any denomination, be it churches or temples,” she states.Breakaway SynagogueAn old Jewish joke says that when a synagogue reaches its 11th man – one beyond the quorum for public prayer – a second synagogue is born. Rabbi Levi Duchman, who is associated with the Chabad movement (which is not officially recognized by the UAE government), recently established a second synagogue in the Emirates.Duchman, according to members of the Jewish community, had been attending the Orthodox minyan for the previous five years. He appointed Solly Wolf, who attended services during High Holy Days, as president. The synagogue does not call itself Chabad.Jewish Businessmen, Rabbis and Former Government OfficialsJewish businessmen have been trailblazers in opening the nexus between the United States and Dubai, as well as Israel.Eli Epstein of Westchester, New York, began flying to Dubai 30 years ago for business as CEO of a large petroleum by-product company. During the years, he would bring rabbis and introduce top members of the American Jewish Committee to government officials.“I was helping the AJC with introductions in the UAE, and the Jewish community was beginning to organize a Shabbat gathering in local hotels,” he tells The Media Line.Epstein played a significant role as a conduit to some leading Emirati businesspeople, including Mohamed Alabbar, the impressive entrepreneur who built the Burj Khalifa skyscraper. He dedicated a Torah scroll for the community in honor of Alabbar, who witnessed the ceremony.“The Torah has an Arabic dedication on the front acknowledging Mohamed’s leadership and the inspiration he offered to his generation,” Epstein says. “He spoke to the community on a Friday night and stayed for dinner. Mohamed played a key role for many I introduced him to.”In addition to the scroll from London’s Marble Arch Synagogue, there is a third, this one from Temple Brith Shalom in Erie, Pennsylvania.Epstein is considered a trailblazer.“I didn’t know I was this,” he says, referring to the description.“Over the years I became someone trusted, which enabled me to bring rabbis,” he states. “Over time, the Emirates realized that not all Jews are Israelis. I was early in the game. I didn’t sign up as a trailblazer. Frankly, I am changed. My worldview changed and I even pray differently because of Islam.”Describing Epstein’s role from the perspective of the UAE’s Jewish community, Jean Candiotte tells The Media Line: “Eli is the poster child for being active in business and interactive in government, and therefore one of those people who help create the friendship between the UAE and the Jewish community.”Looking ahead, Epstein says: “We’re heading into the blue yonder. It’s a watershed for Israel and the region, a harbinger of strategic realignment of the Middle East. Two years from now, we’ll look back, amazed at what happened. No one can count on America; in the Middle East, you are your own first responder.”There have been many others who have frequented the UAE, working to open a dialogue among faiths and achieve recognition for the Jewish community on the Arabian Peninsula. They include Rabbi David Rosen, the AJC’s international director of religious affairs; Rabbi Y. Dov Krakowski of the Orthodox Union; Rabbi Dov Goldstein; Stephen M. Greenberg and Malcolm Hoenlein of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations; Rabbi Marc Schneier, president of the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding; and Rabbi Michael Schudrich, the chief rabbi of Poland. In addition, Rabbis Marvin Heir and Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center have spent considerable time engaging the Emirates.“The early Simon Wiesenthal Center missions to the UAE were real eye-openers. We had the opportunity to meet with a young dynamic Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, and with open-minded business leaders like Mohamed Alabbar, who revealed to us a place where our faith and our people were not merely tolerated, but respected,” Rabbi Cooper, associate dean and director of the Global Social Action Agenda for the Wiesenthal Center, tells The Media Line.“It cannot be lost on anyone that all this takes place in the UAE as the last Jews of Yemen are hounded out of homes they have lived in for over a thousand years,” Cooper adds. “Only a fanatic Jew-hater like the Ayatollah Khamenei, who backs the Houthis [in Yemen], can be celebrating that an Arab nation is about to become Judenrein. Contrast this as the ruler of Abu Dhabi, His Majesty, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, as well as Dubai’s Sheikh Mohamed, pave the way for more Jewish people to come to Dubai.”Under the radarAlthough news of ongoing contacts between officials from Israel and the UAE continue to surface, many visits by Israelis have been, and will continue to be, under the radar. These include government figures, Mossad agents, executives from defense and security companies as well as other strategic partnerships.In 2018, then-minister of sport Miri Regev escorted Israel’s national team to the International Judo Federation Grand Slam in Abu Dhabi. The current director of the Mossad, Yossi Cohen, made a high-profile visit to the UAE after many clandestine meetings in the Gulf region, which cemented the recent deal toward normalization.In 2001, Dr. Efraim Sneh, a cabinet minister and retired brigadier general, traveled secretly to Dubai.“I was in the inner cabinet of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and went to the UAE for the purpose of establishing relations, and had very high-level meetings,” Sneh reveals to The Media Line. “Since then, I have been advocating between Israel and the Gulf countries, and have been there many times in the past year acting to cement relations between Israel and the UAE.”On waking up to the Abraham AccordRoss Kriel: “I thought many steps would be taken until we had full diplomatic recognition. People could see where it was going, so quickly as well. We hope that this is just the beginning and will invigorate completely new paradigms for people in the Middle East, one that is based on the ability to make change and move forward. … Five years ahead, Emirates and Israelis are so open to this. I’m hoping it produces better stability and economic growth.”Elli Kriel: “It’s an amazing turn of events. I was shocked, quite honestly, and thought the deal was coming in one year’s time. I thought things would open up for the Expo, but not this soon. We received a barrage of responses and it changed things here, too. It allows us to be public without any reservations. Before we had to be careful. … My daughter sang the UAE’s national anthem in Arabic, and it went viral. … This paves the way for positive and constructive development, setting an example how many cultures can live together in one small place. I do hope it will be received positively around the world.”Alex Peterfreund: “At 3 in the morning, when the news broke, I couldn’t sleep. I was chatting with Ross on WhatsApp thinking that in 10 years, there may be 20,000 Jews living in Dubai and we will be sitting in the back of the synagogue remembering those times when we prayed together. If you told me this deal was happening, I’d tell you science fiction is on the second floor.”Jean Candiotte: “I read it on my WhatsApp in disbelief; I felt I was in a dream. It is a great movement toward peace. We felt we had planted the seeds and it was growing, but I didn’t think I’d see it during my time living in the UAE.”Rebecca: “I felt it was coming. I have a lot of Emirati friends and clients [who are] well established in the community and hear a change in business and political points of view. I hear of the US soldiers coming here who were trained in Israel, and the sharing of knowledge. I think it’s the best news we could have possibly gotten. I happen to live here and have a great deal of respect for the leaders of this country, who decided with full knowledge that it might not be the most popular or expected decision, and it might cause different types of political friction with Arab countries that deal with the UAE moving forward. … I think it is amazing for locals here to get to know Israelis who want to see the world and explore. … I see more initial exploration, but with normalization, a lot more for business endeavors.”Sharon Eder: “I knew it was bubbling. I had relationships with Israelis who were trying to make that happen and wasn’t surprised. I think it’s great. What we had for these five years that helped make it happen was special for us. It gave us an identity.”Giacomo Arazi: I have always said a full Jewish community can only happen [together] with peace with Israel. And I think it’s an exciting time for the Jewish community of Dubai. It’s an exciting place to be, that looks to the future. So does Israel; so do the Jews. I’m very optimistic.”Beth Margolis Rupp: “I wish I [had been] in Dubai with the community for the announcement of the deal. I felt so proud of the community… on the ground.”Rabbi Yehuda Sarna: “I am predicting that we will see a burst of intellectual creativity in terms of cross-continent education between the US and the UAE, and Jewish/Arab relations and studies.”EpilogueIt’s nearing the first Sabbath in Dubai since the agreement to normalize relations was announced at the White House, and Omer Yankelevich, Israel’s minister of Diaspora affairs, Zooms into the community to teleconference an emotional greeting. (Her greeting follows congratulations delivered to the community by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu on the evening of the accord.)Ross Kriel takes extreme pride in the moment, graciously thanking all the Jews who came before him and who are there now, and all of the Jewish organizations and individuals who helped make the day possible.“There were other Jews in the UAE, perhaps each one thinking, ‘I’m the only one.’” Jean Candiotte says.Sharon Eder sees herself as something of a diplomat.“We had Arab neighbors who never met Jews before, and had an impact on them,” she says.The Jewish community of Dubai is clearly in transformation. It is opening a synagogue and kosher restaurant and is waiting with open arms to service businesspeople and tourists. The UAE has broken the glass ceiling in the Middle East, and this could not have happened without the Jews who reside there.“Jews came from all over … for two main reasons: work and safety,” Rabbi Sarna tells The Media Line.“It might sound ironic to some people that Jews feel safer in the UAE than they do in places in Europe or North America, but consider the rising antisemitism in those countries, excused in part by some prominent political voices,” he says. “Then come to the UAE and see the Year of Tolerance and the announcement of the Abrahamic Family House.”Alex Peterfreund says that for every Emirati going to Israel, there will be 200 Israelis coming to the UAE. He hopes the Emirati Jewish community can play a role in educating these travelers about the local culture and assist them with their needs, be it a place to pray or kosher food, Elli-style.Expo 2020 will be delayed until next year and will house a large Israeli pavilion – not the one Israel planned to open prior to the Abraham Accord.Jean sums it up.“I feel like it’s a great step forward toward peace and understanding,” she states. “It’s a moment of hope and optimism when most of the headlines are not feeding hope and optimism.”EDITOR’S NOTE: The author expresses her deep respect and appreciation to all who participated in the making of this article.

88,https://www.arabnews.com/node/1724201/world,"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Arab News,Taliban in Pakistan for peace talks,"ISLAMABAD: An Afghan Taliban political team arrived in Islamabad on Monday as part of efforts to help launch peace talks between Kabul and the insurgents, just days after Pakistan gave sweeping orders to enforce UN sanctions against the militant group.

The Taliban delegation, headed by political chief Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, will discuss “recent developments in Afghanistan’s peace process” with Pakistani leaders, as well as the “relaxation and facilitation of people’s movement and trade between the two neighboring countries,” said a tweet by a Taliban spokesman.

In a press conference early on Monday, Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said the meetings were meant to further the “aim” of bringing peace and stability to Afghanistan.

“I have invited them again and will have a detailed meeting with them tomorrow,” he told reporters, adding that he will share the outcome of the talks with media.

Other members of the Taliban team include Khairullah Khairkhwa, Mohammad Nabi Omari, Shahbuddin Dilawar, Qari Deen Muhammad and Abdul Latif Mansoor.

“Afghan Taliban officials routinely pay visits to other countries as part of our political strategy to convey our views about the peace process,” the Taliban spokesman said, adding that recent trips have been delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The Taliban’s arrival in Pakistan follows a statement by Pakistan’s foreign ministry that it would enforce 2015 UN-imposed penalties that target dozens of individuals, including Baradar and several members of the Haqqani family, including Sirajuddin, current head of the Haqqani network and deputy head of the Taliban.

The timing of the decision has been seen by some as a tactic to push the insurgent group into negotiations.

On Sunday the group said the sanctions could affect the peace process.

“These are not new sanctions, they were previously slapped on a number of members,” the Taliban said.

“But we are now entering into intra-Afghan negotiations and there is a need for travel, so of course these sanctions will hamper the peace process.”

But Qureshi said the officials were coming to Pakistan by invitation and that the peace process would not be affected by sanctions.

“We have invited them. We had a long and productive meeting in the foreign office with the Taliban delegation before the signing of the Doha agreement,” he said, referring to a US-Taliban deal signed in February that sets conditions for a US withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Earlier this month, the Afghan government agreed to release 400 “hardcore” Taliban prisoners, paving the way for peace talks to end almost two decades of war.

The insurgent group welcomed the decision and said it was ready to begin talks within 10 days of the release. The Afghan grand assembly, or Loya Jirga, the country’s most powerful institution, approved the release.

The Taliban militants had demanded the freedom of the 400, the last group among 5,000 other prisoners who were released earlier, as a condition to join peace talks.

Among the 400 are Taliban members accused of major attacks against civilians and foreigners, including a 2017 truck bombing near the German embassy in Kabul that killed more than 150 people — the deadliest attack in the 19-year campaign.

With the release, the Afghan government will fulfill its pledge to release a total of 5,000 Taliban prisoners.","ISLAMABAD: An Afghan Taliban political team arrived in Islamabad on Monday as part of efforts to help launch peace talks between Kabul and the insurgents, just days after Pakistan gave sweeping orders to enforce UN sanctions against the militant group.

Waves of positive change and growth seem to have been bypassing Nagaland, observes RN Ravi in his 74th Independence Day Speech



Kohima, August 15 (MExN): The Governor of Nagaland, RN Ravi stated that a ‘deeply entrenched network of vested interests” has emerged during peace period and they “misappropriated the dividends of Peace and did not allow them to reach the people.”

“There is mass scale mayhem and miscarriage of dreams and expectations of the people of Nagaland. It is unendurable and unacceptable,” he asserted in his customary message to the people of the State on the occasion of India’s 74th Independence Day.

The Governor said that the waves of positive transformation and growth are sweeping all parts of the country, and even the North-East is emerging as “an economic hub and is bracing to play a pivotal role in India’s Act East Policy.

“The region is emerging as a destination of choice by the investors from the rest of the country and the world who until recently were wary of even looking towards North East,” he said, adding that the impressive changes for are “quite visible in the neighboring States of the region.”

However, Ravi regretted that the waves of positive change and growth “seem to have been bypassing our State, Nagaland.”

Concerning issues

Although, Nagaland is the 16th State of the Indian Union and the second oldest State in the North East and endowed with one of the finest of human and natural resources, he noted that in recent years, the State is falling behind after initially racing ahead of several other States in the region despite odds.

“Unfortunately today it has the dubious distinction of the worst performing State in the Country including the North-East region on almost all the significant indicators of Human Development,” he said.

Highlighting some of the concerning issues, the Governor said that while human resource is one of the “most precious asset, crucial to fulfill the Naga dreams and aspiration,” it is on steady decline, noting that “some 25% of our children are not enrolled in the Schools and 60% of our youth have not seen High School.”

“Literacy in Nagaland may be technically over 80%, in reality; those who have not even been to High School cannot be called functionally literate,” he argued, wondering “positive contribution they can make to their family, their village, their community and the State.”

In addition, he pointed out that despite the highest pupil-teacher ratio in the State as compared to the rest of the country, the drop-out and failure rates in Government Schools were alarming.

“Absence of internet connectivity and Information Communication Technology facility in majority of our schools is holding back our youth in the global race for progress,” he said.

As a result, it is making online teaching, specially in COVID-19 situation, impossible, pushing them further behind, he added.

The Governor also termed the investment climate in Nagaland as “worrisome,” and called for building investment friendly eco-system so as to encourage investors from outside and within the State to have sufficient confidence to set up enterprises.

“Unfortunately Government job is the main source of employment and economy is largely based on salaries of Government servants,” he said.

“Even our agriculture and horticulture sectors which are the mainstay of our State’s economy are in distress. We have to encourage and incentivise entrepreneurship,” he added.

The Governor, however, noted that the relative decline is more “obvious during the recent decades.”

“When the security forces and the Naga armed groups agreed to suspend operations against each other paving the way for political settlement, the legitimate expectation of the people of Nagaland was dividends of peace – freedom from fear of guns, better health, better education, better infrastructure, better livelihood opportunities, an atmosphere to dream and an eco-system to pursue their dreams,” he stated.

Ravi attributed the decline to a “deeply entrenched network of vested interests has emerged during the period which has misappropriated the dividends of Peace and did not allow them to reach the people” and termed “mass scale mayhem and miscarriage of dreams and expectations of the people” as unendurable and unacceptable.

In India’s grand march forward, Nagaland cannot be left behind, he said, adding: “The people of Nagaland have their natural right of a dignified future.”

To achieve this, he called for building and strengthening institutions of accountability, justice and fair play.

“We will have to break the vice – like grip of the vicious circle of the network of vested interests and make way for the virtuous circle of peace, prosperity and happiness for our people.""

The Governor also maintained that the task cannot be achieved by Government alone.

“In this endeavor, we need the co-operation of the two million people of Nagaland. I have deep and abiding faith in the inherent goodness and capability of our people,” he added.","Governor of Nagaland RN Ravi addresses the people of Nagaland on the occasion of India’s 74th Independence Day on August 15.

90,https://thenewdawnliberia.com/sen-wesseh-calls-for-peace-holiday/,"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",The New Dawn Liberia,Sen. Wesseh calls for peace holiday,"River Gee County Senator ConmanyWesseh, who chairs the Senate committee on peace, reconciliation and good governance here is calling for a National Day of Peace to be celebrated on 18th August each year as a working holiday.

He says such day should be commemorated throughout the country characterized by thanksgiving, peace education andfestivals, including cultural, sports and other activities emphasizing, “never again to war” based on the causes and lessons of the Liberian civil war.

Addressing a press conference in Monrovia Tuesday, August 18, which marked the 17th Anniversary of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) brokered in Accra, Ghana that ended hostility in the country in 2004, Sen. Wesseh also suggested creation of a special national recognition for peace which could be done in two categories at separate ceremonies – one to be named Legislative Medal for Peace to be awarded annually by the Liberian Legislature to lawmakers whose Legislative leadership may have contributed in special ways to promotion and maintaining of peace in Liberia; and the other category could be called the State Medal of Peace to be awarded by the President of Liberia to individuals or organizations that have made extraordinary contributions to the promotion and maintaining of peace in the country.

“I believe that by taking these legislative actions in remembrance of the CPA, we could be reminding ourselves, the people we represent and those who stood by Liberia especially, those whose blood and sweat made us to be alive today that we made a promise for peace to keep and vow to renew in the best interest of our children and future generations”, he adds.

Liberians warring factions and civil society organizations met in the Ghanaian capital, Accra with support of the international community and signed a peace deal that ended 14 years of bloody civil war and ushered in a National Transition Government and subsequent democratic governance after disarmament of belligerent forces by 15,000-strong UN Peacekeeping forces.

Sen. Wesseh recalls that on August 18, 2003, Liberian leaders made a solemn and strong pledge to end the war by signing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement which was the outcome of three months (June to August) of negotiations.

He says by their signatures, the leaders, in the name of the Liberian people promised the country and the world at large that Liberia would never go to war with itself again; that Liberians would never allow the use of Liberian territory for war against its neighbors; that they would disarm themselves and remove weapons of destruction from the politics and rebuild, reform and re-create governing institutions such as the legislature, the executive and judiciary necessary for enduring peace, and use electoral means to choose leaders as provided for in the Constitution, among others.

He reflects that justice, truth and reconciliation will be Core Avenue to sustained peace; that Liberians would give hope to the children and young people of the country that there is a future for which to live and work; and, that they were fully and unwaveringly committed to peace, socio-economic progress, democracy, and above all, to love of country.

“On this 18th day of August, 2020, we the people of Liberia must be proud of ourselves that we have been keeping our pledge for peace. We the people should therefore celebrate that peace have won against war.

To continue the victory of peace over war, we must never allow any of our institutions or individual leaders to be so intolerant as to force our citizens to choose a foreign country to live as refugees fearing for their safety. We must continue to freely organize ourselves to pursue our political, religious and other wishes, ambitions, interests and beliefs; and we must express our views on all matters without fear, but guided by patriotism, truth and civility,” he pleads.

By E. J. Nathaniel Daygbor–Editing by Jonathan Browne","River Gee County Senator ConmanyWesseh, who chairs the Senate committee on peace, reconciliation and good governance here is calling for a National Day of Peace to be celebrated on 18th August each year as a working holiday.
He says such day should be commemorated throughout the country characterized by thanksgiving, peace education andfestivals, including cultural, sports and other activities emphasizing, “never again to war” based on the causes and lessons of the Liberian civil war.
Sen. Wesseh recalls that on August 18, 2003, Liberian leaders made a solemn and strong pledge to end the war by signing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement which was the outcome of three months (June to August) of negotiations.

The stunning announcement that Israel and the United Arab Emirates had brokered what came to be known as the Abraham Accord through the Trump Administration has brought the small Jewish community of the Emirates into the limelight of global interest.

The resilience of the Jews of the UAE is one of the most interesting stories in light of the anti-Jewish (or anti-Israel) sentiment and demise of many Jewish communities in the Middle East. It is the story of individuals from various backgrounds who, one by one, came to Dubai or Abu Dhabi and formed a community that played an important role in the developing deal.

Some of its first members were Sharon and Simon Eder, Ranna and Giacomo Arazi and Michael and Martine Nates, all coming in about 2008. There certainly were others, but they apparently had remained under the radar.

The UAE is located on the Gulf at the northeastern end of the Arabian Peninsula, bordering Oman to the east and Saudi Arabia to the south and west. As the name implies, it is a federation of seven political territories, each independently governed by its own emir.

The Emirate of Abu Dhabi, which serves as the capital, is joined by Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah, Sharjah and Umm Al Quwain. (Qatar and Kuwait, although emirates, are not part of the UAE.)

The seven entities are represented in the world community by their highest constitutional authority, the Federal Supreme Council.

Its president is one of the seven rulers. The current president is Abu Dhabi’s crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, ruler of the Emirate of Dubai, is vice president and prime minister of the UAE.

The largest population among the Emirates is in Dubai, with some 3.3 million people. Abu Dhabi’s population stands at 1.5 million.

Sharon and Simon Eder

Among the first known Jews to reside in Dubai in the 21st century were Sharon and Simon Eder, both born and raised in the United Kingdom.

Sharon’s mother was from Libya and her father from Iraq. Simon’s parents, both of Ashkenazi descent, grew up with strong Jewish identities. Sharon attended Hebrew school and Simon observed the Sabbath.

“Shock and negative reaction” is how Sharon describes the response by friends and family to the Eders’ decision to move to an Arab country, where Simon was offered a job in the conference industry.

“We were absolutely the first. I’m sure there were Jews there, but they didn’t really congregate,” Sharon tells The Media Line.

We were absolutely the first. I’m sure there were Jews there, but they didn’t really congregate

“Prior to leaving London, we received three different phone numbers [of couples known to be moving to Dubai]. Then we realized the three numbers were the same, and all belonged to Ranna and Jack Arazi, who also moved from the UK around the same time.”

Upon their arrival in the Gulf, the two families connected and began sharing traditional Friday night Shabbat dinners. The discussions always turned to the idea that there must be other Jews living there, too.

“We always spoke like the TV series Lost – there must be another part of the island,” Sharon says. “My husband would say randomly, ‘That person looks Jewish,’ and often we would get it wrong.”

Finally, a good friend of the Eders’ from London introduced them to another Jewish couple while they were slowly meeting others by chance. That was the starting point of the community.

“In 2009, I fell pregnant, and that played a big part for Simon and me. We’re really happy here; we both had strong Jewish identities; how long can this go on?” she recalls thinking at the time.

“At the time I got pregnant, I was traveling all over the world for my job, working for Bacardi, heading up the region from a local office in Dubai,” she relates.

“I was five months pregnant [in 2010] and we decided to fly to Sri Lanka for Passover. As chance would have it, we went to Chabad and the rabbi said, ‘This is crazy, I never knew anybody from Dubai,’ but [the previous day] a man [had come] to him from Abu Dhabi,” she says.

Sharon explains to The Media Line that the man had been in the Middle East for decades. He was the head of an institution in Abu Dhabi and spoke 12 languages flawlessly.

“We decided to call him up,” she says.

“At that point, I was due in August,” she continues, “and we basically would stay in Dubai for the holidays and try to get a rabbi to come. He knew other Jews and enabled [them to practice their Judaism]. We sent out emails and asked if anyone was interested in getting a rabbi for the holidays.”

They contacted the Chabad rabbi in Sri Lanka, who came for Yom Kippur, staying a week.

“It was held in an apartment and was a big success, with 35 people attending,” she says. “After that, Sabbath dinners were held in different homes. There was a lot of excitement because either people had been practicing in secret for many years or hadn’t practiced for many years in the Arab nation.”

Sharon notes that the community was so diverse that “if we got together, the traditions followed were based on the host family.”

They were meeting people, Jew by Jew.

The Eders had two children born in Dubai and had to fly in a mohel to perform the ritual circumcision. Ironically, the night before the brit mila ceremony, they received a call from a Jewish person living in Lebanon who also needed a mohel. A day later, the couple and their child flew into Dubai for their own circumcision ceremony.

Sharon shares another story of Jew-connecting-to-Jew.

“My German obstetrician said he had a Jewish patient ‘who tells me she is German, but I think she is 100% Jewish,’” she says.

“Her name was Inbal. I said to my doctor it was an Israeli name and to tell her it means ‘inside of a bell [clapper],’” she relates.

“Quite surprised, Inbal finally gave in to the German doctor, who introduced us. The morning of the evening of Yom Kippur, I called [her] and said these are the details, and please join us if you want,” she goes on.

“Inbal was shocked. She was driving on [a highway] and almost had an accident,” she says. “She came in while her German husband stayed in the car outside – he thought it was a set-up.”

Sharon remembers being heavily pregnant as she and Simon were shopping alongside a man also loading up on baby items. As they left the shop, Simon said to Sharon, “He’s 100% Jewish,” to which Sharon said: “Not again, the last one ended up being Iranian.”

Simon quickly introduced himself.

“The guy was from New York,” Sharon says, with nothing being mentioned about religion.

Six months later, they received an email from the man.

“I don’t know if you remember me but from the moment I met you, I couldn’t stop thinking you were Jewish but didn’t have the courage to ask,” he wrote.

The man added that he had been practicing his Judaism privately and finally had become so upset about it that he did a deep Google search. The next Friday night, he was sitting at Sharon and Simon’s Shabbat table for dinner.

Sharon tells The Media Line that in the early days, the Jews living there were nervous about organizing, and nothing in the way of Jewish groups was established.

“It grew organically,” she explains.

The Eders moved back to London in 2013 and had their third child there.

“We were very much there at the beginning and the first ones to step out on the ice,” she says. “By the time we left, we had well-established traditions. We celebrated Jewish holidays, the Sabbath, even Hanukkah, camping in the desert. We brought the community to the next level.”

Ranna and Giacomo Arazi

“Giacomo [Jack] was [approached] for a job in finance in Dubai. Of course, I was hesitant at the beginning – knowing that no community or Jewish life existed there did make it a bit daunting,” Ranna Arazi tells The Media Line.

“With a background in communications and media, and Jack’s in economics, in the first few years we started our own multi-brand exhibitions company for luxury motor shows and property exhibitions held in malls and international financial centers,” she states.

Giacomo was born and raised in Italy. His mother was from Lebanon, his father from Syria. Ranna’s parents were both born in Tehran.

“It was like one big holiday in the beginning,” she notes. “I had friends from the UAE through travel, and other friends. The Emiratis are well educated and worldly.”

The Arazis were introduced to the Eders via mutual friends from the UK. They decided to get together regularly, and also wondered if there were other Jews living in Dubai.

“We seemed to be like a magnet. People would call us up and say they were traveling through Dubai, were religious, and could they come for dinner,” Ranna says.

“The Jewish community grew organically. We had nothing, no prayer books. Our prayers were all on iPads. But there must have been Jews in the UAE for many years prior and I presume they didn’t feel safe enough to come together. … It wasn’t something we were planning on making public at all,” she recalls.

“We lived in a very large villa, hosting all the large festivals, and would invite Jewish people in the community and travelers. The Eders, and Jack and I, were the pillar-founding families, then others joined in. Sixty to 70 people were at our Seder table,” Ranna says.

“Ross and Elli Kriel came for one of the holidays, and Ross, being a religious man, was interested in an Orthodox … minyan [where a quorum of 10 is required for public prayer]. However, we would all partake in [the] host’s home and respect each other’s religious observance,” she states.

The Arazis have a son, Marco, and a daughter, Sara, who was born in 2009 in Dubai – although she could not obtain UAE nationality or a passport. Nationality is conferred only by blood or through marriage.

“Marco was turning 12 and it was really important for us – and especially for Jack and his family – that he have a proper bar mitzvah,” Ranna says.

“We didn’t want to bring up two teens in an Arab country,” she goes on. “I left Dubai a few months earlier than Jack, back to London, and Ross asked Jack if [he and Elli] could use our villa for the holidays, and then if they could kosher the kitchen. We introduced them to the landlord, and that is how our home became ‘The Villa’ in Dubai.”

Elli and Ross Kriel

A mixture of South African and Greek, Elli Kriel was raised on the east coast of South Africa, near the city of Durban. Husband Ross grew up in Johannesburg in a completely secular home.

“My grandfather was an enlightenment Jew,” Ross, an in-house lawyer for ENGIE, an energy company, tells The Media Line. “I turned 18 and realized I didn’t have a Jewish identity. It bothered me. Now, 30 years later, I am an Orthodox Jew living in Dubai.”

Elli and Ross are a dynamic couple who anchor the Jewish community. When they arrived in 2013, they were the only religiously observant Jewish family in the area.

“We were completely on our own: no rabbi, no synagogue, no parents as influencers. It generated the most exciting version of Judaism,” he reflects.

“Thirty or 40 Jews lived in the community. We built it up brick-by-brick and created the Jewish Council of the Emirates,” he says.

There is no resident rabbi. When a baby boy is born, the child’s family flies in a mohel to perform the circumcision.

“The minyan began in my lounge, and then I leased The Villa on behalf of the Jewish Council of the Emirates in 2015,” he explains.

The Villa serves as a community center, the Kriels the community backbone.

“I have been the de facto leader of the community for many years, and the community has been gathering since 2010,” Ross says.

Formally established in 2019, the Jewish Council of the Emirates is the umbrella body for all of the area’s Jewish communities, as well as the official link to government.

The Kriel children were born in South Africa and came to Dubai when they were three and four years old, respectively. Today, they are among 90 children in the first through the seventh grades and attend the International School.

Synagogue attendance has been suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic, but plans are in formation for a larger place of worship.

Ross explains that while the Jewish community has remained below the general public’s radar, it is well known to Emirati officials.

“We made every effort to communicate our presence and were received with a warm welcome,” he states. “Here we discovered our Judaism. Our amazing story is about our ability to rise to the circumstances. … Our presence here [is] the beginning of something hopeful about the way Jews, Muslims and Christians can work together.”

Elli’s Kosher Kitchen

For travel to Dubai as a kosher Jew when Elli and Ross began their journey, a wide range of basic staples including flour, oil and tuna were available. But, according to Elli, “there was nothing anyone could eat.”

Elli, who holds a doctorate in the sociology of religions and ironically studied exclusion and inclusion in multicultural contexts, began a takeout establishment from her home, offering full, hearty meals to local Jews and visitors. She would feed many of her customers in her home, eventually sending food packages to more than 400 travelers listed in her database.

“I’m self-taught,” she tells The Media Line, “and learned my love of cooking from my grandmother. I have all of her hand-written recipes. I was also influenced by my community in South Africa, and a lot of women share their recipes with me regularly.”

Elli sees the Jewish community in South Africa and how social change impacted on the experience as an example of the thesis she wrote for her doctorate. She explains that identity and belonging are key underlying themes.

“My life in Dubai seems to be an extension of these ideas,” she says proudly.

When the UAE hosted the Interfaith Global Conference for Human Fraternity, attended by Pope Francis, Elli catered for the Jewish delegates. Weeks later, her business was launched. From babkas and Grandma’s matzah ball soup to zatar-and-olive challah and aubergine borekas, her offerings are loved by Emiratis.

Elli was featured recently in the National, a Gulf newspaper, where she describes her food fare as “kosherati” – kosher cooking with an Emirati twist.

Elli’s Kitchen has plans to expand and establish a restaurant that will be able to handle incoming tourists and local trade. She is also looking forward to importing kosher food products to the Emirates.

Alex Peterfreund

“I saw an opportunity to move but was very concerned that, because of my religious background, I was moving not only to a physical desert but to a spiritual one and would find myself in a little room eating a traditional gefilte fish for Shabbat,” Alex Peterfreund tells The Media Line.

A 54-year-old divorcee and businessman who is originally from Antwerp and works in the diamond industry, Alex instead found himself sharing his first Friday night dinner with the Kriels at their home, not having known that a fellow Orthodox Jew lived in Dubai.

During the meal, Ross asked Alex about his plans for the next morning. When Alex replied “I’m praying in my home in the morning,” Ross responded by suggesting: “If you’re praying in your home and I in mine, why shouldn’t we pray together?”

If you’re praying in your home and I in mine, why shouldn’t we pray together?

It became a practice.

“Every Sabbath morning, we prayed as though we were 200 people praying with the Torah,” Alex says. “Eventually, a third Jewish guy from Canada of Moroccan descent came, and then a fourth – his father taught in a French school when he was a child – and suddenly a miracle happened. We had a minyan.”

The community has since outgrown The Villa and is seeking funding to establish a cultural, religious and business center where all denominations can pray and gather.

“We see the center as the Jewish business card of the Emirates,” he states.

When asked about a Jewish cemetery, he says there is none – “but it’s an interesting question!”

London’s Marble Arch Synagogue donated the Orthodox community’s first Torah, the handwritten scroll of the Five Books of Moses.

“Today we are a community of somewhere between 200 and 300 people, and on the Sabbath, maybe 30. The community is made up of people from many professions, including lawyers, doctors, businessmen and people in media,” he explains.

“We as Jews have always been discreet in the UAE, and people listen to the rules of this country and to the authority,” Alex says.

“We pray for the rulers of Dubai and Abu Dhabi, just as Jews do in England, Paris or New York for their home country of residence,” he proudly tells The Media Line.

Beth Margolis Rupp: Leading the Way in Abu Dhabi

“In 2008, my husband, David, our children and I visited Abu Dhabi for the first time to determine if we could live there and feel safe as a Jewish family, to live and learn about the Gulf region, and to give our youngest son a chance to learn about the region. But the 2008 economic downturn was a challenge for architects,” Beth Margolis Rupp tells The Media Line, referring to her husband’s profession.

Beth had worked in Jewish education in the previous decades and was founding director of the Satell Teen Fellowship for Leadership and Social Activism. She designed and implemented numerous programs on conservation, environmental and social justice for Philadelphia youth both in the United States and in Israel. She also taught about the universal lessons of the Holocaust.

“I did all this with both Jewish and secular lenses in America,” she says.

It was an easy transition for Beth to work remotely for Satell, so in 2009, they made the move with their youngest child after a second scouting trip.

“Our child was seven years old then and went to Jewish preschool and synagogue in Philadelphia while our older children were in college. How do you tell your child to keep religion private without shame?” she says. “When we first moved to the UAE, it was a time when Jewish people were not revealing their identity. We sought out the Jewish community.”

Professionally, husband David became project director for award-winning buildings, including The Gate, The Sun and Sky Tower, and eventually the Louvre Abu Dhabi.

“I was still working in the US remotely as director of the Satell Fellowship…, then got a job with New York University and subsequently worked at the American Community School in Abu Dhabi, where my son attended. I was also a research associate for the Institute for International Security at Khalifa University,” she notes.

“Before connecting with many Jewish families in Abu Dhabi, we traveled to Cairo for our first Passover in the [region]. We needed a place to keep [the] Passover [laws and rituals],” Beth says. “Abu Dhabi was still somewhat lonely for us that first year. Our son asked the Four Questions at a Seder [the Passover ritual meal] in Cairo.”

In 2009, when NYU President John Sexton announced that a university campus would be hosted in Abu Dhabi, he invited the school’s Jewish chaplain, Rabbi Yehuda Sarna, to join him in interviewing young high school students seeking admission, albeit without revealing Sarna’s Jewish identity.

Starting in 2010, the rabbi began traveling to the UAE “once or twice a year.” In 2019, he became the UAE’s first chief rabbi.

Traveling to the UAE “roughly every other month” since taking up the post, he tells The Media Line he “had no idea” that the Abraham Accord was going to happen. He now predicts that the UAE will have “several full time rabbis” in the coming years.

Beth wrote to Sarna to learn how Jewish faculty and students would observe Jewish life while living in the Gulf, and requested a meeting upon his visit to the Gulf. They met when he accompanied Sexton on one of his visits.

Meanwhile, she wanted to find other Jews in the Emirates.

“As we met people, we invited them for Shabbat. We met Sharon and Simon, and through them, Elli and Ross. We collected people and families over time. We met Jewish people from around the globe,” she explains.

“We created a Jewish women’s group, and several times the women would come to Abu Dhabi to see… our way of life. AJC [the American Jewish Committee] sent a group of young Jewish college women to Ziad University, and I took them around and gave them an understanding of life in Dubai,” she relates.

Educating their son in Judaism was important to the Rupps.

“We had a mezuzah,” she says, referring to a religious scroll attached to the outside of a home’s doorpost, where it is seen by passers-by. “But it was on the inside of the door.”

We had a mezuzah. But it was on the inside of the door

She recalls that on one Rosh Hashana, her son took apples and honey to school. Dipping slices of apple in honey is a traditional way people wish one another a sweet year during the holiday.

“Another boy noticed it and asked if he, too, had eaten it at home [the previous] night. They became friends, and years later studied for their bar mitzvas together,” she says.

At the same time that Beth was home-schooling her son in Jewish studies, a Jewish woman was offering instruction in Hebrew.

Prof. Joel Bernstein was recruited early on by NYU to teach chemistry in Abu Dhabi. His life partner, Tzipi Springer-Eynot, was an Israeli born in Kazakhstan who had landed in Israel by way of a post-war German DP camp. She went with him on their scouting trip.

“On the flight, I noticed Israel was not part of the map of the Middle East and I told Joel I don’t want to go to place which doesn’t recognize Israel as a country,” Tzipi tells The Media Line. “When we arrived, we met staff and were taken for a tour. I [nevertheless] found the place intriguing and unique.”

Having a background in teaching, Tzipi was asked to provide instruction for a student from Hungary who wanted to continue his studies of the Hebrew language. Suddenly, there were 15 students from around the world, including Yemen, Jordan and Morocco, who wanted to learn Hebrew.

“I taught them bi-weekly,” she says. “They had a willingness to learn, and curiosity. I taught them about the Jewish holidays as well.”

The ‘tale of the wandering Jew’ and the need for Jews to find one another is illustrated by Beth Margolis Rupp’s anecdotes of the people who have traveled through, and those who have sought each other out. It turns out that she, too, was a player who was being noticed without her knowing it.

“I was honored to be invited to the home of Sheikh Nayhan bin Mubarak Al Nayhan, the minister of culture, youth and social development, to his Eid majilas – events in the homes of the leadership in the country where they make themselves accessible and converse on various topics, offering the sheikhs the opportunity to hear from the people,” she relates. “I was with the sheikh for a few minutes, and then escorted back to the women’s section for dinner.”

I was with the sheikh for a few minutes, and then escorted back to the women’s section for dinner

Meanwhile, Beth’s work at NYU was in researching NGOs, governmental institutions and religious institutions and the way they were meeting the needs of societies.

“I saw the religious institutions providing comfort and resources to [the] people,” she states. “I spent time speaking to imams, with various churches, and went to Hindu temples.”

Beth describes as “unnerving” a telephone call she received from Rev. Andrew Thompson, head of Abu Dhabi’s St. Andrews Anglican Church, who was seeking out someone who knew what was going on in the city’s Jewish community. Not surprisingly, though, after several meetings, the reverend became an invited guest at the Rupp’s Shabbat table.

“It takes three cups of coffee to become friends with someone, and that’s the way it was in Abu Dhabi,” Beth says.

In 2013, Rev. Thompson convened a meeting of religious leaders in the home of the deputy chief of mission at the United States Embassy, Ethan A. Goldrich.

Representatives showed up to talk about their community, and the concept of a book on tolerance evolved. The reverend knew the crown prince, sheikhs and government officials, and he brought the concept to them. Several years later it became Celebrating Tolerance.

The Rupps left the UAE to be with Beth’s dad, who was getting on in years.

“I helped build an amazing, vibrant Jewish community,” she says. “It was rich, not one denomination – not only Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, Reconstructionist or secular. I also realize how grateful I am to Ross [Kriel] and the Orthodox Jewish community, and the deep importance of the need to have a minyan. These people held the principles of Jewish life together and created the opportunities for everybody to be there.”

Would she go back?

“I’d move back,” she says, “in a heartbeat.”

Jean Candiotte

Born and raised in Bethpage, New York, a writer and producer of video content for multimedia platforms, Jean Candiotte told her lawyer husband Barry Greenberg one snowy January morning in 2014 that she had a chance to do a Skype call for a job in Dubai. Barry, too, was seeking his next big gig.

Jean had been working with multinational entertainment companies, including News Corp, Viacom and NBC Universal. This was an opportunity to be a creative director for OSN, a Dubai-based direct-broadcast company.

“I interviewed in January, signed a contract in February, and two months later, we were in Dubai. The flight was on a Friday, we arrived on Saturday, and I began working on Sunday,” she tells The Media Line.

“On Monday night, my husband Barry and I were partaking of a communal Passover meal, the Seder. Elli and Ross [Kriel] and other community members were at one of two Seders,” she relates.

Jean’s mother was raised Orthodox, and her father, if asked, would state “I’m Sephardi!” The family attended a Conservative synagogue, where Jean had a bat mitzvah. Barry had less of a Jewish experience growing up.

Jean notes that “many of us arrived in Dubai not wanting to make our Jewish identity known” to the wider public.

“For me it started changing during the past year or so because of the Year of Tolerance, which the UAE government announced in 2019, and [because Crown Prince] Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed announced plans for the Abrahamic Family house, which would be a multi-faith campus and educational center consisting of a mosque, a church and a synagogue,” she explains. “The UAE is proving how progressive they have been in this area.”

The UAE is proving how progressive they have been in this area

In 2016, Beth Margolis Rupp, together with Jean and Ross Kriel, were asked to write and edit the chapter dedicated to the UAE’s Jewish community in Celebrating Tolerance, which by this time had been commissioned by a government ministry.

“Our story of ‘coming out’ and being accepted was [in a] chapter celebrating 12 minority religious communities in the UAE,” she says. “It was published in 2019, and a copy was given to Pope Francis during his visit to the UAE – his first to a Gulf country – when he signed the Document of Fraternity.”

Jean notes that a quote in the chapter “expresses [their] sentiment.” It says: “We are neighbors here, and if you look back, you’ll see that we are actually each other’s family from long ago. You may see us wearing our Hand of Miriam as you wear the Hand of Fatima. We are grateful for our lives here, for the opportunity to be recognized by the UAE government, and for being able to share our story.”

Jean says: “We felt acknowledged in a wonderful way. It acknowledged our community and I felt great about living in a community doing so much about tolerance.”

In March 2020, she was asked to speak to the European Parliament in Brussels as part of a conference about tolerance. Rev. Thompson was one of several speakers. The keynote speaker was H.E. Dr. Ali Rashid Al Nuaimi, chairman of Hedayah, the International Center of Excellence for Countering Violent Extremism, and a member of the UAE Federal National Council based in Abu Dhabi. He traveled from Abu Dhabi to attend along with his staff.

“These points got us over the mountain to the place we are today,” she states.

“It’s been personal growth that has kept me here, and for my husband a great career opportunity,” Jean says. “The overall experience in the UAE has been exciting, and made us want to stay.”

Rebecca and Yoni

Australia-raised Rebecca – who prefers to keep her family name private – was born in Botswana to Israeli parents, who then moved to New Zealand and finally Australia, where she spent her adolescent years.

Rebecca moved back to Dubai a second time because of a job opportunity. She also missed life in the Middle East.

The family of her husband, Yoni, had moved to Singapore from Israel. Yoni’s father was born in pre-state Israel. His mother came from an Orthodox family. Yoni himself was raised on Kibbutz Bror Hayil near Ashkelon, founded by Egyptian Jews.

Rebecca is Sephardi on her Tunisian mother’s side and Ashkenazi on her Polish father’s side. Her dad grew up attending synagogue but the family was not fully observant.

Yoni and Rebecca met in Australia, where they were married in a civil ceremony. Three months after arriving in Dubai in 2012, they traveled through Jordan to Israel, where they underwent an additional ceremony.

During their first time living in the UAE, Yoni was hired as a design researcher for NYU Abu Dhabi, and Rebecca, a trained psychologist, worked at a well-known clinic in Dubai. There was no formal Jewish community then, but according to Rebecca, NYU’s chaplain, Rabbi Sarna, “directed us to the blossoming Jewish community in Dubai, where we would come and spend Shabbat with Elli and Ross [Kriel], and often stay with them.”

As the community began to establish itself, the couple left to raise their two children in Australia. But missing the Dubai clinic, which in the interim had grown, Rebecca was anxious to return, which the family did in 2019. Yoni is now head of design for an online real estate portal.

Raising their young daughters in the UAE, they spend a lot of time with the Kriel Family, among others, celebrating Shabbat and holidays.

“The government here has been working hard with Ross [Kriel] to establish a place of Jewish worship. The community development authority has to issue a license for the Jewish community to have its space and to be able to practice, as it does for any denomination, be it churches or temples,” she states.

Breakaway Synagogue

An old Jewish joke says that when a synagogue reaches its 11th man – one beyond the quorum for public prayer – a second synagogue is born. Rabbi Levi Duchman, who is associated with the Chabad movement (which is not officially recognized by the UAE government), recently established a second synagogue in the Emirates.

Duchman, according to members of the Jewish community, had been attending the Orthodox minyan for the previous five years. He appointed Solly Wolf, who attended services during High Holy Days, as president. The synagogue does not call itself Chabad.

Jewish Businessmen, Rabbis and Former Government Officials

Jewish businessmen have been trailblazers in opening the nexus between the United States and Dubai, as well as Israel.

Eli Epstein of Westchester, New York, began flying to Dubai 30 years ago for business as CEO of a large petroleum by-product company. During the years, he would bring rabbis and introduce top members of the American Jewish Committee to government officials.

“I was helping the AJC with introductions in the UAE, and the Jewish community was beginning to organize a Shabbat gathering in local hotels,” he tells The Media Line.

Epstein played a significant role as a conduit to some leading Emirati businesspeople, including Mohamed Alabbar, the impressive entrepreneur who built the Burj Khalifa skyscraper. He dedicated a Torah scroll for the community in honor of Alabbar, who witnessed the ceremony.

“The Torah has an Arabic dedication on the front acknowledging Mohamed’s leadership and the inspiration he offered to his generation,” Epstein says. “He spoke to the community on a Friday night and stayed for dinner. Mohamed played a key role for many I introduced him to.”

In addition to the scroll from London’s Marble Arch Synagogue, there is a third, this one from Temple Brith Shalom in Erie, Pennsylvania.

Epstein is considered a trailblazer.

“I didn’t know I was this,” he says, referring to the description.

“Over the years I became someone trusted, which enabled me to bring rabbis,” he states. “Over time, the Emirates realized that not all Jews are Israelis. I was early in the game. I didn’t sign up as a trailblazer. Frankly, I am changed. My worldview changed and I even pray differently because of Islam.”

Describing Epstein’s role from the perspective of the UAE’s Jewish community, Jean Candiotte tells The Media Line: “Eli is the poster child for being active in business and interactive in government, and therefore one of those people who help create the friendship between the UAE and the Jewish community.”

Looking ahead, Epstein says: “We’re heading into the blue yonder. It’s a watershed for Israel and the region, a harbinger of strategic realignment of the Middle East. Two years from now, we’ll look back, amazed at what happened. No one can count on America; in the Middle East, you are your own first responder.”

There have been many others who have frequented the UAE, working to open a dialogue among faiths and achieve recognition for the Jewish community on the Arabian Peninsula. They include Rabbi David Rosen, the AJC’s international director of religious affairs; Rabbi Y. Dov Krakowski of the Orthodox Union; Rabbi Dov Goldstein; Stephen M. Greenberg and Malcolm Hoenlein of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations; Rabbi Marc Schneier, president of the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding; and Rabbi Michael Schudrich, the chief rabbi of Poland. In addition, Rabbis Marvin Heir and Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center have spent considerable time engaging the Emirates.

“The early Simon Wiesenthal Center missions to the UAE were real eye-openers. We had the opportunity to meet with a young dynamic Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, and with open-minded business leaders like Mohamed Alabbar, who revealed to us a place where our faith and our people were not merely tolerated, but respected,” Rabbi Cooper, associate dean and director of the Global Social Action Agenda for the Wiesenthal Center, tells The Media Line.

“It cannot be lost on anyone that all this takes place in the UAE as the last Jews of Yemen are hounded out of homes they have lived in for over a thousand years,” Cooper adds. “Only a fanatic Jew-hater like the Ayatollah Khamenei, who backs the Houthis [in Yemen], can be celebrating that an Arab nation is about to become Judenrein. Contrast this as the ruler of Abu Dhabi, His Majesty, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, as well as Dubai’s Sheikh Mohamed, pave the way for more Jewish people to come to Dubai.”

Under the radar

Although news of ongoing contacts between officials from Israel and the UAE continue to surface, many visits by Israelis have been, and will continue to be, under the radar. These include government figures, Mossad agents, executives from defense and security companies as well as other strategic partnerships.

In 2018, then-minister of sport Miri Regev escorted Israel’s national team to the International Judo Federation Grand Slam in Abu Dhabi. The current director of the Mossad, Yossi Cohen, made a high-profile visit to the UAE after many clandestine meetings in the Gulf region, which cemented the recent deal toward normalization.

In 2001, Dr. Efraim Sneh, a cabinet minister and retired brigadier general, traveled secretly to Dubai.

“I was in the inner cabinet of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and went to the UAE for the purpose of establishing relations, and had very high-level meetings,” Sneh reveals to The Media Line. “Since then, I have been advocating between Israel and the Gulf countries, and have been there many times in the past year acting to cement relations between Israel and the UAE.”

On waking up to the Abraham Accord

Ross Kriel: “I thought many steps would be taken until we had full diplomatic recognition. People could see where it was going, so quickly as well. We hope that this is just the beginning and will invigorate completely new paradigms for people in the Middle East, one that is based on the ability to make change and move forward. … Five years ahead, Emirates and Israelis are so open to this. I’m hoping it produces better stability and economic growth.”

Elli Kriel: “It’s an amazing turn of events. I was shocked, quite honestly, and thought the deal was coming in one year’s time. I thought things would open up for the Expo, but not this soon. We received a barrage of responses and it changed things here, too. It allows us to be public without any reservations. Before we had to be careful. … My daughter sang the UAE’s national anthem in Arabic, and it went viral. … This paves the way for positive and constructive development, setting an example how many cultures can live together in one small place. I do hope it will be received positively around the world.”

Alex Peterfreund: “At 3 in the morning, when the news broke, I couldn’t sleep. I was chatting with Ross on WhatsApp thinking that in 10 years, there may be 20,000 Jews living in Dubai and we will be sitting in the back of the synagogue remembering those times when we prayed together. If you told me this deal was happening, I’d tell you science fiction is on the second floor.”

Jean Candiotte: “I read it on my WhatsApp in disbelief; I felt I was in a dream. It is a great movement toward peace. We felt we had planted the seeds and it was growing, but I didn’t think I’d see it during my time living in the UAE.”

It is a great movement toward peace. We felt we had planted the seeds and it was growing, but I didn’t think I’d see it during my time living in the UAE

Rebecca: “I felt it was coming. I have a lot of Emirati friends and clients [who are] well established in the community and hear a change in business and political points of view. I hear of the US soldiers coming here who were trained in Israel, and the sharing of knowledge. I think it’s the best news we could have possibly gotten. I happen to live here and have a great deal of respect for the leaders of this country, who decided with full knowledge that it might not be the most popular or expected decision, and it might cause different types of political friction with Arab countries that deal with the UAE moving forward. … I think it is amazing for locals here to get to know Israelis who want to see the world and explore. … I see more initial exploration, but with normalization, a lot more for business endeavors.”

Sharon Eder: “I knew it was bubbling. I had relationships with Israelis who were trying to make that happen and wasn’t surprised. I think it’s great. What we had for these five years that helped make it happen was special for us. It gave us an identity.”

Giacomo Arazi: I have always said a full Jewish community can only happen [together] with peace with Israel. And I think it’s an exciting time for the Jewish community of Dubai. It’s an exciting place to be, that looks to the future. So does Israel; so do the Jews. I’m very optimistic.”

Beth Margolis Rupp: “I wish I [had been] in Dubai with the community for the announcement of the deal. I felt so proud of the community… on the ground.”

Rabbi Yehuda Sarna: “I am predicting that we will see a burst of intellectual creativity in terms of cross-continent education between the US and the UAE, and Jewish/Arab relations and studies.”

Epilogue

It’s nearing the first Sabbath in Dubai since the agreement to normalize relations was announced at the White House, and Omer Yankelevich, Israel’s minister of Diaspora affairs, Zooms into the community to teleconference an emotional greeting. (Her greeting follows congratulations delivered to the community by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu on the evening of the accord.)

Ross Kriel takes extreme pride in the moment, graciously thanking all the Jews who came before him and who are there now, and all of the Jewish organizations and individuals who helped make the day possible.

“There were other Jews in the UAE, perhaps each one thinking, ‘I’m the only one.’” Jean Candiotte says.

Sharon Eder sees herself as something of a diplomat.

“We had Arab neighbors who never met Jews before, and had an impact on them,” she says.

The Jewish community of Dubai is clearly in transformation. It is opening a synagogue and kosher restaurant and is waiting with open arms to service businesspeople and tourists. The UAE has broken the glass ceiling in the Middle East, and this could not have happened without the Jews who reside there.

“Jews came from all over … for two main reasons: work and safety,” Rabbi Sarna tells The Media Line.

“It might sound ironic to some people that Jews feel safer in the UAE than they do in places in Europe or North America, but consider the rising anti-Semitism in those countries, excused in part by some prominent political voices,” he says. “Then come to the UAE and see the Year of Tolerance and the announcement of the Abrahamic Family House.”

Alex Peterfreund says that for every Emirati going to Israel, there will be 200 Israelis coming to the UAE. He hopes the Emirati Jewish community can play a role in educating these travelers about the local culture and assist them with their needs, be it a place to pray or kosher food, Elli-style.

Expo 2020 will be delayed until next year and will house a large Israeli pavilion – not the one Israel planned to open prior to the Abraham Accord.

Jean sums it up.

“I feel like it’s a great step forward toward peace and understanding,” she states. “It’s a moment of hope and optimism when most of the headlines are not feeding hope and optimism.”

The resilience of the Jews of the UAE is one of the most interesting stories in light of the anti-Jewish (or anti-Israel) sentiment and demise of many Jewish communities in the Middle East.

It is the story of individuals from various backgrounds who, one by one, came to Dubai or Abu Dhabi and formed a community that played an important role in the developing deal.

Some of its first members were Sharon and Simon Eder, Ranna and Giacomo Arazi and Michael and Martine Nates, all arriving in about 2008. There certainly were others, but they had apparently remained under the radar.

The UAE is located on the Gulf at the northeastern end of the Arabian Peninsula, bordering Oman to the east and Saudi Arabia to the south and west. As the name implies, it is a federation of seven political territories, each independently governed by its own emir.

The Emirate of Abu Dhabi, which serves as the capital, is joined by Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah, Sharjah and Umm Al Quwain. (Qatar and Kuwait, although emirates, are not part of the UAE.)

The seven entities are represented in the world community by their highest constitutional authority, the Federal Supreme Council.

Its president is one of the seven rulers. The current president is Abu Dhabi’s crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, ruler of the Emirate of Dubai, is vice president and prime minister of the UAE.

Dubai has the largest population among the Emirates, with some 3.3 million people. Abu Dhabi’s population stands at 1.5 million.

Sharon and Simon Eder

Among the first known Jews to reside in Dubai in the 21st century were Sharon and Simon Eder, both born and raised in the United Kingdom.

Sharon’s mother was from Libya and her father from Iraq. Simon’s parents, both of Ashkenazi descent, grew up with strong Jewish identities. Sharon attended Hebrew school and Simon observed Shabbat.

“Shock and negative reaction” is how Sharon describes the response by friends and family to the Eders’ decision to move to an Arab country, where Simon was offered a job in the conference industry.

“We were absolutely the first. I’m sure there were Jews there, but they didn’t really congregate,” Sharon tells The Media Line.

“Prior to leaving London, we received three different phone numbers [of couples known to be moving to Dubai]. Then we realized the three numbers were the same, and all belonged to Ranna and Jack Arazi, who also moved from the UK around the same time.”

Upon their arrival in the Gulf, the two families connected and began sharing traditional Shabbat dinners. The discussions always turned to the idea that there must be other Jews living there, too.

“We always spoke like the TV series Lost – there must be another part of the island,” Sharon says. “My husband would say randomly, ‘That person looks Jewish,’ and often we would get it wrong.”

Finally, a good friend of the Eders’ from London introduced them to another Jewish couple while they were slowly meeting others by chance. That was the starting point of the community.

“In 2009, I fell pregnant, and that played a big part for Simon and me. We’re really happy here; we both had strong Jewish identities; how long can this go on?” she recalls thinking at the time.

“At the time I got pregnant, I was traveling all over the world for my job, working for Bacardi, heading up the region from a local office in Dubai,” she relates.

“I was five months pregnant [in 2010] and we decided to fly to Sri Lanka for Passover. As chance would have it, we went to Chabad and the rabbi said, ‘This is crazy, I never knew anybody from Dubai,’ but [the previous day] a man [had come] to him from Abu Dhabi,” she says.

Sharon explains to The Media Line that the man had been in the Middle East for decades. He was the head of an institution in Abu Dhabi and spoke 12 languages flawlessly.

“We decided to call him up,” she says.

“At that point, I was due in August,” she continues, “and we basically would stay in Dubai for the holidays and try to get a rabbi to come. He knew other Jews and enabled [them to practice their Judaism]. We sent out emails and asked if anyone was interested in getting a rabbi for the holidays.”

They contacted the Chabad rabbi in Sri Lanka, who came for Yom Kippur, staying a week.

“It was held in an apartment and was a big success, with 35 people attending,” she says. “After that, Sabbath dinners were held in different homes. There was a lot of excitement because either people had been practicing in secret for many years or hadn’t practiced for many years in the Arab nation.”

Sharon notes that the community was so diverse that “if we got together, the traditions followed were based on the host family.”

They were meeting people, Jew by Jew.

The Eders had two children born in Dubai and had to fly in a mohel to perform the ritual circumcision. Ironically, the night before the brit mila ceremony, they received a call from a Jewish person living in Lebanon who also needed a mohel. A day later, the couple and their child flew into Dubai for their own circumcision ceremony.

Sharon shares another story of Jew-connecting-to-Jew.

“My German obstetrician said he had a Jewish patient ‘who tells me she is German, but I think she is 100% Jewish,’” she says.

“Her name was Inbal. I said to my doctor it was an Israeli name and to tell her it means ‘inside of a bell [clapper],’” she relates.

“Quite surprised, Inbal finally gave in to the German doctor, who introduced us. The morning of the evening of Yom Kippur, I called [her] and said these are the details, and please join us if you want,” she goes on.

“Inbal was shocked. She was driving on [a highway] and almost had an accident,” she says. “She came in while her German husband stayed in the car outside – he thought it was a set-up.”

Sharon remembers being heavily pregnant as she and Simon were shopping alongside a man also loading up on baby items. As they left the shop, Simon said to Sharon, “He’s 100% Jewish,” to which Sharon said: “Not again, the last one ended up being Iranian.”

Simon quickly introduced himself.

“The guy was from New York,” Sharon says, with nothing being mentioned about religion.

Six months later, they received an email from the man.

“I don’t know if you remember me but from the moment I met you, I couldn’t stop thinking you were Jewish but didn’t have the courage to ask,” he wrote.

The man added that he had been practicing his Judaism privately and finally had become so upset about it that he did a deep Google search. The next Friday night, he was sitting at Sharon and Simon’s Shabbat table for dinner.

Sharon tells The Media Line that in the early days, the Jews living there were nervous about organizing, and nothing in the way of Jewish groups was established.

“It grew organically,” she explains.

The Eders moved back to London in 2013 and had their third child there.

“We were very much there at the beginning and the first ones to step out on the ice,” she says. “By the time we left, we had well-established traditions. We celebrated Jewish holidays, the Sabbath, even Hanukkah, camping in the desert. We brought the community to the next level.”

Ranna and Giacomo Arazi

“Giacomo [Jack] was [approached] for a job in finance in Dubai. Of course, I was hesitant at the beginning – knowing that no community or Jewish life existed there did make it a bit daunting,” Ranna Arazi says.

“With a background in communications and media, and Jack’s in economics, in the first few years we started our own multi-brand exhibitions company for luxury motor shows and property exhibitions held in malls and international financial centers.”

Giacomo was born and raised in Italy. His mother was from Lebanon, his father from Syria. Ranna’s parents were both born in Tehran.

“It was like one big holiday in the beginning,” she notes. “I had friends from the UAE through travel, and other friends. The Emiratis are well educated and worldly.”

The Arazis were introduced to the Eders via mutual friends from the UK. They decided to get together regularly, and also wondered if there were other Jews living in Dubai.

“We seemed to be like a magnet. People would call us up and say they were traveling through Dubai, were religious, and could they come for dinner,” Ranna says.

“The Jewish community grew organically. We had nothing, no prayer books. Our prayers were all on iPads. But there must have been Jews in the UAE for many years prior and I presume they didn’t feel safe enough to come together. … It wasn’t something we were planning on making public at all,” she recalls.

“We lived in a very large villa, hosting all the large festivals, and would invite Jewish people in the community and travelers. The Eders, and Jack and I, were the pillar-founding families, then others joined in. Sixty to 70 people were at our Seder table,” Ranna says.

“Ross and Elli Kriel came for one of the holidays, and Ross, being a religious man, was interested in an Orthodox … minyan [where a quorum of 10 is required for public prayer]. However, we would all partake in [the] host’s home and respect each other’s religious observance,” she states.

The Arazis have a son, Marco, and a daughter, Sara, who was born in 2009 in Dubai – although she could not obtain UAE nationality or a passport. Nationality is conferred only by blood or through marriage.

“Marco was turning 12 and it was really important for us – and especially for Jack and his family – that he have a proper bar mitzvah,” Ranna says.

“We didn’t want to bring up two teens in an Arab country,” she goes on. “I left Dubai a few months earlier than Jack, back to London, and Ross asked Jack if [he and Elli] could use our villa for the holidays, and then if they could kosher the kitchen. We introduced them to the landlord, and that is how our home became ‘The Villa’ in Dubai.”

Elli and Ross Kriel

A mixture of South African and Greek, Elli Kriel was raised on the east coast of South Africa, near the city of Durban. Husband Ross grew up in Johannesburg in a completely secular home.

“My grandfather was an enlightenment Jew,”says Ross, an in-house lawyer for ENGIE, an energy company. “I turned 18 and realized I didn’t have a Jewish identity. It bothered me. Now, 30 years later, I am an Orthodox Jew living in Dubai.”

Elli and Ross are a dynamic couple who anchor the Jewish community. When they arrived in 2013, they were the only religiously observant Jewish family in the area.

“We were completely on our own: no rabbi, no synagogue, no parents as influencers. It generated the most exciting version of Judaism,” he reflects.

“Thirty or 40 Jews lived in the community. We built it up brick-by-brick and created the Jewish Council of the Emirates,” he says.

There is no resident rabbi. When a baby boy is born, the child’s family flies in a mohel to perform the circumcision.

“The minyan began in my lounge, and then I leased The Villa on behalf of the Jewish Council of the Emirates in 2015,” he explains.

The Villa serves as a community center, the Kriels the community backbone.

“I have been the de facto leader of the community for many years, and the community has been gathering since 2010,” Ross says.

Formally established in 2019, the Jewish Council of the Emirates is the umbrella body for all of the area’s Jewish communities, as well as the official link to government.

The Kriel children were born in South Africa and came to Dubai when they were three and four years old, respectively. Today, they are among 90 children in the first through the seventh grades and attend the International School.

Synagogue attendance has been suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic, but plans are in formation for a larger place of worship.

Ross explains that while the Jewish community has remained below the general public’s radar, it is well known to Emirati officials.

“We made every effort to communicate our presence and were received with a warm welcome,” he states. “Here we discovered our Judaism. Our amazing story is about our ability to rise to the circumstances. … Our presence here [is] the beginning of something hopeful about the way Jews, Muslims and Christians can work together.”

Elli’s Kosher Kitchen

For travel to Dubai as a kosher Jew when Elli and Ross began their journey, a wide range of basic staples including flour, oil and tuna were available. But, according to Elli, “there was nothing anyone could eat.”

Elli, who holds a doctorate in the sociology of religions and ironically studied exclusion and inclusion in multicultural contexts, began a takeout establishment from her home, offering full, hearty meals to local Jews and visitors. She would feed many of her customers in her home, eventually sending food packages to more than 400 travelers listed in her database.

“I’m self-taught,” she says, “and learned my love of cooking from my grandmother. I have all of her hand-written recipes. I was also influenced by my community in South Africa, and a lot of women share their recipes with me regularly.”

Elli sees the Jewish community in South Africa and how social change impacted on the experience as an example of the thesis she wrote for her doctorate. She explains that identity and belonging are key underlying themes.

“My life in Dubai seems to be an extension of these ideas,” she says proudly.

When the UAE hosted the Interfaith Global Conference for Human Fraternity, attended by Pope Francis, Elli catered for the Jewish delegates. Weeks later, her business was launched. From babkas and Grandma’s matzah ball soup to zatar-and-olive challah and aubergine borekas, her offerings are loved by Emiratis.

Elli was featured recently in the National, a Gulf newspaper, where she describes her food fare as “kosherati” – kosher cooking with an Emirati twist.

Elli’s Kitchen has plans to expand and establish a restaurant that will be able to handle incoming tourists and local trade. She is also looking forward to importing kosher food products to the Emirates.

Alex Peterfreund

“I saw an opportunity to move but was very concerned that, because of my religious background, I was moving not only to a physical desert but to a spiritual one and would find myself in a little room eating a traditional gefilte fish for Shabbat,” Alex Peterfreund says.

A 54-year-old divorcee and businessman who is originally from Antwerp and works in the diamond industry, Alex instead found himself sharing his first Friday night dinner with the Kriels at their home, not having known that a fellow Orthodox Jew lived in Dubai.

During the meal, Ross asked Alex about his plans for the next morning. When Alex replied “I’m praying in my home in the morning,” Ross responded by suggesting: “If you’re praying in your home and I in mine, why shouldn’t we pray together?”

It became a practice.

“Every Sabbath morning, we prayed as though we were 200 people praying with the Torah,” Alex says. “Eventually, a third Jewish guy from Canada of Moroccan descent came, and then a fourth – his father taught in a French school when he was a child – and suddenly a miracle happened. We had a minyan.”

The community has since outgrown The Villa and is seeking funding to establish a cultural, religious and business center where all denominations can pray and gather.

“We see the center as the Jewish business card of the Emirates,” he states.

When asked about a Jewish cemetery, he says there is none – “but it’s an interesting question!”

London’s Marble Arch Synagogue donated the Orthodox community’s first Torah scroll.

“Today we are a community of somewhere between 200 and 300 people, and on the Sabbath, maybe 30. The community is made up of people from many professions, including lawyers, doctors, businessmen and people in media,” he explains.

“We as Jews have always been discreet in the UAE, and people listen to the rules of this country and to the authority,” Alex says.

“We pray for the rulers of Dubai and Abu Dhabi, just as Jews do in England, Paris or New York for their home country of residence,” he proudly says.

Beth Margolis Rupp: Leading the Way in Abu Dhabi

“In 2008, my husband, David, our children and I visited Abu Dhabi for the first time to determine if we could live there and feel safe as a Jewish family, to live and learn about the Gulf region, and to give our youngest son a chance to learn about the region. But the 2008 economic downturn was a challenge for architects,” Beth Margolis Rupp says, referring to her husband’s profession.

Beth had worked in Jewish education in the previous decades and was founding director of the Satell Teen Fellowship for Leadership and Social Activism. She designed and implemented numerous programs on conservation, environmental and social justice for Philadelphia youth both in the United States and in Israel. She also taught about the universal lessons of the Holocaust.

“I did all this with both Jewish and secular lenses in America,” she says.

It was an easy transition for Beth to work remotely for Satell, so in 2009, they made the move with their youngest child after a second scouting trip.

“Our child was seven years old then and went to Jewish preschool and synagogue in Philadelphia while our older children were in college. How do you tell your child to keep religion private without shame?” she says.

“When we first moved to the UAE, it was a time when Jewish people were not revealing their identity. We sought out the Jewish community.”

Professionally, husband David became project director for award-winning buildings, including The Gate, The Sun and Sky Tower, and eventually the Louvre Abu Dhabi.

“I was still working in the U.S. remotely as director of the Satell Fellowship…, then got a job with New York University and subsequently worked at the American Community School in Abu Dhabi, where my son attended. I was also a research associate for the Institute for International Security at Khalifa University,” she says.

“Before connecting with many Jewish families in Abu Dhabi, we traveled to Cairo for our first Passover in the [region]. We needed a place to keep [the] Passover [laws and rituals],” Beth says.

“Abu Dhabi was still somewhat lonely for us that first year. Our son asked the Four Questions at a [Passover] Seder in Cairo.”

In 2009, when NYU President John Sexton announced that a university campus would be hosted in Abu Dhabi, he invited the school’s Jewish chaplain, Rabbi Yehuda Sarna, to join him in interviewing young high school students seeking admission, albeit without revealing Sarna’s Jewish identity.

Starting in 2010, the rabbi began traveling to the UAE “once or twice a year.” In 2019, he became the UAE’s first chief rabbi.

Traveling to the UAE “roughly every other month” since taking up the post, he says he “had no idea” that the Abraham Accord was going to happen. He now predicts that the UAE will have “several full time rabbis” in the coming years.

Beth wrote to Sarna to learn how Jewish faculty and students would observe Jewish life while living in the Gulf, and requested a meeting upon his visit to the Gulf. They met when he accompanied Sexton on one of his visits.

Meanwhile, she wanted to find other Jews in the Emirates.

“As we met people, we invited them for Shabbat. We met Sharon and Simon, and through them, Elli and Ross. We collected people and families over time. We met Jewish people from around the globe,” she explains.

“We created a Jewish women’s group, and several times the women would come to Abu Dhabi to see… our way of life. AJC [the American Jewish Committee] sent a group of young Jewish college women to Ziad University, and I took them around and gave them an understanding of life in Dubai,” she relates.

Educating their son in Judaism was important to the Rupps.

“We had a mezuzah,” she says, referring to a religious scroll attached to the outside of a home’s doorpost, where it is seen by passers-by. “But it was on the inside of the door.”

She recalls that on one Rosh Hashanah, her son took apples and honey to school. Dipping slices of apple in honey is a traditional way people wish one another a sweet year during the holiday.

“Another boy noticed it and asked if he, too, had eaten it at home [the previous] night. They became friends, and years later studied for their bar mitzvas together,” she says.

At the same time that Beth was home-schooling her son in Jewish studies, a Jewish woman was offering instruction in Hebrew.

Prof. Joel Bernstein was recruited early on by NYU to teach chemistry in Abu Dhabi. His life partner, Tzipi Springer-Eynot, was an Israeli born in Kazakhstan who had landed in Israel by way of a post-war German displaced persons camp. She went with him on their scouting trip.

“On the flight, I noticed Israel was not part of the map of the Middle East and I told Joel I don’t want to go to place which doesn’t recognize Israel as a country,” Tzipi recalls.

“When we arrived, we met staff and were taken for a tour. I [nevertheless] found the place intriguing and unique.”

Having a background in teaching, Tzipi was asked to provide instruction for a student from Hungary who wanted to continue his studies of the Hebrew language. Suddenly, there were 15 students from around the world, including Yemen, Jordan and Morocco, who wanted to learn Hebrew.

“I taught them bi-weekly,” she says. “They had a willingness to learn, and curiosity. I taught them about the Jewish holidays as well.”

The ""tale of the wandering Jew"" and the need for Jews to find one another is illustrated by Beth Margolis Rupp’s anecdotes of the people who have traveled through, and those who have sought each other out. It turns out that she, too, was a player who was being noticed without her knowing it.

“I was honored to be invited to the home of Sheikh Nayhan bin Mubarak Al Nayhan, the minister of culture, youth and social development, to his Eid majilas – events in the homes of the leadership in the country where they make themselves accessible and converse on various topics, offering the sheikhs the opportunity to hear from the people,” she says.

“I was with the sheikh for a few minutes, and then escorted back to the women’s section for dinner.”

Meanwhile, Beth’s work at NYU was in researching NGOs, governmental institutions and religious institutions and the way they were meeting the needs of societies.

“I saw the religious institutions providing comfort and resources to [the] people,” she states. “I spent time speaking to imams, with various churches, and went to Hindu temples.”

Beth describes as “unnerving” a telephone call she received from Rev. Andrew Thompson, head of Abu Dhabi’s St. Andrews Anglican Church, who was seeking out someone who knew what was going on in the city’s Jewish community. Not surprisingly, though, after several meetings, the reverend became an invited guest at the Rupp’s Shabbat table.

“It takes three cups of coffee to become friends with someone, and that’s the way it was in Abu Dhabi,” Beth says.

In 2013, Rev. Thompson convened a meeting of religious leaders in the home of the deputy chief of mission at the United States Embassy, Ethan A. Goldrich.

Representatives showed up to talk about their community, and the concept of a book on tolerance evolved. The reverend knew the crown prince, sheikhs and government officials, and he brought the concept to them. Several years later it became Celebrating Tolerance.

The Rupps left the UAE to be with Beth’s dad, who was getting on in years.

“I helped build an amazing, vibrant Jewish community,” she says. “It was rich, not one denomination – not only Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, Reconstructionist or secular. I also realize how grateful I am to Ross [Kriel] and the Orthodox Jewish community, and the deep importance of the need to have a minyan. These people held the principles of Jewish life together and created the opportunities for everybody to be there.”

Would she go back?

“I’d move back,” she says, “in a heartbeat.”

Jean Candiotte

Born and raised in Bethpage, New York, a writer and producer of video content for multimedia platforms, Jean Candiotte told her lawyer husband Barry Greenberg one snowy January morning in 2014 that she had a chance to do a Skype call for a job in Dubai. Barry, too, was seeking his next big gig.

Jean had been working with multinational entertainment companies, including News Corp, Viacom and NBC Universal. This was an opportunity to be a creative director for OSN, a Dubai-based direct-broadcast company.

“I interviewed in January, signed a contract in February, and two months later, we were in Dubai. The flight was on a Friday, we arrived on Saturday, and I began working on Sunday,” she says.

“On Monday night, my husband Barry and I were partaking of a communal Passover meal, the Seder. Elli and Ross [Kriel] and other community members were at one of two Seders,” she says.

Jean’s mother was raised Orthodox, and her father, if asked, would state “I’m Sephardi!” The family attended a Conservative synagogue, where Jean had a bat mitzvah. Barry had less of a Jewish experience growing up.

Jean notes that “many of us arrived in Dubai not wanting to make our Jewish identity known” to the wider public.

“For me it started changing during the past year or so because of the Year of Tolerance, which the UAE government announced in 2019, and [because Crown Prince] Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed announced plans for the Abrahamic Family house, which would be a multi-faith campus and educational center consisting of a mosque, a church and a synagogue,” she explains. “The UAE is proving how progressive they have been in this area.”

In 2016, Beth Margolis Rupp, together with Jean and Ross Kriel, were asked to write and edit the chapter dedicated to the UAE’s Jewish community in Celebrating Tolerance , which by this time had been commissioned by a government ministry.

“Our story of ‘coming out’ and being accepted was [in a] chapter celebrating 12 minority religious communities in the UAE,” she says. “It was published in 2019, and a copy was given to Pope Francis during his visit to the UAE – his first to a Gulf country – when he signed the Document of Fraternity.”

Jean notes that a quote in the chapter “expresses [their] sentiment.”

It says: “We are neighbors here, and if you look back, you’ll see that we are actually each other’s family from long ago. You may see us wearing our Hand of Miriam as you wear the Hand of Fatima. We are grateful for our lives here, for the opportunity to be recognized by the UAE government, and for being able to share our story.”

Jean says: “We felt acknowledged in a wonderful way. It acknowledged our community and I felt great about living in a community doing so much about tolerance.”

In March 2020, she was asked to speak to the European Parliament in Brussels as part of a conference about tolerance. Rev. Thompson was one of several speakers.

The keynote speaker was H.E. Dr. Ali Rashid Al Nuaimi, chairman of Hedayah, the International Center of Excellence for Countering Violent Extremism, and a member of the UAE Federal National Council based in Abu Dhabi. He traveled from Abu Dhabi to attend along with his staff.

“These points got us over the mountain to the place we are today,” she states.

“It’s been personal growth that has kept me here, and for my husband a great career opportunity,” Jean says. “The overall experience in the UAE has been exciting, and made us want to stay.”

Rebecca and Yoni

Australia-raised Rebecca – who prefers to keep her family name private – was born in Botswana to Israeli parents, who then moved to New Zealand and finally Australia, where she spent her adolescent years.

Rebecca moved back to Dubai a second time because of a job opportunity. She also missed life in the Middle East.

The family of her husband, Yoni, had moved to Singapore from Israel. Yoni’s father was born in pre-state Israel. His mother came from an Orthodox family. Yoni himself was raised on Kibbutz Bror Hayil near Ashkelon, founded by Egyptian Jews.

Rebecca is Sephardi on her Tunisian mother’s side and Ashkenazi on her Polish father’s side. Her dad grew up attending synagogue but the family was not fully observant.

Yoni and Rebecca met in Australia, where they were married in a civil ceremony. Three months after arriving in Dubai in 2012, they traveled through Jordan to Israel, where they underwent an additional ceremony.

During their first time living in the UAE, Yoni was hired as a design researcher for NYU Abu Dhabi, and Rebecca, a trained psychologist, worked at a well-known clinic in Dubai.

There was no formal Jewish community then, but according to Rebecca, NYU’s chaplain, Rabbi Sarna, “directed us to the blossoming Jewish community in Dubai, where we would come and spend Shabbat with Elli and Ross [Kriel], and often stay with them.”

As the community began to establish itself, the couple left to raise their two children in Australia. But missing the Dubai clinic, which in the interim had grown, Rebecca was anxious to return, which the family did in 2019. Yoni is now head of design for an online real estate portal.

Raising their young daughters in the UAE, they spend a lot of time with the Kriel Family, among others, celebrating Shabbat and holidays.“Online Jewish lessons, as well as online Shabbat services because of COVID-19, maintain our Jewish identity,” Rebecca says.

“The government here has been working hard with Ross [Kriel] to establish a place of Jewish worship. The community development authority has to issue a license for the Jewish community to have its space and to be able to practice, as it does for any denomination, be it churches or temples,” she states.

Breakaway Synagogue

An old Jewish joke says that when a synagogue reaches its 11th man – one beyond the quorum for public prayer – a second synagogue is born. Rabbi Levi Duchman, who is associated with the Chabad movement (which is not officially recognized by the UAE government), recently established a second synagogue in the Emirates.

Duchman, according to members of the Jewish community, had been attending the Orthodox minyan for the previous five years. He appointed Solly Wolf, who attended services during High Holy Days, as president. The synagogue does not call itself Chabad.

Jewish businessmen, rabbis and former government officials

Jewish businessmen have been trailblazers in opening the nexus between the United States and Dubai, as well as Israel.

Eli Epstein of Westchester, New York, began flying to Dubai 30 years ago for business as CEO of a large petroleum by-product company. During the years, he would bring rabbis and introduce top members of the American Jewish Committee to government officials.

“I was helping the AJC with introductions in the UAE, and the Jewish community was beginning to organize a Shabbat gathering in local hotels,” he says.

Epstein played a significant role as a conduit to some leading Emirati businesspeople, including Mohamed Alabbar, the impressive entrepreneur who built the Burj Khalifa skyscraper. He dedicated a Torah scroll for the community in honor of Alabbar, who witnessed the ceremony.

“The Torah has an Arabic dedication on the front acknowledging Mohamed’s leadership and the inspiration he offered to his generation,” Epstein says. “He spoke to the community on a Friday night and stayed for dinner. Mohamed played a key role for many I introduced him to.”

23 צפייה בגלריה Ross Kriel, Eli Epstein and Alex Peterfreund at the Torah dedication ceremony ( Photo: Courtesy )

In addition to the scroll from London’s Marble Arch Synagogue, there is a third, this one from Temple Brith Shalom in Erie, Pennsylvania.

Epstein is considered a trailblazer.

“I didn’t know I was this,” he says, referring to the description.

“Over the years I became someone trusted, which enabled me to bring rabbis,” he says.

“Over time, the Emirates realized that not all Jews are Israelis. I was early in the game. I didn’t sign up as a trailblazer. Frankly, I am changed. My worldview changed and I even pray differently because of Islam.”

Describing Epstein’s role from the perspective of the UAE’s Jewish community, Jean Candiotte says: “Eli is the poster child for being active in business and interactive in government, and therefore one of those people who help create the friendship between the UAE and the Jewish community.”

Looking ahead, Epstein says: “We’re heading into the blue yonder. It’s a watershed for Israel and the region, a harbinger of strategic realignment of the Middle East. Two years from now, we’ll look back, amazed at what happened. No one can count on America; in the Middle East, you are your own first responder.”

There have been many others who have frequented the UAE, working to open a dialogue among faiths and achieve recognition for the Jewish community on the Arabian Peninsula.

They include Rabbi David Rosen, the AJC’s international director of religious affairs; Rabbi Y. Dov Krakowski of the Orthodox Union; Rabbi Dov Goldstein; Stephen M. Greenberg and Malcolm Hoenlein of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations; Rabbi Marc Schneier, president of the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding; and Rabbi Michael Schudrich, the chief rabbi of Poland.

In addition, Rabbis Marvin Heir and Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center have spent considerable time engaging the Emirates.

“The early Simon Wiesenthal Center missions to the UAE were real eye-openers. We had the opportunity to meet with a young dynamic Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, and with open-minded business leaders like Mohamed Alabbar, who revealed to us a place where our faith and our people were not merely tolerated, but respected,” says Rabbi Cooper, associate dean and director of the Global Social Action Agenda for the Wiesenthal Center.

“It cannot be lost on anyone that all this takes place in the UAE as the last Jews of Yemen are hounded out of homes they have lived in for over a thousand years,” Cooper says.

“Only a fanatic Jew-hater like the Ayatollah Khamenei, who backs the Houthis [in Yemen], can be celebrating that an Arab nation is about to become Judenrein. Contrast this as the ruler of Abu Dhabi, His Majesty, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, as well as Dubai’s Sheikh Mohamed, pave the way for more Jewish people to come to Dubai.”

Under the radar

Although news of ongoing contacts between officials from Israel and the UAE continue to surface, many visits by Israelis have been, and will continue to be, under the radar. These include government figures, Mossad agents, executives from defense and security companies as well as other strategic partnerships.

In 2018, then-minister of sport Miri Regev escorted Israel’s national team to the International Judo Federation Grand Slam in Abu Dhabi.

The current director of the Mossad, Yossi Cohen, made a high-profile visit to the UAE after many clandestine meetings in the Gulf region, which cemented the recent deal toward normalization.

In 2001, Dr. Efraim Sneh, a cabinet minister and retired brigadier general, traveled secretly to Dubai.

“I was in the inner cabinet of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and went to the UAE for the purpose of establishing relations, and had very high-level meetings,” Sneh says.

“Since then, I have been advocating between Israel and the Gulf countries, and have been there many times in the past year acting to cement relations between Israel and the UAE.”

Waking up to the Abraham Accord

Ross Kriel: “I thought many steps would be taken until we had full diplomatic recognition. People could see where it was going, so quickly as well. We hope that this is just the beginning and will invigorate completely new paradigms for people in the Middle East, one that is based on the ability to make change and move forward. … Five years ahead, Emirates and Israelis are so open to this. I’m hoping it produces better stability and economic growth.”

Elli Kriel: “It’s an amazing turn of events. I was shocked, quite honestly, and thought the deal was coming in one year’s time. I thought things would open up for the Expo, but not this soon. We received a barrage of responses and it changed things here, too.

""It allows us to be public without any reservations. Before we had to be careful. … My daughter sang the UAE’s national anthem in Arabic, and it went viral. … This paves the way for positive and constructive development, setting an example how many cultures can live together in one small place. I do hope it will be received positively around the world.”

Alex Peterfreund: “At 3 in the morning, when the news broke, I couldn’t sleep. I was chatting with Ross on WhatsApp thinking that in 10 years, there may be 20,000 Jews living in Dubai and we will be sitting in the back of the synagogue remembering those times when we prayed together. If you told me this deal was happening, I’d tell you science fiction is on the second floor.”

Jean Candiotte: “I read it on my WhatsApp in disbelief; I felt I was in a dream. It is a great movement toward peace. We felt we had planted the seeds and it was growing, but I didn’t think I’d see it during my time living in the UAE.”

Rebecca: “I felt it was coming. I have a lot of Emirati friends and clients [who are] well established in the community and hear a change in business and political points of view.

""I hear of the U.S. soldiers coming here who were trained in Israel, and the sharing of knowledge. I think it’s the best news we could have possibly gotten. I happen to live here and have a great deal of respect for the leaders of this country, who decided with full knowledge that it might not be the most popular or expected decision, and it might cause different types of political friction with Arab countries that deal with the UAE moving forward. … I think it is amazing for locals here to get to know Israelis who want to see the world and explore. … I see more initial exploration, but with normalization, a lot more for business endeavors.”

Sharon Eder: “I knew it was bubbling. I had relationships with Israelis who were trying to make that happen and wasn’t surprised. I think it’s great. What we had for these five years that helped make it happen was special for us. It gave us an identity.”

Giacomo Arazi: I have always said a full Jewish community can only happen [together] with peace with Israel. And I think it’s an exciting time for the Jewish community of Dubai. It’s an exciting place to be, that looks to the future. So does Israel; so do the Jews. I’m very optimistic.”

Beth Margolis Rupp: “I wish I [had been] in Dubai with the community for the announcement of the deal. I felt so proud of the community… on the ground.”

Rabbi Yehuda Sarna: “I am predicting that we will see a burst of intellectual creativity in terms of cross-continent education between the US and the UAE, and Jewish/Arab relations and studies.”

'A moment of hope and optimism'

It’s nearing the first Shabbat in Dubai since the agreement to normalize relations was announced at the White House, and Omer Yankelevich, Israel’s minister of Diaspora affairs, Zooms into the community to teleconference an emotional greeting. (Her greeting follows congratulations delivered to the community by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the evening of the accord.)

Ross Kriel takes extreme pride in the moment, graciously thanking all the Jews who came before him and who are there now, and all of the Jewish organizations and individuals who helped make the day possible.

“There were other Jews in the UAE, perhaps each one thinking, ‘I’m the only one.’” Jean Candiotte says.

Sharon Eder sees herself as something of a diplomat.

“We had Arab neighbors who never met Jews before, and had an impact on them,” she says.

The Jewish community of Dubai is clearly in transformation. It is opening a synagogue and kosher restaurant and is waiting with open arms to service businesspeople and tourists. The UAE has broken the glass ceiling in the Middle East, and this could not have happened without the Jews who reside there.

“Jews came from all over … for two main reasons: work and safety,” Rabbi Sarna says.

“It might sound ironic to some people that Jews feel safer in the UAE than they do in places in Europe or North America, but consider the rising anti-Semitism in those countries, excused in part by some prominent political voices,” he says. “Then come to the UAE and see the Year of Tolerance and the announcement of the Abrahamic Family House.”

Alex Peterfreund says that for every Emirati going to Israel, there will be 200 Israelis coming to the UAE. He hopes the Emirati Jewish community can play a role in educating these travelers about the local culture and assist them with their needs, be it a place to pray or kosher food, Elli-style.

Expo 2020 will be delayed until next year and will house a large Israeli pavilion – not the one Israel planned to open prior to the Abraham Accord.

Jean sums it up.

“I feel like it’s a great step forward toward peace and understanding,” she states. “It’s a moment of hope and optimism when most of the headlines are not feeding hope and optimism.”

Calls for stricter sanctions against coupists

Omololu Ogunmade in Abuja

President Muhammadu Buhari thursday called for the unconditional release of ousted President Ibrahim Keita of Mali, saying the development in the Sahelian nation, which led to the toppling of the government poses grave consequences for peace and security in West Africa, adding that it is a setback for regional diplomacy.

He condemned what he described as the unconstitutional change of government in Mali and called on the military that unseated the civilian government to act responsibly and ensure restoration of constitutional order, peace and stability.

Buhari, who yesterday joined his colleagues from West Africa to discuss the military coup in Mali called for tougher sanctions against Mali as measures to force the military to restore the country to democratic rule.

Some soldiers had rebelled on Tuesday and staged a coup, arresting Keita and Prime Minister Boubou Cisse.

Keita announced his resignation in a live broadcast on Wednesday.

Earlier in his official twitter handle, @MBUHARI, the president had condemned the action of the coupists.

“The events in Mali are great setbacks for regional diplomacy, with grave consequences for the peace and security of West Africa. It is time for the unconstitutional ‘authority’ in Mali to act responsibly and ensure restoration of constitutional order, peace and stability.

“A politically stable Mali is paramount and crucial to the stability of the sub-region. We must all join efforts, ECOWAS, the AU, the UN and other stakeholders, and work together until sanity returns to Mali with the restoration of civil administration,” he tweeted.

Also, while addressing the virtual extraordinary session of ECOWAS leaders to discuss the ouster of a democratic government in Mali, Buhari described the military rule as an aberration, which must not be allowed to stand.

Buhari said he was saddened by the coup, which he described as a setback “for regional diplomacy, which has grave consequences for the peace and security of West Africa.”

According to him, the military has no place in governance and military rule runs contrary to the protocol of ECOWAS on democracy and good governance.

He implored ECOWAS leaders to ensure that “this dastardly act” does not stand, adding that Nigeria upholds the principles of ECOWAS protocol on good governance and democracy.

He said: “Indeed, it saddens me greatly as we meet today to discuss the turn of events in Mali, which commenced on Tuesday this week, where President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, his prime minister and senior members of his government were arrested, resulting in the forcible resignation of the president as well as the dissolution of the parliament. Both acts are illegal and stand condemned.

“The action of the military runs counter to the letter and spirit of ECOWAS protocol on good governance and democracy in which unconstitutional change of governments is prohibited. The Authority of ECOWAS Heads of State and Government should not allow this dastardly act to stand. Nigeria stands by the provisions of the protocol on good governance and democracy.

“Mali has been in political turmoil since the results of the parliamentary elections were announced in March this year. ECOWAS interventions, through a series of efforts by ministers, the special envoy and chief mediator and a group of heads of state of our organisation as well as an extraordinary summit did not yield positive results. Today, Mali has not only descended into political chaos but also socio-economic and security disaster with potentially tragic consequences to Mali and the sub-region.

“I am pleased that ECOWAS, EU, UN and France issued strongly-worded statements against the action of the Malian military. The events in Mali are great setbacks for regional diplomacy, which have grave consequences for the peace and security of West Africa. I am pleased, therefore, that this extraordinary summit, holding to discuss pathways to the debacle we face today in Mali, is most timely and appropriate.”

According to him, aside from the closure of ECOWAS borders with Mali, a series of regime of sanctions should be imposed on the country to heighten pressure on the military to restore democracy.

The president lamented that coup d’état was staged in Mali despite a series of efforts made by ECOWAS, the special envoy of the sub-regional body and Nigeria’s former president, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, foreign groups and individuals to resolve the impasse.

He said if all parties to the crisis had abided by recommendations made to resolve the imbroglio, the country would not have been driven to the level it is today.

He called for the release of the ousted president and his allies who have been detained since their ouster.

Buhari advocated support for all consultations being made by the Chairman of ECOWAS and President of Niger Republic, Mr. Mahamadou Issoufou, with ECOWAS, African Union (AU) and the United Nations (UN), noting that the AU and UN had subscribed to ECOWAS protocol on good governance.

He said: “The closure of borders already called for by ECOWAS should be our first line of action. We need to isolate a series of sanction regimes that can create and sustain sufficient pressures on the military to force a return to constitutional governance.

“The critical issues for resolution in the Malian crisis had been aptly captured as the four-point pathways to peace. Within that context, and if all parties to the crisis were to abide by those recommendations, the developments now on the ground would have been avoided.

“The action of the military in Mali has regrettably hoisted on us as a sub-region, the need to decide the options that will be consistent with the provisions of the protocol on good governance and democracy, which ECOWAS, AU and the UN subscribe to. In this context, therefore, Nigeria believes that President Keita and other detainees should be released unconditionally and with immediate effect.

“Furthermore, we strongly support the efforts of our chairman, President Mahamadou Issoufou, for wider, regional and continental consultations with ECOWAS, AU and UN in adopting strong measures to promoting the early restoration of constitutional order, peace and stability in Mali.

“Military involvement in governance, in whatever guise, is an aberration that has no place in managing the business of government that suspends the constitution and with it, democratic institutions. It is time for the unconstitutional ‘authority’ in Mali to act responsibly and do the needful by heeding to the above recommendations.”

Buhari said the political stability of Mali was paramount to the stability of the entire West African sub-region, adding that hence, ECOWAS, AU and the UN could not afford to fold their arms while the situation worsens.

He also said the condemnations of the three groups were well appreciated and called for sustainable resistance to force the military to relinquish power.

94,https://allafrica.com/stories/202008240945.html,"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",AllAfrica.com,"Sudan: Peace Negotiations - Darfur Almost Final, SPLM-N Make Demand","Juba — In Juba, capital of South Sudan, the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF) rebel alliance clarified issues with the security protocol in the peace agreement on the Darfur track. Meanwhile, a political declaration has been made concerning the stalled Two Areas (South Kordofan and Blue Nile state) track, demanding transfer of negotiations to Sudan's Council of Ministers.

This weekend, the Sudanese government and the SRF rebel alliance finalised revisions to political issues of the Darfur track peace agreement in Juba.

Tut Galuak, head of the mediation team in the South Sudanese capital, stated that rounding up the peace talks is going well: ""All parties are determined to sign the peace agreement on August 28"".

Issues reviewed include displaced people in the Darfur region, refugees, recurrent conflicts between farmers and herders, land use and ownership, and transitional justice, according to South Sudanese mediator Dhieu Mathok.

The security protocol has been finalised apart from the issue of integrating the forces, said Mathok. The government negotiation delegation believes the integration should take place within a time frame of 39 months (the length of the transitional period after which general elections will take place), while the rebel groups suggest that it takes place over a period of seven years.

About one month ago, Mathok announced the postponement of the signing of the final peace agreement by the government and the SRF. At the time, he said that the government and the SRF agreed on six major issues, only the security protocol remained to be discussed.

The SRF attributed the postponement of the signing of the peace agreement, which they call the ""national pivotal issues paper"", to the violent break-up of the sit-in in Fata Borno in North Darfur by militiamen.

Also in Juba, a set of projects to strengthen the peace process among various communities in the western region of Sudan was presented to a government delegation headed by the Deputy Chairman of the Sovereign Council, Lt Gen Mohamed Hamdan 'Hemeti' yesterday by the Darfur Women group delegation. The delegation also presented projects to enhance the role of women in political and social life.

Hemeti said he will heed all the projects put forward. He also called for unity in Darfur and the importance of the national interest over ""narrow"" interests.

In October 2019, the USA-based Darfur Women Action Group and 37 experts and Sudanese civil society representatives produced a ""Strategic Framework for Sustainable Change in the Republic of Sudan"". The comprehensive strategy was delivered to the Sudanese government, as well as to international and regional actors and stakeholders working on Sudan.

The Darfur Women Forum held in November 2019 recommended that women not only participate in peace negotiations, but also take part in the demobilisation, disarmament, and reconstruction committees. The Darfur Women group claims to represent all Darfuri women in various political and societal issues.

Two Areas

On Sunday, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North under the leadership of Abdelaziz El Hilu (SPLM-N El Hilu) and the Peoples' Demand Association* signed a political declaration in Juba.

SPLM-N El Hilu General Secretary, Ammar Daldoum, signed the document on behalf of the movement, and Emadeldin Mirghani on behalf of the Peoples' Demand Association.

The political declaration, containing 20 items, demands the transfer of the negotiation file from the government delegation in Juba chaired by Hemeti, who is also Commander-in-Chief of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), to the Council of Ministers. According to the declaration, this will ""expedite the completion of the establishment of the Peace Commission and enable it to play its role in accordance with what was stipulated in the 2019 Constitutional Document, in addition to the formation of the Parliament"".

The declaration also states that those accused of crimes in Darfur should be handed over to the International Criminal Court, and those involved in crimes committed against peaceful demonstrators, activists, human rights defenders in all parts of Sudan must be held accountable.

The declaration also prohibits the establishment of political parties and organisations on religious or ethnic bases. Daldoum said in a press conference after the signing that secularism is not mentioned in the political declaration, but this does not mean that the movement has backed away from it.

The recent involvement of RSF forces in violence in South Kordofan, along with ""heinous violations"" committed against unarmed civilians in various parts of Sudan, led the rebel group to withdraw from negotiations on Thursday. Daldoum explained that the movement has strong reservations about the military chairmanship of the government negotiation delegation.

FFC restructure

The SRF rebel alliance and the Forces for Freedom and Change** (FFC) agreed to ""a joint transitional mechanism"" on Sunday. This includes restructuring the FFC in order to carry out its tasks as ""a powerful coalition that will work to determine the political direction of Sudan"".

El Hadi Idris, chairperson of the SRF, said that the agreement represents a new page opened for the FFC.

Wesseh Calls for Peace Holiday,"River Gee County Senator ConmanyWesseh, who chairs the Senate committee on peace, reconciliation and good governance here is calling for a National Day of Peace to be celebrated on 18th August each year as a working holiday.

He says such day should be commemorated throughout the country characterized by thanksgiving, peace education andfestivals, including cultural, sports and other activities emphasizing, ""never again to war"" based on the causes and lessons of the Liberian civil war.

Addressing a press conference in Monrovia Tuesday, August 18, which marked the 17th Anniversary of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) brokered in Accra, Ghana that ended hostility in the country in 2004, Sen. Wesseh also suggested creation of a special national recognition for peace which could be done in two categories at separate ceremonies - one to be named Legislative Medal for Peace to be awarded annually by the Liberian Legislature to lawmakers whose Legislative leadership may have contributed in special ways to promotion and maintaining of peace in Liberia; and the other category could be called the State Medal of Peace to be awarded by the President of Liberia to individuals or organizations that have made extraordinary contributions to the promotion and maintaining of peace in the country.

""I believe that by taking these legislative actions in remembrance of the CPA, we could be reminding ourselves, the people we represent and those who stood by Liberia especially, those whose blood and sweat made us to be alive today that we made a promise for peace to keep and vow to renew in the best interest of our children and future generations"", he adds.

Liberians warring factions and civil society organizations met in the Ghanaian capital, Accra with support of the international community and signed a peace deal that ended 14 years of bloody civil war and ushered in a National Transition Government and subsequent democratic governance after disarmament of belligerent forces by 15,000-strong UN Peacekeeping forces.

Sen. Wesseh recalls that on August 18, 2003, Liberian leaders made a solemn and strong pledge to end the war by signing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement which was the outcome of three months (June to August) of negotiations.

He says by their signatures, the leaders, in the name of the Liberian people promised the country and the world at large that Liberia would never go to war with itself again; that Liberians would never allow the use of Liberian territory for war against its neighbors; that they would disarm themselves and remove weapons of destruction from the politics and rebuild, reform and re-create governing institutions such as the legislature, the executive and judiciary necessary for enduring peace, and use electoral means to choose leaders as provided for in the Constitution, among others.

He reflects that justice, truth and reconciliation will be Core Avenue to sustained peace; that Liberians would give hope to the children and young people of the country that there is a future for which to live and work; and, that they were fully and unwaveringly committed to peace, socio-economic progress, democracy, and above all, to love of country.

""On this 18th day of August, 2020, we the people of Liberia must be proud of ourselves that we have been keeping our pledge for peace. We the people should therefore celebrate that peace have won against war.

Addressing a press conference in Mutare yesterday, ZIICC spokesperson, Reverend Andrew Wutawunashe said as servants of God, they will never call on people to revive old grudges or wounds.

His sentiments follow the publication of a pastoral letter titled ""The March is not ended"" by the Zimbabwe Catholic Bishops' Conference, which also received support from the Zimbabwe Council of Churches.

The pastoral letter also resonates with the country's opposition parties' efforts to roll-out demonstrations so as to subvert the will of the people as expressed in the 2018 elections.

""We take strong exception to and categorically dissociate ourselves from calls by certain religious leaders to march against the Government and to reignite conflicts and wounds of the past to heal us, from which God answered our prayers by bringing political leaders to the negotiating table where reconciliation was achieved.

""Please do not reverse the good that God had done. Our response as God's servants should not be to call people to revive old grudges, but rather to urge people to go forward in peace"".

ZIICC also called on Zimbabweans to reject irresponsible calls to protests and needless boycotts that are aimed at provoking violence and damaging the country's economic revival efforts. ""Since 2018 elections and even before, Zimbabweans have been held at ransom and forced to drink from a poisoned chalice of lethal and adversarial politics whose sole agenda is that the opposition may govern, regardless of the democratic outcome of electoral and legal processes, both of which they participated in. To this end, a relentless propaganda war bent on painting a picture of the Government as intolerant, corrupt and violating human rights with no regard to the rule of law, continues to be pursued- a picture that has relentlessly been played to the gallery of the international community with the intent of persuading them to maintain the economic sanctions which have brought untold suffering to the poor people of this nation,"" he said.

Since losing the 2018 elections, the country's opposition parties, working with fugitive former G40 politicians, have vowed to sabotage the Second Republic economic recovery efforts through rolling out demonstrations.

ZIICC's patron, Bishop Nehemiah Mutendi said this is not the time to apportion blame, but to come together as the church, as a people, nation and Zimbabwe to make the country great again.

""As true shepherds, let us encourage our sheep to be productive rather than destructive. Right from the beginning, God urged man to be productive. Good shepherds should therefore urge their sheep to work towards building our country.

""Isn't it a shame that Zimbabwe with all the abundant and fertile land that it has, is spending US$40 million a month to import food when in the 1980s it had enough maize to feed itself for three years even if there was drought and had enough grain to last eight years? Good shepherds should advocate for positive and constructive discourse than judgement,"" said Bishop Mutendi.

""These tactics have also, from the outset, involved extreme provocation of the elected Government to goad it into reactions that would, if succumbed to, serve to justify the false picture being painted,"" said Rev Wutawunashe.

Notwithstanding the oppositional forces, working in cahoots with foreign elements, attempts to derail the country's inevitable march to prosperity, the indigenous churches hailed Government's vigorous efforts to protect the nation from the Covid-19 pandemic, the reconstruction of roads, the aggressive empowerment of the agricultural sector, efforts towards a new political culture of peace and unity in diversity, persistent efforts towards international re-engagement as well as measures to fight economic hardships.

""Clear effort has been made, at best to distract attention from the sterling, diligent and very visible efforts to develop and take the nation forward which the Government has been pursuing, or at worst, to sabotage these efforts,"" he said.

Rev Wutawunashe said the church is alarmed by the reckless dearth of sincerity and basic patriotism among some Zimbabweans who are pitting Zimbabweans against the Government through deliberate disinformation campaigns.

""The people of Zimbabwe deserve better from their political leaders rather than this ruthless and cynical adversarial politics.

The talks between the Sudanese government and the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF) rebel alliance are expected to conclude soon.

On Thursday, the SPLM-N El Hilu withdrew from the negotiations with the Sudanese government delegation, in protest against the chairmanship by Lt Gen Mohamed Hamadan 'Hemeti', who is not only Deputy President of the Sovereign Council, but also Commander of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

The recent involvement of RSF forces in violence in South Kordofan, along with ""heinous violations"" committed against unarmed civilians in various parts of Sudan, have led the rebel group to withdraw. Hemeti ""lacks neutrality and is not qualified to lead the negotiation delegation"", the SPLM-N said in an official complaint on August 18.

The head of the South Sudanese mediation team, Tut Galuak, announced yesterday that Juba decided to freeze the Sudanese government-SPLM-N El Hilu negotiation track after the rebel group ""surprised the mediation"" with the request to intervene and call for the replacement of the Sudanese government negotiating team's chairman.

In a press statement, he said that the movement earlier presented a clear opinion about the contents of the negotiations but did not put the head of the government delegation in question.

Galuak further said that the negotiations between Khartoum and the SRF concerning the Darfur and South Kordofan/Blue Nile state tracks are continuing.

In Khartoum, Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok denied that the Council of Ministers decided to leave the peace talks to the military component of the Sovereign Council.

""The government is in constant contact with the armed movements participating in the negotiations, as well as the rebel groups that abstained, including SPLM-N El Hilu and the mainstream Sudan Liberation Movement headed by Abdelwahid El Nur,"" he said.

International Day of Peace is observed on September 21.

The International Day of Peace was established in 1981 by the UN General Assembly to recognise and strengthen the ideals of peace.

What is peace? That is the question disturbing so many as the mind is bombarded with multiple thoughts and questions every moment, unsettling the harmony and equilibrium of a person.

Merriam-Webster’s Elementary Dictionary defines “Peace” as “freedom or a period of freedom from public disturbance or war; a quiet and calm state of mind; agreement and harmony among people; an agreement to end a war.”

Peace is also one of the UN Sustainable Goals. Sustainable Development Goal 16 is about “peace, justice and strong institutions” and is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the UN in 2015.

The SDG 16 is dedicated to the “promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, the provision of access to justice for all, and building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.”

People have different meanings, understandings and interpretations of peace.

Some think of peace as just absence of wars and battles.

Many believe that injustices, discrimination, wrong values, jealousy, greed, hatred and violence are the main factors disturbing peace.

Most people are searching for peace, only to find disappointment and deceit.

The mind is often disturbed with worry of the present and anxiety of the future.

This causes much distress, disturbance and stress for anyone.

The COVID-19 pandemic crisis has worsened the mental state of many because of lack of employment, financial constraints, uncertainty of the future, fear of their health and so many more issues.

Mental torture is the greatest of greatest torments affecting many today.

Everyone is doing something to get some peace because everyone is craving for some moments of peace.

Some seek peace in religion for salvation, while some enjoy the beach for fun and relaxation.

However, some indulge in alcohol and drugs for release of tension. But some are deprived of peace by their own decisions and actions and.

Some regretting their mistakes and errors, perhaps unable to forget the wrongs they have committed.

Their peace is shattered forever, as they are unable to forgive themselves.

Many philosophers, writers, poets, religious leaders, politicians and researchers have expressed their views on the concepts of peace.

The Dalai Lama states: “Although attempting to bring about world peace through the internal transformation of individuals is difficult, it is the only way.

“Peace must first be developed within an individual. And I believe that love, compassion, and altruism are the fundamental basis for peace.

“Once these qualities are developed within an individual, he or she is then able to create an atmosphere of peace and harmony.

“This atmosphere can be expanded and extended from the individual to his family, from the family to the community and eventually to the whole world.”

According to Mahatma Gandhi, peace implies a state of positive and constructive world order where every individual lives in mutual co-operation.

Gandhi states that “Nonviolence is a weapon of the strong.

The law of love will work, just as the law of gravitation will work, whether we accept it or not.

“The more I work at this law the more I feel the delight in life, the delight in the scheme of the universe. It gives me a peace and a meaning of the mysteries of nature that I have no power to describe.”

Many say that doing the right things and practicing good ethical principles will bring peace.

The Bible says “Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult.

On the contrary, repay evil with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing.

For, “Whoever would love life and see good days must keep their tongue from evil and their lips from deceitful speech. They must turn from evil and do good; they must seek peace and pursue it” [Peter 3:9-11].

One of the first steps in establishing peace is being friendly to everyone. A smile is one of the best ways to make peace.

If we spread love and friendliness, people will feel respected and accepted.

Many see the cause of wars and conflicts being differences in opinion.

Another step towards peace is to be open to new ideas, views and perspectives of others.

If we accept new ideas and differences, there are better chances of solutions to the problems in the world.

Just by listening to each other is an important step towards peace.

Dialogues and negotiations are the way forward to peace.

Peace needs nurturing and building, not just celebrating. Peace needs to be practiced.

We should try to make every day our day of peace and we should work towards achieving peace and harmony at home, school, work, sports and in the community.

We should make peace in every aspect of our life- being at peace with ourselves, others and the environment.

The theme for the International Day of Peace this year is “Shaping Peace Together”.

We can celebrate Peace day by spreading love and compassion to everyone.

Peace is necessary and essential if we and the world are to survive.

Let us all work together in shaping peace in Fiji and the world.

Let me conclude with my poem on peace.

In search of peace

Lying on the white sand

Looking at the vast open sea

Mind plunged in the ocean of thoughts

What is peace and where it is to be found?

Why are there so many wars and confl icts?

Is peace all about freedom?

Is peace freedom from fear?

Is peace love, happiness and joy?

Is peace a sense of quietness?

Is peace a state of understanding?

Is peace an experience of knowing oneself?

Is peace being “at peace” with oneself?

Is peace only an elusive dream?

And why is peace so elusive?

Will anyone ever find everlasting peace?

Needing no abstract and philosophical reasons

But clear, concrete and plausible answers

Like the clear blue sky above

But are there any real answers available?","The International Day of Peace was established in 1981 by the UN General Assembly to recognise and strengthen the ideals of peace.

Photo by AKUOT CHOL/AFP via Getty Images.

Although there is a long road ahead to achieve sustainable peace and formidable challenges remain, the hope is Sudan can turn the page on decades of war that has left hundreds of thousands dead and millions displaced, particularly in Darfur and the Two Areas (South Kordofan and Blue Nile).

The peace agreement, between Sudan’s transitional government and the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF), a broad alliance of armed and other movements, and Minni Minawi’s Sudan Liberation Movement, is not yet comprehensive as it did not include two other important armed movements.

Expected to be formally signed in early October, the deal has been hailed as a ’historic achievement’ by the UN secretary-general, and the international community also commended the government of South Sudan for its positive role as mediator and urged hold-out groups to join the peace process. Much does depend on delivering on the agreement, and the experience of implementing past peace accords in Sudan has been dismal, particularly when it comes to bringing tangible benefits to people on the ground.

What potentially makes the Juba agreement different is that Sudan’s civilian-led transitional government aspires to deliver peace, justice and democracy in line with the goals of the revolution; that the agreement was negotiated between the Sudanese themselves, with a light touch from the South Sudanese mediation and low-key logistical and technical support from the international community; and that much of the negotiations were conducted between former comrades, in marked contrast to the confrontational atmosphere that prevailed during the Bashir era.

As Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok put it: ’This is a Sudanese peace, made with our own hands and by our own efforts’ and: ’This is not a paper agreement, but is a living organism that needs care, attention and political will from all of us’.

Achievements of the agreement

The result of almost one year’s hard work in Juba, the agreement is comprehensive in scope and addresses the fundamental issues of Sudan’s crises in Darfur, the Two Areas and other marginalized regions, albeit in a mixture of regional and national protocols. It goes a long way to realizing the vision of a democratic ‘New Sudan’ based on respect for the diversity of the Sudanese people and equal citizenship without religious, ethnic, cultural or gender discrimination.

There is a focus on the concerns of historically marginalized populations in Sudan’s conflict zones and disadvantaged areas, and it addresses root causes of conflict, such as issues of identity, marginalization, the relationship between religion and state, governance, resource-sharing, land issues, social justice, and equality at the national level.

The deal also looks to resolve the consequences of conflict, such as humanitarian relief, the safe and voluntary return of IDPs and refugees to their original lands and compensation, eviction of illegal settlers and the development and reconstruction of the conflict-affected areas. It provides for significant devolution of power and resources to the regions, including autonomy for the Two Areas and restoration of a single Darfur region. On transitional justice, the government has committed to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Court (ICC) and ensure Bashir and others subject to arrest warrants will ‘appear before’ the ICC.

This deal will change the face of the transitional government by bringing marginalized forces to the centre of the political process. The transitional period will extend to 2023, with the armed movements having three seats in the (currently 11-member) Sovereign Council and 25% of seats in the Cabinet and soon-to-be-formed Legislative Assembly.

The power-sharing provisions have been criticized as disproportionate to the size of the movements’ political constituencies and military presence inside Sudan. But the movements argue significant representation in the government is necessary to support implementation and that their arrival in Khartoum will help to strengthen the transition to democracy.

Establishing a single, national professional army, reflective of the diversity of Sudan and with a new military doctrine opens the way for much-needed comprehensive security sector reform. During the transition, this will include the creation of a 12,000 strong joint force between government security forces and the armed movements to help protect civilians in Darfur. Importantly, mechanisms allowing for civilian input on security reforms are also established.

The deal also guarantees religious freedom and the separation of religion from politics. This ensures religion will not be exploited by state institutions as it was during the Bashir-era, provides for the constitution to be based on equal citizenship, and for the establishment of a National Commission for Religious Freedom to protect the rights of Christians and other minorities. In the Two Areas, the autonomous government will have special legislative powers to pass laws based on the secular 1973 Constitution.

Increasing inclusivity

Key to achieving inclusive and sustainable peace is ensuring popular ownership and finding ways to engage civil society stakeholders and marginalized communities such as nomads in dialogue, reconciliation and social peace initiatives. The negotiations were mainly a top-down elitist process. Although the UN brought IDPs, tribal leaders and women’s groups to Juba for short periods, there was limited participation by civil society. However, the agreement provides for a wider range of stakeholders to feed into a comprehensive peace through reconciliation and transitional justice mechanisms, follow-on conferences and an inclusive National Constitutional Conference.

Achieving a comprehensive peace will also mean bringing other armed movements on board, particularly those led by Abdel Aziz Al Hilu and Abdel Wahid Al Nur, both of whom hold significant territory, forces and support (in the Two Areas and Darfur respectively). Negotiations in Juba with Abdel Aziz had stalled over his demands for a secular state or, failing that, the right to self-determination, but he has now reached a preliminary agreement with Prime Minister Hamdok on a way forward.

Other challenges of implementing peace

Turning the peace agreement into reality on the ground will face many other challenges given the fragility of a civilian-military transitional government, distrust, and competition between the signatory movements and some political parties, as well as increasing insecurity in many parts of the country caused by armed militias, inter-tribal violence, the proliferation of weapons, and sabotage by elements of the former regime. There is also likely to be resistance from groups such as illegal settlers who see their interests being threatened.

With its economy in meltdown because of economic mismanagement by the Bashir regime, COVID-19, and unprecedented floods, finding resources to implement the peace deal is far beyond the means of Sudan’s cash-strapped government. Implementation therefore requires sustained and generous support from its regional and international partners, including the country’s urgent removal from the US State Sponsors of Terrorism list, which is preventing debt relief, access to concessionary loans and large-scale foreign investment. With donor budgets under heavy pressure, raising money will be hard, but by continuing to support a nascent democracy in a strategically important but unstable region, Sudan’s allies will be safeguarding their long-term interests.

If properly implemented, the Juba peace agreement is a major first step towards creating a ‘New Sudan’ based on peace, equal citizenship and social justice. Key tests of whether Sudan can finally turn the page are whether the signatory movements and other revolutionary forces can unite to deliver the dividends of peace for the victims of Sudan’s conflicts, and embrace inclusion rather than tribalism and narrow political affiliation; whether the remaining armed movements are ready to start serious negotiations for a comprehensive peace; and whether Sudan now receives the support and attention it deserves from the international community. Surely Sudan has already come too far for this historic opportunity to be lost.","Chairman of Sudan’s Sovereign Council, Lt General Abdel Fattah al Burhan (left), South Sudan President Salva Kiir (centre) and the Sudanese Prime Minister Dr Abdalla Hamdok (right) greet people gathering during the initialling of the Sudan peace deal with the rebel groups in Juba, South Sudan.

Three days later, U.S. Consul General Barbara Stephenson spoke at a memorial service outside Belfast city hall. Flanked on stage by political and religious leaders from Protestant and Catholic communities, she said: “The best thing you can do to help us is find peace amongst yourselves.” Afterwards, a taxi driver took me on a tour of the city, where I saw burn marks on houses from petrol bombs, so-called “peace walls” separating communities, curbstones painted in the colors of the British flag, and murals celebrating freedom fighters around the world.

At that time, British and Irish officials were working to implement the Good Friday Agreement. The deal had been brokered three years earlier by George Mitchell, President Bill Clinton’s envoy for Northern Ireland, who brought together the Protestant and predominantly unionist community with the Catholic and largely nationalist one. A power-sharing executive gave both communities a voice in decisionmaking, the British government removed security checkpoints from the border, and paramilitary groups pledged to decommission their weapons. The European Union (EU) membership of Britain and Ireland enabled the removal of additional barriers.

Slow progress on decommissioning weapons hindered the agreement’s early years, with unionist leaders concerned about the arsenal of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) — a paramilitary organization opposed to British rule in Northern Ireland. On the morning of September 11, 2001, Richard Haass, President George W. Bush’s envoy for Northern Ireland, met in Dublin with Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Féin, a nationalist political party with links to the IRA. Haass was upset about the recent arrests in Colombia of three suspected IRA veterans who were accused of providing explosives training to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a leftist guerrilla organization seeking to topple the government in addition to trafficking cocaine into the United States. Haass reportedly questioned the IRA’s commitment to the peace process and warned that American engagement with Sinn Féin (including the provision of travel visas to the party’s leaders) could be jeopardized if FARC attacks conducted with IRA equipment harmed U.S. personnel.

Haass’ case was bolstered by the 9/11 attacks, which altered the Western world’s perception of terrorism and led many benefactors — including Irish-Americans who had long provided financial backing to Sinn Féin and Irish paramilitary groups — to rethink their support. The combination of American diplomacy and diaspora influence, in concert with ongoing efforts by the British and Irish governments, led to the IRA’s historic announcement on October 23, 2001 that it had begun decommissioning its weapons.

Although the power-sharing government proceeded in fits and starts, the peace process was finally on the right trajectory. Politicians began addressing mundane issues of governance rather than contentious issues of identity. Foreign direct investment increased, with nearly 900 international companies employing around 100,000 people. Belfast, which was named the best travel destination in 2018 by Lonely Planet, opened a museum about the locally-constructed Titanic, served as a filming location for “Game of Thrones,” and attracted trendy boutiques and cafes.

This positive momentum stalled in the wake of Brexit. In June 2016, the U.K. opted by a narrow margin in a June 2016 referendum to leave the EU; notably, 56% of voters in Northern Ireland preferred to remain in the EU. Although the region was rarely discussed during the campaign, disagreements between London and Brussels about the post-Brexit management of the Irish border plagued divorce negotiations. They also reopened old wounds in Northern Ireland, prompting debate about constitutional arrangements and hindering efforts to resuscitate the Northern Ireland Assembly, which collapsed after a breakdown in trust and left the region without a political voice for three years.

After extensive debates about a “backstop,” the two sides ultimately agreed on the “Northern Ireland Protocol” and concluded the deal. After the U.K. left the EU on January 31, the sides began negotiating their future relationship, including thorny trade relations. The talks, whose logistics were hampered by the coronavirus pandemic, faltered over competing visions of economic competition rules and the complexities of managing customs and tariffs on goods traveling between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. This week, the British government introduced legislation threatening to undo key provisions of the protocol. Although the British government claims these changes will protect the Good Friday Agreement, the EU fears they will do the opposite.

For decades, there was a bipartisan consensus in Washington about the importance of facilitating and preserving peace in Northern Ireland. The Trump administration has not made any public statements on the draft legislation, although officials are reportedly having quiet conversations. (Despite talking points that support the Good Friday Agreement, the administration’s credibility has been hindered by the president’s enthusiasm for Brexit at any cost.) In contrast, congressional Democrats have consistently expressed American support for the peace process throughout the Brexit process. In separate statements this week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, and Foreign Affairs Chairman Elliot Engel warned that the proposed changes could hinder a future U.S.-U.K. trade deal. Similarly, Tony Blinken, a key advisor to Joe Biden, tweeted the candidate’s desire to see the Good Friday Agreement protected during the negotiations.","My memories are indelibly intertwined with Northern Ireland, where I had just arrived as a post-doctoral research fellow.

tags: foreign policy

Dr. Lawrence Wittner is Professor of History Emeritus at SUNY/Albany and the author of Confronting the Bomb (Stanford University Press).

After nearly four years of the Trump administration, U.S. voters have a pretty good idea of the policies that the President and his Republican allies champion when it comes to America’s dealings with other nations. These policies include massive increases in military spending, lengthy wars abroad, threats of nuclear war, withdrawal from climate and nuclear disarmament treaties, a crackdown on refugees, and abandonment of international institutions.

But what about the Democrats? Do they, as some have charged, simply mirror the Republicans when it comes to America’s engagement with the world? The official Democratic Party platform, adopted this August at the Democratic national convention, provides a useful answer to this question.

The foreign affairs section of the platform opens with a sharp rebuttal to Trump’s belligerent, nationalist approach. Challenging militarism, it pledges to “use force only when necessary, always as a last resort, and with the informed consent of the American people.” It also promises to draw upon international partnerships and institutions to “meet common challenges that no country can face on its own.”

The platform’s discussion of U.S. military policy is particularly striking. “We need to bring our forever wars to a responsible end,” the document states. “Our military engagements, which have spanned from West Africa to Southeast Asia, have cost more than $5 trillion and claimed more than half a million lives. Our war in Afghanistan is the longest war in American history.” Thus, “it’s time to bring nearly two decades of unceasing conflict to an end.”

Accordingly, the platform calls for a peace settlement in Afghanistan, termination of U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen (a war that “is responsible for the world’s worst humanitarian crisis”), and for applying the lessons learned from these disastrous conflicts. This means, among other things, that “we will work with Congress to repeal decades-old authorizations for the use of military force and replace them with a narrow and specific framework that will ensure we can protect Americans from terrorist threats while ending the forever wars.” The platform adds: “Rather than occupy countries and overthrow regimes to prevent terrorist attacks, Democrats will prioritize more effective and less costly diplomatic, intelligence, and law enforcement tools.”

In line with this new approach, the platform calls for cutting the Trump administration’s bloated military budget—what it calls, in typical Washington-speak, “restoring stability, predictability, and fiscal discipline in defense spending.” In justification, the platform notes that “we spend 13 times more on the military than we do on diplomacy. We spend five times more in Afghanistan each year than we do on global public health and preventing the next pandemic. We can maintain a strong defense and protect our safety and security for less.”

The platform also pledges that Democrats will initiate other reforms in the U.S. military. These include efforts to halt “the Trump administration’s politicization of the armed forces,” root out sexual assault within their ranks, and safeguard “the independence of the military justice system—not pardon war criminals.”

Promising to “revitalize American diplomacy,” the platform argues that, “rather than militarize our foreign policy,” the Democrats would make diplomacy “our tool of first resort.” Under a Democratic administration, the U.S. government would rejoin the World Health Organization, the UN Human Rights Council, and the UN Population Fund and seek to modernize international institutions. Championing foreign assistance and development programs, the platform backs U.S. “investments in the prevention and alleviation of poverty, hunger, disease, and conflict,” and “the empowerment of vulnerable and marginalized populations.” It also promises that “Democrats will lead international efforts to help developing countries withstand and recover from debt crises causes by the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Indeed, the Democratic platform sharply rejects the narrow nationalist approach of the Trump administration. It contains strong commitments to acting cooperatively with other nations to ensure global health (for example, by restoring the U.S. role as the leading funder and technical partner of the WHO), battle climate change (by rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement and developing more ambitious global goals to reduce greenhouse gas pollution), utilize technology for the public good (by maintaining an open internet), and expand the admission of refugees. In yet another attempt to respect the rights of other nations, the platform promises to move the U.S. government’s “relationships in the Middle East away from military intervention” and to end the cruel policies of the Trump administration toward Cuba and Venezuela.

In line with this decreased emphasis on military might and increased emphasis upon international cooperation, the platform states that Democrats support the “elimination” of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons. They favor “reducing our overreliance and excessive expenditure on nuclear weapons” and declare that “the Trump administration’s proposal to build new nuclear weapons is unnecessary, wasteful, and indefensible.” Furthermore, “Democrats commit to strengthening” the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, “maintaining the moratorium on explosive nuclear weapons testing, pushing for the ratification of the UN Arms Trade Treaty and Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and extending New START.” Moreover, they would “work with Russia” to “negotiate [nuclear] arms control agreements . . . and move the world back from the nuclear precipice.”

Admittedly, the 2020 Democratic platform also contains occasional flag-waving rhetoric and a number of positions that are bound to irk at least some critics of Trump’s policies. Also, of course, a party platform is a statement of policy preferences—not a guarantee of their implementation.

Even so, when it comes to war, peace, and international relations, the Democratic Party has outlined a program significantly different from that of its Republican counterpart. In this November’s elections, American voters will have a clear choice as to what kind of role they want their country to play in the world.","These policies include massive increases in military spending, lengthy wars abroad, threats of nuclear war, withdrawal from climate and nuclear disarmament treaties, a crackdown on refugees, and abandonment of international institutions.

104,https://warontherocks.com/2020/09/negative-peace-chinas-approach-to-the-middle-east/,"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",War on the Rocks,‘Negative Peace’? China’s Approach to the Middle East,"What is China up to in the Middle East? What are its intentions, and do they constitute a threat to the predominant U.S. order there? And will there soon be a transformation in its approach to regional conflict, especially through the emerging concept and practice of “peace through development”?

For decades, the regional order has been a U.S.-designed and U.S.-managed one, in which there were clear differences between allies and rivals. By contrast, on the surface China looks to have rejected this model and to have prepared to work with all countries across the U.S. ally/rival divide, including Israel, Iran, and Saudi Arabia.

In Israel, the U.S. administration expressed its displeasure at a Chinese firm’s managing Haifa port, which could prove sensitive for the U.S. Sixth Fleet, which sometimes docks there. Washington was also unhappy that Huawei was potentially in the running to develop Israel’s 5G network, which would put security and intelligence cooperation with the United States at risk. At this stage, it looks as though Huawei will be excluded from consideration.

Then, in July, the New York Times reported that Washington’s “maximum pressure” strategy to isolate Iran and force the collapse of the 2015 nuclear deal was being undermined by a major deal between Iran and China. The 18-page draft agreement suggested that China and Iran were planning a 25-year project in which China would have access to cheaper oil while investing up to $400 billion in upgrading Iran’s transport and energy infrastructure and telecommunications sectors. Finally, in early August it emerged that China was helping Saudi Arabia with the development of its nuclear program. Although the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump was initially untroubled, senators from both sides of the aisle subsequently expressed concern, believing that this development could disrupt the region.

Although China has worked with different regimes across the Middle East, that does not mean that the prevailing regional order is under severe challenge yet. To understand the situation, it is important to recognize the role of established and rising powers — the United States and China, respectively — and the behaviors they exhibit.

As I set out in my new book, China and Middle East Conflicts, the United States has long been the hegemonic power in the Middle East and, therefore, its security provider. In fulfilling this role, it has worked closely with allies while containing and confronting its rivals. But, as Mehran Kamrava at Georgetown University Qatar has pointed out, the regional order is fragmenting. U.S. dominance has waned, giving space to regional and extraregional actors to push for greater influence, including China. But because China’s interests are primarily commercial, it wants to minimize business risk and price fluctuations. That means that China’s regional preferences are for order and stability — much like the United States’.

What differentiates the U.S. and Chinese positions are their respective places in the international system. As the established power, the United States has shaped and maintains the security structure. As an emerging, or rising, power, China has had less involvement in that process. It therefore has greater flexibility in realizing its goals. The result is that it has been able to adopt one or more of several different roles in dealing with the region’s contentious politics and the need for security: “supporter,” “spoiler,” or “shirker.”

What shapes China’s response depends on two factors: the state of its economic relations and the surrounding political context. Where China’s economic interests have been strong, it has taken a closer interest in security issues. But where someone else — such as the United States — provides security and its economic interests are fewer, China has shirked involvement in security provision.

Chinese “shirking” has been evident in its response to Iraq after 2003, the 2017 Gulf dispute, and the Palestine-Israel conflict. In Iraq, Chinese firms gained considerably from Saddam Hussein’s ouster, and many became major players in developing the country’s energy sector. They did so despite the absence of Chinese assistance with security efforts, which largely fell to the United States and its military occupation. The imbalance so frustrated then-President Barack Obama that he accused the Chinese of free riding.

U.S. preponderance was also a factor in the Gulf dispute between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on one side and Qatar on the other. The rivalry between the two sides is deep and systemic, with Saudi Arabia long the dominant Arab power in the Gulf and Qatar — through its recent wealth as a natural-gas-producing superpower — behaving as a challenger. Over the past decade, the two have been on opposing sides of the Arab uprisings that began in 2011 and their aftermath. Broadly, Qatar was sympathetic toward the protestors, while Saudi Arabia opposed some of the emerging political Islamist groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood. Saudi Arabia was also deeply unhappy about the Qatar-based Al-Jazeera’s sympathetic reporting about the protests. Saudi Arabia and Qatar played out their differences in proxy conflicts, including the Syrian war and the Egyptian coup in 2013. In 2014 Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt withdrew their ambassadors from Qatar, but differences were patched over by the end of the year. However, the underlying tensions never went away, resulting in another diplomatic and economic boycott in June 2017. Trump’s visit to the region was judged to be the catalyst, with the Saudis and Emiratis persuading the United States of Qatari radicalism and unreliability.

The Chinese were surprised when the boycott began, because they were in the process of negotiating a free trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, encouraged the two sides to talk to each other, but she stopped short of suggesting that China might take a more active role. Partly this was the result of China’s prioritization of economic considerations over political choices, but it was also because the United States remained the Arab Gulf states’ principal ally. In short, the path to resolution lay through Washington, not Beijing.

Chinese unwillingness to take on a more active role has also been evident in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Although China has regularly voiced support for the goal of a negotiated peace agreement between the two, its practical efforts have been more modest. At the last meeting between Israeli and Palestinian delegations in Beijing, in December 2017, it struggled to get the two sides to agree a nonbinding declaration.

Where Western political and economic influence has been slighter, China has adopted a more active “supporter” role in relation to conflict management. The most notable examples of this role concerned Darfur in Sudan from 2004 to 2006 and Iran’s nuclear program from 2013 to 2015. As a major commercial partner, China had the ears of the two governments. Its situation enabled it to act as a mediator, coaxing its regional partners to accommodate Western concerns while pushing back on Western demands for tougher sanctions.

Despite this trend toward greater involvement, China’s goals and outcomes as mediator elsewhere have generally remained modest, focused on achieving minimal agreement between the two sides. In Israel, its foreign minister reiterated China’s commitment to two states, including a fully independent Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital and based on the 1967 borders. But in practice, the Chinese-sponsored talks did little to address the fundamental grievances underpinning the conflict. Their result was a highly circumscribed form of conflict management in which the threat or practice of violence was reduced, rather than a resolution of grievances and their root causes: what Johan Galtung called “negative peace” and “positive peace,” respectively.

Negative peace also seems to be the principal goal of China’s response to the current “hot” wars taking place in the Middle East: in Libya, Syria, and Yemen. China’s limited goals and involvement in these conflicts may also reflect the more modest political and economic contacts it has at stake. Indeed, even before the start of the Arab uprisings, Chinese investment was less than $8 billion for the three countries.

In all three cases, Chinese officials have emphasized the importance of respecting national sovereignty, discouraging foreign intervention and persuading conflict parties to engage in political dialogue rather than armed conflict. To that end, they have supported international efforts, whether by regional organizations or international ones such as the United Nations. They have backed the internationally recognized authorities in Libya and Yemen, as well as the bloodied but undefeated Bashar al-Assad government in Syria.

Although the Chinese would see their stance as constructive, some Western observers have judged China as behaving like a “spoiler.” As early as February 2012, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized opponents of a U.N. resolution condemning Assad, which included China. Clinton said they would have to “bear responsibility for the horrors that are occurring on the ground.” Already the Chinese viewed Western claims skeptically, believing the West sought to remove Assad, using the new resolution just as its interpretation of Resolution 1973 had been used by NATO forces to target Moammar Gadhafi in Libya — a resolution on which China had abstained.

Until now, China’s roles as a supporter, spoiler, or shirker in relation to Middle East conflict have marked it out as a reactive force. But there are recent signs that its attitude may be changing and that it may pursue a more proactive role. Beijing is showing interest in becoming a “shaper” rather than simply a manager of conflicts, and resolving them and supporting post-conflict reconstruction through the notion of “peace through development.”

The “peace through development” concept has been explored outside official circles in recent years and received interest for three main reasons. One is that China’s global rise means that it is coming into closer and more regular contact with conflict-affected states and societies. Another is that its “Belt and Road” initiative — a project to build and upgrade transport and communications infrastructure across the Eurasian landmass, which began in 2013 — is becoming the vector through which China engages with such countries. A third is that China believes that its own experience of development can provide a model for other countries to emulate.

The result is a form of development that contrasts with the prevailing (and Western-associated) model of “liberal peace,” which emphasizes institution building, specifically democracy and markets. Instead, the Chinese alternative proposes state-led development over political reforms, stability over inclusion, and unconditional aid and investment.

Since then, efforts to apply the idea of peace through development in practice have gathered pace among some scholars and observers. Earlier this year, a Chinese-language article authored by Middle East scholar Sun Degang and China’s former Middle East envoy, Wu Sike, was posted on WeChat. Although not an official document, it encapsulates some of the comments and statements made by Sun as well as state officials in recent years. They argued that China has previously contributed to peacekeeping in the region but that now it was time to take part in peace building. They noted Chinese leaders’ comments from 2016 that much of the regional turmoil was due to its lack of development.

Sun and Wu criticized the American approach, which they summarized as the top-down imposition of democracy regardless of local conditions. Instead, they suggested, the Middle East would benefit more from a Chinese-supported, bottom-up and comprehensive approach, including “political reconciliation, economic development, social construction, and basic education.”

For now, “peace through development” remains largely on paper. Attempts to put it into practice have proved difficult. Last November, China hosted the Middle East Security Forum and hoped that participants would set aside their differences with each other and learn from Chinese experience. However, those hopes turned out to be too optimistic. Wang Jin at China’s Northwest University wrote that “China’s ‘new idea’ is still too idealized to be applied to the region.” Wang pointed out that the United States is still the regional hegemon and security provider and that the region is separated into two rival camps, with the Arab Gulf states, Egypt, and Israel on one side and Iran, Turkey, and Qatar on the other.

Looking ahead, then, it will prove challenging for China to apply its concept of peace through development in the region. But regardless of whether it works, the new tactic does herald a change in Chinese behavior in relation to conflict management and resolution. Instead of the more defensive, responsive actor it has been in the past, China appears set to become a more proactive participant. For that reason, U.S. and other Western policymakers should take note and respond accordingly. They can work with China to design and implement policies and projects that aim to deliver peace and development, by sharing knowledge, advice, and best practices. Alternately, they may conclude that China’s peace through development framework is too vague or does not resolve the underlying causes of conflict. In that case, the scope for cooperation may be limited. Either way, the emergence of a Chinese alternative highlights the need for current aid agencies and donors to review their own practices and acknowledge past limitations or failures. They should be prepared to deal with the likely presence of a new security and development actor on the scene.

105,https://www.thenewleam.com/2020/09/helping-create-justice-equality-peace-and-environment-sustainability-the-key-role-of-education/,"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",The New Leam,"Helping Create Justice, Equality, Peace and Environment Sustainability: The Key Role of Education","Education is often first seen in terms of literacy and then preparing for a prosperous, stable livelihood , also referred to commonly as good career. There is however also a much wider, more important role of education( which increasingly gets less attention), and this is to contribute to creating a society based on justice, equality, peace and environment protection. Ultimately this is the most important aim of human life and of education.

Let me make my point clearer by comparing two situations. The first situation relates to times when people lived by gathering fruits and other wild growing edibles. In this situation there is no literacy at all in the modern sense, no formal schools and colleges. However there is a strong oral tradition and other methods of ensuring that members of this society grow up with strongly embedded values that they will intentionally not cause any distress to any human being and any form of life and respect the equality and dignity of all people without any discrimination.

The second situation is of a modern mega city advertised as a centre of excellence in education. Name any advanced technology of education and it is available here. All the modern facilities are available as billions of Rs. have been invested. However there is no emphasis on basic values. Students are highly focused on lucrative jobs, even though this may involve work involving exploitation and destruction of environment. In this race for the most profitable jobs, using unfair means to get ahead of others, creating problems for others and discriminating against some is accepted as normal.

Now comparing these two systems, I have absolutely no hesitation in saying that there is a much better educational system in the former situation, even though even basic literacy does not exist there .

What is the essence of human life? This is to strive as much as possible to create a life based on justice, equality, peace, harmony of all forms of life and environment protection. What is the essence of education? The essence of education is to help to create the base for this by nurturing supportive value systems in various creative and interesting ways, with special emphasis on more formative years of childhood and youth but continuing later as well.

Let us consider just two basic human values. Firstly, we should not intentionally cause distress to any other human being and any other form of life. We should train ourselves and restrain ourselves in various ways to try to ensure this all our life. Now this appears to be a very simple statement but look at its dimensions. If we see this only in the context of daily life, so much distress will be avoided. If many people follow this and we look at wider possibilities of support for better policy, then even more, much more will be achieved.

Let us look at another basic value—no discrimination on the basis of race, caste, religion, class , color, region, nation etc. and a deeply-felt respect for the equal rights, welfare and dignity of all people. How many problems of our deeply troubled world will be resolved if only a very large number of people can imbibe this human value at a deeper and very sincere level. But lately the problem has been that despite rapid expansion of education many of these discriminations have increased, and that too among youth.

Now imagine the annual result of two schools. In one school there are all the big toppers but no emphasis has been given on these two or similar values. In the second school narrow academic result is mediocre at best but very sustained and sincere efforts have been made to impart these two human values ( and other related values). I have absolutely no hesitation in saying that the second school imparts much better education. It is extremely important that wide consensus should be reached on secular value systems which are very important for a world based on equality, justice, peace and environment protection. The most important role of education should be to strengthen these values, whether in formal educational institutions ( schools, colleges,universities), in communities or families.

While this was always very important, now that our planet is faced with a survival crisis, this has more urgency than ever before.

The sharp increase in armed attacks on communities, health centres, schools and other public institutions and infrastructure has disrupted livelihoods and access to social services. The impact on affected people is devastating.



As the international community responds to the crisis, we must meet immediate needs, and invest in long-term development. We must also work on shaping peace together, the theme of this year’s International Peace Day.

In Central Sahel, shaping peace together requires the full participation of women and young people. Engaging, employing, and empowering women and young people offers the best hope for peace, stability and recovery.

While the responses to address this complex crisis to date have centred on humanitarian and military interventions, collective investments are required simultaneously in all sectors including humanitarian response, economic and social development, and peacebuilding to foster a sustainable and resilient society.

As a priority, governments and partners must take action to reduce massive human suffering. It is important not to lose sight of the centrality of protection in our collective response to this crisis. Of 63 million people, more than 13 million, about 1 of 5, need humanitarian assistance. More than 1.5 million people are displaced, fleeing from non-state armed groups in the Central Sahel region and from neighboring countries, and violence is taking a massive toll.

Assistance is needed to address gender-based violence, lack of basic health services, growing food insecurity, rising poverty, and COVID-19. In Central Sahel, as in countries around the world, women and girls bear a disproportionate impact during crises, and face increased risks of sexual exploitation and abuse. During COVID-19, reports of violence against women are rising.

Given overstretched health systems and health worker capacity, it is vital that frontline responders are equipped with personal protective equipment to prevent the spread of COVID-19, respond to the needs of survivors, and provide much needed services.

An estimated 12 million girls in the Sahel are out of school due to the pandemic, which puts them at greater risk of sexual assault, child marriage, and early pregnancy, according to the Sahel Women’s Empowerment and Demographic Dividend (SWEDD) programme.

Launched by the United Nations and the World Back Group in response to a call made by Sahel governments, the ambitious SWEDD programme, led by UNFPA with the West Africa Health Association and partners, is a benchmark initiative to reduce gender inequality and convert population growth into an economic dividend.

To move forward, the vulnerabilities and violations of women, adolescents and youth affected by the crisis must be addressed to avoid a disaffected and dependent generation, from which to draw young people (and young men in particular) to armed groups and extremism.

It is time for collective action to put women and young people at the center of efforts, support social reform, and invest in social services while responding to the pandemic. Dynamic partnerships between governments and humanitarian agencies could provide women and young people with opportunities and support protection, health including sexual and reproductive health, and education.

Enabling women and youth to develop their skills, receive training, and earn an income would foster social cohesion, reduce economic dependency and extreme poverty, and promote peace, resilience and recovery in a more sustainable manner. Building more inclusive and healthy communities diminishes risks such as early marriage and early and unintended pregnancy.

Enabling women and young people to become self-sufficient creates an atmosphere of ownership and empowerment.

To drive progress, there is a need to develop economic incentives for private sector companies to employ young people, including young women. A strong partnership with the private sector will allow governments to spur innovation, progress, and a more diverse funding base supporting longer-term youth employment strategies. A win-win with young people is one where companies can find a balance between philanthropy and business, and young people can achieve financial goals and independence as they transition into adulthood.

To succeed, the governments of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger should lay the institutional and structural foundation for youth employment by promoting programmes and partnerships for skills training and establishing small and medium-sized enterprises. This is especially important in remote communities to benefit young people and the communities in which they live.

Efforts should reflect the rights, and drive to self-determination and economic prosperity, of young women and men, and promote gender equality, social cohesion, and access to quality health services and care, including psychosocial support and family planning.

Given growing funding constraints, the UN system must demonstrate new and innovative ways of working and efficiency in “doing more with less”. A complementary humanitarian, development and peacebuilding approach is the only way to address the complexities of the Central Sahel crisis. Investments across these three pillars can address immediate needs, root causes, and fund efforts to build back better with women and young people at the centre.","We must also work on shaping peace together, the theme of this year’s International Peace Day.

The goal is to reach a peace accord to end the world’s deadliest war.

The long-delayed talks come after an agreement in February between the US and the Taliban, which included a conditional the United States troop withdrawal within 14 months, a controversial prisoner swap and the Taliban’s promise to cut ties with Al-Qaeda.

The hope is that a political settlement could help reduce the likelihood of Afghanistan becoming a safe haven for terrorists once the US withdraws its troops. But the peace talks, known as the intra-Afghan negotiations, have a rocky road to success. Apart from fundamental differences on the type of post-peace government and women’s rights, the challenge will be whether any agreement on a lasting ceasefire can be reached until political progress is made.

Lasting ceasefire

According to the United Nations, the 19-year war has taken at least 35,000 civilian lives with the majority of casualties inflicted by anti-government groups, mainly the Taliban.

Source: United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, February 2020

After a series of three-day ceasefires during Muslim festivals in 2020, the warring parties have expressed willingness to negotiate a lasting ceasefire during the new talks, but disagreements remain on the timing and sequencing of it. Unlike the Afghan government, human rights bodies and the European Union, who all put humanitarian imperatives first, the Taliban’s view is that a ceasefire can be negotiated only after a political agreement.

Governments usually advocate for an early ceasefire in order to minimise the number of concessions they are required to make in negotiations. But armed groups are often opposed, arguing an early ceasefire can favour the status quo and government.

Some ceasefires, such as in Aceh, Indonesia in 2005, have been successfully agreed at the beginning of negotiations. But there are some examples, such as in El Salvador in the early 1990s, where a ceasefire was only negotiated after progress had been made on the political front.

A post-peace government

Afghanistan’s 2004 constitution, formed after the toppling of the Taliban Islamic Emirate in 2001, starts by calling Afghanistan “an Islamic Republic, independent, unitary and indivisible”.

It is likely the negotiators will agree on all these broad principles – except the idea of Afghanistan as a republic. That is because the Taliban still presents itself as an Islamic emirate forced into exile by the US invasion.

The Afghan republic derives its legitimacy from a popular mandate, rather than the divine right vested in the Taliban’s Islamic emirate. The head of state and members of parliament are now elected, albeit with allegations of electoral fraud and malpractice.

After capturing Kabul in 1996, the Taliban formed a two-track governance system, made up of a political-military leadership council and an executive bureau aiming to transfer its leadership system into state structures. But the group never succeeded in forming a functional state.

In 2020, little is known about the specifics of what the Taliban wants the future Afghan state to look like. However, the group does appear to want an inclusive, Islamic political system in which sharia laws are enforced – possibly akin to the theocratic government in Iran.

To ensure effectiveness and stability, any agreement on the structure of a post-peace government should make clear the role of the state institutions which have been set up since 2001. And it must also reflect the underlying configuration of power in Afghanistan, which is predominantly based on consensus among elites than domination by one group over the rest.

Rights and justice

The Taliban claims to want to build an Islamic system in which all Afghans have equal rights, where the rights of women “granted by Islam” are protected. When Taliban leaders were asked whether women should be allowed to go outside alone, according to Human Rights Watch, they said women would only be permitted to travel a short distance without a male companion.

Such a restriction would be among the world’s strictest interpretations of sharia law – comparable to Saudi Arabia’s guardianship system.

The question is whether Taliban negotiators will be willing to acknowledge that there are multiple interpretations of sharia, as well as embrace the post-2001 realities of Afghanistan, which have changed significantly since the group was last in power.

The fact that all sides are now sitting down at the negotiating table doesn’t necessarily mean they all believe a mutually acceptable political settlement is feasible. It can be tactical, a way to show progress.

The success of peace negotiations depends partly on whether the parties involved now conclude they can no longer sustain the recent levels of violence. But it also depends on them changing their perception of the conflict as a zero-sum game – one in which what one side gains, the other loses.

While all parties express their willingness to end the prolonged war, there are doubts whether the peace efforts could have got this far without US pressure for intra-Afghan negotiations to begin. But the US involvement – and US President Donald Trump’s apparent push to get a deal before the US election in November – could mean a peace agreement ends up being imposed on Afghanistan that is likely to fail, for example, due to reluctance of the post-peace government to implement it.

The Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, recently said that “Afghan society does not have a deadline”. Given the frighteningly massive human cost of the war, these peace efforts must be given a genuine chance – along with the necessary time and space to succeed.

But ideologically, he said, the pair of optimistic Zionists are on the same page. On over 450 pages, actually, the length of their newly published book, “Never Alone: Prison, Politics, and My People.”

“Never Alone” is what Troy tongue-in-cheekily calls a “memoirfesto.” It is part Sharansky memoir — recounting the three main periods of his life: prison, politics, and as head of the Jewish Agency — and part manifesto. Through the framework of Sharansky’s nine years in Soviet prisons, nine years in the Knesset, and nine years in the Jewish Agency, it’s also a rallying cry to every Jew to get personally involved in the Jewish story and push for unity.

“Never Alone” is a book of gratitude and great expectations. But it’s also an inside look at top Israeli, US and Russian leaders that portrays them as the flawed individuals they are. Readers gain not only Sharansky’s gulag anecdotes and behind-the-scenes insight into the Knesset, but also reap US historian and author Troy’s rich knowledge of the historical and personal context of the presidents who aided and abetted Sharansky in finding freedom for himself, and Israel.

It is the story of an immigrant who faced sabra disdain and changed a system, but also warns against rising anti-Semitism and broken communications among the Jewish peoples, especially on campuses. And finally, it’s a story of an undying love of democracy and an optimism that peace will prevail.

The Times of Israel spoke with Troy and Sharansky as part of the ongoing Behind the Headlines series. The interview was streamed exclusively for The Times of Israel Community earlier this week. (To join the ToI Community and to catch future video interviews as they happen, please click here.)

Both authors are based in Jerusalem and while Sharansky is enjoying his so-called retirement (by speaking internationally and writing prolifically), Troy, who was formerly based at McGill University in Canada, is still teaching at a variety of institutions in Jerusalem and elsewhere.

Before speaking about “Never Alone,” which was completed in April and includes the beginnings of the coronavirus crisis, The Times of Israel asked the pair about the recent peace treaty between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.

Sharansky hailed the agreement as Israel’s first true peace process with its neighbors.

We are dealing with something that is changing a paradigm of 50 or 60 years

This treaty is, Sharansky said, “the first real agreement about normalization which doesn’t include any concessions to any dictator. It simply says that it is in our interest to co-exist, to co-operate, and to help one another. I believe the meaning of it is huge. It is much bigger than the size of Abu Dhabi and Israel.

“I’m very optimistic about it. I think it’s a huge achievement… Here we are dealing with something that is changing a paradigm of 50 or 60 years,” said Sharansky.

As depicted in “Never Alone,” ahead of his arrest and imprisonment in the gulag, Sharansky was regularly under surveillance by the KGB. The Times of Israel asked Sharansky whether the current use of cellphone surveillance and COVID-19 tracking is, in his opinion, an infringement upon citizens’ privacy.

The coronavirus, said Sharansky, did not give birth to telephone surveillance technology: it has been in use for over a decade, he said.

“Because of corona, some of the new methods of monitoring, watching after people, which already existed, became legitimate,” he said. “The fact that now that it is general knowledge that you can be watched because of your mobile phone, I think it’s a good thing.”

He said that while nondemocratic countries are surely using the technology in place of, or in addition to, the informants of his era, it is the job of all Israeli citizens and the government to place legal restrictions on the technology and stop a slippery slope of infringement upon citizens’ rights.

“The people say that it is bad that now that it is openly used, I say in fact it is good that now we and members of the Knesset know what is the potential… Now that we know about it, I’d hope that the law would put very strict restrictions on its use. It should not be used in a normal situation to invade our lives,” he said.

Providing historical context, Troy said that over 100 years ago, the great Jewish American judge and legal scholar Louis Brandeis wrote an essay about privacy that couldn’t be more resonant today.

“You read it and it’s unbelievable. He saw that if you don’t respect privacy you have a serious problem in democracy. He set up the tension between the power of the technology to violate the individual’s privacy and be used by the state and the need to be vigilant to protect the individual. And so it’s a constant balance,” said Troy.

Building a bridge in 3-D

At its heart, the conceit of “Never Alone” is the vehicle of the three segments of Sharansky’s life in order to build a “3-D” approach to conceiving of the Jewish people.

“If you want to see a subject, you have to look at it from three different perspectives,” said Sharansky. “In this book… we tried to show the arguments from both sides, so it’s not the fight of enemies, but the fight of people who are concerned how we are rebuilding the Jewish state and have different points.”

While in prison, Sharansky imagined a nation supporting his struggle — which was indeed the reality. Later, as a politician traveling to US campuses, he learned that not every Jew supports the Jewish state. And finally, as a statesman in the role of the head of the Jewish Agency, he attempted to be a bridge builder between the two largest Jewish communities of Israel and the United States.

We have to talk in a much more deep intimate way than we talk if you want to continue to be one family

To illustrate the essential differences currently facing the two communities, the authors coin the concept of the lineages of David versus Isaiah. Israelis are “davidic” and are most preoccupied with the existential existence of the Jewish state. The Diaspora communities are more likely to be of the house of Isaiah and are concerned with building tolerant communities in which they can flourish.

“We have to understand that we are living in different environments and we have a different set of priorities, but we have something mutual in common, let us discuss, let us talk. We have to talk in a much more deep intimate way than we talk if you want to continue to be one family,” said Sharansky.

“I would say that’s the main message of our book: We will stay being different, but because our desire to continue our journey in history is so strong, through talking, through discussions, through cooperating, we can build it,” he said.

The two schools of thought often come into conflict, however, such as over the rights of Liberal Jews to the pray at the Western Wall or what types of conversions — and by which rabbis — are accepted by the Israeli chief rabbinate.

There are no books written on how you are ingathering exiles after thousands of years and how you recognize them as citizens

“There are no books written on how you are ingathering exiles after thousands of years and how you recognize them as citizens,” said Sharansky, implying that while perhaps the Israeli governments have not always been sensitive to US Jewry’s desires, they are traveling in uncharted territory.

“We’ll solve these problems, with the Kotel and liberal approach to conversion, we’ll solve them — but better sooner than later,” said Sharansky.

The rise of Soviet-style doublethink in the free world

Among the problems Diaspora communities face today is the rise of “doublethink” in which societal or career pressures don’t allow them to speak freely for fear of cancel culture. This is not only a Jewish problem, emphasize the authors, but it is one that may have roots 20 years ago during the Second Intifada when young Jews on campus were suddenly ashamed of the Jewish state.

As a politician at the time, Sharansky no longer embodied the pure Prisoners of Zion movement, rather the “Goliath” IDF responding to Palestinian suicide bombers’ terrorist attacks. He was accused of being an accomplice to the genocide of Palestinians and told that it would have been better had Israel not existed at all.

“I have no remorse, no second thoughts moving from the life where everybody says you’re such an inspiration to the life where everybody says you’re such a disappointment,” said Sharansky. But this transition did cause him to open his eyes to a new existential threat to Israel.

“Suddenly you understand the danger — not for our physical survival because we can fight with the help of our army — but for the unity of the Jewish people, that we can lose a big number of our Jewish people simply because our enemies are so successful in hijacking the language of human rights from us and presenting us as the last ugly colonial project,” said Sharansky.

“So the challenge became: how to make these students proud to be part of the struggle of the Jewish people and not being ashamed of it,” said Sharansky.

We can lose a big number of our Jewish people simply because our enemies are so successful in hijacking the language of human rights from us

Troy, a longtime campus professor, said that in the past academics thought this dissatisfaction with Israel among youth was “a passing fancy.” But now, he said, it has evolved into the idea of a “social justice warrior,” which has become mainstream, even in banks and corporations.

“Once upon a time it was a thing in the universities, now the extremists are running the conversation and they’re bullying people, not just on Twitter, but also in the corporation called Twitter. Not just on Facebook, but in the corporation called Facebook. And from there it’s going even into banks,” he said.

Troy relates that to him, one of the saddest incidents recounted in the book was when Sharansky visited campuses and found that even though students may support Israel, they are afraid to voice their opinions.

“What was really terrifying, what was really heartbreaking was to hear this man from the Soviet Union see these double-thinkers at Harvard University, at Columbia University, at Rutgers University. People at the best universities in the United States of America, at the freest country in the world, in the world that had always set the standard for the freedom, and he sees in their eyes, ‘I think one thing, I feel one thing, but I have to say a different thing in order to be accepted.’

“And it started in the 2000s over Israel and now we’re starting to see it in 2020 over the United States of America, over race questions, over veganism, over all kinds of things,” said Troy.

Sharansky said that a very dangerous phenomenon of doublethink is entering the free world, but it can still be stopped by every citizen making a decision to be free.

“I’m optimistic. It is the nature of people to want to be free and there is no totalitarian regime which will turn people into non-free. But even the small concessions here, individual concessions, are dangerous. We are simply warning,” he said.

“I was optimistic in prison and I am definitely optimistic in Jerusalem,” said Sharansky.

It is strange that Hindu nationalists are not coming to the defence of Rhea Chakraborty on her alleged consumption of weed. Cannabis is one of five essential, even sacred, plants mentioned in the Atharva Veda.

Vedic endorsement is not the only reason why we need to consider legalising of marijuana. The ban is unnecessary, detrimental to public health, and is causing a huge loss of revenue to the government.

Many would be surprised to hear that the use of cannabis in various forms was legal in India until 1985. That’s when we banned it under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. This was part of a global push, championed by the United States. But there’s a reason why many states in the US itself have now legalised cannabis.

A 2019 study on substance abuse by the Ministry of Social Justice estimated that 2.8 per cent Indians consume cannabis. That comes to around 3 crore Indians. Delhi and Mumbai are among the highest cannabis consuming cities in the world. Those who want to put Rhea Chakraborty in jail for alleged use of weed should consider this: if the law was applied in full force, around three crore Indians would be in jail, serving a term anywhere between six months to 10 years, depending on the amount of cannabis found on them.

What does Arnab smoke?

Call it cannabis, marijuana, hashish, hash, ganja or charas, way too many people consume it in some form or the other for pleasure. This is one of our social hypocrisies — we know it is prevalent, we know everyone who does it is not an addict in need of medical attention, and yet we don’t question the need for it to be illegal.

Like alcohol prohibition in Gujarat and Bihar, the criminalisation of cannabis is a sad joke. A recent study by Delhi-based Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy found, unsurprisingly, that most who fall victim to the law are the poor and marginalised. We rarely hear about middle-class or rich people going to jail for smoking up. They’ll get away with a bribe. Unless, of course, it is a politically motivated witch-hunt, which is what the media and the government are doing to Rhea Chakraborty.

In fact, Arnab Goswami’s style of coverage would have done more harm, driving peddlers underground and users at the mercy of unsafe options. Are the prime time hitmen of reputation smoking something stronger? Arnab can’t possibly be normal to do the item numbers he does to chase TRPs. If you think people who do weed are deranged, you should watch some prime time news one of these days.

Regulate for public health

Nobody is denying that cannabis use can be detrimental to public health. Which is precisely why we need to legalise and regulate it — just like tobacco and alcohol. The criminalisation of cannabis has resulted in a mammoth underground cannabis economy. As a result, people often don’t know what they are smoking, how strong it is, how adulterated, how bad, how many other harmful chemicals are mixed in it. Unless of course they’re growing the Vedic plant in their backyard — not something that’s unheard of.

Legalisation would mean less stigma around the use of cannabis, which in turn will help the extreme cases get better access to de-addiction centres and support groups. Some recent success in Punjab’s war against drugs has come not by putting drug users in jail but by widely distributing de-addiction pills among them.

We need to fight the falsehood that every user of cannabis is an addict who goes on to use harder, more harmful psychotropic substances. If anything, cancer-causing tobacco is more harmful, singularly the largest cause of lung cancer. Banning cannabis with tough jail terms just because some people over-do it, is like banning alcohol just because some people become alcoholics. Not that bans work.

GST on cannabis?

There are three kinds of economic opportunities India is missing out on with its irrational ban on cannabis.

First, many countries have decriminalised the use of cannabis. India could export cannabis to these countries and earn a lot of money.

Second, the government could earn a lot of money in tax revenue by legalising the drug. According to one study, the Delhi government alone could raise Rs 725 crore in annual tax revenue by legalising cannabis.

Third, the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy study points out that the strict ban on the cultivation of cannabis makes it difficult to produce industrial hemp — used in various sectors from construction to paper-making. India’s share in the $4.7 billion global hemp market is 0.0001 per cent.

Remember we are talking about something produced from a natural plant that has been consumed in this land for millennia. Legalise marijuana, end the hypocrisy. Something that’s Vedic and Ayurvedic, with proven medicinal purposes, can’t be banned as if it were poison.

As competition over natural gas resources in the Eastern Mediterranean intensifies, the situation has become dangerously militarised. With the help of Dimitrios Triantaphyllou, professor of International Relations at Kadir Has University in Istanbul, we assess what is different about the same old debate this time and why it has become heated now, and we look at the fallout between the two NATO allies, reactions within the EU, the grievances of both countries and the wider international setting that contributes to the tensions.

What should we keep in mind in the present situation in both the Eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean?

Before the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in 1982, no one talked about exclusive economic zones (EEZs). The extension of the continental shelf is a question of sovereignty, and an EEZ means sovereign rights. That means you can navigate through them, but you cannot exploit them.

In the Eastern Mediterranean region, there are three countries that have not signed UNCLOS—Israel, Syria and Turkey—although Israel has agreed to its national maritime delimitations based on UNCLOS. Hydrocarbons are an essential factor; they make a country a more important player. And if you have them, or control access to them, you have the upper hand in economic bargaining. It is also part of the reason why it is difficult to find a solution over Cyprus. In the Eastern Mediterranean, which is a relatively open sea, this is not a major factor, because no land touches Turkey’s. [Turkey is the only country that recognises the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC)”.—HH]

In the Aegean, yes, there is an issue, and here it is possible to find a formula. For example, extend Greek territorial waters to nine or ten miles and if we are unable to agree, technical experts will take it to arbitration. So, the issue then is: if we go to dialogue, on whose terms?

EEZs are essential because they are not only about oil and gas—they are also about fishing rights. Unless there are regulations, fish will be overexploited. The need to regulate also has to do with renewable energy. Whether it is wind power or geothermal power—both of which need large areas of sea—this becomes an issue because we know that, at some stage, the debate about hydrocarbons will become irrelevant as societies move towards green energy.

What do you say to Turkish claims about “grey zones” in the Aegean, referring to certain uninhabited islands that have also been a cause of tensions in the past?

There are no “grey zones”; how can Greece negotiate its sovereignty? Even if Imia is uninhabited, it is still just as important. Turkey’s arguments based on how far these are from the mainland or the capital are nonsense. It is Greek territory. Turkey says, “We want open-ended dialogue”. This can’t happen when the sovereignty of Greek islands is contested.

Open-ended dialogue meaning Turkey does not want to be restricted by customary international law?

Yes, and then Greece says: “If we cannot find a political solution in these parts, let’s take it to the International Court of Justice or international arbitration, where we will accept whatever the judges say”. Greece says it only discusses the continental shelf and EEZs because one comes with the other. By the way, in the Black Sea, Turkey’s maritime territory is 12 miles; otherwise, it could not have claimed its recently found gas reserves. Turkey accepts UNCLOS principles there.

What are the latest general developments in bilateral relations between Greece and Turkey?

We are now at the stage of trying to de-escalate. One would have expected de-escalation to have happened already but, even though one would think both countries and their leaderships are rational players, rationality is expressed differently in this case.

And why is there de-escalation? Because Turkey decided to escalate. The other side, Greece, said “Well, we cannot sit idly by when you have warships in waters we consider ours”. A strong Turkish reaction is the reason Greece has responded by sending warships to confront Turkish warships accompanying a research vessel, Oruç Reis. One should also not discount what happened on the land border in February and March.

Do you mean the weeks when the Turkish leadership decided to encourage thousands of desperate migrants and refugees to gather on the Greek border, promising them a passage to Europe?

Absolutely. It was a real wake-up call for Greece. Since then, we have this crisis developing, and now it has moved to the sea. What happened at the land border—the instrumentalisation of the refugees and migrants—was slowed down by COVID-19, but it arose again in the summer. And the Greek government decided enough was enough: “Your navy is out, my navy is out”. In turn, this has created a new wave of patriotism in Greece. We can debate whether or not the perceived threat from Turkey is real, but the feeling is there. We also feel many others don’t understand what we are saying.

Is this criticism aimed at the EU?

Not only the EU, other countries too. You in Estonia have your security concerns, and sometimes those further away do not understand them well enough. One might think, “Why are these Greeks shouting about Turkey?” but, for us, it is an issue that has to do with our identity and culture; it is an existential threat.

We also have to keep in mind that we are not talking about countries with similar populations, resources and power. It is not the “exotic Greek” always talking about the Turkish threat when nothing is happening. The history of Turkey and Greece is shaped by interactions with one another and this interaction explains both Turkish and Greek actions and reactions today.

The role of COVID-19 is worth discussing. It has affected Turkey’s already cooling economy, and the popularity of the government. What effect did it have on bilateral relations apart from closed borders?

What is different is that during the rapprochement from 1999 onwards both sides agreed on confidence-building measures (CBMs). They decided to reduce tensions during the summer months for the sake of tourism. Turkey would not violate airspace or send ships, and reduced any pressure, be it political, military, whatever. So, for three or four months, when revenue from tourism was coming in, both agreed to slow things down and benefit from it. But then COVID came along, and very little is left of tourism. I think this has also compounded why we have the crisis in the summer months.

Coming back to using desperate migrants and refugees on its border—this started in February. Then Hagia Sophia happened [the former Christian church turned to a mosque, then to museum was reopened as a mosque], then the ships, and the Chora museum [another former museum] was turned into a mosque as well. These are almost desperate measures. When you listen to Turkish politicians, they seem to perceive Turkey as being increasingly boxed in by other states when it comes to natural resources in the Eastern Mediterranean. In January, the MOU creating the EastMed Gas Forum (EMGF) was signed, without Turkey. Turkey argues that at least the “TRNC” should have been included. Is there a correlation between all these?

I am not sure using refugees and migrants was connected to gas. I think it has more to do with EU funds for the refugees and the domestic political situation in Turkey.

We also have to think about why we have the EMGF. Was Turkey left out, or does it not like the fact that other countries took the initiative? Cyprus is an important player because its discovery is significant. [The Aphrodite offshore gas field is located 160km south of Limassol, within the Cyprus EEZ.—Ed.] Since Turkey does not recognise Cyprus and has created complicated circumstances, others said “OK, we’ll go ahead anyway”. The US ambassador to Greece said in January that the US supported Turkey joining the EMGF.1

Some are saying that, without a pipeline through Turkey, the end price of gas from the Mediterranean would be too high for Europe to buy.

In terms of exploitation, some say the most cost-effective route would be a pipeline through Turkey: I think this is also a reaction to a long-term Turkish ambition to become an energy hub. But then you have discoveries that change the priorities—for example, Egypt’s Zohr field, which has become a hub—and the rapprochement between Israel and Egypt has helped this whole process along. [The Zohr offshore natural gas field is located about 190km north of Port Said, within Egypt’s EEZ.—Ed.]

In reality, everything about the EastMed Pipeline is still hypothetical.

Yes, it is one thing to have gas, and another to produce it—whether a pipeline or LNG or something else is feasible. In general, what happened was that other countries in the region said: “Wait a second, why should only Turkey become an energy hub and keep making demands?” At the same time, Cyprus is not heard. So they decided to create something instead. Mind you, the EMGF is an open-ended process.

In international relations, we usually look at the correlation between domestic- and foreign-policy dynamics. In recent years in Turkey—especially after the implementation of the presidential system and the failed coup attempt—domestic developments have produced a direct effect on its foreign policy. How do you see this?

What is happening in Turkey is having almost too great an impact on external issues, and I think the government is doing this consciously. The first priority is the domestic situation; after all, president Erdoğan is still a politician who has to think in terms of legitimacy. In this country, you can’t win by 60 or 70%; you lose your legitimacy. Counting every vote is crucial, like everywhere else.

So, you raise the issue of refugees and migrants because you realise your domestic constituency does not want them in the country anymore. You have to show that you are making a big deal, get more funds, and show that the Europeans are listening to you.

It is true that any populist leader has to answer directly to their voter base because power is becoming personified. If things are not going well, one person is to blame, not the entire system.

Yes, and this government has painted itself into a corner. They changed the political system and are now forced to get elected by 50% plus one. To get this number of votes makes everything more complicated. At the height of your popularity, you can get them on your own; then with a coalition; but now even the informal alliance is no longer enough. So other issues have to be brought up.

Yes, there is a rationale behind any leader’s behaviour, and their choices are defined by historical and international conditions and current affairs.

Sure, rationality is there. Decision-makers sit in the capital and assess the world. If something is happening and the global order is broken, you come up with “forward defence” and mix this into the political situation, and then you have a new dimension which translates almost to the lebensraum concept with links to the past. And then borders are not enough. If you add history to this, you relive the War of Independence 100 years ago to lead up to 2023.2 The conditions do not exist for an actual war. So you have to create something. This is the rationale.

This rationale is zero-sum, though; it makes long-term stable cooperation with other countries more difficult.

Exactly. We are still in the de-escalation phase; even though it should have been weeks ago, it has not happened. And I am thinking: why? Let’s take the example of US-Turkish relations. It has been transactional and is now even more so. Turkey is still a key ally in this part of the world, but is buying [Russian] S400s [anti-aircraft weapon systems] and other examples. Transnationalism has been tolerated for a long time.

Doesn’t Greece have S300s on Crete?

Yes, it does, but they came to Greece from Cyprus, whose purchase of them created great tension in the region. A solution was found by basing them in Crete in 1998 as part of a de-escalation deal. The missiles were stored there and have not been tested for some 14 years.

Greece says that Turkey has not been playing by the rules. The liberal multilateral order is not just about membership of NATO and being a candidate for EU accession. In the chapter on fishing rights in the accession documents, which must be negotiated with the European Commission, a candidate country has to recognise UNCLOS principles or it cannot join the EU.3[This refers to the acquis communautaire, the accumulated legislation, legal acts and court decisions that constitute the body of EU law. This is organised into 35 chapters that candidate member states must negotiate.—Ed.] It is also about signing other conventions, including the International Court of Justice and the Paris Agreement on climate change. Now Turkey is talking about backing out of the Istanbul Convention, which addresses violence against women. There are several other things which show that Turkey has not been playing by the rules. Greece has tolerated this because of mechanisms that keep tensions in check, and it has accepted transactional behaviour.

The concept of Finlandisation has recently come up in Greece. Athens does not want to be in the same position [with Turkey] as Finland with was the USSR. It cannot accept that.

From what I gather, those who shape Turkey’s foreign policy feel they have to react quickly in the conditions of a changing world order. Diminishing US influence and weakening of the EU are often the narratives.

Maybe Turkey has reacted faster than other countries in thinking about what its interests are. They might be thinking “What does this mean for me as a medium-sized power, my plan to be an energy hub?” and so on Erdoğan says Turkey is a global player: this is power projection. The same government used to have a different foreign policy. The elites ran it. Now domestic issues are projected in foreign policy, and ideological issues are brought in. A combination of all these factors has been leading to this. It is not only Greek-Turkish relations and violating its maritime borders and airspace with overflights.

Turkey has certainly become more assertive. You said in an article that, without mechanisms like NATO and EU accession talks in place, the Greek-Turkish relationship would mirror Turkey’s relations with some of its other neighbours, such as Iraq and Syria.

Since Helsinki [the 1999 European Council summit], Greece and the UK have been the most steadfast supporters of Turkish accession to the EU. The official Greek policy is still in favour of Turkey joining. The thinking goes that, if they become more like us, we will understand each other better. If this is blocked, there is less leverage too. Greece must therefore insist that rules of engagement are also put in the package deal proposed by Germany, which includes refugees, a customs union and visa liberalisation, as an alternative to accession.

Estonia also supports Turkey’s accession, so we have a similar position to Greece.

Yes, this would be beneficial to Turkey’s economy, too, since ratings agencies have downgraded it recently and its economy is suffering. If there was a deal, there would also be more confidence towards Turkey; tourism would be better, or maybe Volkswagen would not have postponed a decision on its 1.5-billion-euro investment.

It has been estimated that natural gas will be used for another 40–50 years as a bridge to a transition to cleaner energy. Hydrocarbons are a big issue for Turkey, bearing in mind that they also lost oil-rich Mosul Vilayet to the Mandatory Iraq due to the British interests in 1926. It currently has a considerable budget deficit and is a growing energy consumer with an ambition to become an energy hub. Is Turkey in a hurry?

This is a burning issue for everyone—Cyprus, Greece …. Most of these countries are energy importers. They have also economic crises and COVID-19 to deal with. The problem with Turkey’s gunboat diplomacy is that it is trying to set precedents by sending [research] ships like the Barbaros Hayreddin Paşa and the Oruç Reis to areas which do not belong to it under international law.

Shouldn’t the issue of energy in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Aegean and Cyprus be separated from each other?

It isn’t easy. Given how Athens has perceived the Turkish threat and its actions, it cannot act alone or let Cyprus act alone. For example, sovereign rights have been violated for years on Cyprus’s continental shelf. Cyprus is a small country, and unable (given partition) to defend itself when Turkey is drilling on its continental shelf.

So, to be heard, Greece and Cyprus are trying to internationalise the issue, to get solidarity, which is starting to come through. We say if you want the EU to continue functioning—and it is a union of mostly small countries—only being united helps us. So, the Greeks and Cypriots are saying that the only way we, as small and medium powers in the EU, can deal with this is through internationalisation. We need values, norms and conventions, international law, UNCLOS and so on.

Internationalisation can have dangerous side effects, though. Already, the US, the UAE, Egypt, France, the EU, and even Russia, have entered the process. Doesn’t this worry you, looking at the proxy wars in Syria, Iraq and Libya? Not all these countries respect international law. Is it possible to keep the situation from snowballing and, if so, what are the factors?

The internationalisation of the differences between Greece and Turkey is the only way forward for Greece, the smaller country in this case. In the Greek-Turkish context, it has two dimensions. The first is to make its partners in the EU and NATO aware of the threats it believes it is facing. The second has to do with coalition-building and strengthening its deterrence, both militarily and diplomatically. This is where Egypt and the UAE come in. The intention is not to start a conflict or to get mired in one, but to even out the diplomatic and military playing field in order to deter the other side from crossing the red line. One of the side effects of internationalisation is that, should de-escalation occur and a dialogue start, the two sides might be pressured into making tough compromises which they cannot do on their own.

The presence in the region of the US, France and Russia—all three of which are permanent members of the UN Security Council—implies how dangerous the stakes have become and that internationalisation cannot be avoided.

When Ankara was blocking NATO’s defence plan for the Baltics and Poland, pressuring the Alliance to recognize Turkey’s action in Syria as a fight against terrorism, it was perceived in our region as Turkey failing its allies. When we needed unity to support Belarus in its struggle for democracy, Greece and Cyprus said they would not sign up unless all EU states recognised their dispute with Turkey. What do you think about this strategy?

Greece behaves like that because others don’t consider its concerns. During EU enlargement, when the Baltic countries joined, Cyprus entered with others because Greece said so, and a deal was done. Other members agreed because, otherwise, Greece would have blocked enlargement. We are small countries, and we deal with our immediate neighbours who are members, and that is why Greece wanted a quid pro quo.

For the countries in your region, Belarus is a priority. It should be discussed more in Greece, because what is happening there is the most beautiful thing in the world: wanting to be free and democratic.

Turkey is doing the same within NATO. In this way, it is also trying to reduce support for Greece inside the EU by making threats among the NATO membership, or using its tools when it comes to Russia.

The problem is that small EU countries try to compartmentalise their foreign policy to their immediate neighbourhood while, for the EU to be effective, they need to have more holistic policies.

Let’s expand on the Russian factor. How is this perceived in Greece? We certainly don’t need factions or divisions in NATO because Russia would gain from this. Has this aspect been discussed from the perspective of conflict between Greece and Turkey?

It has been discussed from that point of view. Greece’s relations with Russia are the worst ever. The problem with Russia is the same for all countries: it is still a member of the UN Security Council Big Five. So one has to be extra careful. Greece is very concerned about Russia and is coming to terms with its hybrid warfare in every respect.

You live in Fener, so talk to the Patriarch4, who is feeling the heat of the Russian state acting through its church. It is trying to influence the Patriarchates in Jerusalem, in Alexandria, and so on. There is awareness of the Russian threat. A couple of years ago, for the first time in history, two Russian diplomats were expelled from Greece, after being found to be doing more there than they were supposed to be.

Why does Greece allow Russian ships to pass through its waters on their way to bases in Syria?

It is keeping the Russians in check, but it is not comfortable with them passing through the Aegean either. Of course, in the public eye, Turkey is a more significant worry, but Russia’s disruptive role is a growing concern in all the debates. But this notion has taken time to develop. Russia is relevant when it comes to Cyprus. The UN Security Council has to review the mandate for UNFICYP [the UN peacekeeping force in Cyprus, present since 1964] every six months, so there needs to be a balancing act.

I want to add that, in recent years, because of Turkey’s actions, Greece has turned more to the West. Russia is not as important a political player for Greece as many people believe. America is turning to Greece to update its defence agreements, especially after the failed coup attempt and subsequent developments in Turkey. Washington is not sure how long Turkey can remain a front-line state. This led to the defence agreement earlier this year, ratified by the Greek parliament, which upgraded the US presence in Crete and even the port of Alexandroupolis. Greece has also turned very much to the EU and supports its geopolitical ambitions, which is shifting from being a slow ship towards becoming a hard power.

Can “strongman” leaders like the Turkish president back down? It would show them as weak, and they can’t afford that domestically. And the changing international order legitimises leaders like this.

Yes, how do you get a strongman to back down? He has to show that the other party has stepped back first. Choices for strongmen are limited. They can’t allow healthy debate in society. This is part of the problem; de-escalation would mean that Greece pulls its ships back, and then Erdoğan can say we will, too. But this is not going to happen.

However, we know the press is not necessarily in the best shape here in Turkey. It is possible to set the tone. It is not healthy, but it has leverage, and public discourse can be changed, although a lack of debate about choices is not good. More democratic leaders, by the way, do not have that advantage.

One thing that characterises both Greek and Turkish political culture is that they depict themselves as victims of others. Turkey is a powerful country with huge potential, and I find it curious that its leadership still expresses the feeling that the international community is bullying them. The current government feels it needs to lash out for its own protection, while self-victimising itself in domestic rhetoric.

True. I think this has to do with being on the margins. Both are European flank states; so was the Ottoman Empire, and thus not part of the European system. There is an inferiority complex on both sides. Greece is smaller and less strong, but here in Turkey, one can see that Turks also have the same sense of inferiority.

The debate in Greece is interesting: the issue of whether or not we belong to the West is there, coupled with a notion that Greeks are a nation without brethren, and we are all alone in the world. This narrative is still alive, although in the 1970s the debate about Greece’s place in the West was started by Karamanlis. This was followed by efforts to become a member of the EU.

And what do the Turks say? “There is no better friend to a Turk than another Turk.” It is the same mentality: we are all alone and cannot trust anybody; everyone means us harm and want to dismember us. In that sense, there are a lot of parallels, even though modern Turkey has never lost a war; in the War of Independence, it was victorious against Greeks and the colonial powers.

Turkey currently lacks public debate, but paradoxically, during the first period of the AKP’s rule, social freedoms improved as never before. Today, it looks as if the public narratives have one life and political narratives another.

The AKP has certainly done tremendous things for social justice in Turkey since coming to power. Turkey has never been democratic, but it was democratising. The AKP opened up society. Kemalism brought about a divided society, with segments that did not talk to each other, which worked for the groups in power. Now things have changed, but to challenge the state is difficult. Daring to protest is becoming more and more complicated and this is not healthy for any society.

As for public debate, what worries me is that moderate voices in Turkey are afraid to speak out. Turkey has come to the point where even silence is considered a political view; it means not supporting [the government]. I am not judging those who stay silent, but silence does not contribute to the debate.

Meanwhile, research by Metropoll shows that a majority of Turkish citizens (59.7% of those polled) would prefer a diplomatic solution to the dispute with Greece over the Eastern Mediterranean. By comparison, 31.7% were in favour of a military solution and, not surprisingly, those were mainly AKP and MHP supporters.5

In addition, around 69% of Greeks are inclined to dialogue, and just 28.3% are against it.6 The numbers are comparable to public opinion in Turkey. So let’s see—perhaps Turkey will look at these numbers and back down based on the public preference. And it is crucial to keep these figures stable before the trend is reversed—by de-escalation and starting a dialogue. Theoretically, one place to begin would be exploratory talks as well as reinvigorating various CBMs. Negotiating in good faith means you compromise in good faith.

Everything we are talking about is connected to the international system, and far from being just a bilateral issue. It is connected to the position Washington is taking in its foreign policy.

We have a strategic void. The multilateral order, set up after the end of the Second World War, is changing. The country that has held this order together is the US, which is now casting doubt on its role; as a result, a pivot towards Asia is taking place. The void has grown thanks to how president Trump has been acting.

Turkey interpreted this in its own way and is trying to fill the void in its own interests. The EU is a slow, complicated system, but for France, for example, the incident on the Greek-Turkish border was a wake-up call, which NATO played down. The same applies to the incident between a French frigate and Turkish ships off Libya in June this year. France is the only real military power left in the EU since the UK left, and considers itself a guarantor power in the Mediterranean, along with the US. It is the only country that can be a counterbalance in place of the US. In addition, it wants to sell weapons, and Greece is going to buy them.

The French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle7 is coming to the Mediterranean for the first time, and this sends a strong message. France is saying to Turkey, “We are willing to negotiate, but only in good faith”. Ankara is acting on its own.8

Let’s be more positive. What steps or CBMs might be possible? What about Cyprus proposing Turkish as an official language of the EU?

I think it should; it would have a multiplier effect. It would also have a positive impact on Turkey’s relations with the EU. The reason this comes up is that Cyprus has two official languages, Greek and Turkish, under the constitution. I think this would be good, and the Cypriot government is aware of it. However, in present circumstances it is difficult; they personify Turkey with its leadership and forget about society. In addition, doing this will cost money because, when a country proposes an official language to the EU, it has to pay the costs involved, such as for interpretation. But a way could be found.

Cyprus has other ideas too, such as a joint escrow account that is part of negotiations between the communities. But they will not come out with them now, while Turkey is complaining about equitable shares of eventual energy finds.

Also on a more positive note, Greek-Turkish relations are not at all black and white, despite everything. There are many examples of interaction that are filtered out because of the nature of modern media.

Indeed. I first came to Turkey in 2003 and arrived with a Spanish friend who needed a visa to enter. I, as a Greek national, did not. He was shocked. As we entered, we saw a huge banner at Atatürk airport with the Greek and Turkish flags, because at the time the countries were bidding together for the European Football Championships. It was our joint bid! We did not get it, but we were doing it together. My friend was very surprised and I told him: “Just because we have problems doesn’t mean we don’t talk to each other!” I like to use this example because there is this misconception. We are neighbours, our histories are linked and related, and it does not mean there is no dialogue.

When I told my father I was interviewing a Greek professor who has been teaching in Turkey for years in the sphere of political science and international relations, he was stunned. His reaction was: a Greek working in Turkey and still alive? It is sad that political disputes overwhelm everything.

Yes, the last 21 years have been a period of rapprochement, although it seems to be coming to an end. In 1999 a paradigm shift to move ahead was decided, and it was tied to the Turkish bid for EU accession. Greece stopped blocking the accession, which led to involvement on all levels of civil society. I would not be in Turkey were it not for the rapprochement process. People like me came and started working at Turkish universities, even teaching in such fields as international relations and foreign policy.

It is lessening over time, but still, Greeks came to work here when there was an economic crisis and found ways to teach their kids Turkish so they would have more opportunities. There has always been academic dialogue, and academics have always wanted to work together—even before, during and after rapprochement. It is continuing: other Greek academics and I are integrated into our teams in the universities, and I invest my time in Greek-Turkish work. I even run a Turkish institution at Kadir Has University: the Centre for International and European Studies. There are research projects, think-tanks and research centres. For example, I started the “Greek-Turkish Young Leaders Symposium”,9 where we talk about how to enhance dialogue. I see interest in elements of both societies.

Most people in the IR community are moderate, and they want to reach out to each other. I am concerned that these connections might get broken because even moderate intellectuals end up adopting nationalist positions. Dialogue is needed now more than ever.

People often ask me if I have roots in this part of the world. Many Greeks have because they were displaced with the population exchange and so on. I don’t, but I understand and value the connection. I am here out of curiosity.

Are they surprised that you prefer to analyse things? Would most people prefer the simple “terrible Turk” narrative?

“Turkey is aggressive” is a repeated narrative. As a Greek citizen, I can understand this up to a point, but let’s not stop there—let’s keep analysing! When you talk about Erdoğan and his new Ottoman dream, I say, aren’t we being short-sighted? When we only say “aggressive” and “New Ottoman”, we have created a problematic dead end and I don’t think this narrative is useful for my country; we should be able to do more. From a purely Greek citizen’s perspective, Turkey might be revisionist, but let’s explain this, try to understand in what sense it is and in what sense it is not. Understanding allows us to take better steps, make better judgements, and act better. I love my country and I want it to be better and without tensions; it would be easier to solve our problems, too.

Peace is an essential part of catalysing positive economic, social, and political change in Sudan, according to statements made by spokespeople for Sudan’s peace agreement yesterday.

Head of the delegation of the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF) rebel alliance* and Secretary General of the Sudan People’s Liberation Front faction under the leadership of Malik Agar (SPLM-N Agar) Yasir Arman, called on all Sudanese political forces to be aware of their “great responsibility” to create balance in the transitional period.

In a press conference following the arrival of the 36-strong delegation in Khartoum yesterday, Arman stated that the faction is not excluding the military from the transitional period, but they also do not support the military’s control of it.

“We are not excluding the military from the transitional period, but we also do not support the military’s control of it” - Yasir Arman

He stressed that they want a real and responsible partnership to overcome all challenges, explaining that: “We realise that there are diseases in the transitional period, but these are diseases of teething rather than old age, and we are able to treat teething diseases.” He said that there is fragility in the political situation, along with fragility in the current Sudanese state apparatus, which increases their responsibility in reforming the situation.

Three challenges

Ibrahim Zariba, spokesman for the delegation and the chief negotiator of the Sudan Liberation Forces Group, said at the press conference that there are three challenges facing the peace agreement, economic, political, and social, economic being the largest. He said that peace itself is the way out of this crisis. According to Zariba, “it will return of millions of acres of land to those who can produce food, and will return millions of people in displacement and refugee camps to the land for food production.”

40 per cent of Darfur’s natural resources, such as oil and minerals, has been allocated to Darfur in the coming 10 years under the peace agreement.

“Peace will return of millions of acres of land to those who can produce food, and will return millions of people in displacement and refugee camps to the land for food production.” - Ibrahim Zariba

He added that peace will make trade exchange possible with neighbouring countries such as Libya, Chad, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic.

Social and political problems, including the outbreak of tribal conflicts in Darfur, in the Nuba Mountains in South Kordofan, and in eastern Sudan, can be stopped by joint action according to the peace agreement.

The deputy head of the delegation and head of the Sudan Liberation Movement-Transitional Council, Nimir Abdelrahman, said that “the transitional government faces major challenges in moving the country forward,” noting that peace is a central and basic theme of progress and prosperity.

The agreement is for all diplomatic missions in Sudan, according to Abdelrahman, noting that an agreement will contribute to improving the economic situation and that the SRF is an essential part of the transitional government.

Implementation and inclusion

Ibrahim El Sheikh, leading member of the Sudanese Congress Party, and leader of the Forces for Freedom and Change, the driving force behind the uprising, welcomed the rebel delegation, which arrived yesterday afternoon, the first group of rebels who arrived in Khartoum after the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement in the South Sudan capital of Juba on August 31.

El Sheikh said that the biggest challenge facing the peace process is the implementation of the clauses of peace agreements, noting that previous agreements have been signed but then revoked. He warned that financial resources must be made available by the government as required, and all parties must make strict and decisive commitment to the agreement made in Juba.

Maryam El Sadig, daughter of the President of the National Umma Party, El Sadig El Mahdi, and Vice President of the party, called for “including everyone in the peace agreement, in order to make all Sudanese people it’s guardian.”

At the same time, she stressed that sustaining peace requires realism and honesty in its implementation.

General conference

During the press conference, El Sadig announced that there had been contact with the SRF in Juba about holding a general conference to start the 39-month transitional period according to the new date agreed, which is the date of the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement. The conference will discuss how to reform the government and all institutions so that it can achieve a transition to civilian governance.

* The SRF alliance consists of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North faction headed by Malik Agar (SPLM-N Agar) active in Blue Nile state, and the Darfur rebel groups Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), Sudan Liberation Movement faction under the leadership of Minni Minawi (SLM-MM), SLM-Transitional Council, the Sudan Liberation Forces Group, and the Sudanese Alliance (which includes 15 smaller groups).

Radio Dabanga’s editorial independence means that we can continue to provide factual updates about political developments to Sudanese and international actors, educate people about how to avoid outbreaks of infectious diseases, and provide a window to the world for those in all corners of Sudan. Support Radio Dabanga for as little as €2.50, the equivalent of a cup of coffee.","September 18 - 2020 KHARTOUMPeace is an essential part of catalysing positive economic, social, and political change in Sudan, according to statements made by spokespeople for Sudan’s peace agreement yesterday.

On September 18, Libyan National Army (LNA) Commander Khalifa Haftar announced the resumption of oil production and exports in Libya. The general, whose army controls the eastern and southern parts of the country, explained his decision by concern for the welfare of citizens.

Haftar stressed that a precondition for resuming Libyan oil exports after months of suspension was compliance with measures that guaranteed a fair distribution of revenues and their non-use to finance terrorism.

Almost at the same time as Haftar, Vice Chairman of the Presidential Council of Libya, which presides over the Government of National Accord, Ahmed Maiteeq issued a statement on the resumption of oil production.

According to the LNA command, an internal inter-Libyan dialogue has begun in Libya, with the participation Ahmed Maiteeq from the Tripoli’s side.

Export of Libyan oil was blocked by representatives of tribes of the east and south in January-February of this year. The UN recognized Government of National Accord of Libya (GNA), located in Tripoli, accused Haftar, on the territory controlled by which tribes blocked oil terminals and fields.

Haftar and his LNA support an alternative government in Tobruk, which bases its legitimacy on the support of the House of Representatives (HoR) and its Speaker, Aguila Saleh.

The LNA and the forces supporting the GNA are now in a state of civil war. LNA is supported by the France, UAE and Saudi Arabia. GNA – by Turkey, Qatar and Italy. Americans are contacting both sides as well as Russia, while Moscow is blamed by Washington in the indirect military support of Haftar’s forces.

Over the past month, however, a number of foreign actors, primarily Turkey and Russia, but also the U.S., have engaged in various peaceful initiatives.

Historical agreement

The agreement announced by Haftar and Ahmed Maiteeq can be called historic one. Earlier, despite all the pressure from outside, it was not possible to resume oil production.

Now, as a result of the agreement, the National Oil Corporation of Libya (NOC) announced on Saturday night that the status of ‘force majeure’ had been removed from the “safe” fields and ports, but so far remains in areas and ports where it is believed that armed men hinder production.

Libya’s economy is entirely based on oil production. Oil is the main source of income. According to the NOC as of September 15, budget losses as a result of stoppage of oil production in Libya reached $ 9.8 billion.

The resumption of production means the return of these revenues, provided they are distributed fairly.

The fact is that only the national oil company – NOC – can sell Libyan oil. The revenues through the Central Bank of Libya were distributed among the institutions of all parts of the country, regardless of what military unit or government controls this or that region.

However, in the east and south of Libya it has always been suspected that militia groups controlling Tripoli take the lion’s share of the income. Thus, the blocking of the field and terminals was not only an act of pressure on the GNA by Haftar. It was no less in line with the interests of the tribes and clans in eastern and southern Libya.

That is why, although there had been information about the negotiations on this issue before, it was difficult to achieve a solution: it was necessary to find a compromise between the positions of all actors involved, including business circles and local leaders, and not just key political actors.

Ahmed Maiteeq as the new main player in Libya?

On September 18 Maiteeq announced on his Twitter that a joint technical committee would manage the distribution of revenues from Libyan oil export.

The main functions of the joint technical committee will be to form a budget that is fair from both sides’ point of view and to oversee the implementation of agreed expenditures. The committee will perform its functions until a new unified government of Libya is elected.

De facto, this committee will create a stable channel of communication and coordination between the two governments in Libya, establishing a strong economic basis for unification of the country.

Zawiya military and municipal councils and local sheikhs supported the arrangements. The resumption of oil exports through that port in western Libya promises them direct benefits.

Ahmed Maiteeq – Libya’s former prime minister has always enjoyed the image of a determined and effective man with connections in business and abroad, seeking a diplomatic solution to the Libyan conflict.

Previously, he had been on more than one occasion with diplomatic missions in different parts of the world, from Washington to Moscow. During a visit to Moscow in June 2020, Maiteeq predicted a decrease in the intensity of the conflict, and it was realized. Despite belligerent rhetoric from both sides, there was no storming of Sirte or Al-Jufra Air Force Base.

Moreover, at the same time the opposing Libyan parties agreed to resume negotiations of the military committee (5+5) for a truce in accordance with the draft agreement submitted to the UN during the negotiations on February 23.

For talks with the LNA and government in Tobruk, Ahmed Maiteeq is the ideal figure. He is the deputy of Presidential Council, a highly respected official. At the same time, opponents cannot call him a militant leader or an Islamist.

Unlike the influential interior minister Fathi Bashagha or head of the Libyan state council Khaled al-Mishri, he is not plagued by accusations of war crimes or patronage of such crimes.

Not long ago, on the eve of the announcement of the beginning of oil export, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu held a productive meeting in Ankara on September 15 with Ahmed Maiteeq. Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar also held talks with Maiteeq on the visit.

Given the recent statements of the head of the GNA Fayez al-Sarraj about his desire to resign, Ahmed Maiteeq could claim to replace him at the head of the GNA Maiteeq’s visit should be seen as an attempt to gain support for Ankara, which plays a crucial role in Libyan affairs.

The high level of negotiations may indicate that Maiteeq has received such support.

It is telling that the Turkish state media TRT World, quoting one of the experts, called Maiteeq “the next prime minister of Libya’s UN-recognized Tripoli government”.

Thus, Ahmed Maiteeq has a chance to become ‘the savior’ of Libya, turning the country to the path of peaceful settlement and prosperity, resolving the oil export crisis. His talks with Haftar are an excellent PR move, proving to the Libyan people and the world community his peace-making intentions.

Attacks of globalists

Nevertheless, there were those who opposed the agreement signed by Ahmed Maiteeq and Haftar representatives.

“Ean Libya”, citing its own sources, reports that some U.S. officials are dissatisfied with the agreement signed by Ahmed Maiteeq and Khalifa Haftar on the resuming of Libyan oil production. Apparently, the negotiations were held in Russia, which is negatively perceived in the United States.

Bloomberg reports that Fayez al-Sarraj, rejected the agreement, which, according to his senior assistant, calls into question the restoration of production.

A senior warlord – Major General Osama al-Juwaili, the commander of the Western Military Zone, also spoke out against the agreement.

The readiness to take any decision of the Libyan government, but without participation of Khalifa Haftar, was expressed by the plenipotentiary minister of defense in the Government of National Accord Salah Eddine al-Namrush on September 20.

Mohamed Sowan, head of the Justice and Construction Party, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood in Libya, described the agreement to resume Libyan oil supplies as suspicious and absurd.

On September 18, a Twitter user reported that an armed group attacked the house of Ahmed Maiteeq in Misrata and demanded that he leave the city. The user also indicated that another armed group attempted to attack the Central Bank building in Tripoli.

According to LibyanNews, sheikhs and many civilians arrived in Sirte for the meeting of representatives of the country’s Eastern government and Tripoli authorities. However, the planned dialogue was allegedly disrupted by al-Mishri-controlled militia.

Finish line

On August 21, the warring parties to the Libyan conflict issued statements on cessation of hostilities. The agreement calls for the elaboration of various conditions for preserving peace, including conditions for the transition period before elections, which are likely to take place in March 2021. It is assumed that a single government will be elected in Libya.

Under these conditions, serious internal political transformations are beginning in the eastern and western parts of Libya. On September 14, the government based in Tobruk resigned. Large-scale changes are expected in the GNA.

In many ways, resistance to Maiteeq deal from other actors in the GNA is due to their own ambitions and fear that if he succeeds, he will be the main and only candidate for the post of the country’s leader. However, along the way, they become puppets of the US, disinterested in strengthening both Russian and Turkish influence in the country.

The U.S. itself seeks to act as the saviors of Libya by initiating negotiations. Previously, the U.S. embassy had tried to negotiate with Haftar to resume oil exports, apparently in exchange for its support.

U.S. Embassy #Libya’s statement on the apparent Libyan agreement to reopen the energy sector. https://t.co/vVzP9cYYgS — U.S. Embassy – Libya (@USAEmbassyLibya) September 12, 2020

But now the U.S. is left with nothing.

It is unlikely that Ankara was not aware of the Maiteeq-Haftar agreement on oil, given that it was in constant contact with Maiteeq and was engaged in a military and diplomatic dialogue with Moscow on Libya.

At the same time, the strengthening of the U.S. role means a direct threat to Turkey’s interests and everything it has achieved in Libya.

On September 19, The National Interest magazine published an article by an expert from the leading pro-Israeli American think tank JINSA (the Jewish Institute for National Security of America) – U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas Trask (ret.), former vice commander of U.S. Special Operations Command.

JINSA calls for a Special Envoy for Eastern Mediterranean “to create a clear counterweight to Turkey’s growing obstruction of regional energy development.

“A special envoy must also end a decade of “leading from behind” on Libya, where Turkey and Russia appear to be establishing permanent beachheads and coordinating to shape the country’s future, despite being on opposing sides of the conflict. Among other priorities, U.S. should focus on limiting Ankara’s influence over the Tripoli government,” – Lt. Gen. Thomas Trask said.

Given the influence of the Israeli lobby on the policy of the current U.S. administration, any U.S. initiatives in the Libyan direction should cause concern to Ankara. The attempts to sabotage Mateeq’s oil deal will only strengthen the US, which interest in the Eastern Mediterranean are oppose to Turkish ones.","Initiative by Ahmed Maiteeq may change Libya foreverOn September 18, Libyan National Army (LNA) Commander Khalifa Haftar announced the resumption of oil production and exports in Libya.

The Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North led by Abdulaziz El Hilu (SPLM-N El Hilu) has criticised statements of the Sudanese High Peace Council.

South Sudan Security Advisor to the President and head of the mediation team Tut Galuak arrived in Khartoum yesterday, and handed the invitation from the South Sudanese President Salva Kiir personally to the chairman of the Sovereign Council, Lt Gen Abdelfattah El Burhan.

Heads of state and government officials of neighbouring countries, Arab countries, member countries of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), and Friends of Sudan* have been invited as well.

Dhieu Mathok, member of the mediation team, told reporters at Khartoum International Airport yesterday that the mediators are arranging that a delegation of the Sudan Revolutionary Front rebel alliance visits Khartoum on Thursday, to prepare the return of all leaders of the armed movements from abroad.

After the final signing of the peace agreement, the text will be included in the Constitutional Document signed by the then Transitional Military Council and the Forces for Freedom and Change opposition coalition in August last year, marking the start of the transitional period.

The peace agreement, mediated by South Sudan, was signed in initials on August 31. The date for the final signing ceremony was initially set on October 2.

SPLM-N El Hilu

Mathok further said that peace talks with the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North led by Abdulaziz El Hilu (SPLM-N El Hilu) will start soon, following consultations with the Sudanese government about the negotiation methodology. Prime Minister Hamdok and rebel leader El Hilu signed an accord on the basic principles for peace negotiations two weeks ago.

In a press statement yesterday, SPLM-N El Hilu criticised the statement of the High Peace Council** about its meeting on Monday. Rebel spokesperson Ammar Daldoum stated that the High Peace Council ignored the contentious issues mentioned in the two two agreements signed by Sudan's Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok and El Hilu in Addis Ababa on September 3 and 4.

According to Daldoum, the statement of the High Peace Council did not mention that the majority of Sudanese political parties and civil society organisations, a large proportion of the Sudanese people - in particular those living in the war-torn states of South Kordofan and Blue Nile - support the SPLM-N El Hilu positions. Daldoum also claims support for SPLM-N El Hilu from the African Union, the United States, Britain, France, and the Sudan Troika (USA, UK, and Norway).

According to SPLM-N El Hilu, a broad national dialogue by way of workshops, according to the methodology mentioned in the Addis Ababa agreement, should lead to national consensus about a viable secular state. This new Sudan will impose no laws based on religion. The movement affirmed it adheres to what has been agreed upon by Hamdok and El Hilu in Addis Ababa.

In July, El Hilu warned the Sudanese government that its policies will continue to divide the Sudanese people.

SPLM-N El Hilu separately joined the peace negotiations in September last year. The talks continued in January, but no progress was reported. In a statement dated May 28, SPLM-N El Hilu denied rumours that they withdrew from the peace negotiations. ""These are baseless allegations,"" said Daldoum, who is also the movement's chief negotiator. ""We deposited our position paper on State and Religion to the South Sudanese mediation team on 26 February 2020, and received no response from the government up to this moment,"" he stated.

El Sheikh said that the biggest challenge facing the peace process is the implementation of the clauses of peace agreements, noting that previous agreements have been signed but then revoked. He warned that financial resources must be made available by the government as required, and all parties must make strict and decisive commitment to the agreement made in Juba.

Maryam El Sadig, daughter of the President of the National Umma Party, El Sadig El Mahdi, and Vice President of the party, called for ""including everyone in the peace agreement, in order to make all Sudanese people it's guardian.""

By Owei Lakemfa

NIGERIA and Ghana, the two neo-colonial Anglophone ‘neigbours’ who are also two of the three largest economies in the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, are at each other’s throats, fighting like kindergartens.

Both countries, like sibling rivals, have squabbled for decades, the latest being last Friday, August 28, 2020 when Nigeria catalogued the sins of Ghana which include harassment of Nigerians in Ghana, the demolition of the Nigerian Mission’s property, deportation of 825 Nigerians between January 2018 and February 2019 and unfair residency permit requirements.

Other allegations by Nigeria include a media war against Nigerians in Ghana, a harsh and openly biased judicial trial of Nigerians, and the Ghana Investment Promotion Centre Act which imposes a crazy $1 million capital investment on Nigerians and other foreigners who want to engage in retail trade in Ghana. This led to the closure of over 300 Nigerian shops in 2018 and another 600 in 2019.

I am a Nigerian pan-Africanist who from the 1980s religiously followed Ghanaian politics, studied its history and capped these with a three-year residency in Accra as the chief executive officer of an African organisation with ambassadorial rank.

So, I can easily speak to these allegations without bothering you much with the mainly evasive defence of the Ghanaian government and its counter-allegations against Nigeria, which are mainly true.

The harassment of Nigerians in Ghana are constant. After witnessing some, I asked a Ghanaian friend why this was so. He said Ghanaians, compared to Nigerians, are poor and that they hold Nigerians responsible for the skyrocketing price of property in Accra because Nigerians were ready to pay outrageous amounts to buy property.

In 2019, an informal meeting of Nigerians held in Accra, and Professor Augustine Nwagbara, then teaching at the University of Education, Winneba, highlighted the ordeals of Nigerians in Ghana and suggested that the Nigerian press should take this up.

The video of the meeting leaked and an enraged Ghanaian government pounced on Professor Nwagbara, accusing him of incitement and being a threat to peace. He was detained and interrogated before being sacked from the university. He practically fled Ghana.

On demolition of structures of the Nigerian High Commission, no private citizen in any country would demolish the buildings of an embassy without official connivance, more so when the police headquarters nearby refused to intervene.

Many Ghanaians believe all Nigerians are crooks. A senior Ghanaian lawyer once told me that in the eyes of the average Ghanaian judge, a Nigerian charged for crime is more or less guilty; he is like a cockroach pleading innocence before a hen.

I was privy to a visitation to the Nsawam Medium Security Prison on the Accra-Kumasi Highway by a church organisation in 2014. Many of the prisoners were Nigerians, mainly Igbos. Some wept, asking that their squalid conditions be brought to the notice of the Nigerian government, while many asked for judicial reviews, claiming to be victims of conspiracy between Ghanaians and their police.

Nigeria said Ghana had deported 825 of her citizens; the Ghanaian government disputes this, saying only 700 Nigerians were deported. What is the issue? It is not necessarily the number, but the act of deporting citizens in a regional community with supposed free movement.

Under the ECOWAS protocols, citizens from member states can stay in any country for 90 days. Now, there were many Nigerian students in Ghanaian universities who, by the way, paid fees in foreign exchange over four-fold what Ghanaian students paid.

ALSO READ: Ganduje settles N257m scholarship fees of 43 students studying in Egypt

I witnessed some of these Nigerian students being barred by Ghanaian Immigration from boarding flights from the Kotoka Airport back to Nigeria on the basis that they had spent a few days above the 90-day window.

I had intervened on such occasions, and became marked. The officers had contempt for my Nigerian Diplomatic Passport, so I started pushing my African Union Diplomatic passport in their faces.

Perhaps the most contentious issue is the forced closure of Nigerian shops, but not directly by the Ghanaian government that has become an expert in the act of throwing stones and hiding its hand. Rather, Ghanaian traders and thugs are used, which amounts to Ghanaians taking the law into their hands.

The background to this is that in 1994, Ghana made a Ghana Investment Promotion Centre law which states that foreigners who want to carry out any retail trade must have a $300,000 capital.

This is a way of barring all non-Ghanaians from trading in Ghana because a hawker with such huge capital will not leave his country to go hawk slippers on the streets of Ghana. This amount was by 2013, increased to $500,000, and is now $1 million! This violates ECOWAS protocols.

The Nigerian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, wonders: “What is the point of having an economic community if at the end of the day each country will make laws and regulations in contradiction of that? Clearly, if it is contravening the ECOWAS protocol, then we would have to now look at ECOWAS solution, including the ECOWAS court as a final arbiter.”

Brilliant, except that he turns a blind eye to Nigeria’s blatant violation of the same ECOWAS protocols of free movement of persons and goods. How does Nigeria hope to get justice at ECOWAS when it is going there with unclean hands?

Ghana’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Shirley Ayorkor Botchway, pointed out that Nigeria similarly hurt Ghanaian traders when without notice, it shut down its land borders in 2019 with other countries.

Clearly, the Nigerian government’s excuses for the border closure are not tenable. For instance, it claims arms are smuggled across the borders. This may be true, but who says they go through the official borders and not the illegal routes that remain open?

Those that came through the official borders were clearly due to connivance with Nigerian border security because they have scanners to detect arms.

A second excuse is the claim that the closure is meant to grow Nigeria’s economy. Nigeria has an overwhelming control of trade across West Africa; its products are in all West African markets I have been.

Nigeria is clearly the economic giant in West Africa, accounting for 73.5 per-cent of ECOWAS exports, 52 per-cent of its general imports and 51 percent of its food imports. For a country to dominate a market and then shut itself against that market is nothing short of sabotage.

The Nigerian and Ghanaian governments have no basis for the quixotic war of attrition they are engaged in. Both are undeserving of their peoples, endanger African unity and integration and are striving to be good boys of foreign financial institutions and their Western owners. They are bedwetting big boys who should find productive engagements.

Monrovia — Sister Aid Liberia (SALI), a women-based National Non-Governmental Organizations vehemently condemns the Liberian Government use of lethal force against peaceful protesters who have gathered to beseech the government to address the sparring number of gruesome cases of rape against women, especially girls and babies in Liberia. The ongoing peaceful protest by Liberian women and men alike who are demanding that the Government fix the country's judicial and political systems so that women and girls are protected from sexual and all forms of violence is guaranteed by Article 17 of the Liberian Constitution and by various international instruments.

It is evident that running parallel with the Coronavirus crisis has been the Rape Pandemic. The existing overwhelming and telling statistics of cases of rape fanning across Liberia tower this fact. Recently, when COVID-19 reached its peak at 1,216 active cases early August 2020 and recessed to less than 400 cases with more than 700 recoveries, the Rape Pandemic suddenly surged astronomically to a similar height thus preventing women, girls, and babies from returning to normal life unlike the rest of the country. An enumeration of a few telling statistics demonstrates this point. For example, just in two months (June and July), in Grand Cape Mount County alone, an eight-year-old girl was allegedly raped by a 19-year old boy; a 15-year old girl was also raped in Mobayer Town and another 14-year-old girl was raped in Bagama Town, Tewor District; and on Agust 4th, a 13-year-old girl was allegedly raped in Singe Town.

Additionally, in Gbarpolu County, a 15-year-old boy admitted raping a 3-year-old girl using a razor blade to cut her private part to enable him to penetrate. Similarly, in Montserrado County, a 10-year-old girl was raped and sodomized by a 32-year old man, Moses Tarnue. The survivor took several stitches, was undergoing treatment, wearing pampers and her anus could not hold any longer. Added to this are the alleged rape cases of a 17-year-old girl by an Officer of the Liberian National Police, Emmanuel Wesley, who was disrobed but is currently on the run; the rape of a 15-year-old-girl by a pastor in Bong County on June 6, 2020, just to name a few. Meanwhile, attending this pervasive Rape Pandemic are ongoing cases of other forms of violence against women and girls. For example, in Margibi County, a 26-year old man, Darius Bondo murdered his 30-year ex-girlfriend, burnt her home, and committed suicide after accusing her of an extra-sexual relationship in Kissi Camp Village, Borlola Township, Margibi County. Indeed, rape has become a Social Pandemic in Liberia.

Meanwhile, we appreciate all meaningful Liberians, including politicians and partisans of various political parties as well as our male counter and religious leaders for participating in this ongoing campaign. Notwithstanding, we observe with dismay the political poaching and encroaching on this meaningful campaign process, something that is evidently introducing an unintended political slant to our campaign, making it politically fraught, rhetorically jabbing, and tension-filled. We detest this! Similarly, we denounce the uncivil outburst of emotions of a female who reportedly slapped a male and we also condemn reported bullying by the police force, one of whom was said to have engaged in a victim-blaming and defensive argument with protesters, justifying that women are being raped because of the way they dress, something that is logically contradictory, considering the number of babies currently bleeding in blood as a result of rape. At any rate, we insist that those nominal political side-events give no ground for police brutality and a few instances of uncivil outbursts of protesters do not in any way discount the meaningfulness of our campaign against this Rape Pandemic.

There is overwhelming consensus by all Liberians that incidents of rape in Liberia have reached crisis proportion and actions are urgently needed to curb this menace. Already, many have crowded in this cause, including the Independence Day Orator, Rev. Dr. Simeon Dunbar and the Major General Prince C. Johnson, Chief of Staff, Armed Forces of Liberia, both of whom went too far to propose the meting out of the death penalty against convicted rapists, something we object to. But the message is clarion clear. Rape is a pandemic and deliberate actions must be taken now by the Liberian Government to curb this menace. Not the reverse. Therefore, SALI condemns the use of force by the Liberian National Police and we join others to demand that the political and judicial system be fixed now so women's rights are not continuously violated, their dignity ravished, and future dismantled by rapists. We insist: Enough is Enough!","It is evident that running parallel with the Coronavirus crisis has been the Rape Pandemic.

The answer is yes, because there have been significantly longer periods of peaceful coexistence between the two nations (or their historic predecessors) than of conflict—the latter of which occurred during the collapse of empires.

The resolution should address a few levels of the problem. One is the geopolitical context: Russia’s twenty-seven-year-long security domination in the Caucasus, which has clearly proved to be not a factor of stabilization but one of control, based on consolidation of Soviet legacies—expressed in conflict narratives, paradigms, institutions, and governance—must be neutralized.

This can be achieved by changing the format of negotiations and the composition of mediators.

Both Armenia and Azerbaijan should understand that neither long-term peace nor consistent democratization is possible without independence from Russia.

The other way is by delegitimizing military gains in order to take away their power as bargaining tools in negotiations, thus disincentivizing any military adventures. This includes bringing more normative certainty and justice in cases of violation of international law.

The negotiations should also suggest and consider mutually beneficial deals, rather than try to achieve concessions under military pressure.

And at last, in order to change the territorial conflict’s old, pre-modern paradigm, any conflict resolution should put relations between the two states into the contemporary context of IT, human rights, and conditionality of borders.

Laurence Broers Director of the Caucasus Programme at Conciliation Resources and Associate Fellow at Chatham House

Peace is possible between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, but Armenia and Azerbaijan have never been at peace as sovereign states—only as provinces of larger empires. That tells us that there is no intrinsic reason why the two peoples cannot be at peace with one another.

Rather, the issues dividing them are political. These issues are familiar: a contested territory that is sacred to both nations, an Armenian self-determination movement that ended in a dearly won military victory in 1994, and its overspill into the occupation of a large swathe of Azerbaijani territory and the forced eviction of some 600,000 ethnic Azerbaijanis.

Azerbaijan points to four UN Security Council resolutions affirming its territorial integrity. Armenia points to grave and persisting insecurity and an existential threat to the Armenian population of Nagorny Karabakh. After twenty-eight years of often—though not always—dysfunctional diplomacy, supportive multilateralism is receding as an approach to negotiating an Armenian-Azerbaijani peace.

It is being replaced by opportunist multipolarity, as regional powers Russia and Turkey increasingly dominate the conflict-management space. This augurs new dependencies for both Armenia and Azerbaijan—and the illusory prospect of another enforced peace—as clients rather than sovereigns.

Carey Cavanaugh Chairman of International Alert and Professor at the Patterson School of Diplomacy and International Commerce

Absolutely. Is it easy to attain? Absolutely not.

I know this firsthand, having served as the U.S. co-chair of the OSCE Minsk Group. This body has been charged since 1992 with helping bring about a peaceful resolution of the Nagorny Karabakh dispute. At least twice under this mediation format, in the mid-1990s and again in 1999–2001, the parties to the conflict approached political settlements that could have brought about lasting peace and fostered a dramatic transformation of the South Caucasus region.

Three distinct elements are required to achieve peace between Armenians and Azerbaijanis: a willingness on the part of their leaders to work together toward a compromise solution, international support in the development of such a settlement and its eventual implementation, and the preparation of local populations to embrace that kind of accommodation.

Achieving all three has proved a daunting challenge, but I believe it is possible and must be done. There is no military solution to the Nagorny Karabakh conflict.

What is needed now from all parties is the political courage to end hostilities, restore the ceasefire, and commit to truly meaningful, mutually beneficial negotiations that can provide their peoples with the peace they deserve.

Thomas de Waal Senior Fellow at Carnegie Europe

Peace is still possible—and indeed it is essential. But the latest fighting, which began on September 27, 2020, makes it even more distant. An immediate ceasefire is essential.

Fundamentally, it is up to Armenians and Azerbaijanis to solve this conflict themselves; outsiders cannot do it for them. But the bloodshed and toxic rhetoric from both sides have boxed them in and limited their capacity to do a deal.

The international community—the three main mediators, but not only them—can start with three steps to help promote peace.

First, the OSCE Minsk Group co-chairs—France, Russia, and the United States—should declare that the two countries must honor the commitments they made in Vienna in May 2016 to restart a peace process after the last round of conflict—and pay a price if they don’t.

Second, they should begin active discussions of what a peacekeeping operation would look like—a crucial issue that has been neglected since the 1990s.

Third, everyone needs reminding that Armenians and Azerbaijanis are not eternal enemies. They live side by side peacefully in Georgia and have been friendly neighbors for long periods of history. Outsiders can promote a sorely missed “third narrative” that sets out a vision of how the two peoples have lived together in peace and will ultimately benefit by doing so again.

Alexander Iskandaryan Director of the Caucasus Institute

At the time of writing, active warfare is taking place on what was just a few days ago known as the contact line and should now be called the frontline.

Events are unfolding in the logic of war. Azerbaijan has chosen the ideal timing for its offensive. The United States is rocked by the campaign ahead of the presidential election in November, Europe is getting over Brexit and facing a general crisis of public administration, and Russia is dealing with the crisis in Belarus.

Worldwide, political elites are focusing their efforts on reacting to the coronavirus pandemic. The South Caucasus is not a priority for the international community. Therefore, there is no reason to expect external intervention.

International actors will certainly use political leverage in the form of statements, calls, and appeals for peace, which will be absolutely insufficient. Accordingly, unless the fighting evolves into a trench war, it will only desist following the logic of war, not politics or peace. Once this happens, negotiations will be resumed, but it will no longer be possible to restore the configuration that existed the week before violence erupted.

Whether or not the OSCE Minsk Group format survives this, the situation in the conflict will be further from a peace settlement than ever before. This does not mean that a peaceful settlement will be ruled out; no conflict lasts forever. However, we will need to create a new peace agenda burdened with two wars instead of one.

John C. Kornblum Senior Counsellor Noerr LLP

The most important thing to remember about the Nagorny Karabakh conflict is that it is above all one of Russia’s frozen conflicts, intended to keep the countries and the region and thus also the West off balance.

Rather than being a mediator, Russia often fans the flames of the dispute. It is undoubtedly no accident that violence has returned just as Russian President Vladimir Putin is burdened by troubles at home and at a point when his relations with the West are at an all-time low. He is sending the West a message. Work with me or I can put this place in flames.

I first joined the search for a “diplomatic solution” of the Nagorny Karabakh crisis during the summit conference of what was then the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in Helsinki in 1992. Twenty-five years of endless diplomatic efforts have been unsuccessful. The tragedy will continue until Russia is convinced that peace in Nagorny Karabakh, Georgia, Ukraine, and elsewhere is more in its interest than is the fomenting of crisis among its neighbors.

The stakes for Europe are especially high. The Caucasus are the front line of European democracy. If they fall to Russian domination, Europe’s democratic vision will be damaged severely.

Gerard Libaridian Former Alex Manoogian Chair in Modern Armenian History at the University of Michigan

Peace is possible, but it is now less likely to result from negotiations between the sides. More than ever, the sides have been locked in a logic that justifies war for each.

Turkey’s direct participation in this round has further complicated an already difficult conflict. For Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Turkey, the conflict now is a matter of honor, national identity, and legitimation of power. For Nagorny Karabakh, it is also an existential one.

The indiscriminate shelling by Azerbaijan of civilian targets in Karabakh has cemented the sense Karabakh Armenians have that they could not possibly be safe under Azerbaijani jurisdiction.

Neither side revised its position on a resolution following the two more recent rounds of fighting in April 2016 and July 2020. The 2018 Dushanbe agreement between Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev on the consolidation of the ceasefire was the last hope for a reset. Instead, it became the source of a deeper—and now fatal—mutual mistrust, because the sides had conflicting expectations of what was to follow.

Russia and Turkey will use this or the next round of fighting—if there is one—to impose a peace that will be at the expense of Armenians, as has been the case in history.

Eldar Mamedov Foreign Policy Adviser to the Progressive Alliance of Socialists & Democrats (S&D) in the European Parliament

At this stage, sustainable peace is not possible. The two sides have radically incompatible notions of what a peace would entail. For Armenians, it means a status for Nagorny Karabakh that excludes any relationship based on subordination to Baku. For Azerbaijan, nothing less than the return of the region to Baku’s effective control would do.

Nor can both sides agree on the process leading to any kind of solution. Azerbaijan insists on a phased settlement, involving a return of its occupied territories first. Armenia wants guarantees of independent status for Nagorny Karabakh before it engages in any substantive concessions.

So, the only peace that is feasible now would be in a narrow sense of ceasefire, and then only imposed by external actors. They should foresee—possibly via a UN Security Council resolution—the deployment of a robust ceasefire-monitoring mechanism with targeted sanctions against any party violating it and an immediate resumption of negotiations.

It is also urgent to prevent this local territorial conflict from metastasizing into an ethnic conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis worldwide. The joint call for restraint launched by Armenians and Azerbaijanis in the diaspora after July’s clashes could serve as the basis for such efforts.

This analysis reflects the personal views of the author and not necessarily the opinions of the S&D or the European Parliament.

Stefan Meister Head of the Heinrich Boell Foundation Tbilisi Office

The latest escalation in the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan shows how dangerous this conflict at the margins of Europe is.

Armenia and Azerbaijan belong to the most armed countries in the world, always ready for war. This is no frozen conflict but a powder keg, more or less ignored by the international community.

Yes, Russia and Turkey play a key role in this conflict. Russia is the “honest bargainer” who has troops on the ground in Armenia and sells weapons to both sides to keep the balance. Turkey is increasingly willing to support Azerbaijan, which changes this balance of power.

However, it is first of all a conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, where both societies have been socialized with the enemy narrative of the other and the constant threat of a war. Nation-building in both countries after the fall of the Soviet Union was focused on the external enemy.

Yes, peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan is possible, when the political elites stop instrumentalizing the conflict and when an honest discussion starts in both countries about the roots of the war. Only changing the domestic discourse in both countries can bring peace.

Emin Milli Analyst and Human Rights Activist

The Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict has evolved during the last thirty years. Azerbaijan has become much stronger as a state, built up its army, but also improved and deepened its relationship with both Turkey and Russia.

From the Azerbaijani perspective, Armenia has occupied territories that are internationally recognized as Azerbaijan’s, including Karabakh and seven regions around it. Armenia has also ignored—for almost thirty years—the UN resolutions demanding the withdrawal of Armenian armed forces from occupied territories.

Armenia and some mediators repeat that “there is no military solution” to this conflict, but the current status quo is the result of the Armenian aggression and its “military solution.”

Thirty years of negotiations and attempts to convince Armenia to compromise and return occupied territories peacefully, in order to avoid another war and negotiate the future status of Karabakh, have failed. Today, Armenia as a state is weaker, and its relationship with Russia has been severely damaged by Pashinyan and the new government.

The fastest and most realistic possibility for Armenia to start new peace talks is to show goodwill and return several occupied territories.

Marc Pierini Visiting Scholar at Carnegie Europe

Peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan is necessary, but getting there will be a long and difficult enterprise. Not only is the territorial litigation old and complex, but nowadays the political and diplomatic situation of neighboring countries is creating additional hurdles.

Russia has a strong military relationship with Armenia but also provides weapons to Azerbaijan. However, it has the power to make the two sides stop fighting each other. Will Moscow see an advantage in playing the peacemaker? Its complex relationship with Ankara will be an important factor when making a decision.

Turkey has expectedly taken sides with Azerbaijan but—more importantly—is providing it with armed drones and—allegedly—with Syrian jihadists from the Idlib province. Turkey is the only country to have taken a confrontational attitude in the current hostilities between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

The conflict is a challenge for the OSCE Minsk Group, a largely ineffective forum in recent years. But ultimately, whether under the aegis of the OSCE or the UN, peace will have to be achieved in a multilateral framework and a peacekeeping force will have to be deployed.

This is now a challenge for both Russia and Turkey.

Paul Stronski Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace

The resumption of deadly fighting between ethnic Armenian and Azerbaijani forces over Nagorny Karabakh could not come at a more inopportune time.

The fighting, which could easily surpass the devastation of the 2016 Four-Day War, shows few signs of letting up and exacerbates human insecurity—already threatened by the pandemic—in the region.

The geopolitical landscape of the South Caucasus is changing too with a far more aggressive Turkey and an increasingly distracted West. Russia too seems to be struggling in its response and is having difficulty getting the sides to stand down, as it has succeeded with in past flare-ups.

NATO ally Turkey’s growing involvement, possibly with U.S. equipment and certainly with U.S. training, certainly brings greater responsibility on the United States to work toward a ceasefire.

Washington could normally try to use its leverage over Baku, Yerevan, and Ankara to do just that. But the United States appears absent in this latest crisis. This is no surprise, given the dysfunctional foreign policy of the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the United States’ gradual withdrawal from the region over the past decade.

But with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Putin—among others—all trying to conduct telephone diplomacy with the parties, the lack of senior U.S. diplomatic engagement beyond bland or outright bizarre statements is striking. And particularly for an administration eager to show some foreign policy bona fides before the election in November.

Yet with the U.S. Congress and U.S. presidential nominee Joe Biden all calling for a more robust U.S. response, polarized American politics also might be contributing to the administration’s sluggish response.

Dmitri Trenin Director of the Carnegie Moscow Center

The question that has preoccupied me since Sunday, September 27, is different. It’s this: Is war possible between Russia and Turkey?

This unavoidably leads to a follow-up question: Should Turkey attack Armenia, and should Russia choose to defend Armenia, its Collective Security Treaty Organization ally, will this activate the North Atlantic Treaty?

It in turn reminds me of a warning issued to Ankara in the fall of 1991 by the last Soviet minister of defense, Yevgeny Shaposhnikov: if you intervene in Karabakh, you’ll provoke World War III. My conviction today is that this fateful step will be avoided, and Russia and Turkey will avoid a direct military collision, possibly to the regret of some third parties.

With regard the peace question, the answer is: not in the foreseeable future. Complete military victory by Azerbaijan, the stronger party, is impossible without Turkey’s massive intervention. Armenia cannot make Azerbaijan accept the status quo forever—and certainly not without large-scale and direct Russian support. Turkey and Russia, however, are reluctant to fight each other, and Russia also values its generally friendly relations with Azerbaijan.

While war promises victory to neither side and peace remains elusive, ceasefire and its periodic violations look like the future. Or the past.

Sinan Ülgen Visiting Scholar at Carnegie Europe

In principle, yes. But for more than thirty years, this frozen conflict has demonstrated the ineffectiveness of multilateral diplomacy. Since Armenia invaded a land that belongs to Azerbaijan in and around Karabakh thirty years ago, the territory remains to this day under occupation despite UN Security Council decisions.

The international community has so far stood up to attempts by nation states to acquire territory by force. That was the case against the Iraq of Saddam Hussein. That is also the rationale for the EU and U.S. sanctions against Russia. Yet the same degree of willingness and perseverance is conspicuously absent in the case of Nagorny Karabakh.

Instead, the international community relied on the mechanism of the Minsk Group to steer the parties toward a settlement with very little progress to show for. The Minsk Group has in essence become a parody of international diplomacy. If a peaceful settlement is to emerge, the international community should be more serious in enforcing the terms of the UN Security Council decisions and seek to achieve an end to this occupation.

At the same time, the terms of settlement should include strong guarantees for the Armenians of Karabakh that their fundamental rights will be protected by Baku. These two objectives should hitherto guide conflict settlement efforts.","Both Armenia and Azerbaijan should understand that neither long-term peace nor consistent democratization is possible without independence from Russia.
Armenia points to grave and persisting insecurity and an existential threat to the Armenian population of Nagorny Karabakh.
This body has been charged since 1992 with helping bring about a peaceful resolution of the Nagorny Karabakh dispute.
There is no military solution to the Nagorny Karabakh conflict.

119,https://www.thesierraleonetelegraph.com/africa-needs-greater-inclusion-of-women-in-peace-and-security-processes/,"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Sierra Leone Telegraph,Africa needs greater inclusion of women in peace and security processes,"Sierra Leone Telegraph: 27 October 2020:

The African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) and the UN Office of the Special Adviser on Africa (OSAA) have called for greater inclusion of women in peace and security processes if Africa is to meet its development aspirations and enjoy meaningful stability.

To mark the 20th anniversary of the UN Security Council Resolution 1325, OSAA and the APRM, are advocating for the full implementation of UNSCR 1325 in Africa, with women’s full, equal and meaningful participation in sustainable development goals (SDGs) planning and domestication at the local, national and regional levels through the effective monitoring and evaluation of SDG 16 within the Decade of Action to deliver the SDGs (2020-2030).

The heads of the two entities, Ms. Cristina Duarte from OSAA and Prof. Eddy Maloka from the APRM, acknowledged progress made towards women’s inclusion to date, but emphasized that more still needs to be done. UNSCR 1325 was adopted in October 2000 and exclusively recognizes women’s right to have a leading role in achieving international peace and security.

Among the milestones achieved by African countries in the last 20 years, women’s representation in national parliaments has increased, especially with the African Union (AU) 50:50 parity campaign and the AU gender policy in 2010. Rwanda has exceeded this target, with 64% of parliamentary seats occupied by women, followed by the Seychelles, Senegal, South Africa and Namibia (from 40-44%).

However, the share of parliamentary seats at the regional average remains low at only 22.4% for women and 77.6% for men, with a slightly lower average for ministerial positions occupied by women.

With the COVID-19 pandemic, governance, gender, peace and development have become more interlinked than ever before. The pandemic has scaled back gains, with women and girls being disproportionately affected by its socio-economic impact.

A recent report by the APRM Secretariat on Africa’s response to COVID-19, sets women’s inclusivity in governance, and the fight against gender-based violence (GBV), as some of the urgent prerequisites to curb the pandemic. Further, providing skills, resources and funds for women, especially in fragile and conflict areas, is likely to help avoid further human catastrophes and accelerate recovery and building back better.

“One of the significant lessons learned from the novel coronavirus is that societies led by women in leadership display a sense of transparency and accountability, essential to mitigate disasters,” Ms. Duarte said, while commending the leadership of the 13 African female health ministers who are leading the continent’s efforts to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic at national level.

Despite the notable achievements by African women, their contribution to the four pillars of UNSCR 1325, namely conflict prevention, peacekeeping, conflict resolution, and peacebuilding, still needs to be strengthened.

For instance, in 16 African peace mediation processes between 1992 to 2011, only two had 5% female signatories, and only three of 16 processes had female led mediators, according to the AU Special Envoy on women, peace, and security.

In addition, African countries are lagging behind in developing or adapting National Action Plans (NAPs) on UNSCR 1325. The APRM study on “Governance, Gender and Peacebuilding” reveals that in some African regions, only a quarter of countries have NAPs on UNSCR 1325.

“The conflicts in Africa necessitate women’s involvement in the mentioned four pillars, especially conflict prevention. Strengthening the role of women is crucial for the delivery of the SDGs, in line with the goals and aspirations of Agenda 2063 and 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,” Prof. Maloka said.

Although the state-based conflicts slightly declined, the rise of non-state armed conflicts during the last decade imposes severe implications for the African regional security. By 2018, Africa had 14 of the top 20 most fragile states worldwide. Adding to poverty, inequality, and social challenges in many African countries, mobilising youth – including females – to extremist and terrorist groups became a phenomenal trend.

APRM and OSAA applauded UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’s Appeal for a Global Ceasefire and implored AU, UN organs and related bodies to assist African countries with necessary funds to raise women’s skills, resources, and infrastructure in fragile and conflict states in Africa. This is in line with OSAA’s mandate on global advocacy on Africa’s strategic priorities.

The two entities urged AU Members States, Civil Society Organizations, the private sector, academia and multilateral organisations to strengthen their collaboration towards fostering the adoption of gender-governance standards; Strengthening capacity and women’s resilience; Disseminating best practices, and Monitoring implementation of governance targets through the effective implementation of SDG 5 and SDG 16.

2020 is historical as it commemorates the 75th Anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations, and the 20th anniversary of UNSCR 1325. It is also the African Union’s year of Silencing the Guns, the year of maturity for the African Women Decade (2010-2020) and the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Platform for Action (Beijing 25+).

Therefore, 2020 is, without a doubt, a year for the celebration of women and peace. This year gives prominence to key instruments and SDGs entailing goals such as: SDG 5 on Gender Equality, SDG 16 on peace, justice, and strong institutions. SDG 16 meets Aspirations three and four of Agenda 2063, which aim to promote “good governance and the rule of law in Africa” and achieve “A Peaceful and Secure Africa”. In the same manner, it is worth noting that the Aspiration 6 of Agenda 2063 calls for “An Africa Whose Development is people-driven, relying on the potential offered by African People, especially its Women and Youth, and caring for Children.”

Over the past two decades, African Women achieved various milestones of empowerment at political and economic levels. These achievements are alluded to by the African Union Constitutive Act (2000), the Maputo Protocol (2003), and the Kampala Protocol (2009). The framework also comprises of The Solemn Declaration on Gender Equality in Africa (SDGEA) (2004), which led to the appointment of Women Special Envoys and The Declaration on Democracy, Political, Economic and Corporate Governance (2002). The latter established the APRM as a tool for peer-review and sharing best experiences to promote good governance among AU countries.

As an early warning tool, the APRM as Africa’s home-grown organisation for promoting good governance was designated at the 30th Ordinary Session of the AU Assembly held in January 2018, in Addis Ababa. In March 2020, inspired by the AU theme of Silencing the Guns, the 914th meeting of the Peace and Security Council reiterated the role of the APRM towards the Peace and Security Agenda.

The APRM coordinates with the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) and the Africa Governance Architecture (AGA) towards promoting the Governance, Peace and Security Agenda while encouraging a greater women’s participation in the process.

It is a paradox that precisely at a time when the salience of cross-national and global challenges has significantly increased, nation states are less willing to cooperate and collaborate in tackling them. COVID-19 recognises no national or regional boundaries as it rages across the world. One would have expected that countries, particularly those with technological and financial capabilities, would agree to pool their resources together to work on an effective and affordable anti-virus vaccine. Instead, there are several parallel national efforts under way even as the World Health Organization (WHO) has put together a Covax alliance for the same purpose. There is a competitive compulsion at work which may be appropriate in economic and commercial domains. When the lives of people are at stake, active collaboration would have enhanced our collective ability to overcome what has become a public health-cum-economic crisis. But we live in an era when nationalist urges, fuelled by a political opportunism, diminish the appeal of international cooperation. As pointed out by Nicholas Eberstadt of The National Bureau of Asian Research, “The post pandemic world will have no choice but to contend at last with a problem long in the making: the awful dilemma of global integration without solidarity.”

Comment | UN and the retreat from multilateralism

Looming food crisis

This year’s Nobel Peace Prize to the World Food Programme (WFP) is a recognition of its role in combating hunger and malnutrition across the developing world. But the WFP’s achievement are modest, not because it is an inefficient institution, but because it is perennially under-funded. But more important is the message which this award is sending to the world — that we need multilateralism as an expression of international solidarity. It is also a warning that the novel coronavirus pandemic is reversing the substantial gains made in the fight against poverty.

According to the WFP, 132 million more people could become malnourished as a consequence of the pandemic. To the 690 million people who go to bed each night on an empty stomach, perhaps another 100 million or more will be added. This counts for a major world-wide catastrophe and unless the conscience of the world is aroused, we will be condemning vast pools of humanity to living in wretchedness and deprivation. The Nobel Prize to the WFP will hopefully nudge our collective conscience to come together and relieve this looming humanitarian crisis.

The UN at 75 is still important

The United Nations is at the centre of multilateral institutions and processes. It is celebrating the 75th anniversary of its founding. While it is a pale shadow of the vision with which it was invested at its founding, nevertheless it has kept alive the notion of international solidarity and cooperation. If it has become increasingly marginal in mobilising international responses to global challenges, the fault lies with its most powerful member countries. They have deprived the UN of resources. They have resisted efforts to institute long overdue reforms; 75 years on, its structure no longer reflects the changes in power equations that have taken place. It is anachronistic that a country such as India continues to be denied permanent membership of the Security Council. And yet despite these disabilities ,the UN is now an essential part of the fabric of international relations; its role has become even more important precisely because the salience of global issues has expanded and the need for multilateral approaches in finding solutions has greatly increased.

India has been a consistent advocate of multilateralism and Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently said: “India firmly believes that the path to achieve sustainable peace and prosperity is through multilateralism. As children of Planet Earth we must join hands to address our common challenges and achieve our common goals.”

Institutions and problems

There is a network of multilateral institutions, several as part of the UN system. Others are inter-governmental in nature; still others may be non-governmental of a hybrid character. This is a network which enables governance in areas which require coordination among nation states and set norms to regulate the behaviour of states so as to avoid conflict and to ensure both equitable burden sharing and, equally, a fair distribution of benefits. This network continues to function and deliver benefits to participating states despite the less than propitious international environment. However, going forward, there are more complex challenges which would require a different mind-set and patterns of behaviour.

While there are multilateral institutions they have become platforms for contestations among their member states. There is recognition of the need to cooperate but this is seen as compulsion rather than desirable. When participating in multilateral negotiations, whether at the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva, or later at multilateral negotiations on climate change in the run-up to the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference in 2009, my brief would be the same as other country representatives — concede as little as possible, and extract as much as you can. If all delegations work on the same brief, is it any wonder that even a supposedly “successful” outcome is invariably the least common denominator? This may be appropriate when dealing with trade or security matters but not in tackling global challenges such as climate change or the current pandemic.

Comment | A revival of multilateralism, steered by India

Globalisation here to stay

Given the scale, urgency and seriousness of the challenges we confront, we need maximal, not minimal, responses. The dynamics of negotiations and their outcomes would dramatically change if delegations came with a brief to contribute as much as possible within the limitation of resources and demand the minimum in terms of assessed needs. This is the international solidarity which a globalised world requires to handle the dense interconnections that bind us.

Globalisation may have stalled, but as we become increasingly digitised, there will be more, not less, globalisation. The pandemic has triggered galloping globalisation in the digital economy . Globalisation is driven by technology and as long as technology remains the key driver of economic growth, there is no escape from globalisation.

Comment | Multilateralism post COVID-19

Don’t we need to first focus on getting our domestic imperatives right and then think of international cooperation? In the contemporary world, the line separating the domestic from the external has become increasingly blurred. In tackling domestic challenges deeper external engagement is often indispensable. This is certainly true of climate change. Even if India’s carbon emissions became zero tomorrow, climate change would continue to affect us if others do not also reduce their emissions. The pandemic originated in a third country, but soon raged across national borders. If there had been a robust and truly global early warning system, perhaps it could have been contained.

The thread in challenges

When one speaks of the rising salience of cross-national issues we must also take into account the inter-connectedness among various challenges. For example, food, energy and water security are inter-linked with strong feedback loops . Enhancing food security may lead to diminished water and energy security. It may also have collateral impact on health security. Raising crop yields with current agricultural strategies means higher incremental use of chemical fertilizers and toxic pesticides. India’s unprotected farmers are exposed to serious health risks as a result and often get bankrupted not due to crop failure but debilitating health costs. It is in recognition of these inter-connections that the international community agreed on a set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are cross-domain but also cross-national in character, and hence demand greater multilateral cooperation in order to succeed.

Comment | Resuscitating multilateralism with India’s help

Finally, this also points to the need for a more democratic world order since lack of cooperation from even a single state may frustrate success in tackling a global challenge. A fresh pandemic may erupt in any remote corner of the world and spread throughout the globe. Prevention cannot be achieved through coercion, only through cooperation. It is only multilateralism that makes this possible.

Some are already saying the election has been rigged, while several opposition leaders are calling for their supporters to demonstrate and demand justice through peaceful means.

Do we really need to go onto the streets if election results are announced without being counted properly? I don't think so.

Instead, the political class should channel its energies to focus on a more pressing issue. The current law does not allow presidential results announced by the National Electoral Commission to be contested in court. Now more than ever it's time for political parties, civil society organizations and human rights activists to push for a constitutional amendment to remove this outdated legislation.

Tanzanians should remember they have a big responsibility and a long way to go as a nation after the election to protect peace at any cost. So the results should not be a cause of hostility and violence. Elections come and go, and at the end of the day there is only one winner, either from the ruling party or the opposition.

Tanzania must look forward

DW's Grace Kabogo

The outcome of the election must not divide Tanzanians, but help to unite them to build the nation for the coming five years. Now is the time to assess the shortcomings of the last elections and come up with a blueprint to correct them, hence allowing better preparation for the election in 2025.

The new government needs to focus on and implement development projects in all areas without any discrimination — regardless of which side people voted for. And it must create an environment in which all political parties feel secure and protected to carry out their work.

State institutions should also resist any tendencies to play party politics and instead provide equal opportunities for all political parties and safeguard people's freedom to engage in political activities, without fear for reprisal.

A new electoral commission needed more than ever

The people of Tanzania have demonstrated their quest for democracy and the government would do well to heed their demand for the establishment of an Independent Electoral Commission which is capable of overseeing a free and fair election.

Tanzania's development requires peace and stability, values built on the principles of harmony, solidarity and reconciliation.

As the country's first president, Mwalimu Julius Kambarage Nyerere, once said, ''Democracy is not a bottle of Coca-Cola which can be imported, democracy is a process which is developed according to particular situations of any country.''

All citizens must realize that they have a responsibility to maintain and protect the peace that their country has enjoyed since it gained independence in 1961.

The election is not only about who wins. It's also about what comes next, and what it means to the people. So will the new government aim to repair its image? Is it prepared to give its diplomacy a facelift and revive democracy? What it does about these issues will provide a glimpse of where Tanzania is headed over the next five years.","Do we really need to go onto the streets if election results are announced without being counted properly?

It marks a new milestone of the anti-Junta struggle after about three months of protests and civil disobedience movement since the military takeover on 1 February 2021. It is considered a parallel civilian-led government against the military-led State Administration Council (SAC).It has come into being when the country has been facing its worst crisis ever, along with the complex political dynamics. As we see claims and counterclaims from NUG and the military regime, it is worthwhile to understand the role and challenges of the NUG.

Formation of the Government

The opponents of Myanmar’s junta formally announced the establishment of a National Unity Government (NUG) on 16 April, 2021.It came in the wake of mounting brutality and murders of protesting civilians by the ruthless military regime. The NUG includes a president, state counsellor, vice president, prime minister and 11 ministers for 12 ministries. There are also 12 deputy ministers appointed by the CRPH. Of the 26 total cabinet members, 13 belong to ethnic nationalities, and eight are women. In the new government, Mahn Win Khaing Than, an ethnic Karen and former House Speaker under the NLD government, is the country’s prime minister, while President U Win Myint and State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi retain their positions. The vice president is Duwa Lashi La, the president of the Kachin National Consultative Assembly.

It has unveiled a 20-page Federal Democracy Charter, which is based on an interim constitution drafted between 1990 and 2008 by NLD lawmakers elected in 1990 and ethnic armed forces in Myanmar’s border areas. The goal of the NUG is to establish an alternative government – a sort of internal government-in-exile – that can compete with the junta for international recognition and spearhead what is likely to be a long campaign to defeat it. The NUG is aimed at uniting anti-coup groups, ethnic armed organizations, and other opponents of the junta. It has pledged the “eradication of dictatorship” and the creation of an inclusive federal democracy “where all citizens can live peacefully”.

Reckoning the Role of the NUG

Roadmap for a Democratic Government

The Federal Democracy Charter provides a roadmap for a democratic government of Myanmar abolishing the current constitution. It includes plans to establish a national convention to draft a new constitution. Diversity and consensus mark the formation of the NUG, which addresses the multi-ethnic and multi-national nature of the state of Myanmar. The NUG hopes that it will bring all ethnic nationalities on board as it represents the great diversity and strength of this great nation of Myanmar. The new government aims at maintaining inclusiveness in the governance system aligning all ethnic groups. Calling it “the peoples’ government” veteran democracy activist Min Ko Naing emphasized the unity between the pro-democracy movement and autonomy-seeking ethnic minority groups. The understanding between and among the democratic forces as well as ethnic groups and Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) organizers may facilitate peace and unity in Myanmar.

Pressure on the Military Regime

The formation of NUG will exert a major political pressure on the post-coup military regime. The two-part charter of NUG lays out a plan to “weaken the governance mechanisms” of the military regime by discrediting the Tatmadaw, support the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM), and make arrangements for “national defence” by forming a federal army. Representatives of the NUG state that there will be “no compromise” between their Government and the military regime unless the group’s demands are met. These demands include: restoring the country’s democratically elected leaders and parliamentarians from the November election, ending to violence against civilians, removing soldiers from the streets, and releasing political prisoners. Meanwhile, many argue that Myanmar is on the verge of spiralling into a failed state and stands on the brink of civil war at an unprecedented scale.

Managing Support of the Ethnic Groups

The formation of NUG offers new hope for Myanmar to increase interactions with diverse ethnic and religious groups. The 10 ethnic armed organizations’ Peace Process Steering Team (PPST) has given its unwavering support to Myanmar’s striking civil servants and the ousted government’s Federal Democracy Charter. Some ethnic communities have already termed it as Myanmar’s “spring revolution” and pledged to join the fight against the junta if it doesn’t stop the killing immediately or meet calls to restore democracy. Analysts say that plans to unite ethnic groups with the majority ethnic Burman people will take time, but that the signs of cohesion are slowly forming, including National Unity Government in accordance with the will and demand of ethnic political parties, ethnic armed resistance organizations, and mass protest movements. Notably, the inclusivity and diversity of the nature of the formation of the shadow government is likely to forge consensus building it halting the outrage of the military.

Marshaling Regional and Global Support

Garnering regional and global support is the prime motivation behind the NUG. The NUG has already called on Southeast Asian countries to boost their engagement and support for the body. According to the NUG representatives, some nations, including some Western countries and a member country of the Arab World that experienced the Arab Spring, are already intending to formally recognize the NUG as the country’s legitimate government. The joint statement of the G7 Foreign and Development Ministers’ Meeting held in London on 5 May 2021 welcomed the creation of the NUG. The Special Advisory Council for Myanmar, a group of international experts including former United Nations officials, hailed the creation of the NUG as historic and said it was the legitimate government. Many other international groups have called for the NUG’s legitimacy to be recognized. The International Trade Union Confederation recognizes its legitimacy. Two international rights organizations – Fortify Rights and Rohingya Organisation U.K. (BROUK) urged southeast Asian leaders to work with the newly formed anti-coup unity government in Myanmar to restore democracy, putting an end to the illegal military takeover.

ASEAN has a unique role in resolving the Myanmar crisis. Global actors – both states and civil society – strongly argue that ASEAN should work with the newly formed NUG in Myanmar and the broader international community to end the Myanmar military junta’s attacks and ensure a transition to democratic, civilian rule. After filing the case against General Min Aung Hlainga head of the junta leader’s arrival in Jakarta to attend an ASEAN summit, the shadow government has asked the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) to arrest the coup leader. A letter to Interpol said Min Aung Hlaing was a criminal and terrorist for his crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing in Rakhine State and must be tried at both international courts.

Challenges Ahead

Few challenges need to be considered in assessing the future of the NUG. While the shadow government has expectations for expanding support among socio-ethnic and religious groups, more violence may dampen hopes for national reconciliation, as the military junta regime has not retreated from its brutal and repressive moves. The announcement of a new unity government is likely to push Myanmar into a dangerous new phase of its crisis with urban upheaval, a collapsing economy. Internationally, the formation of the NUG will confront foreign governments with the difficult choice of whether to recognize and throw the full force of their support behind the alternative government. Recently, the expelling of the Myanmar Ambassador in London for his support to Suu Kyi created a difficult situation for the U.K. government. The invitation of general Min Aung Hlaing in the ASEAN’s special summit in Jakarta was also a critical choice for ASEAN states to decide whether they would recognize NUG or Tatmadaw.

The move is likely to harden the country’s battle lines since the military coup. The junta has killed 739 people and made 3,370 arrests. There are statements and counter statements between NUG and the junta regime over the formation of unity government. In an apparent response to the NUG’s letter to Interpol accusing general Hlaing, the regime announced that all 24 NUG ministers and two associates have been charged with high treason. It has also declared the NUG an unlawful association. The‘non-interference’ principle of ASEAN, which prohibits involvement in the ‘internal affairs’ of member states, has been violated in the recent move by the ASEAN. It has bolstered the Aung Hlaing government. By inviting Min Aung Hlaing and not NUG representatives to the ASEAN Special Summit, the organization has chosen to intervene and recognize the military regime. This situation has created contradictions and a lack of consensus among the parties who formed the NUG. Diverse comments and different positions of the groups concerned have caused a shadowy situation. For instance, the NUG initially did welcome the five-point consensus on the Myanmar crisis during the ASEAN summit. Contrarily, the protesters have rejected the five-point consensus as it has not mentioned political prisoners and vowed to continue their protest campaign. Later on, the NUG declared that they would not negotiate with the military regime against the people’s will, despite calls from the ASEAN for talks. The NUG rejected a joint junta-ASEAN statement which said, ‘all parties shall exercise utmost restraint’.

In conclusion, the very formation of NUG with its projection of establishing a federal democracy is likely to open opportunities for giving a direction to the ongoing protest movement and creating greater understanding among socio-ethnic groups who have long been cherishing autonomy and ending the cycle of military authoritarianism in essence. If the NUG can build consensus and accelerate trust among the stakeholders of the forces of democracy, there is a prospect for success in the coming days for the transition. The key to victory for the NUG will be to keep civil disobedience going in the face of repression and an economic collapse that has already started and gain support and recognition from the domestic and international arena. Most importantly, the role of the international community is critical. Regionally, ASEAN’s role is vital, but so far, it has not demonstrated any credible action, including the special summit decisions. The NUG remains a fragile unity in a country of the almost permanent reign of the military that makes its mission ever challenging.","As we see claims and counterclaims from NUG and the military regime, it is worthwhile to understand the role and challenges of the NUG.

Fredrik S. Heffermehl, a Norwegian lawyer and long-time critic of the political and bureaucratic processes behind the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize, for instance, stated: “We recognise the great value of the World Food Programme, but the 2020 prize is much less ambitious than [Alfred] Nobel’s idea of ‘conferring the greatest benefit to humankind’.”

Mukesh Kapila, a former United Nations representative to the Sudan who blew the whistle on atrocities committed by the Sudanese government in Darfur, and who is now a professor of global health and humanitarian affairs at the University of Manchester, was even more scathing. “It’s a bizarre choice, and it’s a complete waste of the prize, in my opinion,” he told Devex. “I don’t think the World Food Programme needs this money, and I really object to awarding prizes to people or organisations who are just doing their paid jobs.”

Apart from the fact that WFP’s raison d’être is to deliver food to vulnerable populations, and its staff are paid generously to deliver food aid, critics who know the food aid business have in the past pointed out that food aid is, in fact, detrimental in the long run because it suppresses local food production, making it harder for poor or conflict-ridden countries to feed themselves. In fact, studies have found that direct cash transfers are a much more efficient and effective method to alleviate hardship and improve the overall welfare of beneficiary communities.

A few years ago, none other than the European Union (EU)’s representative to Somalia, Georges-Marc André (now retired), admitted this to me when I was researching for my book War Crimes, which explores how foreign aid has negatively affected Somalia. He told me that United Nations agencies such as WFP might have actually “slowed down” Somalia’s recovery by focusing exclusively on food aid instead of supporting local farmers and markets. “The EU is against food aid that substitutes local food production,” he said.

His views are also shared by Michael Maren, a former food aid monitor for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in Somalia, whose book, The Road to Hell: The Ravaging Effects of Foreign Aid and International Charity, chronicles how aid became a political tool in Somalia that was manipulated by both the donors and the recipient country. Maren, who lived and worked in Somalia in the 1980s, believes that food aid to Somalia may have actually prolonged the civil war in the country. “I had learned to view development aid with skepticism, a skill I had hoped to put to good use to help ensure that aid projects, at worst, didn’t hurt people. But Somalia added a whole new dimension to my view of the aid business. My experience there made me see that aid could be worse than incompetent and inadvertently destructive. It could be positively evil,” he wrote.

In his book, Maren quotes a former civil servant working for Somalia’s National Refugee Commission during President Siad Barre’s regime who told him that traditionally, Somalis never relied on food aid, even during droughts. There was a credit system; pastoralists would come to urban areas where they would take out loans that they would repay when things returned to normal. Aid essentially destroyed a centuries-old system that built resilience and sustained communities during periods of hardship.

Food aid hurts local farmers

Food aid also suppresses local food production. Many Somali farmers have reported that NGOs working with WFP are notorious for bringing in food aid just before the harvest, which brings down the price of local food. They have also complained that the food aid is imported, rather than bought locally. At the height of the famine in Somalia in 2011 (which many believe was exaggerated by the UN), for example, WFP bought food worth £50 million from Glencore, a London-listed commodities trader, despite a pledge by the UN’s food agency that it would buy food from “very poor farmers who suffer because they are not connected to local markets”.

Let us be clear about one thing – food aid is big business and extremely beneficial to those donating it. (“Somebody always gets rich off a famine”, Maren told Might Magazine in 1997.) Under current United States law, for instance, almost all US food aid (worth billions of dollars) must be purchased in the US and at least half of it must be transported on US-flagged vessels.

Aid essentially destroyed a centuries-old system that built resilience and sustained communities during periods of hardship.

Most of this food aid is actually surplus food that Americans can’t consume domestically. Under the US government’s Food for Peace programme (formerly known as Public Law 480), the US government is allowed to sell or donate US food surpluses in order to alleviate hunger in other countries. Famines in other countries are, therefore, very profitable to the US government and to highly subsidised American farmers, who benefit from federal government commodity price guarantees. (Interestingly, since 1992, all WFP Executive Directors have been US citizens. This could be because the US is the largest contributor to WFP, but it could also be that the Executive Director of the UN’s food agency is expected to promote US policies regarding food aid.)

In a 1988 paper titled “How American Food Aid Keeps the Third World Hungry”, Juliana Geran described Food for Peace as “the most harmful programs of aid to Third World countries”, and urged the US government to discontinue it. She noted that US food aid often distorts local markets and disrupts agricultural activity in recipient countries.

For example, massive dumping of wheat in India in the 1950s and ‘60s disrupted India’s agriculture. In 1982, Peru “begged” the US Department of Agriculture not to send any more rice to the country as it was feared that the rice would glut the local market and drive down food prices for farmers who were already struggling. “But the US rice lobby turned up the heat on Washington and the Peruvian government was told that it could either take the rice or receive no food at all,” wrote Geran.

But what happened in Guatemala was truly catastrophic, as Geran narrates: “In 1976, an earthquake hit Guatemala, killing 23,000 people and leaving over a million homeless. Just prior to the disaster, the country had harvested one of the largest wheat crops on record, and food was plentiful. As earthquake relief, the US rushed 27,000 metric tons of wheat to Guatemala. The US gift knocked the bottom out of the local grain markets and depressed food prices so much that it was harder for villagers to recover. The Guatemalan government ultimately barred the import of more basic grains.”

Stealing food to aid militias

One of the most evident distortions caused by food aid (apart from the fact that farmers have no incentive to grow food when the market is flooded with free food) is the temptation to steal it. There have been reports of blatant theft of food aid under the not-so-watchful eyes of WFP. UN monitors have routinely reported the theft of food aid to Somalia, for example, but to no avail. In its 2010 report, for instance, the UN Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea reported that local NGOs (known in development circles as “implementing partners”), WFP personnel and armed groups that controlled areas where food aid was being distributed were diverting up to half of the food. WFP vehemently denied these allegations, even though an Associated Press report the following year showed American, Japanese and Kuwaiti food aid being openly sold in Mogadishu’s markets.

It is also important to remember that WFP’s international staff usually do not distribute food directly in conflict or disaster zones; instead they hire local NGOs to do the work. Many of these NGOs are not vetted; in fact, in Somalia, some of them have even been linked to militias who act as “gatekeepers”, deciding who gets the aid and who doesn’t.

When Maren was in charge of monitoring food aid donated by the US government to refugees fleeing the Ogaden war of 1977-78, he found that about two-thirds of the food went missing. Trucks would arrive at the Mogadishu port, collect the food and disappear, never to be found again. Even when food arrived at the refugee camps, much of it would be stolen.

Aid thus became a profitable source of income for criminal elements within Somalia. And Siad Barre learned to exploit this well. In fact, Maren believes that international aid not only sustained the dictator’s regime but also facilitated the unravelling of Somali society.

The looting of aid continued even after Barre was ousted in 1991. Battles between warlords were won or lost depending on how much aid each warlord had access to. However, it was not just the warlords who profited from food aid; corrupt NGO cartels also benefitted. Because many parts of Somalia were considered a no-go-zone by international humanitarian agencies, and therefore rendered inaccessible, enterprising Somalis formed NGOs that liaised with these agencies to provide humanitarian assistance and services on the ground. These businesses-cum-NGOs signed lucrative contracts with aid agencies; some controlled entire sectors of the aid industry, from transport to distribution. Others were run by warlords, who often diverted food aid, which was then sold openly in markets to fund their militias.

“By engaging with the warlords to ensure the delivery of aid, the United Nations and other actors only encouraged the spread of the conflict and the establishment of a thriving aid-based and black market economy,” wrote political scientist Kate Seaman in Globalizing Somalia: Multilateral, International and Transactional Repercussions of Conflicts. “In essence they became a party to the conflict, losing their neutrality and only serving to perpetuate the conflict by providing resources which were then manipulated by the multitude of armed groups operating within Somalia.”

Battles between warlords were won or lost depending on how much aid each warlord had access to. However, it was not just the warlords who profited from food aid; corrupt NGO cartels also benefitted.

When an international humanitarian agency comes in to provide food to starving people, bad governments are let off the hook, and are allowed to continue with their bad policies that can lead to more famines in the future. Internationalising the responsibility of food security to UN institutions, international NGOs and foreign governments makes practically everyone across the globe a stakeholder in famine relief. “The process of internationalisation is the key to the appropriation of power by international institutions and the retreat from domestic accountability in famine-vulnerable countries,” wrote Alex de Waal in his book Famine Crimes: Politics and the Disaster Relief Industry in Africa.

Bad management practices at WFP

If the Norwegian Nobel Committee had bothered to find out how WFP staff view the organisation they work for, it might not have been so quick to award WFP the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize. Like at many UN agencies, senior staff at WFP have been accused of abusing their authority, an allegation that has tarnished this Rome-based agency’s reputation. A confidential internal WFP survey of staff attitudes (whose findings were first leaked to the Italian Insider, and then to other news organisations, such as Foreign Policy in October last year) found that 35 per cent of the more than 8,000 WFP employees surveyed reported experiencing or witnessing some form of abuse of authority, the most typical being the granting of “preferential treatment” for recruitment to close associates.

“The senior leadership of the World Food Program – once one of the most highly regarded United Nations agencies – have abused their authority, committed or enabled harassment, discriminated against women and ethnic minorities, and retaliated against those who spoke up in protest,” wrote Colum Lynch in Foreign Policy on 8 October 2019.

What was evident in the survey was that WFP, like the rest of the UN, is extremely hierarchical and authoritarian. Respondents admitted that senior managers “aimed to further their own self-interest rather than the mission of WFP, and abuse their power to further themselves and their favorites”.

Moreover, 29 per cent of those surveyed said they had witnessed some form of harassment, while 23 per cent said they had encountered discrimination. Some 12 per cent of staff said they had experienced some form of retaliation for speaking up about abusive practices (which is fairly common in the UN, where protection for whistleblowers is virtually non-existent, as I have illustrated here). An even more alarming finding was that 28 of the WFP employees interviewed had experienced “rape, attempted rape or other sexual assault” while working at the agency.

What was evident in the survey was that WFP, like the rest of the UN, is extremely hierarchical and authoritarian. Respondents admitted that senior managers “aimed to further their own self-interest rather than the mission of WFP, and abuse their power to further themselves and their favorites”.

The results of the WFP survey (which was conducted by an independent management consultancy) are consistent with other UN surveys on staff attitudes and experiences. Results from a UN Staff Union survey conducted in 2018 in response to the #MeToo movement showed that sexual harassment made up about 16 per cent of all forms of harassment at the UN; 44 per cent of those surveyed said that they had experienced abuse of authority and 20 per cent felt that they had experienced retaliation after reporting misconduct. The survey also found that a large number of staff members’ complaints were never investigated.

It is, therefore, difficult to understand why the Norwegian Nobel Committee found it fit to award WFP the Nobel Peace Prize, given that the UN’s food agency has failed to adhere to almost all best practices in human resources management, and has not done enough to protect those who report internal abuse or wrongdoing. Nor has WFP improved conditions for peace in conflict-affected countries or prevented the use of hunger as a weapon of war, as I have illustrated above.

What then could have motivated the Committee to award WFP the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize – apart from some misguided notion that what the world needs most right now is food hand-outs? In a world that is being ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic, increasing xenophobia, racism and sexism, a global recession and climate change (all of which threaten peace and security), couldn’t the Committee have picked a more worthy candidate?","“The EU is against food aid that substitutes local food production,” he said.
Food aid hurts local farmersFood aid also suppresses local food production.
Let us be clear about one thing – food aid is big business and extremely beneficial to those donating it.
Most of this food aid is actually surplus food that Americans can’t consume domestically.
Others were run by warlords, who often diverted food aid, which was then sold openly in markets to fund their militias."

By Dame Rosalind Marsden

Sudan is looking towards a brighter future after the initialling of the Juba peace agreement on August 31, an important first step towards bringing peace to the conflict zones and laying the foundation for democratic transition and economic reform throughout the country.

Although there is a long road ahead to achieve sustainable peace and formidable challenges remain, the hope is Sudan can turn the page on decades of war that has left hundreds of thousands dead and millions displaced, particularly in Darfur and the Two Areas (South Kordofan and Blue Nile).

The peace agreement, between Sudan’s transitional government and the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF), a broad alliance of armed and other movements, and Minni Minawi’s Sudan Liberation Movement, is not yet comprehensive as it did not include two other important armed movements.

Expected to be formally signed in early October, the deal has been hailed as a ‘historic achievement’ by the UN secretary-general, and the international community also commended the government of South Sudan for its positive role as mediator and urged hold-out groups to join the peace process. Much does depend on delivering on the agreement, and the experience of implementing past peace accords in Sudan has been dismal, particularly when it comes to bringing tangible benefits to people on the ground.

'This is not a paper agreement, but is a living organism that needs care, attention and political will from all of us' - PM Abdallah Hamdok

What potentially makes the Juba agreement different is that Sudan’s civilian-led transitional government aspires to deliver peace, justice and democracy in line with the goals of the revolution; that the agreement was negotiated between the Sudanese themselves, with a light touch from the South Sudanese mediation and low-key logistical and technical support from the international community; and that much of the negotiations were conducted between former comrades, in marked contrast to the confrontational atmosphere that prevailed during the Bashir era.

As Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok put it: ‘This is a Sudanese peace, made with our own hands and by our own efforts’ and: ‘This is not a paper agreement, but is a living organism that needs care, attention and political will from all of us’.

Achievements of the agreement

The result of almost one year’s hard work in Juba, the agreement is comprehensive in scope and addresses the fundamental issues of Sudan’s crises in Darfur, the Two Areas, and other marginalized regions, albeit in a mixture of regional and national protocols. It goes a long way to realizing the vision of a democratic ‘New Sudan’ based on respect for the diversity of the Sudanese people and equal citizenship without religious, ethnic, cultural or gender discrimination.

There is a focus on the concerns of historically marginalized populations in Sudan’s conflict zones and disadvantaged areas, and it addresses root causes of conflict, such as issues of identity, marginalization, the relationship between religion and state, governance, resource-sharing, land issues, social justice, and equality at the national level.

The deal also looks to resolve the consequences of conflict, such as humanitarian relief, the safe and voluntary return of IDPs and refugees to their original lands and compensation, eviction of illegal settlers and the development and reconstruction of the conflict-affected areas. It provides for significant devolution of power and resources to the regions, including autonomy for the Two Areas and restoration of a single Darfur region. On transitional justice, the government has committed to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Court (ICC) and ensure Bashir and others subject to arrest warrants will ‘appear before’ the ICC.

'This deal will change the face of the transitional government by bringing marginalized forces to the centre of the political process'

This deal will change the face of the transitional government by bringing marginalized forces to the centre of the political process. The transitional period will extend to 2023, with the armed movements having three seats in the (currently 11-member) Sovereign Council and 25% of seats in the Cabinet and soon-to-be-formed Legislative Assembly.

The power-sharing provisions have been criticized as disproportionate to the size of the movements’ political constituencies and military presence inside Sudan. But the movements argue significant representation in the government is necessary to support implementation and that their arrival in Khartoum will help to strengthen the transition to democracy.

'Establishing a single, national professional army, reflective of the diversity of Sudan and with a new military doctrine opens the way for much-needed comprehensive security sector reform'

Establishing a single, national professional army, reflective of the diversity of Sudan and with a new military doctrine opens the way for much-needed comprehensive security sector reform. During the transition, this will include the creation of a 12,000 strong joint force between government security forces and the armed movements to help protect civilians in Darfur. Importantly, mechanisms allowing for civilian input on security reforms are also established.

The deal also guarantees religious freedom and the separation of religion from politics. This ensures religion will not be exploited by state institutions as it was during the Bashir-era, provides for the constitution to be based on equal citizenship, and for the establishment of a National Commission for Religious Freedom to protect the rights of Christians and other minorities. In the Two Areas, the autonomous government will have special legislative powers to pass laws based on the secular 1973 Constitution.

Increasing inclusivity

Key to achieving inclusive and sustainable peace is ensuring popular ownership and finding ways to engage civil society stakeholders and marginalized communities such as nomads in dialogue, reconciliation, and social peace initiatives. The negotiations were mainly a top-down elitist process. Although the UN brought IDPs, tribal leaders and women’s groups to Juba for short periods, there was limited participation by civil society. However, the agreement provides for a wider range of stakeholders to feed into a comprehensive peace through reconciliation and transitional justice mechanisms, follow-on conferences, and an inclusive National Constitutional Conference.

Achieving a comprehensive peace will also mean bringing other armed movements on board, particularly those led by Abdel Aziz Al Hilu and Abdel Wahid Al Nur, both of whom hold significant territory, forces, and support (in the Two Areas and Darfur respectively). Negotiations in Juba with Abdel Aziz had stalled over his demands for a secular state or, failing that, the right to self-determination, but he has now reached a preliminary agreement with Prime Minister Hamdok on a way forward.

Other challenges of implementing peace

Turning the peace agreement into reality on the ground will face many other challenges given the fragility of a civilian-military transitional government, distrust, and competition between the signatory movements and some political parties, as well as increasing insecurity in many parts of the country caused by armed militias, inter-tribal violence, the proliferation of weapons, and sabotage by elements of the former regime. There is also likely to be resistance from groups such as illegal settlers who see their interests being threatened.

'With its economy in meltdown because of economic mismanagement by the Bashir regime, COVID-19, and unprecedented floods, finding resources to implement the peace deal is far beyond the means of Sudan’s cash-strapped government...'

With its economy in meltdown because of economic mismanagement by the Bashir regime, COVID-19, and unprecedented floods, finding resources to implement the peace deal is far beyond the means of Sudan’s cash-strapped government. Implementation therefore requires sustained and generous support from its regional and international partners, including the country’s urgent removal from the US State Sponsors of Terrorism list, which is preventing debt relief, access to concessionary loans and large-scale foreign investment. With donor budgets under heavy pressure, raising money will be hard, but by continuing to support a nascent democracy in a strategically important but unstable region, Sudan’s allies will be safeguarding their long-term interests.

If properly implemented, the Juba peace agreement is a major first step towards creating a ‘New Sudan’ based on peace, equal citizenship, and social justice. Key tests of whether Sudan can finally turn the page are whether the signatory movements and other revolutionary forces can unite to deliver the dividends of peace for the victims of Sudan’s conflicts, and embrace inclusion rather than tribalism and narrow political affiliation; whether the remaining armed movements are ready to start serious negotiations for a comprehensive peace; and whether Sudan now receives the support and attention it deserves from the international community. Surely Sudan has already come too far for this historic opportunity to be lost.

126,https://truthout.org/articles/19-years-after-us-invasion-afghanistans-civil-war-rages-despite-peace-talks/,"Wed, 07 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Truthout,"19 Years After US Invasion, Afghanistan’s Civil War Rages Despite Peace Talks","The United States invaded Afghanistan 19 years ago today, sparking the nation’s longest-running war that has cost tens of thousands of lives and the U.S. about $2 trillion. While the U.S. originally ousted the Taliban as part of a broader anti-terrorism campaign, the Taliban and other militants have waged a bloody and arguably successful insurgency for nearly two decades. Despite billions of dollars in U.S. aid, and years of state-building and counterterrorism operations obscured by mission drift and government disinformation, Afghans continue to suffer a bloody civil war even as the Taliban meet with the Western-backed government for historic peace talks in Qatar.

Deadly airstrikes and bombings have punctuated the fragile and slow-moving peace negotiations since they began in mid-September after months of delay. On Monday, a suicide bomber targeted the convoy of the governor of Afghanistan’s Laghman province, killing eight people and injuring dozens more, including civilians and children. Nobody immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but the Taliban and Islamic State militants are active in the area, according to the Associated Press.

U.S. troops remain on the ground in Afghanistan, and their lingering presence gestures toward the broader reality of US interventionism, militarism and occupation around the world.

“While people in this country do not feel the direct physical effects of these wars, every bomb dropped represents millions of dollars less for our schools, health care, affordable housing, public transportation, physical infrastructure, and a myriad of other social services desperately needed in a time of pandemic and severe economic recession,” reads a statement released Tuesday by the Chicago Committee Against War and Racism.

Meanwhile, 19 years of U.S. occupation clearly hasn’t toppled the Taliban. Vanda Felbab-Brown, a foreign policy senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies the Afghan conflict, says the Taliban remain strong both politically and on the battlefield. The Taliban are expected to use their capacity for violence as leverage at the negotiating table despite a peace deal with the Trump administration and international calls for a ceasefire.

“The war in Afghanistan is not stalled, the Taliban is slowly but surely winning,” Felbab-Brown said in an interview. “It’s ascendant, it’s steadily chipping away at government territory, it has capacity of creating all sort of forms of insecurity.”

Civilian casualties peaked years after the U.S. invasion, with more than 10,000 civilians killed or injured each year since 2013, including hundreds killed in U.S. airstrikes. The United Nations estimates more than 100,000 civilians have been maimed or killed since 2010.

“The war in Afghanistan is not stalled, the Taliban is slowly but surely winning.”

Analysts say the Afghan government propped up by the U.S. remains disorganized, corrupt and unable to control much of the countryside, where the Taliban control large swaths of territory. The country’s economy is now largely dependent on U.S. and international aid. Afghan government officials and their security forces, trained and heavily funded by the U.S. to fend off terrorists and maintain stability, continue to suffer constant attacks and struggle to hold territory and defend population centers, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.

While the U.S. forces have not suffered casualties since striking a controversial peace agreement with the Taliban in February, more than 2,400 U.S. troops have lost their lives in the course of the war in Afghanistan. While President Trump heralded the agreement as a historic turning point in the war, some critics say the administration failed to exact enough concessions from the Taliban as Trump pursued his political goal of withdrawing U.S. troops, putting rights for women and ethnic minorities in danger. While violence subsided for a couple of weeks after the deal was finalized, fighting between the Taliban and Afghan security forces erupted shortly after, causing an alarming spike in civilian casualties.

Under the U.S.-Taliban deal, the U.S. agreed to a timetable for withdrawing troops this year and a complete withdrawal by next summer. Polls show broad and bipartisan public support for ending U.S. involvement in the conflict after years of war, and Trump reportedly wanted to withdraw all troops ahead of the November elections, promoting his desired image as an antiwar president (despite his hawkish positions toward Iran and other countries). Last month, the Defense Department announced that it expects there to be fewer than 5,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan by the end of November.

The Taliban agreed to enter peace talks with the Afghan government and take steps to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a breeding ground for militant groups that could attack the U.S., including al-Qaeda, the target of the original U.S. offensive after the 9/11 attacks. However, reports suggest the Taliban have kept close ties with al-Qaeda despite their assurances to the Trump administration.

Reports suggest the Taliban have kept close ties with al-Qaeda despite their assurances to the Trump administration.

While the U.S.-Taliban deal set the stage for the current peace talks between the Taliban and Kabul, ending the U.S. occupation is one of the Taliban’s top goals, and Trump’s push to make good on his campaign promise to withdraw U.S. forces gives Afghanistan’s former rulers a leg up at the negotiating table. The Taliban have made it clear that they won’t agree to a ceasefire until both parties agree on an “Islamist system” of government, guaranteeing the Taliban a large if not dominant role in the country’s future. Many in the Afghan government fear losing U.S. military support and ceding power to the Taliban, given the way in which the U.S. has installed itself as a seemingly necessary part of the country’s precarious governmental infrastructure. But with the U.S. eyeing the exit, a power-sharing agreement is likely the only path toward peace.

“[The Taliban] understand that they are stronger at the negotiating table when they are stronger on the battlefield,” Felbab-Brown said, adding that the Taliban continue to effectively degrade the Afghan security forces with attacks. “So, they will ask for a lot of the table, and they will certainly ask for profound changes to the political dispensation of the country.”

While analysts and international interlocuters say the talks are the best chance Afghanistan has at establishing peace in decades, Felbab-Brown and others do not expect the civil war will end any time soon, even if U.S. forces withdraw completely.

“The chance that negotiations will result in a peace deal are slim, the betting odds are higher that the talks will break down, or to phrase it more precisely, talks will go on with starts and pauses … for years to come as civil war intensifies,” Felbab-Brown said.

Anthony H. Cordesman, the Arleigh A. Burke chair in strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the current situation on the ground – where the Taliban and Kabul are openly competing for territory – makes building a framework for peace difficult.

The U.S. military has about 800 bases in dozens of countries across the world and is involved in a number of conflicts and proxy wars across North Africa and the Middle East.

“Look at these reports of who controls territory and who is fighting for it — it tends to be district by district, and in a lot of cases, the government controls the main population center, the district capital, and the Taliban control the countryside,” Cordesman said in an interview. “How on Earth do you distribute power and authority in a new government?”

While some observers hope the Taliban will settle for changes to the Afghan constitution, Felbab-Brown is skeptical given their highly authoritarian and religious ideology. The best scenario Felbab-Brown can imagine is an Iran-like system with a supreme council of religious leaders heading the government with some elected officials operating below them. At minimum, she said, the Taliban hope to play a dominant role in the Afghan government, as they did before the U.S. invasion.

The prospect of an empowered Taliban terrifies urban, educated Afghans and women’s rights groups, who are already organizing through civil society to influence the peace talks. There is an international push to include ethnic minorities and women especially in the talks, but Kabul has only four women on its 21-member negotiating team. The Taliban have none. In the lead-up to the negotiations, deadly attacks on human rights activists and women serving in the Afghan government increased.

“My expectation is that Taliban want a strong or dominant role in the Afghan government and will be very inclined to make this space much more authoritarian, much more religiously oriented and much more repressive of civil society actors and women’s rights,” Felbab-Brown said.

While the U.S. points to increased access to education for women since the Taliban were ousted, Cordesman said the U.S. government’s official data on children attending school are probably exaggerated. With peace negotiations stalled at their initial stages, urban and educated Afghans are grappling with the reality that the price of peace may be living under the Taliban’s harsh rules once again. However, much of the country has been living under those rules all along: An estimated 76 percent of Afghan women live in Taliban-controlled areas and the conservative countryside where little has changed since the invasion, according to Felbab-Brown. For them, peace would at least mean an end to bloody fighting that claims the lives of brothers, sons and husbands they are forced to rely on for survival due to strict patriarchal codes.

What, if anything, the U.S. has achieved for the Afghan people during 19 years of war and occupation remains up for debate, but the amount of bloodshed is undeniable. On the anniversary of the Afghan war, activists across the U.S. will be calling for an end to the U.S. military’s massive global reach and interventionism, and to reallocate the nation’s massive war spending to meet the needs of people at home. Currently, the U.S. military has about 800 bases in dozens of countries across the world and is involved in a number of conflicts and proxy wars across North Africa and the Middle East. During this time of economic hardship, organizers are drawing attention to the way in which war and militarism suck up money that might otherwise fund life-affirming priorities like health care, housing and education.

“With one-half of the federal discretionary budget going to the US military, and much of the rest given over to subsidizing the already-rich, it’s little wonder that there are only crumbs left for the rest of us,” reads the statement by the Chicago Committee Against War and Racism.

Following the defeat of Italian forces by the Allied Forces during World War Two, Britain occupied Eritrea until its federation to Ethiopia in 1952. However, by 1962 Emperor Haile Selassie had annexed Eritrea, declaring that it was part of Ethiopia, and in this way ending the federation.

In 1961, a year before the annexation, the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) started an armed struggle for independence from Ethiopia. The armed struggle continued for 30 years against successive Ethiopian regimes until 1991, when the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front (EPLF), who had replaced the ELF, defeated the Ethiopian forces in Eritrea. Eritrea became formally independent following a United Nations-supervised referendum in 1993.

From the beginning, the EPLF (now the People’s Front of Democracy and Justice – PFDJ)’s strategy for achieving liberation and national unity was for it to dominate all social, political, and economic spaces. The PFDJ implemented a highly centralised and opaque two-track system of administration: an unseen, powerful inner circle of elites; and public structures that projected an image of egalitarian self-sufficiency. This centralised and opaque model of governance continues today.

Since liberation, PFDJ has banned all opposition parties and treats all non-mass-movement organisations (i.e. independent civil society) with suspicion; hence there are no independent national civil society organisations in the country. Without any consultation, the PFDJ has nationalised all land; it has established a unitary form of government, and it has changed the administrative boundaries within the country. Despite these totalitarian tendencies, in 1994, the PFDJ, as the Provisional Government of Eritrea, set up the Constitutional Assembly to draft the Constitution. The task was completed in 1997. But the Constitution remains unimplemented.

Border dispute

In 1998, hostilities and war between Eritrea and Ethiopia resumed over border demarcation issues, particularly in the town of Bademe. By December 2000, the two countries signed the Algiers Peace Agreement and established the Eritrea Ethiopia Border Commission (EEBC) to determine the limits of their shared border.

The EEBC delivered its border decision on 13th April 2002, placing the town of Bademe, the flashpoint of the border conflict, on the Eritrean side. The Ethiopian government contested the allocation of Bademe to Eritrea. Therefore, a situation of “no war, no peace” ensued between the two countries as President Isaias Afewerki refused any dialogue on the issue because the parties had agreed that the decision of the EEBC was final and binding.

President Isaias Afwerki, who is also the chair of the PFDJ, took advantage of the strained relationship with Ethiopia to:

indefinitely postpone the implementation of the 1997 Constitution as well as the general elections; arrest and disappear dissenters, especially University of Asmara students and the members of the government known as G15 who promoted a democratisation process (2001); close the independent media and arrest journalists (2001); abolish the Eritrean National Assembly (i.e. the Eritrean Parliament) (2002); maintain a high level of militarisation of the country.

To maintain a high level of militarisation, the government vertically integrated the National Service to the National Development Programme (i.e. the Warsay Yikaalo National Development Programme) and to Education. This integration allows the Eritrean government to move students into the National Service and the National Development Programme from high schools (i.e. Grade 12) and indefinitely extends the period of service of the conscripts, hence taking full control over the working population.

In 1998, hostilities and war between Eritrea and Ethiopia resumed over border demarcation issues, particularly in the town of Bademe. By December 2000, the two countries signed the Algiers Peace Agreement and established the Eritrea Ethiopia Border Commission (EEBC) to determine the limits of their shared border.

Through the integration of the National Service into the Warsay Yikaalo National Development Programme and Education, the government has limited the citizenship rights of conscripts who while in service cannot: legally obtain a mobile phone or SIM card; get or renew a business licence; access land; and access travel documents and exit visas. Deserters or objectors are denied any rights and cannot access state services. Thus, the official Eritrean concept of citizenship is intrinsically linked to conscription and the fulfilment of National Service duties.

The National Service is a combination of military training and civil service, working for little pay in non-military activities such as agriculture, the construction of roads, houses and buildings and mining. The Warsay National Development Programme relies on the deployment of te National Service (Warsay) and defence personnel (Yikaalo) as a labour force. The programme operates under the umbrella of the Ministry of Defence.

Since 2003, the government has closed the University of Asmara (the only university in the country). It has also required that all Eritrean students complete Grade 12 at the Sawa military training camp. Students who have not completed their final year of secondary school at Sawa and have not sat for the National School Certificat, cannot access college education. The PFDJ has replaced Asmara University with regional colleges, which are administered jointly by an academic director and a military director.

National Service conscripts work for an indefinite period on development projects, the administration of ministries and local authorities, as well as in PFDJ-owned businesses. Such work is carried out for very little pay and in conditions that a UN Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in Eritrea described as “forced labour”.

The Eritrean authorities’ control over the people includes the restriction of movement both internally and externally. Therefore, all Eritreans aged five and above cannot leave the country without an exit visa. The government will not issue an exit visa to any Eritrean above the age of five, irrespective of their situation (i.e. family reunification, health, etc.)

The government’s control over the Eritrean people is a political, social and economic process of deprivation and human rights violations for which it refuses to take any responsibility. It is systematically impoverishing the population. Therefore, Eritrean youth face having to choose between the life of slave labour or exile. They describe their situation as slavery: “[The] situation in Eritrea and long time ago with slaves is the same. We build the houses of the elites without money. We work on farms of government officials for no money. If you are educated, they deploy you to anywhere…for a short time, you can tolerate it…but this is for life.”

Faced with accusations of human rights violations, the government reverts to “threat” mode. It labels any reference to human rights violations as “lies” and “ploys” of its enemies to undermine the state. The PFDJ Head of Political Affairs, Mr Yemane Gebreab, dismissed the findings of the Commission of Inquiry on Human rights by saying: “….[it is] really laughable……There is no basis to the claims of the Commission of Inquiry…”

The Eritrean authorities’ control over the people includes the restriction of movement both internally and externally. Therefore, all Eritreans aged five and above cannot leave the country without an exit visa.

In addition to taking control over the working population, the government also took control of the economic sectors, including finance, import and export, transport and construction. It has achieved control over the economic sphere through a process of unfair competition with private business, facilitated by the fact that it does not pay taxes and does not comply with labour, environmental, and other regulatory requirements. Also, as the regime has control over the working population, it has unlimited access to a large pool of free labour, effecting a net transfer of the workforce away from the private sector. This policy of moving human resources to labour sites identified and controlled by the government has crippled the private sector, especially the agricultural industry, which still relies to a large extent on subsistence farming.

The government’s control and domination of the economy have not increased economic activity or productivity. The economy is stagnating, further weakening the private sector and restricting economic opportunities for Eritreans.

Notwithstanding PFDJ’s rhetoric, Eritrean youth experience the state as an albatross around their necks. They understand the state in terms of spy networks; as a human rights violator curtailing civil, political, and economic rights and as the as the source of torture and deprivation. They see it as the source of all restrictions and deprivations. This is the reason why they flee the country.

Peace Agreement with Ethiopia and its aftermath

In April 2018, the Ethiopia Prime Minister Abiy announced the acceptance of the EEBC decision, in particular the allocation of the flashpoint town of Bademe to Eritrea. In this way, he started a process that led to the signing of the Ethiopia Eritrea Peace Agreement in July 2018, thus ending two decades of “no war, no peace”. The land borders opened to much jubilation in 2018. However, by April 2019, the Eritrean government had closed them all. So far, the only achievements of the Peace Agreement are the reopening of embassies and telecommunication lines and the resumption of flights.

The signing of the Peace Agreement immediately raised expectations that there would be a normalisation of relations between the two states. It also raised expectations regarding reforms within Eritrea that would lead to a reduction in the number of Eritrean youth fleeing the country. Soon after the signing of the Peace Agreement, the Eritrean Catholic priest Aba Teklemichael pointed to the sweeping reforms implemented by Prime Minister Abiy in Ethiopia, and urged the Eritrean government to also undertake necessary reforms in Eritrea and to democratise the government. By Easter 2019, the Eritrean Catholic bishops were also calling for a constitutional government and the rule of law. They also encouraged the government to release political prisoners and start a process of reconciliation within the country. However, to date there have been no reforms in the country, a state of affairs confirmed by the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Eritrea who at the start of this year reported that she had: “ ……no tangible evidence of a meaningful and substantive improvement in the situation of human rights in Eritrea”.

The signing of the Peace Agreement immediately raised expectations that there would be a normalisation of relations between the two states. It also raised expectations regarding reforms within Eritrea that would lead to a reduction in the number of Eritrean youth fleeing the country.

The ongoing peace process is not transparent; it has mostly remained an elite political level agreement unable to deliver on the economic front or to resolve the issue of Bademe as both Prime Minister Abiy and President Isaias Afewerki have marginalised the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) for political motives. The Eritrean government has increasingly identified the Tigray State and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) as an existential threat to Eritrea, thus justifying the maintenance of a high level of militarisation. Consequently, Eritrean youth continue to flee the country. In 2018, UNHCR ranked Eritrea as the ninth-largest refugee-sending state in the world.

Ailing health sector

The totalitarian agenda of the Eritrean government did not spare the health sector either. The task of reconstructing the Eritrean health system after the liberation struggle and following the 1998-2000 Eritrea-Ethiopia border war was monumental. It was an undertaking that the late and former Minister of Health Saleh Meki undertook with passion, commitment, and zest from 1997 to 2009 when Ms Amina Nurhussein replaced him.

In his efforts rebuild the Eritrean health system, Saleh Meki sought to establish strategic partnerships with critical international health institutions, private practitioners, faith-based organisations, such as the Catholic Church, as well as professional members of the Eritrean diaspora. The former Minister of Health carried on with his efforts despite the enormous pressure to conform to the dictates of President Isaias Afwerki, and the concerns generated by the closure of international non-governmental organisations, as well as the restriction of movement imposed on all organisations working in the country. Against all the odds, he re-established the medical school known as the Orotta Medical School.

Saleh Meki died on 2nd October 2009. Soon after his death, all the medical missions of international organisations that he had worked so hard to bring to Eritrea ended. By 2011 the Eritrean Government forced the closure of all private medical clinics. And, by 2018 a total of 29 Catholic health facilities providing maternal and child health support and serving some of the more remote communities in the country were closed. The seizure and closure, of the Catholic health facilities was carried out in complete disregard to the health and safety of the patients, most of whom were left to fend for themselves.

There was no clear justification for the closure of the private health facilities. However, the closure of the Catholic health facilities was justified as an enforcement of the 1995 Proclamation to standardise and articulate religions institutions (Proclamation No 73 of 1995). The Proclamation prohibits religious bodies from engaging in social and welfare services. This position is contested by all faith-based organisations, especially since there was no consultation in the development of the law. The Eritrean Catholic bishops’ communication with the government on the seizure and closure of their health facilities point out that the facilities operated by abiding with all the requirements of the Ministry of Health.

Poor COVID-19 response

The closure of health facilities has reduced the number of available beds and the overall capacity of the health system. Hence, Eritrea, with a score of 0.434, was ranked 182nd out of 189 countries by the 2019 Human Development Index. The low Human Development Index combined with a hospital bed capacity of 7 beds for 10,000 people, and no available data as to the number of health professionals (i.e. doctors and nurses) available per 10,000 people, suggests that the situation might be even more dire. And the poor connectivity of the country (i.e. mobile phones, internet, broadbands) means that the country’s capacity to deal with pandemics such as COVID-19 is low.

The low capacity of the Eritrean health system to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic was also of concern to the diaspora Eritrean Healthcare Professionals Network (EHPN), which urged the Eritrean government to immediately implement the World ealth Orbanization (WHO) and Centre for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines and advisories to contain the pandemic. EHPN expressed concern that the country lacks the necessary prerequisites to implement hygiene measures because: “There is a shortage of water, disinfectants, laboratories that carry out diagnostic tests and medical professionals, including nursing and technical staff. There is also a lack of functioning intensive care units with adequate ventilation equipment needed to properly treat patients. The reality is that many Eritreans will not be able to seek and obtain medical treatment in their homeland or neighbouring countries. In short, the Eritrean health system is not adequately prepared for COVID 19.”

Fears regarding the poor state of the Eritrean health system were further heightened when the Eritrean government refused COVID-19 emergency supplies donated by the Chinese billionaire Jack Ma and his Alibaba Group. Mr Hagos “Kisha” Gebrehiwet, the head of Economic Affairs in the ruling PFDJ, justified the rejection of Jack Ma’s donation by saying that it was unsolicited.

The government’s willingness to reject donations has, however, launched a COVID-19 appeal among citizens. The appeal is remarkable for the lack of information as to how the funds raised will be used. There is no single COVID-19 emergency response bank account designated for the appeal; hence, in the diaspora, funds are collected in different foreign bank accounts set up by Eritrean embassies. Consequently, there is a real danger that the funds will never enter the country and will disappear into the government’s opaque offshore financial system. Also, there is no information as to how the Ministry of Health will use the funds. Reports by Eritrean human rights activists say the appeal is coerced, confirming the lack of transparency and accountability of the fundraising process.

There is also no transparency in the COVID-19 data that the Eritrean government is providing. It reported the first four COVID-positive cases on the 21st and 23rd of March. One patient was an Eritrean national resident in Norway, and the other three positive patients were Eritrean nationals returning from Dubai. Because of these events, by 26th March, the government banned all commercial passenger flights for two weeks. It also closed schools. And, by 1st April, it imposed COVID-19 lockdown measures.

Fears regarding the poor state of the Eritrean health system were further heightened when the Eritrean government refused COVID-19 emergency supplies donated by the Chinese billionaire Jack Ma and his Alibaba Group. Mr Hagos “Kisha” Gebrehiwet, the head of Economic Affairs in the ruling PFDJ, justified the rejection of Jack Ma’s donation by saying that it was unsolicited.

The lockdown measures did not include the closure of the Sawa military training camp or the release of political prisoners. The government has recently released 27 Christian prisoners, who were imprisoned without charge or trial for as long as sixteen years. Their release is conditional on their family lodging their property deeds with the government as a guarantee that the people released will not leave the country.

While maintaining a strict lockdown, the Eritrean government has allowed mass gatherings to celebrate the graduation of the 33rd round of Sawa military training camp graduates as well as the transfer of Grade 12 conscripts to the facility.

From 1st April to 18th April, the Eritrean government reported 39 COVID positive cases, all linked to Eritreans visiting or returning from their travels. Then, for two months, there were no new cases reported. After that, the number of COVID-positive cases increased, and by the 12th of October, Eritrea reported a total of 414 COVID-positive patients and 372 recoveries.

Though the government makes repeated references to quarantine centres, it has not shared a list of the centres, their location or capacity. It is also not reporting the daily number of COVID tests. Nor has it reported any COVID-related deaths or any community transmission of the virus. It continues to attribute all the new COVID cases to Eritreans returning through “irregular land and sea routes” from Ethiopia, Sudan, Djibouti and Yemen. But there is no explanation as to why so many nationals are travelling despite the government’s strict lockdown procedure that prohibits all movement between towns and that restricts te movement of any vehicles, including buses and taxis, which require movement permits. Such permits are not easy to obtain.

Finally, there are only five incidents of Ministry of Information reporting the number of individuals tested or in quarantine:

3,000 quarantined – 8th May 2020; 5,270 quarantined – 3rd June 2020; 7,158 nationals returned through irregular land and sea routes. Not clearly stated but the implication is that they were all quarantined – 14th June 2020; 18,000 citizens allegedly returned through irregular land and sea routes. This movement occurred in the last four months. Again, not clearly stated but the implication is that they were all quarantined – the 12th October 2020; 41,100 tests – 12th October 2020.

In a recent report, the Eritrean Ministry of Information asserted that the rate of COVID infection in the country was “a paltry 0.02%”, based on one (1) positive result during 4659 random tests done in Asmara”. The data shared by the government (41,100 tests and 414 COVID-positive cases) suggests that the rate of infection is just 1 per cent.

The COVID lockdown in Eritrea, like in other countries, has brought economic activities to a standstill. The difference between Eritrea and other countries is that the Eritrean economy was already on its knees before the lockdown and the Eritrean government has not made any attempt – beyond extorting donations from its citizens – to alleviate the suffering of the people with economic support packages. Consequently, Eritreans are hungry and desperate and have started to ignore strict lockdowns. They are on the streets selling all kinds of goods. Women are out in the streets, making tea and cooking food for sale. Family and friends describe Asmara, the capital city, as full of mobile tea shops.

The data shared by the government (41,100 tests and 414 COVID-positive cases) suggests that the rate of infection is just 1 per cent.

The Eritrean Afars have, through the Red Sea Afar Human Rights Organisation (RSAHRO), issued a press statement, describing their situation under lockdown as a: “… siege imposed by the Eritrean regime on the citizens of the region.”. They warn of the danger of hunger in their area. They also describe confiscation of boats, camels and supplies by the military, closed health centres, unprepared quarantine centres, as well as lack of medical supplies. The human rights organisation also accuse General Tekle Manjus of confiscating trucks of emergency food sent from Asmara for distribution among the Afar.

The Afar coastal area is not the only area in danger of hunger. The information from Eritrea is that hunger is very real all over the country. The government media and social media accounts do not report the danger of hunger or any of the difficulties that the people are facing during this COVID-19 emergency. Their postings give the impression that Eritrea is doing just fine.","By December 2000, the two countries signed the Algiers Peace Agreement and established the Eritrea Ethiopia Border Commission (EEBC) to determine the limits of their shared border.

On the invitation of National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser, a 17-member Afghan parliamentary delegation, led by Speaker of Wolsey Jirga Mr Rahmani, arrived in Islamabad to participate in the seminar, titled Pakistan-Afghanistan Trade and Investment Forum 2020.

Speaking at the inauguration, Prime Minister Imran Khan, who was the chief guest, said that Pakistan has also suffered due to the 40-year conflict in Afghanistan.

""After Afghanistan, Pakistan has suffered the most due to the conflict,"" he said. The past, he said, only has one purpose: people should only learn from it and not live in it.

""What history has shown us is that foreign interference has never been successful in Afghanistan; the people need to make their own decisions,"" he said, adding that the people will decide who will be elected. ""Pakistan will work with the Afghanistan government and will keep the relationship strong.""

The prime minister also commented on neighbour India, saying that there has never been a more ""Muslim-hating"" government in power in 72 years.

""We tried very hard to befriend them [...] I had many friendships [in India] because of cricket. But at one point, I understood that there was no point as they were against us ideologically,"" he said, adding that what is currently happening with the Muslims in the neighbouring country has never happened before.

""So there is a fear in Pakistan that India will use Afghanistan to destabilise the country. But we have decided that we will back the wishes of the people of Afghanistan because the future of this region lies in the relationship and cooperation between Pakistan and Afghanistan.""

The premier concluded his address by saying that trade was the only way to bring prosperity to both the countries.

According to a handout by the National Assembly Sec­re­­­­­tariat, lawmakers, ministers and businessmen from the two countries will attend the two-day seminar. USAID Pakistan has also extended support to the National Assembly Secre­tariat for organising the seminar under its regional connectivity and integration initiative.

Thematic sessions of the seminar will discuss Pakistan-Afghanistan transit trade, and investment opportunities in sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, food and livestock.

This conference report outlines the main findings of the workshop on ‘European Security’ organised by RUSI and the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC) in February 2021 as part of the UK–Russia Security Dialogue. The dialogue is a proven format that has provided an opportunity for RUSI and RIAC to bring together experts from the two countries to discuss key questions, including sensitive security issues, at a time when this kind of interaction is the exception rather than the rule.

UK–Russia relations have become increasingly strained over the past decade, notably from 2014 following Russia’s actions in Crimea and the war in eastern Ukraine, which together marked a turning point in the bilateral relationship. In the subsequent years, there have been a series of efforts by Western European leaders, including from the UK, to reset relations with Russia. Despite these efforts, relations have continued to deteriorate. Against this background, the prospect for a reset of the sort that was pursued between the US and Russia in 2009 seems, at present, dim.

Given this environment, the focus of the current dialogue workshop was on how to reduce the chances for open military confrontation between NATO and Russia, especially in Europe, and on maintaining mutual engagement in the spheres where it is absolutely crucial.

The UK’s position in Europe has undergone significant evolution in recent years, although European security remains a core focus in the ‘Global Britain’ agenda. Previously preoccupied with Brexit, the UK government has started to move beyond negotiations on the UK’s departure from the EU to fashion a revised foreign and security policy. Even though EU–UK relations might remain tense for some time, it is clear that the UK is committed to working closely with both the EU and major European powers on foreign and security policy. Equally, the transatlantic relationship will remain a core part of the UK approach to European security. As a result, UK approaches to Russia will be closely aligned with its European and North American allies.

Indeed, in contrast to the apprehension about the reliability of the US as a security partner under Donald Trump, cooperation with President Joe Biden’s administration is likely to give a new momentum to transatlantic ties. These ties are based on mutual interests and reflect largely similar approaches to Russia. Following Brexit, the UK has ensured that sanctions relating to Russia continue to operate effectively by replacing the existing EU legislation with national measures.

For Russia, it is of paramount importance which mode of interaction the Biden administration will opt for in relations with Moscow. President Biden might be a more difficult partner, but the Russian view is that opportunities for some positive moves by NATO should not be ruled out. The integration of military-to-military contact into the political discussions of the NATO–Russia Council could be an important initial step to help promote stability and manage relations. From a Russian perspective, such a move should not be seen by the Alliance as a step to appease Russia or as a departure from NATO’s established approach, but rather as a step that would lay the ground for more dialogue.

Moderate optimism can be expressed about the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) regarding measures to overcome its institutional crisis and Sweden’s chairmanship in 2021, which may bring new opportunities. Russia chairing the Arctic Council from 2021 to 2023 provides a further opportunity to open the space for cooperation in some areas that affect the security situation in the High North.

With UK–Russia relations likely to be difficult, it is imperative that efforts remain focused on the realistic goal of developing a ‘new normalcy’ to stabilise the situation. Moves from confrontation to cooperation are unlikely given that both sides have irreconcilable visions of the essence of the international system and cite the lack of trust as an underlying impediment to normalisation. In this situation, it is important that efforts to exchange information and views continue and that there is further work on confidence-building measures to manage confrontation to lower risks and costs.

Summary of the Discussion

This UK–Russia dialogue workshop explored the various political and security issues affecting the contemporary European security landscape and provided an opportunity to share threat perceptions and consider the potential to mitigate security risks. The participants presented their countries’ strategic priorities and perspectives on the evolving nature of European security, including the prospects for arms control. The workshop also introduced the sub-regional perspective by focusing on the security complex in the Baltic Sea, Northern Europe and the Arctic.

The discussion focused on: the challenges that the European regional security order faces; the dangers stemming from its fragmentation; the erosion of much of the post-Cold War arms control regime; and the ebbing of the credibility of the OSCE, which faced a deep institutional crisis in 2020.

UK–Russia Relations

UK contributors noted that there have been a number of factors that have strained the UK–Russia relationship, such as the Russian annexation of Crimea and the military incursion into eastern Ukraine in 2014, Russian interference during the 2016 Brexit referendum, the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko on UK soil in 2006, the 2018 Salisbury chemical weapons attack and the attempted murder of Alexei Navalny in 2020. Some of these actions have led to the introduction of UK sanctions against Russia. Against this backdrop, the resumption of cooperative ties between the governments does not look feasible and the restoration of direct military cooperation is unlikely.

Citing this environment, the overarching idea of the discussion shared by most participants was that the status quo in relations between Russia and the UK – a ‘new normalcy’ – is not desirable but sustainable, is ‘not acceptable but bearable’. This perception about the potential for relations is likely to continue to inform the policy responses by both sides in the foreseeable future. Participants noted that the current state of affairs appears to be characterised by a situation in which both parties have reciprocal expectations that the steps towards normalisation need to come from the other side.

At the same time, participants underlined the importance of measures to reduce the chances of open confrontation. A key theme to emerge from the discussion was, thus, the need to maintain engagement in the spheres where it is most crucial.

A Russian participant expressed his concern that the decision taken by NATO in April 2014 to sever ties with Russia had grave repercussions in terms of increasing the risks of unintended military escalation. In the absence of an appropriate venue for discussions, many in the Russian expert community would like to see the governments of Russia and NATO countries start to discuss imminent threats in order to anticipate areas of tension and to set in place the means to de-escalate confrontations.

It was recognised that, at present, communication tends to start only when the risks become unacceptable, like in Syria. With important, but narrow, mechanisms for preventing dangerous military incidents already in place, there is no incentive to conduct political talks on the factors that could lead to confrontation.

It was noted that a key role for expert discussions such as the UK–Russia dialogue should be to alert governments to the possibility that ‘acceptable risks today can become unacceptable tomorrow’. The prevention of tensions or even resolution of some areas of dispute is thus crucial to managing the current difficult relations and avoiding a further dangerous deterioration. A Russian participant noted, however, that the West seems not to be ready for a selective approach to Russia which would allow for the compartmentalisation of the bilateral agenda into independent areas.

UK participants observed that while relations with Russia are difficult, the current status quo is viewed as sustainable and there are many other issues on the international security agenda for the UK to focus on beyond relations with Russia. At the same time, it was noted that if Russia does not shift its approach in the coming years, which was deemed unlikely, the transatlantic community will increasingly focus on deterrence and risk management in their relations with Russia.

It was noted that following a series of unsuccessful outreaches to Russia by NATO members, the Allies do not feel they should be the demandeurs in terms of the reset with Russia or for arms control initiatives. A UK participant observed that recent efforts by Western European states to reach out to Russia, including President Emmanuel Macron’s initiative and the visit to Moscow by EU High Representative Josep Borrell, bore no fruit and did not generate a positive response from the Russian side.

Thus, for any reset to occur, it was suggested that Russia would have to take the first steps. This would need to involve addressing the issues that have strained relations between Russia and the West, notably the annexation of Crimea, military intervention in Ukraine and actions in the Middle East, as well as Russian activities in the cyber domain. At the same time, the widespread view in the UK is that the Russian government does not believe that it is currently in its interests to make substantial concessions in relation to eastern Ukraine, over the joint management of the Syrian issue or in regard to its cyber activities.

The Challenges Facing Arms Control in Europe

The significant risks for a new arms race emerging in Europe were discussed at length. Participants were sceptical about the prospects of another golden age for arms control emerging, comparable to the one in the 1960s after the Cuban and Berlin crises, or in the late 1980s when the Soviet Union sought a radical change in its policies towards NATO and the West. Conventional arms control in Europe – based on the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), the Vienna Document and the Open Skies Treaty – is in demise and the existing regimes are no longer considered adequate to address contemporary security threats.

There was consensus that the erosion of the nuclear arms control architecture between the US and Russia poses a serious threat to European security, even if the UK and other European states are not direct participants in US–Russia treaties. Following the demise of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, the extension at the beginning of 2021 of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) between Moscow and Washington was met with relief. This positive step to renew the last remaining arms control agreement was hailed by Russian and UK participants, albeit a deal reached in an emergency rather than as a result of a wide r détente.

The collapse in recent years of the last remaining confidence- and security-building measures in Europe was noted as emblematic of the rapid deterioration of Russia–West relations. The US under the Trump administration withdrew from the Open Skies Treaty in November 2020, accusing Russia of treaty violations that made continued US membership impossible. In January 2021, Moscow announced it would follow the US and withdraw from the Treaty, citing the failure of NATO signatories to agree to its demands not to share information from the Russian surveillance flights with the US.

Though the future of the agreement remains uncertain, a Russian expert welcomed the possibility of the Biden administration returning the US to the Treaty. It was opined that Russia actually launched the withdrawal procedure to send the signal to the US that renewing its participation should be considered an urgent matter.

Workshop participants indicated that it is unlikely that there will be progress towards Europe-wide conventional arms control, along the lines of the adapted CFE treaty, in the foreseeable future. Russian participants expressed support for consultations to address the risks around sensitive areas where NATO and Russia border with each other – in the Baltic and the Black Sea regions. The aim should be to, at minimum, establish the sub-regional arrangements that could prevent unintended security escalations.

It was also noted that it should be a priority to extend confidence-building measures into the Barents and Norwegian Seas, which are the overlapping areas of operations by the Russian Northern Fleet and the recently re-established US Second Fleet. Participants recognised, however, that NATO did not accept the idea of concluding separate sub-regional agreements with Russia. One of the benefits of re-establishing NATO–Russia military-to-military dialogue was identified as providing a more credible notification arrangement on ground forces and, thus, a means to improve transparency and trust.

On the arms control regime in Europe, Russian participants indicated that Moscow would welcome European initiatives on arms control mechanisms but noted that Russia assessed that European capitals are wary of Washington’s reactions to such initiatives and oversensitive to potential criticism.

At the same time, the Russian perception of Europe as lacking strategic autonomy on security issues loomed in the discussions when a Russian discussant expressed the belief that for the Russian defence establishment, talking to Europeans about arms control when the US is not at the table has no practical sense.

The fate of the Chemical Weapons Convention was discussed. A UK participant raised the issue of the large-scale use of chemical weapons in Syria, where Russia is supporting the regime of Bashar Al-Assad. The use of banned chemical agents for attempted assassinations was also noted. These actions were identified as policies that seriously erode trust in Russia’s commitment to adhere to legally binding treaties.

Against the background of the chemical weapons attacks in Salisbury in 2018 and the attempted poisoning of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in 2020 using a prohibited nerve agent, restoring the credibility of the Chemical Weapons Convention and Russia’s adherence to its provisions were seen as a cornerstone for improving relations with the West.

The deterioration of arms control arrangements was seen as reflective of the wider breakdown of the crisis management functions of the OSCE. Experts agreed that there were some improvements at the end of 2020 with agreement on the appointment of the organisation’s institutional heads and with the stable hand of the Swedish chairmanship guiding this process. But the continuous tensions around these institutions, which embody the comprehensive security concept at the core of the OSCE, and the lack of significant progress around the organisation’s regional conflict management activities, were raised. The limited levers available to the OSCE during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war were also highlighted.

A Russian expert opined that Moscow does not see a bigger independent role for the OSCE in crisis management and arms control, since it views the organisation as an instrument that has been privatised by the West. The Russia–NATO relationship was identified as a better-placed format to discuss arms control issues.

Perspectives on the Security of Northern Europe

In the session devoted to discussing Northern Europe and the Arctic, the Baltic sub-region was identified as the most dangerous environment. At the same time, the Arctic can no longer be considered as a region insulated from tensions. The vision of the Arctic as a region of peace and cooperation may no longer hold true as the security mechanisms of the past are losing their relevance.

The discussion highlighted differences in perceptions between UK and Russian specialists on the military dynamics in the region. Russia sees Northern Europe and the Baltic Sea as two distinct regions, while the UK – together with the other states of Northern Europe – increasingly see these areas as a single security space.

A Russian participant contended that assessments that Moscow is militarising the region are exaggerated; there is force modernisation, rather than the creation of new offensive capabilities. These modernisation programmes, it was argued, do not violate the military balance or provoke an arms race in the region, and are aimed to make the Russian armed forces better prepared to deal with non-traditional security threats.

A British discussant noted, however, that Russia’s increased sense of security is creating a growing sense of insecurity among its neighbours. Russia has extended its capabilities in air defence and other areas beyond its borders in order to protect its strategic forces located in the north. With new capabilities, it is able to project power beyond the Arctic into the North Atlantic.

As a result of Russian activities in the region, the transatlantic community assesses that the security environment has changed substantively. NATO, including the UK, has developed a much keener interest in the region, and NATO Arctic states that were previously resistant to the Alliance having a regional role are shifting to accept that it can be an interlocutor on Arctic military questions. There is a perception that there needs to be an Alliance response to Russian activities with a growing focus on the Greenland–Iceland–UK gap.

With new actors, including China, coming into the region, Russia is on the defensive. Responding to a question about whether Russia is prepared to talk to NATO about the Arctic and managing military tensions, it was noted that Russia is opposed to seeing more NATO engagement in the region, and security dialogue should be conducted among the five littoral states directly.

Conclusions

The workshop highlighted the importance of maintaining a channel for candid talks between Russia and the UK’s expert communities. There were a number of areas of consensus, in the sense that both sides recognised the need to maintain a dialogue without illusions in order to, at minimum, better understand each other’s perspective and positions. Participants agreed that the UK and Russia should be aware of the real potential risks of any further deterioration in European security at the cost of an arms race, or even unwanted confrontation. Dialogue participants also highlighted that, despite the bilateral difficulties, there are ways that both parties can manage the risks of the ‘new normal’ situation. There is, thus, an urgent need to explore how this can be achieved effectively.

A realistic assessment of UK–Russia relations points to the need for both sides to recognise that the focus of bilateral ties should be on developing pragmatic and limited areas of cooperation. Discussion of a wholesale reset, which is not feasible at present, should be avoided. Some of those pragmatic areas could be talks about how to make progress on arms control, ways to strengthen military-to-military contacts, and maintaining the discussions on threat perceptions and regional security.

Catholic,Become an ‘artisan of peace’: Vancouver Catholics react to Pope’s encyclical Fratelli tutti,"Local Catholics offer their thoughts on Pope Francis’ new encyclical Fratelli Tutti and its themes of unity and peace, charity, and the spirit of St. Francis of Assisi.

Dr. Michael W. Higgins

A prophetic cry of the heart

Fratelli Tutti, the latest document to emerge from the pen of Pope Francis, is a substantive examination of humanity’s desperate need for meaningful connection, for human communion, for a shared grasp of those values that enrich us as individuals and as societies.

Building on this pope’s special love for, and identification with, the Poverello of Assisi, the encyclical letter is a sustained meditation on the evangelical vision and legacy of Francesco Bernardone – St. Francis of Assisi – especially as they apply to our tremulous, plague-riddled, and deeply unsettled time.

Having prompted Pope Francis to write his earlier encyclical, Laudato Sí, a powerful document on the environment and our common home, the Pope returns to the first Franciscan, if you like, and draws on his wisdom and saintliness to address our universal yearning for credible love, genuine justice, profound unity.

He writes: “Francis felt himself a brother to the sun, the sea and the wind, yet he knew that he was even closer to those of his own flesh. Wherever he went, he sowed seeds of peace and walked alongside the poor, the abandoned, the infirm and the outcast, the least of his brothers and sisters.”

And that has also been the way of Papa Bergoglio as he privileged the poor in his ministry, prioritized the pastoral needs of the displaced migrants, addressed the social and economic inequities that define our politically fraught environment, and has taken on the powers and principalities that oppress the underclass.

Pope Francis reminds us that the COVID-19 pandemic is a dramatic illustration of the crippling irony that “for all our hyper-connectivity, we witnessed a fragmentation that made it more difficult to resolve problems that affect us all. Anyone who thinks that the only lesson to be learned was the need to improve what we are already doing, or to refine existing systems and regulations, is denying reality.”

In Fratelli Tutti Francis is embracing reality. He names the structural, systemic, and historically conditioned problems that divide us, polarize us, delimit and denigrate us. His encyclical is a cri de coeur, a cry of the heart that is prophetic, and yet not oracular or abstract. It has about it the sweet reason of the pragmatic infused with the spiritual. Pope Francis is uninterested in windy expostulations and grand theories. He diagnoses our ailments through his Franciscan lens and then offers some prescriptions that can assist us in restoring our social health.

Although, as is the tradition in encyclical writing, he speaks of issues and avoids naming personalities, it is not difficult to identify those leaders and the policies that they advocate who merit his moral outrage: those who build walls, foment racial and ethnic hatred, demean their opponents and critics, sunder language from truth, commodify human worth, create a politics that despises the “other,” perpetuate a “throwaway culture” that diminishes life at its beginning and at its end, solidify an ethos that prizes “killers over zeros, winners over losers.”

The conclusion of Fratelli Tutti is a public acknowledgement of the heroic witness and holy lives of those outside the Catholic faith who have influenced the author greatly: Martin Luther King, Desmond Tutu, Mahatma Gandhi. The Pope draws on a moral chorus he finds congruent with the teachings of Jesus, with Francis of Assisi his lead soloist.

Call for radical transformation

St. Francis of Assisi’s response to God’s call is a model for us of the radical transformation that the new encyclical Fratelli Tutti urges us to make. It was significant that Pope Francis travelled to Assisi Oct. 3 to celebrate Mass before signing this encyclical on the fifth anniversary of Laudato Sí, his document on the environment. Both encyclicals provide a blueprint for the conversion of heart, mind, and soul needed in our current global reality. Today is a critical moment, not only because of the pandemic but for the survival of our planet.

In his youth, St. Francis was known as a partier, a flamboyant merchant who was ambitious with aspirations for knighthood. He was caught up in the market economy with dreams of wealth and pleasure. While he was a knight, he encountered a dark period of illness which awakened him to a new vision of reality, changing the rest of his life. He became an advocate for the vulnerable, showing forth a love that transcended barriers of geography and distance. One day while praying, Francis heard a voice telling him, “Francis go rebuild my house, as you see, it is all being destroyed.”

Pope Francis hopes that this encyclical will be our wakeup call to a new vision of fraternity and social friendship. He encourages us to dream of ourselves as a single human family, united as companions on the journey. Using the parable of the Good Samaritan as a pivotal theme, he reminds us of our challenge to see and attend to the wounded and discarded strangers on the road, offering them compassionate and selfless care, overcoming barriers to being neighbours.

In the first chapter, Dark Clouds Over a Closed World, Pope Francis illustrates extensively the trends in our society today that hinder the development of this universal fraternity. He urges us to reimagine our lifestyles, our relationships, our institutions, governments, and above all the meaning of our existence. He calls for a universal love that transcends walls, races, differences, and borders, and promotes the dignity, worth, and value of every human being, not based on circumstances but on their intrinsic worth. This demands that the systems of structural injustices that cause poverty, war, inequality, homelessness, migration, trafficking, etc. be addressed and resolved to secure justice and dignity for all.

Besides outlining a comprehensive plan of action for a more just world, Pope Francis names several essential tools needed in the development of this global community of fraternity, such as a social charity, a better politics, skills of dialogue and negotiation, the practice of building bridges and eliminating walls, and the art of peacemaking, kindness, forgiveness, and reconciliation.

If, like St. Francis, we are to rebuild our universal world, each of us, regardless of religion, needs to be an “artisan of peace, by uniting and not dividing, by extinguishing hatred and not holding on to it, by opening paths of dialogue and not constructing new walls.”

Let us live the vision so clearly articulated by Pope Francis in Fratelli Tutti.

Local and global

An aspect of Pope Francis’ encyclical Fratelli tutti which caught my eye was the distinction between “popular” and “populist” (155-162). Both those words come from the word for “people.”

Now, we think of “people” as a collection of individuals. But when we speak of “the people” or “a people,” we think of something that goes beyond individuals to a group, a nation. Both “populist” and “popular” refer to that kind of people. For Pope Francis, the “populist” distorts the people. Populists tend towards xenophobia, hatred of foreigners, and populist leaders become demagogues who exploit the desires of the people.

But what he is really interested in is the “popular” – the movements and leaders who express the history (13), tradition (14), and culture (134) of a people. These are realities that go beyond the rational and logical to the “mythic” (158). (We might note that “mythic” doesn’t mean imaginary or unreal but rather a reality that is conveyed by a story, rather like the parables of Jesus.)

On the other hand, Pope Francis is aware that concentrating on your own popular traditions has a danger. He calls it “local narcissism” (146), i.e. being blind to what is beyond your own village or homeland. There has to be a global perspective also, an openness to the wider world.

This openness leads to relationship and dialogue. We welcome strangers, especially migrants and refugees. As a Benedictine, I’d like to note that Pope Francis cites the Rule of St. Benedict on hospitality in this context (90).

But what is behind all this openness and relationship is love, that is, the virtue of charity. It unites opposite dimensions, such as the abstract and the institutional (164), the intimate, and the political/economic (181). “If someone helps an elderly person to cross a river, that is a fine act of charity. The politician, on the other hand, builds a bridge, and that too is an act of charity.” (186)

The Holy Father recognizes that there is a tension between globalization and localization, and between other opposites that come together under charity. This tension is necessary: “universal fraternity and social friendship are thus two inseparable and equally vital poles in every society.” (142)

On one hand this means that a change of heart is necessary; otherwise the proposals of charity will seem unrealistic (127).

But tensions will remain and the process will be difficult. “Let us not forget that ‘differences are creative; they create tension and in the resolution of tension lies humanity’s progress.’” (203)

In fact there are not only necessary tensions but also necessary conflicts. “Authentic reconciliation does not flee from conflict, but is achieved in conflict, resolving it through dialogue and open, honest and patient negotiation.” (244)

I think the idea that “reconciliation is achieved in conflict” is a key to understanding not only the Holy Father’s thought on the popular but also some of the other difficult aspects of the papacy of Pope Francis.

131,https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/10/29/parallel-universe-peace,"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Common Dreams,The Parallel Universe of Peace,"Here’s a piece of paradoxical news that puts even the looming U.S. presidential election in perspective: Nuclear weapons are now (or soon will be) . . . good Lord, illegal.

Armageddon is against the law!

No nuke-armed nation has, as far as I can tell, anything but contempt for this infringement on its right to blow up the world.

Well, sort of. And the Trump administration doesn’t agree. Indeed, no nuke-armed nation has, as far as I can tell, anything but contempt for this infringement on its right to blow up the world (only if necessary, of course). War and peace, it seems, exist in parallel universes.

In the pro-war universe, as explained with succinct clarity by Nuclear Ground Zero in a three-minute video, it takes five minutes for a U.S. president to launch a war. An aide carries a briefcase full of nuclear codes — this is the “nuclear football” — literally everywhere the president goes; and if the president decides that now is the time, he issues his encrypted order to the Pentagon war room, then responds to the “challenge code” the war room officer presents to him. The correct response is “on a little card” the president carries.

“It takes five minutes to launch a war. . . . It’s as easy as ordering a pizza.” And there’s no way to stop a missile once it’s been launched. “The whole process, from the president opening his briefcase to missiles being launched can take as little as five minutes. Millions of people will be dead faster than Domino’s can get there with your pizza.”

Human progress! This is the world we have created in our pursuit of dominance over Planet Earth and one another, lo these past ten thousand or so years. We have made it to the edge of the void, the brink of global suicide and non-existence, pushed along by a sense of glory and power and fear of the enemy, who, it turns out, is none other than ourselves. Humanity has pursued the opposite of this as well, but peace — connectedness, “love thy enemy as thyself” — is profoundly more complex to grasp and understand, and those who believe in war have successfully contained it so far.

This is the context in which I consider the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which was approved by the U.N. General Assembly in July 2017 by a vote of 122-1. The debate on this treaty — which proclaims that no nation can “develop, test, produce, acquire, possess, stockpile, use or threaten to use nuclear weapons” and holds nations responsible to remediate the environmental and human damage they’ve caused by nuclear testing over the last 75 years — was boycotted by the United States, Russia, China, the U.K., France, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea . . . hmmm, what do these countries have in common? Oh yeah, they all possess nuclear weapons. Also boycotting the debate and vote were their allies, including all the NATO countries.

After its passage, the treaty then had to be ratified by 50 countries before it could become international law. That happened in the past week, when Honduras became the fiftieth nation to do so. That means, according to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons: “In 90 days, the treaty will enter into force, cementing a categorical ban on nuclear weapons, 75 years after their first use.”

SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Never Miss a Beat. Get our best delivered to your inbox.







OK, but what does that actually mean? First of all, the prohibition against development and use of nukes applies only to the treaty’s signatories, which only include countries that are nuke-free anyway — which means this isn’t a law in any pragmatic way but, rather, a commitment. And while I do not disparage such a commitment, I have to ask how it brings us the least bit closer to actual global nuclear disarmament.

Well, according to The Guardian, “campaigners hope the treaty will have the same impact as previous international treaties on landmines and cluster munitions, bringing a stigma to their stockpiling and use, and thereby a change in behavior even in countries that did not sign up.” They also suggest that military-industrial companies will begin feeling pressure to stop producing nuclear weapons because financial institutions will stop investing in them.

This adds up to an enormous imbalance between war and peace. We can start a nuclear war in five minutes, faster than we can order a pizza. But it took the world 72 years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki to officially declare nukes illegal (for some), and another three years to ratify that declaration, followed by a hope that this is the beginning of stigmatizing nukes sufficiently so that someday the nuclear powers will surrender their weapons voluntarily, or at least stop developing new ones.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has declared this treaty “dangerous” and has urged signatories to withdraw their support. I note also that the U.S. president is famous for his fear and hatred of non-white potential immigrants, be they Muslim or Mexican or African, and — speaking of stigmatization — has said that a lot of them are from “shithole countries.” And he has no problem with putting them, or at least their children, in cages.

Think of it! The guy who could start a nuclear war has, in his own mind, already dehumanized a huge percentage of the world’s population. Doing so makes it so much easier to kill them when necessary.

Creating peace requires an enormous growing up, politically and every other way. Those who are committed to peace and global equality are forced to work for it in a world that is seriously prejudiced in favor of war. The path to war is easy and smooth, and nuclear war is easiest of all. The level of spiritual growing up necessary to embrace nuclear disarmament is perhaps best exemplified by South Africa, which played a crucial role in the passage of the U.N. Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.

South Africa is also the only country on the planet that gave up its nuclear weapons after being in full control of them. When did this happen? Around the same time that it transitioned from an apartheid government to one of racial equality.

Is there a lesson to be learned here?","Here’s a piece of paradoxical news that puts even the looming U.S. presidential election in perspective: Nuclear weapons are now (or soon will be) .

***

Raisa Wickrematunge: Hi everyone and welcome to Southasiasphere, a monthly roundup of news events in the region, now a podcast. I’m Raisa, and I’m joined by my colleagues Amita and Shubhanga.

Shubhanga Pandey: Hello.

Amita Arudpragasam: Hi Raisa

RW: So the big stories that we are going to be talking about this month are the 20th Amendment and the process of constitutional reform in Sri Lanka, the Bhutan-Bangladesh Free Trade Agreement and the status of peace talks in Afghanistan.

AA: So let’s start with Sri Lanka and the 20th Amendment then!

On the 22nd of September 2020, Sri Lanka’s Justice Minister tabled the 20th Amendment to the Constitution in parliament. The proposed bill, if passed in this form, will be detrimental to Sri Lanka’s constitutional democracy. Perhaps the most significant change that will be introduced by the 20th Amendment is the change in the composition and importance of the Constitutional Council. Under the 19th Amendment, the Constitutional Council recommended individuals for appointment to independent commissions. These included the Election Commission, the Human Rights Commission and the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. It also approved the names of individuals recommended to the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal, and for the posts of Attorney General, Auditor General and Inspector General of Police. The diverse members of the council helped ensure that there was some accountability for appointments made to these positions. But under the 20th Amendment, the Constitutional Council will be replaced by a Parliamentary Council that will be less diverse: So it’s composed entirely of elected representatives as opposed to a mix of non-elected and elected representatives and it will also have less influence over the appointment process.

Under the proposed 20th Amendment, the executive is mandated only to seek the council’s observations and the Parliamentary Council will not even have the power to approve recommended names. Apart from the changes it makes to the Constitutional Council, the 20th Amendment also proposes the repeal of the Audit Service Commission and the National Procurement Commission. It removes the ability for citizens to challenge the executive actions of the President through fundamental rights applications and the president now has the option to pass so called ‘urgent’ bills, except those that amend the Constitution.

RW: And for those who are interested in reading more about the topic and the history around this, we recently published an article by law academic, Dinesha Samararatne on this.

AA: That’s right Raisa, and what I really like about Dinesha’s piece is that it situates the proposed 20th Amendment in the context of other constitutional amendments in Sri Lanka like the 17th, 18th and 19th Amendments. She makes a pretty strong argument for why Sri Lankans must reclaim representative democracy from political parties to prevent what she calls ‘constitutional ping-pong’. Now of course all these reforms to centralize power such as the 20th Amendment also occur during Covid 19 when the government has much more lee-way than usual among the public to increase militarization. And the government does continue to increase the presence of state intelligence to, to monitor civilians and businesses. We recently heard, for example, that university students will be subject to increased surveillance to curtail ragging and that intelligence assistance is also being sought to investigate tea-factory owners suspected of adulterating tea with ingredients like sugar and sodium bicarbonate.

SP: Right, so the other big story in Southasia last month was the beginning of intra-Afghan peace talks. So on September 12th, the representatives of the Taliban and the Afghan government finally met after months of delay in the planned talks in Doha. Now these are basically talks about future power sharing arrangements and to also look at possible ceasefires in the future. But these have just begun and at this stage the meetings are actually to set conditions and procedures for the future ones.

Now these talks should also be looked at in the context of an earlier deal between the US and the Taliban, from February 2020, which basically said that the US and NATO had to withdraw all their armed forces from the country by May 2021, while the Taliban had to prevent Al-Qaeda operations in territories they control but also start pursuing peace talks with the Afghan government. Now the big issue with that deal was that it completely left out the Afghan government, and also involved kind of prisoner swaps between the Taliban and the Afghan state. So it was actually seriously objected to by President Ghani.

In the months since then there have been intermittent periods of low violence and the patterns of violence has changed. But actually if you look at the numbers, the overall level of violence this year is pretty much the same as 2019. It’s just that the US forces are out of combat. And so it’s state forces and the Taliban. But with the peace talks there’s great hopes for potential ceasefires, so that would significantly change the political landscape of the country.

AA: So Shubhanga what do you think are some likely stumbling blocks in these talks?

SP: So, one of the things that is of concern is that there seems to be for example some tensions within the Afghan state’s side of the negotiation party. For example, the chief negotiator from the Afghan government is Abdullah Abdullah, who actually lost the elections to the current president, but had a long extended period where he refused to accept the results. And there was actually another deal between the current president and him. So he leads the negotiations and there’s already some power play within that. And they’re also looking ahead to a future, kind of post-peace-talk government which would involve actors from Taliban as well as the current government forces. So you know they are already looking at that arrangement in the future so there’s going to be some scramble for power in that way.

The other major issue could be the fact that the Taliban representatives have tried to frame this current talks as a result of the February US-Taliban talks. So they want that to be the main agreement and this to be the one that flowed out of that. Obviously, they are doing it seeing that it gives them greater credibility as a force, and the Afghan government side is not too keen on that. In addition to that there is also going to be I think serious disagreement on what the nature of the Afghan state and administrative apparatus will be like. So for example, the Taliban in particular are very keen on introducing religious elements in law, administration, public policy, so that could be another serious issue.

While all of this is happening a lot of commentators have also noted the international dimensions of this, also because the talks happened with the presence of representatives from the US government, Pakistan, Qatar, India and the United Nations. Not all of them were physically there, some of them joined virtually, but the fact that this involvement shows a greater geo-political workings has been talked about. But I feel that kind of conversation has also left out the other big international dimension of what’s happened in Afghanistan in over the last several years which is the impact of foreign aid.

There’s this report from May this year in the Afghan Analysts Network which looks at you know what the impact of foreign aid has been in Afghan economy and also in Afghanistan’s democracy. So for example the country has seen greater inequality in last several years. The argument is that the flow of foreign aid is also converting Afghanistan into a rentier state, because a lot of, more than 40 percent of the state’s GDP comes directly from aid. It increases the state patron-client relationship, there’s a loss of democratic accountability. So it’s an interesting argument on why and how foreign aid has actually been not so beneficial for Afghanistan and I think it’s a conversation worth having I think.

RW: Thanks Shubhanga for that. And the other kind of big story that we want to talk about is actually about a Free Trade Agreement between Bangladesh and Bhutan. Now there’s been a lot of clichés kind of bandied around saying that there’s not a lot of intra regional trade in the Southasian region, but there are these kind of agreements that are still taking place. So more than a hundred Bangladeshi origin goods will come under the PTA which is going to be hopefully signed within the next month and Bangladesh is going to allow duty free import of around 34 Bhutanese goods. Now a lot of Bangladeshi media reported that this was the first Free Trade Agreement between the two countries but actually Bangladesh did concede obligation free access to around 18 items from Bhutan in 1980. Bangladesh is actually Bhutan’s second largest trading partner – behind India, of course – and is a significant importer of mandarins, apples, boulders, pebbles and gravel. The two way trade between Bangladesh and Bhutan was 57.9 million dollars in the fiscal year between 2018 and 2019.

Over the years the two countries have spoken about, and in some instances made commitments to enhancing their strategic development partnership in several different areas. And these have included hydropower, transport and more recently free trade. There are also these more informal agreements between the two countries. So one is that Bangladesh is actually one of the preferred destinations for higher studies among Bhutanese students, especially those who are pursuing courses in health and medical science. Bangladesh also assists Bhutan in the field of medical education through the provision of annual scholarships. In fact the current Bhutanese Prime Minister is a medical professional trained in Bangladesh. Bhutan’s tourism and hospitality sector has also benefited from the rise of tourists from Bangladesh. So according to Bhutan’s tourism data, the number of Bangladeshi tourists was around 10,450 in 2018. Of course Bhutan’s recent sustainable development fee, which is going to be imposed on tourists from Bangladesh, India and the Maldives could have an adverse impact on the number of travelers who are coming from Bangladesh into the country.

SP: Raisa, since you’re also talking about trade, there was some news about Bhutan lifting the ban on cigarettes, I think, earlier last month. What was that news about?

RW: Yeah that’s right, so actually in August, Bhutan made this decision to temporarily reverse a ban on the sale of tobacco due to COVID-19. So the country actually first banned the sale, manufacture and distribution of tobacco in 2010, but they did allow smokers to import controlled amounts of tobacco products after paying, you know, hefty duties and taxes, and of course what that resulted in was a thriving black market for cigarettes, which was often smuggled over the border from India. And when Bhutan closed its frontier with India earlier this year because of the pandemic, these under the counter tobacco prices soared as much as four-fold, because traffickers found it much harder to get into the country. So as a result, the Prime Minister actually made the unusual decision that the government would make alcohol and tobacco products available to those who need it. And he justified this as saying that [for] those who are used to drinking every day, nothing could substitute the craving for alcohol, he said, and so that’s why he said they were planning to distribute and supply alcohol to those who needed it, as well as tobacco.

Bhutan actually also lifted a ban on the import of furniture and alcohol from India in 2014, so the drinking of alcohol is – there’s not so much of a stigma around it – but given that this lifting happened during a pandemic, it made a lot of news.

AA: A smaller story that is worth mentioning is the rise of COVID cases in Myanmar. Strict stay-at-home orders were issued in the Yangon region as the number of cases continued to rise. As of the 28th of September, which is today as we’re recording this podcast, there were 10,734 cases with 226 deaths. But despite the Yangon lockdown and the reporting of COVID-19 cases around the country, the Union Elections Commission says it’s going to be sticking with November 8th for the General Election. There are growing public calls for a delay due to COVID-19 because many parties have argued that it’s just not safe to campaign.

Also in the news in Myanmar, on the 16th of September the Tatmadaw promised to take action against three of its members who admitted to a gang rape in Ugar village, in the Rathedaung township. The servicemen had initially denied the allegations, leading the Tatmadaw to conclude that the victim’s testimony was fabricated. But during a more recent investigation one of the soldiers actually confessed and the Tatmadaw’s Public Relations Unit has now announced that the military has formed a court martial. The UN’s fact-finding mission in Myanmar described sexual violence “a hallmark of the Tatmadaw’s military operations”, so this is not a rare incident.

RW: Yeah, and similar to what happened in Myanmar, there’s also been one single case which has kind of brought renewed focus to the issue of sexual violence in Pakistan. On the 9th of September, a woman, who was raped by two men in their 30s when her car broke down on the motorway leading out of Lahore, faced judgment from a senior police official who questioned why she had not taken a busy road or checked her fuel before leaving. Now, this is not a new phenomenon. Victims of sexual violence in Pakistan and indeed the region often find their own virtue on trial, with very few cases being prosecuted successfully. This also wasn’t the only case of violence against women that made the news in Pakistan. There was a journalist who was shot dead in Balochistan recently in an apparent honour killing and there was a minor who was raped and murdered in Karachi. But the police official’s comments received angry pushback online and protest demanding for institutional reform, which pressured him to apologise. So the motorway incident did lead to renewed focus on the topic of violence against women in Pakistan, with women continuing to be vocal especially on social media and challenging the social norms that keep women’s freedom severely restricted there.

The case actually led Prime Minister Imran Khan to say that he advocated public hanging for rapists, expressing regret that it would not be internationally accepted as the GSP plus concessions Pakistan received would be affected. He also advocated for chemical castration as a solution, but critics have pointed out that this discourse not only distracts from the wider issue of sexual violence in Pakistan, it also notes that even though there are these laws which prohibit sexual violence there has been weak implementation and flawed accountability.

And those of you who are interested in this topic, we are actually sending out a newsletter for a product that we’re working on right now, a book list which looks at the topic of sexual violence in Southasia, so a few of you may be receiving that.

SP: Now onto India. One of the major stories in India in the last few weeks has been the passage of what’s been called Farm Bills. So a set of three legislations that basically, the government says, will liberalise the agricultural markets. And so these new laws have basically resulted in a lot of opposition and protest from the farmers, but also the opposition parties. In fact, one of the coalition partners of the BJP, Shiromani Akali Dal, which is also a political party in Punjab, has actually left the government.

So basically the topic has been controversial for you know two different reasons. One is that it was passed in the Parliament using voice votes, even though it was quite a controversial bill and usually voice votes are used when it’s either very clear that the law will pass with overwhelming support, or if there’s a consensus. But that was not the case. So that’s one reason why it’s getting a lot of criticism.

The other is actually in the details of these bills. So like i mentioned, the broad aim, the government says, is to liberalise the agricultural markets. And basically in India what you have is that the farmers generally don’t sell it directly to the buyers. There’s a state-regulated market where you know they take their produce, the state sets what’s called a minimum support price (MSP) and that kind of informs the decisions that buyers and sellers make. So what the government has said is that farmers don’t have to do that. So it basically creates a parallel market which is kind of unregulated, and critics have basically said that this is just one step further in ending the minimum support price (MSP) regime.

But there are also concerns about the fact that these new laws allow private hoarding of produce, for example. And based on experience in Bihar, where a system like this is already in place, and where government-run markets have been abolished for some time now, what you’ve seen is that farmers ended up receiving much lower prices. So the critics say that while these state-regulated markets are not perfect institutions that they do function as safety cushions.

RW: Speaking of safety, making the news in Southasia also has been heavy rain and floods. Some of the regions that have been affected include Karnataka, Kathmandu and Pakistan in several areas. Kathmandu actually was affected by landslides with 11 people killed and Pakistan actually saw over 2 million people affected in Sindh and the Northern province also badly affected with landslides and road blockages.

So that’s it from us for our regional roundup. Thank you for listening and do check out our website as well. I just want to give a quick shoutout to Gihan de Chickera who’s doing great cartoons illustrating some of these stories – so if you actually go to our website you’ll be able to see those. And do watch this space for more updates on the Southasian region.

Thanks everyone!

The 2nd of October, 2020, marks the 151st anniversary of Gandhi’s birth and the start of a life of struggle in the fight for Indian independence from British colonial rule.

It’s an occasion being marked all over the world, particularly in India. But who was Gandhi and how did he end up championing Indian independence? Here’s a brief timeline of his life.

Legal leanings

He was born in 1869 in the princely state of Porbandar, in modern-day Gujarat, where his father served as a government official. At the age of just 18, Gandhi sailed for London to study law, where he eventually passed the bar exam and qualified as a barrister.

But any hopes he may have had of a glorious legal career soon began to crumble. After losing his first case back home in India, he left India again, this time for South Africa. It was there he became so nervous advocating on behalf of a client in court that he couldn’t speak properly. He ended up reimbursing his client and fleeing the court.

But it was another incident in South Africa that set Gandhi on a new path. While travelling first class on a train, he was ejected from his carriage after a white passenger complained. The experience would help to solidify some of the ideas he had already started to form around equality for all people. It may be worthwhile to revisit Gandhi’s famous life-defining moment on that train journey in 1893 from Durban to Pretoria. Gandhi was forcibly evicted from the first-class compartment because he was a “coloured” man. The bitter cold night that Gandhi spent on a lonely railway station in a strange country could have become a life-long trauma. As he shivered through the night in the station’s waiting room, Gandhi did consider running back home to Rajkot. But eventually, he began to think of his duty. The real culprit, Gandhi realised, was not that particular man who had him thrown off the train. That man’s behaviour was merely “a symptom of the deep disease of colour prejudice”. Therefore, resentment towards his offender was a waste of time and energy. By contrast, trying “…if possible, to root out the disease and suffer hardships in the process” seemed truly worthwhile. Gandhi, later, described the incident at the railway station as a “creative experience” that changed the course of his life. He said: “My active nonviolence began from that date.” This sequence of action and reaction illustrates powerful and universal truths.

A tax on your roots

Indian immigrants in South Africa were subject to punitive laws and restrictions on freedoms. There was even a tax levied on them simply because they were Indian immigrants. Gandhi set about tackling segregation and founded the Indian Congress in the Natal region of South Africa. This was also the point at which he began dressing in the traditional white Indian dhoti, which became his trademark attire.

His first target was the £3 ($3.69) tax on people of Indian origin. Preaching a strategy of Satyagraha, or nonviolent protest, Gandhi organized a strike and led a march of more than 2,000 people to call for the tax to be scrapped. He was arrested and sent to prison for nine months. But his actions brought about the end of the tax and catapulted him to international attention.

Back in India, in 1915, Gandhi founded an ashram, or spiritual monastery, open to all castes of people. He wore just a simple loincloth and shawl, and dedicated himself to prayer and fasting.

In 1919, when the British implemented laws that allowed for the arrest and imprisonment of anyone suspected of sedition, Gandhi rose up calling for a wave of nonviolent disobedience. Tragedy followed.

A massacre and a wave of boycotts

In the city of Amritsar, British Indian Army soldiers were ordered to open fire on a crowd of 20,000 or so protestors that had begun to grow unruly. Around 400 people were killed, with more than 1,000 injured. From that point on, Gandhi’s goal was clear – Indian independence. He soon became a leading figure in the home-rule movement.

The movement called for mass boycotts of British goods and institutions. Gandhi implored civil servants to stop working for the British, for students to quit government schools, for soldiers to abandon their posts and for the citizenry to withhold their taxes and avoid buying British goods.

In 1922, he was arrested by the British authorities and pleaded guilty to three counts of sedition, which resulted in a six-year prison sentence, although that was commuted after just two years.

Britain’s strong grip on India was also evident in the Salt Act, which made it illegal for Indians to collect, produce or sell salt. Official sales of salt were also subject to tax. It was legislation that hit the poorest hardest. And so, in 1930, Gandhi took on the Salt Act. The most well-known part of his campaign was the 390 kilometre Salt March to the shores of the Arabian Sea, where he collected salt in symbolic and open defiance of the government monopoly.

He wrote to the British viceroy, Lord Irwin, saying: “My ambition is no less than to convert the British people through non-violence and thus make them see the wrong they have done to India.”

The Salt Act protests gathered momentum and around 60,000 were imprisoned, including Gandhi.

Time magazine named him Man of the Year in 1930.

Real change

The following year, Gandhi was invited to London on behalf of the Indian National Congress. He met King George V, and visited mill workers in Lancashire, gaining publicity and sympathy for his cause in the UK. But there was little in the way of progress and relations with Britain remained strained.

At the height of World War II, Gandhi stepped up his Quit India campaign, urging the British to get out of the country altogether, while arguing that the war was none of India’s concern. Once again, he was arrested and jailed - this time along with fellow leaders of the Indian National Congress and his wife.

A change of government in Britain after the end of the war saw more willingness to discuss independence for India. But the negotiations that followed led to the partition of the country into India and Pakistan. On August 15, 1947, India gained its independence, Pakistan was born and millions of people were displaced and relocated, leading to waves of violence and killings.

The following year, on 30 January, 1948, Gandhi was shot three times and killed by a Hindu extremist. Gandhi’s dedication to nonviolent, anti-colonial protest has made him an inspirational figure for millions of people to this day.

International Day of Non-Violence

The International Day of Non-Violence is observed on 2 October, the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, leader of the Indian independence movement and pioneer of the philosophy and strategy of non-violence. According to General Assembly resolution A/RES/61/271 of 15 June 2007, which established the commemoration, the International Day is an occasion to “disseminate the message of non-violence, including through education and public awareness”. The resolution reaffirms “the universal relevance of the principle of non-violence” and the desire “to secure a culture of peace, tolerance, understanding and non-violence”.

Introducing the resolution in the General Assembly on behalf of 140 co-sponsors, India’s Minister of State for External Affairs, Anand Sharma, said that the wide and diverse sponsorship of the resolution was a reflection of the universal respect for Mahatma Gandhi and of the enduring relevance of his philosophy. Quoting the late leader’s own words, he said: “Non-violence is the greatest force at the disposal of mankind. It is mightier than the mightiest weapon of destruction devised by the ingenuity of man”.

Gandhi, who helped lead India to independence, has been the inspiration for non-violent movements for civil rights and social change across the world. Throughout his life, Gandhi remained committed to his belief in non-violence even under oppressive conditions and in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges.

The theory behind his actions, which included encouraging massive civil disobedience to British law as with the historic Salt March of 1930, was that “just means lead to just ends”; that is, it is irrational to try to use violence to achieve a peaceful society. He believed that Indians must not use violence or hatred in their fight for freedom from colonialism.

The principle of non-violence - also known as non-violent resistance - rejects the use of physical violence in order to achieve social or political change. Often described as “the politics of ordinary people”, this form of social struggle has been adopted by mass populations all over the world in campaigns for social justice.

Professor Gene Sharp, a leading scholar on non-violent resistance, uses the following definition in his publication, The Politics of Nonviolent Action:

“Nonviolent action is a technique by which people who reject passivity and submission, and who see struggle as essential, can wage their conflict without violence. Nonviolent action is not an attempt to avoid or ignore conflict. It is one response to the problem of how to act effectively in politics, especially how to wield powers effectively.”

While non-violence is frequently used as a synonym for pacifism, since the mid-twentieth century the term non-violence has been adopted by many movements for social change which do not focus on opposition to war. (WEF, UN)","But who was Gandhi and how did he end up championing Indian independence?

In a speech at Freedom Square (formerly Green Square), south of the airport, the President of the Sovereignty Council, Lt Gen Abdelfattah El Burhan, announced that an official ceremony will be organised to honour the leadership of South Sudan, the negotiating delegation of the government, and the leaders of the rebel movements.

He apologised to the people of Sudan for the severe bread and fuel shortages the country is suffering from, declaring that the Sovereign Council and the Council of Ministers are responsible for the negligence.

He praised the Sudanese people for their patience and promised to change the situation for the better.

SRF-MM joint delegation

In a press statement yesterday, the Sudan Liberation Movement faction headed by Minni Minawi announced the formation of a SRF-MM joint delegation chaired by El Tom Hajo.

The Sudan Liberation Movement split-off faction under the leadership of Ahmed Ibrahim 'Kazaski' (SLM-AK), the Democratic Unionist-Revolutionary Wing led by El Tom Hajo, the Northern Entity headed by Mohamed El Jakoumi, and the Third Front joined the SRF-MM in Juba.

They will establish offices in Sudan and prepare a SRF-MM conference to be held within three months, along with carrying out their responsibilities as part of the peace agreement.

That morning, the SLM-AK signed the Juba Peace Agreement. The faction's vice president, Ali Hamed, signed the document in the presence of the South Sudanese mediation team, a representative of the Arab League, and the negotiating parties from the government and the Sudan Revolutionary Front rebel alliance. Kazaski was in France because of an emergency.

The group sought to join the negotiations a year ago and its leaders have remained in Juba until the document was signed yesterday, Hamed said in his press statement.

'Solid foundation'

Yasir Arman, Vice President of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North under the leadership of Malik Agar (SPLM-N Agar) in Blue Nile state, announced that SRF* leaders will arrive in Khartoum on November 3.

During his address at Freedom Square, Arman said representatives for the leaders of the armed movements returned today as a symbolic gesture of the SRF rebel movements joining the ranks of the Sudanese people.

The delegation will be responsible for implementing the terms of the agreement, according to El Tom Hajo, deputy head of the SRF. He said that the priority of the next phase is providing a safe economic situation in Sudan.

Lt Gen Mohamed Hamdan 'Hemeti', Vice President of the Sovereign Council, Commander of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, and head of the government negotiation team, asserted that the agreement will be a solid foundation for comprehensive peace, adding: ""We must exit from the cycle of war in order to reach development, through the fair distribution of power and wealth.""

Rebel holdouts

He stated that the Juba Peace Agreement does not exclude any party but rather is in the interest of every Sudanese person. ""We have failed to manage our diversity in the past, but we have learned from this lesson"".

On the same day, Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok renewed his call for the Sudan Liberation Movement led by Abdelwahid El Nur (SLM-AW**) and Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North led by Abdulaziz El Hilu (SPLM-N El Hilu***) to join the peace process.

He said that the country has been under ""the grip of tyranny"" for so long that facts were falsified and real information about the tragedies that occurred because of the war are absent. ""Now that peace has been achieved, we must follow the spirit of solidarity and support.""

Finance Minister Heba Mohamed said that this amount will be saved over the next ten years in a press statement yesterday.

Implementing peace is a joint responsibility and has political, security, social and economic aspects, according to the minister, who said Sudan must ""work together to fulfil them"".

The role of the Ministry of Finance is mobilising resources and providing the budget for implementation of the peace agreement. Resources will be drawn from the general budget, regional and international institutions, friends and partners of Sudan, and the UN Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS).

The investment environment must also be improved across the country, in order to attract the private sector to the least developed regions.

Achieving a just and sustainable peace is one of the Ministry of Finance's seven priorities, she said. ""The main drivers of the conflict in Sudan are the systemic economic and development marginalisation, especially in the countryside, and the failure to distribute the country's wealth in a fair way. This has pushed the people of the country to take up arms in Darfur, the Nuba Mountains, Blue Nile state, eastern Sudan, and, before it became independent, South Sudan.""

On the wealth-sharing protocol, the Ministry of Finance will ensure that economic policies fall in line with the ""spirit of the peace agreement"". This includes balancing national and state revenues and diversifying their sources, establishing development funds, improving natural resource management, ensuring the national character of development projects, grants and loans, and updating reconstruction and development studies to achieve positive discrimination in the less developed regions.

Peace agreement

The government and most armed movements in Sudan signed the peace agreement on Saturday. All major armed movements in Sudan are involved in the peace agreement, except Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North led by Abdulaziz El Hilu (SPLM-N El Hilu*) in South Kordofan and parts of Blue Nile state and the mainstream Sudan Liberation Movement under the leadership of Abdelwahid El Nur (SLM-AW**).

The signing ceremony was witnessed by a number of heads of state and governments, and representatives of the African Union and the United Nations.

The head of the mediation committee, Tut Galuak, said in a press conference yesterday that ""the mediation will continue to ensure the unsigned movements join,"" referring to SPLM-N El Hilu and SLM-AW.

In Khartoum, the Communist Party of Sudan launched a fierce attack on the Juba Peace Agreement, calling it a real threat to the unity and future of Sudan, noting that there are movements that did not join the peace platform.

137,https://allafrica.com/stories/202010230246.html,"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",AllAfrica.com,Liberia: Dr. Moniba - A Statesman of Peace And Diplomacy,"opinion

Living by farming, palm cutting and setting animal traps, Harry Fumba Moniba had humble beginnings. Born on October 22, 1937, he grew up in a poor family with limited means, much like millions of Liberians today. During his younger years growing up in Lofa, he had one pair of black pants that he would wash in the creek, and wait until it dried to wear for the walk back to his village.

This was one of the earlier stories of a man who went on to achieve the country's highest mark on a USAID administered examination and obtained several academic degrees. He was later known as Dr. Harry Moniba, having earned his undergraduate degree from Cuttington University of Liberia, and two others from the United States, (i) a Master's from New York University, and (ii) a Doctorate in International Relations and African Studies from Michigan State University. Soon after fulfilling his studies, Dr. Moniba became an Assistant Minister and continued his public service path as Liberia's Ambassador to the United Kingdom, and finally, as the Vice President of our Republic of Liberia (1984-1990).

A strong advocate for peace and diplomacy, he was known for his ability to intellectually disarm adversity and conflict. Captured by rebel forces in 1985, the attempted coup d'etat placed Dr. Moniba at gunpoint to announce his and the government's resignation at the ELBC studio. Instead, he gave a speech that was heard by the entire nation, where he stated, ""this country is too small a nation to fight"", while imploring Liberians to never resort to violence to settle their differences and disputes.

During the full outbreak of the civil war, his stance for non-violence continued after the death of President Doe. When asked to continue to fight for state power, Dr. Moniba publicly responded, ""if one single Liberian has to die for me to become President, then I do not want to be."" In a time of great uncertainty, he repeated this powerful message at international conferences and subsequently on international radio. This was further evidenced when Dr. Moniba accepted the results of an interim president during the peace talks which were held in Banjul, Gambia in November 1990. Despite being next in line to assume the position of president and having thousands of soldiers pledged loyalty to defend his constitutional right, he again stated to the military leadership, ""if one of your men have to die for me to sit in the mansion, it is not worth it"".

Ahead of the 2005 Presidential election, he was considered the preferred candidate by many influential figures in the international community and at home. Unfortunately, during one of his visits to the United States, he was met with a tragic car accident that caused his untimely death at the age of 67. The United States flag was flown at half-mast over the US Capitol, making him the only Liberian to have received such an honor in recent history. Dr. Moniba was afforded two funerals, one in the United States, attended by numerous US Government officials, and another in Liberia, which was one of the largest state funerals in Liberian history.

In one of his final published writings, Dr. Moniba stated, ""there is a dire need for every Liberian to have a new vision of a Liberia based on social justice, respect for human rights and rule of law... what happened to us during the civil war should be a lesson for everyone to learn from in our arduous task for national reconstruction, democracy and reconciliation"".

In memory of a true statesman of peace and diplomacy, he is remembered for his intellectual capacity, strong stance against corruption and violence, deep loyalty and love for his people and country.

This year speakers at the Security Council Open Debate on Women, Peace and Security emphasized the need to ensure concerted efforts and far greater implementation of the women and peace and security agenda. The Open Debate also echoed the need to protect women human rights defenders, to marshal the international community to protect the shrinking civic space within which women are operating.

Today, 45 percent of UN Member States and observers have National Action Plans (NAPs) on UNSCR 1325. Of the 84 adopted by December 2019, only 28 include an allocated budget for implementation.

According to the UN Secretary-General’s report on women and peace and security, the number of women in peace processes still remains disappointingly low.

The UN-World Bank Pathways to Peace report notes that investment in prevention will pay off, every US$1 invested today saves US$16 down the road. Yet the global military expenditure has seen largest annual increase in a decade. Women peacebuilders and human rights defenders are often subjected to threats and assassination attempts with little recourse to justice, in addition to being left out of decision-making processes.

The year 2020 also marks the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Platform for Action. There is no doubt that some progress has been made in advancing the women, peace, and security agenda, but more needs to be done.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had devastating effects on women and girls. Yet UNDP and UN Women’s newly launched COVID-19 Global Gender Response Tracker shows the social protection and jobs response to the pandemic has largely overlooked women’s needs. Governments are failing to address inequalities within education systems, providing protection to the victims of domestic violence and necessary health care; which are disproportionately impacting women and girls. We must act now to halt the reversal in our hard-won gains.

UNDP is working with the International Civil Society Action Network (ICAN), the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) and UN Women to address challenges on the ground in conflict and post-conflict areas. We have increasing evidence that women leaders at the local level are able to quickly build key “social infrastructure” in crisis settings.

In Lebanon UNDP is working with local women leaders to respond to increased cases of gender-based violence since the onset of COVID-19 through social media campaigns.

UNDP’s global programme on Rule of Law, Justice, Security and Human Rights assistance spans seven key areas: Political Engagement, Institution Building, Community Security, Human Rights, Access to Justice, Transitional Justice, and Gender Justice. The lack of access to justice is a critical area of concern for victims of conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV). UNDP’s work in Darfur, for example, seeks to strengthen governments’ capacities for investigating and prosecuting serious crimes, including CRSV and Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) and focuses on building security and justice infrastructure for marginalized and vulnerable communities.

In the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao located in the southern Philippines, UNDP has been providing technical and operational assistance in the implementation of reformation, reintegration and transformation initiatives . This ‘deradicalization’ programme, covers more than 1,000 returnees who are former members of violent extremist groups. UNDP is also assisting, through the ‘Women’s Rapid Action and Mobilization Platform’, female mediators and grassroots activists, to pioneer peace education and conflict mediation, develop alternative narratives, tackle misinformation, hate, discrimination and the corruption of faith-based learning.

In Kyrgyzstan and Sierra Leone UNDP has joined forces with women parliamentarians and community leaders to advance vital action plans on women, peace and security.

According to a 2019 independent assessment commissioned by UN Women, only 50 percent of the gender-related recommendations from the UN’s peace and security reviews were in place and 10 percent had either gone backwards or were not progressing at all. The UN Secretary-General has called for profound changes in the way we conduct our work on international peace and security, joining forces behind five goals for the next decade; women’s equal and meaningful participation; women’s human rights at the forefront; investment in social infrastructure and services; a gender data revolution; and universal compliance with a minimum of 15 percent of official development assistance to conflict-affected countries dedicated to advancing gender equality.

UNDP remains committed to tackling its multi-dimensional challenges to move the women, peace and security agenda forward, even amidst and especially because of the COVID-19 crisis. In today’s world, it is clear that we must continue to work with our partners to help countries across the globe to put women and girls--their inclusion, representation, rights, and protection--at the centre of all efforts to build forward better, with the SDGs as our compass.","The 20th anniversary of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (UNSCR 1325) on women, peace and security marks an important milestone for the Decade of Action, to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.
This year speakers at the Security Council Open Debate on Women, Peace and Security emphasized the need to ensure concerted efforts and far greater implementation of the women and peace and security agenda.
According to the UN Secretary-General’s report on women and peace and security, the number of women in peace processes still remains disappointingly low.
UNDP’s global programme on Rule of Law, Justice, Security and Human Rights assistance spans seven key areas: Political Engagement, Institution Building, Community Security, Human Rights, Access to Justice, Transitional Justice, and Gender Justice.

About the WHO Health and Peace Initiative



The Health and Peace Initiative aims to position health as an influencer of peace and WHO as a peace actor through health interventions that are conflict-sensitive, context-specific, and which deliver on both WHO's Triple Billion goals and the Sustainable Development Goals (particularly SDG3 on Good Health and Wellbeing, SDG16 on Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions and SDG17 on Partnerships). The Initiative seeks to do this by building a peace lens into WHO's comparative advantage in health in order to create tailored health interventions that deliver health outcomes as well as peace dividends in conflict-affected areas.

141,https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/blog/2020/re-envisioning-climate-action-to-sustain-peace-and-human-securit.html,"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",UNDP,Re-envisioning climate action to sustain peace and human security,"A combination of crisis, conflict, climate change and COVID-19 means that we live in truly unprecedented times. In complex contexts, the message of environmental protection and climate action can often get lost, particularly, as climate change is still most frequently understood of in terms of socio-economic, development, environmental and disaster risks. However, through these very mechanisms, climate change has manifold implications for peace, stability and security. Insecurity and conflict are likewise, an obstacle to climate action. Yet according to OECD/INCAF, in 37 of the 58 fragile contexts, less than 10 percent of Overseas Development Assistance was allocated to climate change adaptation in 2016 and 2017. Moreover, the Zurich Flood Resilience Alliance finds that the majority of countries most vulnerable to climate change, only received less than US$20 per person per year in climate change adaptation financing over the period 2010-2018.

Conflict can also result in the physical destruction of renewable energy, irrigation, and other water-related infrastructure, not to mention other productive capacities. Energy and water infrastructure are strategic assets which are often targeted by non-state armed groups. To punish political opponents the Islamic State seized control of water infrastructure to wilfully cut off and pollute the water supply to farming communities in central and southern Iraq and flood government and military installations, including the city of Abu Ghraib. Its attacks on the energy sector served as attempts to destabilize the government, with a resulting considerable environmental toll.

Environmental-driven resource scarcity has also been an enabling force for recruitment in Somalia which has compounded grievances and marginalization. In the face of drought, internal displacement and chronic food insecurity, Al Shabaab has become an effective alternative service provider, strengthened its legitimacy by doing so and bolstered recruitment. Its illicit activities have been sustained in part, by the illegal charcoal trade which is subject to bans by the Federal Government, since 1969 and the UN Security Council resolution 2036 of 2012. Logging driven by charcoal production has in turn resulted in land degradation and deforestation, increasing vulnerability and pressure on livelihoods and coping strategies, as the preferred hardwood feedstock, acacia bussei, is also depended upon by pastoralists as fodder for their livestock.

UNDP’s new study, with contributions from UNFCCC, examined all 186 first round NDCs, the results highlighting that conflict and insecurity are an obstacle to climate action but that progress towards peace alone is not necessarily conducive to climate action. Post-conflict economic recovery can put greater pressure on natural resources, alter migration and seasonal transhumance patterns, and increase environmental degradation, including deforestation/destruction of carbon sinks. This, in turn, can increase greenhouse gas emissions and negatively impact on coping strategies and resilience, showing that more consideration is needed of the reduction of emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in post-conflict scenarios and to climate-proof peacebuilding.

Building lasting peace in fragile and conflict-affected contexts requires we step up climate action. In this regard, through its Climate Promise, UNDP is supporting 115 countries around the world to raise the ambition of their NDCs. This includes support to 27 fragile states, where we have embedded recovery from COVID-19 as well as a strong gender, and governance focus. While these countries contribute very little to global greenhouse gas emissions, decentralized access to energy in conflict and crisis-affected contexts, that renewables afford, is a lifeline which makes all other support, including clean water, light, warmth, and sustenance, as well as basic and emergency services possible. Choosing renewables and clean technologies in reconstruction efforts strengthens resilience and avoids costlier efforts to retrofit at a later stage. UNDP’s work, including in Afghanistan, Iraq, Mali, Nigeria, Sudan, Syria, Palestine and Yemen, shows that providing support to energy access can help restart livelihoods and local economic development, lock in resilience and set countries out on sustainable development pathways to recover.

At UNDP, we focus, together with our partners, on post-conflict stabilization, including in places such as the Lake Chad Basin and Liptako Gourma region, because with stability comes development. As part of the Climate Security Mechanism, UNDP is bolstering the capacity of regional partners to address climate security and introduce a climate security lens to post-conflict stabilization particularly in regional contexts, because climate-related security risks often manifest externalities which go beyond a simple country office configuration and demand cross-border approaches to address them.

In quick summary, there is a powerful business case to investing in prevention first and addressing climate change has to be part and parcel of this. We need to re-envision climate action in conflict-affected and fragile states as part of an integrated prevention and peacebuilding strategy. This is why UNDP’s workstream on climate security stresses climate proofing prevention and peacebuilding, ensuring peace-positive mitigation and adaptation, and delivering integrated approaches to address two of the most pressing issues of our time: climate action and sustaining peace.","However, through these very mechanisms, climate change has manifold implications for peace, stability and security.

142,https://womensenews.org/2020/11/seeking-gender-justice-and-peace-include-men/,"Sun, 29 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Women's eNews,Seeking Gender Justice and Peace? Include Men,"“Millions of women are living in fear, with long-term consequences for families and communities, and for all our efforts for peace and security, human rights and sustainable development,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres recently said in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Further, as physical and structural violence against women increase globally, it may be hard to make a case for investing in projects targeting men and boys.

But with patriarchal norms standing in the way of women’s empowerment, we must absolutely focus on changing attitudes among men and boys towards gender equality, and crucially, when it comes to pursuing the women, peace and security agenda.

The landmark UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security (WPS), adopted on October 31, 2000, seeks to address the disproportionate impact of conflict on women and girls and to recognize the under-valued role of women in conflict prevention and peace building. Yet 20 years later, implementing this resolution remains profoundly challenging.

One of the major roadblocks has been deeply ingrained gender norms, or traditional ideas about what it means to be a man or a woman, coupled with cultural and political conservatism – giving rise to both gender inequality and conflict in many societies.

For their part, conflict and crises themselves often give rise to more rigid gender norms and stereotypes that men, women, and those of other gender identities are expected to fulfil.

Conservative socio-political norms are deeply embedded in typically male dominated decision-making institutions at national and international levels, as well as within global governance institutions. Women who operate in these spaces struggle to be heard and experience pushback when trying to promote a women’s rights agenda. This has significant implications for the women, peace and security agenda.

The emphasis given to women’s rights within institutions of global governance is dwindling, with many arguing that backsliding on WPS commitments and progress is not just possible, but likely.

The impact of patriarchal gender norms is also evident at the community level. Patriarchal values of male family members can mean that women are actively either discouraged or blocked from accessing women empowerment programs, or have to get permission from their husband or father. Where women do participate, they can face stigma or even violence. Gender norms also often result in men being socially, culturally and politically conditioned to engage in physical violence in both the private and public spheres.

In the Sahel, for example, a strong incentive for men to join extremist groups stems from the notion that a ‘real man’ should protect and provide for his family. As one community member told us: “Anyone who refuses to fight to protect the community shouldn’t be seen as a man: he is a coward.”

Implementing the women, peace and security agenda therefore requires addressing deeply entrenched gender norms across different levels of society, in a way that gives men and women viable alternatives to violence. It also requires addressing community-level norms and expectations that justify the subjugation of women.

And yet, comprehensive engagement with men and boys is still largely missing from the agenda itself. Only two UNSC resolutions explicitly mention men and boys (one notes that men and boys can be enlisted as partners in the prevention of sexual and gender-based violence, while also recognising that men and boys can also be victims, while the other reiterates the importance of engaging men and boys in promoting women’s participation in conflict prevention and peacebuilding).

Thankfully, plenty of evidence does exist on why engaging with masculinities is good for women, peace and security. Peace activists have been working with men for many years, particularly in highly patriarchal and conservative societies.

In Afghanistan, women peacebuilding organizations have not only been working with male champions but also with conservative mullahs, which has led to the acceptance of these programmes in local communities, and therefore made it easier for women to participate.

In Tajikistan, the Zindagii Shoista (‘Living with dignity’) project by International Alert and local partners aims to protect at-risk women from the possibility of violence, by bringing the whole family together, including in-laws, to resolve conflicts and improve the role and lives of the wives and daughters within the family. Moreover, by fostering an idea of financial independence, Tajik women are now seen as valued members of society, in turn helping individual men within the family context, and communities at large, to change their attitudes towards violence against women and girls.

In the Great Lakes region of Africa, involving men in positive masculinities projects has also improved relations between men and women, at home and in the public sphere. In a project seeking to improve conditions for women cross-border traders and therefore fostering more peace in this region, the involvement of men (officials, border guards, husbands) has been crucial. Changes in attitudes of spouses regarding their wives being the primary bread winners improved the situation of women both at home and in society. “Before the project I had a bad perception of my wife and her business. I now understand that she works hard for our benefit. I am proud of my wife,” said Philippe, a farmer, who took part in the project.

Without minimizing the role of men in conflict and violence perpetration, men should be seen as agents of positive change. Support for gender equality and women’s agency in conflict should reach out specifically to a range of integral allies and resistors alike, including men and boys.

In doing so, agencies must be careful to ensure this does not divert hard-won support and money from women organizations working tirelessly on gender equality, or reinforce the unequal power of men and boys in already deeply patriarchal societies.

Simply put, if we don’t change men’s attitudes, then peacebuilding and gender equality cannot succeed. We must work together – NGOs, governments, policymakers and donors – to achieve this.

143,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/building-sustaining-and-strengthening-peace-through-the-united-nations,"Tue, 03 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",GOV.UK,"Building, sustaining and strengthening peace through the United Nations","Mr. President, thank you and good afternoon to everyone from London. You are a dear friend of the United Kingdom and thank you for convening this debate today.

It is indeed timely ahead of our adoption vote in this Council, and indeed in the UN General Assembly of the critical twin resolutions on peacebuilding and sustaining peace – texts, that St Vincent and the Grenadines have so expertly shepherded.

I also, right from the beginning, wish to thank our three briefers, Ibrahim Miyaki, Sir Hilary Beckles and His Excellency Munir Akram. And of course, it’s always very heartening to have the expert insights of the Deputy Secretary-General, my dear friend, Amina Mohammed, who set the scene so excellency with this update.

As the United Kingdom’s minister for the United Nations and the Commonwealth, I’m deeply grateful for your country’s close partnership with ourselves, especially in these global institutions.

Mr President, whilst power politics, aggression and oppression remain very real factors behind many of today’s conflicts we are increasingly aware of new and emerging threats to our peace. One of the contemporary drivers of conflicts is exclusion: exclusion of vulnerable communities, exclusion of religious minorities, exclusion of women from civil, political, economic and social processes, exclusion that leads directly to poverty, desperation, violence and extremism. And it takes no great leap to understand how the strains placed on societies grappling with public health emergencies or the impact of climate change can exacerbate these threats.

2020 is certainly testament to that very fact. They make violent conflict more likely and threaten to roll back hard-won development and peace gains - especially, but not only, in the poorest countries and those already affected by insecurity and conflict. The sustaining peace agenda has brought home to all of us the importance of understanding, how peace, security and sustainable development are not independent, they’re interconnected. Based on this agenda, we have begun to refine our collective approach, building and sustaining peace. And, Mr. President, if I may, I just wanted to make three very brief points.

Firstly, tackling the impact of climate change is critical alongside broader efforts to sustain peace. Secondly, good governance and inclusion are fundamental. And thirdly, we must coordinate our collective efforts to build effective partnerships in order to prevent conflict in the first place.

On my first point, Mr President, climate change is creating structural conditions that multiply conflict risks in countries around the world. The erosion of fertile land is increasing food scarcity and intercommunal tensions. In small island developing states, hurricanes and rising sea levels threaten whole communities and some country’s very existence. I saw this myself as Minister for the British Overseas Territories and our relationship with the Caribbean. We must address the manmade causes of climate change, and the upcoming COP26 in Glasgow in the United Kingdom next year, I believe, presents a great opportunity for all of us to agree collective and real, concerted action.

To my second point, I’ve already referenced the problem of exclusion as a key driver of conflict. Even advanced economies are susceptible to shocks. Development and peace gains can be undone if large parts of the population are marginalised or human rights are not respected, sustained or indeed strengthened. And let us be absolutely clear: a country that protects the rights of the most vulnerable, the rights of the socially excluded, the rights of minority communities, the rights of women, those are the stronger nations. Those are the progressive nations. It is a sign of strength and the unity of a nation when all rights are equally respected.

Strong and inclusive institutions, respect for human rights, access to services, healthy democracy, the rule of law, and the empowerment of women are all essential to building resilience and building sustainable peace.

And to my third point, Mr. President, better analysis provides for better national and international responses. Coordinated planning among national stakeholders, the UN, and other international partners can focus preventive efforts and ensure they are appropriately resourced. This includes the UN and International Financial Institutions working in a more coordinated manner to support peacebuilding objectives.

In New York, the Peacebuilding Commission has increasingly demonstrated its value as a forum for countries and organisations to come together in pursuit of shared peace and development objectives.

Mr. President, it is these approaches that are paramount to more effective conflict prevention, and they must be owned by each and every one of us.

The Council can, of course, play an important supporting role, but it also has a key obligation. Where threats to international peace and security emerge we cannot simply sit back or stand back. The UN Charter, as we’ve already heard from other contributors, together with international treaties, places obligations on states to respect human rights and international humanitarian law. And it is this Security Council, which has an obligation to call out violations for what they are, threats to fundamental peace and security around the world.

Mr. President, in concluding the need for international cooperation is arguably greater than it has been for a generation. And poignantly, the United Nations in its seventy fifth anniversary year, can celebrate its unique role it’s played in the past in building peace, sustaining peace, in strengthening peace. But most importantly, us, the Security Council, us, the United Nations, which define the United Nation, must look forward to seeing what we can do collectively in building, sustaining and strengthening peace around the world.

144,https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/news-analysis/clashing-interests-geopolitical-rivalries-loopholes-in-libya-cease-fire-could-derail-peace,"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Daily Sabah,"Clashing interests, geopolitical rivalries, loopholes in Libya cease-fire could derail peace","Libyans at U.N.-led talks agreed to hold national elections in December next year following a cease-fire agreement signed between the rival sides, raising hopes to achieve a lasting political settlement to the decade-old conflict. Yet the road to peace hinges on preventing both internal and external spoilers as well as a strong commitment and removing the shortcomings of the cease-fire text.

“Libyans have been promised elections five times in five years,” Emadeddin Muntasser, a Libyan political analyst and human rights advocate, told Daily Sabah. “The 2015 Skhirat agreement promised elections, the first Paris summit in July 2017 promised elections, the second Paris summit in May 2018 promised elections, the Abu Dhabi summit in March 2019 promised elections, and now the Tunis agreement promises elections,” Muntasser pointed out, saying that at each instance, world leaders including the U.N. secretary-general would hail the agreement and promise support. “However, there has been no attempt to actually hold elections or even prepare for elections.”

Since the civil war in Libya began in 2011 with the ouster and killing of longtime ruler Moammar Ghadafi, there has been no shortage of western proposals to reestablish peace and stability in the country.

After years of chaos and violence, the internationally recognized government in the west and its eastern-based rival consisting of a House of Representatives (HoR) backed by the forces of putschist Gen. Khalifa Haftar, have once again taken steps toward a political solution by engaging in U.N.-led talks in Tunis. Dubbed the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF), the talks aimed at hammering out a deal for a new transitional government for the oil-rich North African country. However, the Libyan people are torn between hopes and doubts as several previous attempts for cease-fires and settlements have failed.

Friday's announcement for national elections to be held on Dec. 24, 2021, came on the fifth day of political talks in Tunisia, involving 75 delegates from existing state bodies and groups from across Libya's political and social spectrum.

Delegates are tasked with appointing a three-member Presidency Council representing Libya's three historical regions and a prime minister to lead a separate Government of National Unity.

The 75 delegates meeting in Tunisia were selected by the U.N., but some Libyans have questioned their legitimacy and criticized the way they were chosen.

Speaking to Daily Sabah, Noamane Cherkaoui, a researcher and political analyst focusing on North Africa geopolitics, said the list for the forum involves “recycled participants from the past many of whom have seen their influence wane over time.”

Cherkaoui stated that some within Libya consider these delegates as non-representative.

Actors seek to protect status quo

“Divisions are increasing, with some members of the HoR and the (Libyan High Council of State) HCS using this opportunity to jockey for influence, particularly due to the vulnerability of their positions if elections are eventually held,” Cherkaoui underlined.

Similarly, acting U.N. envoy Stephanie Williams on Friday in a press conference stated that there is “a large status quo party in Libya.” These are factions and individuals who are seeking to block progress or undermine the process and who are only interested in retaining their current privileges at the expense of the Libyan people, the envoy stressed.

“Elections are a threat to Libyans who have illegally amassed power and wealth in the past few years as well as to war criminals and their state backers,” Muntasser warned, saying that the Tunis agreement offers these players a new transitional period during which they can extend their reach and strengthen their grip on power.

“It will be a fragmented government with many opposing priorities, allegiances and interests,” Muntasser stated while Cherkaoui said that whether a successful outcome will be reached, “considering the interference by illegitimate external forces, the lack of diversified buy-in, the institutional infighting and the conflicting diplomatic tracks,” remains to be seen.

The Tunisia talks are held in parallel with military discussions in the coastal city of Sirte to fill in the details of a cease-fire deal struck in October which made official the halt of fighting since August. Prior to that, Haftar, allied with the HoR, launched an offensive in April 2019 to seize Tripoli from the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) but was repelled with Turkey stepping up its support to the legitimate government after signing a maritime and military deal.

The conflict has cost tens of billions of dollars in lost oil revenue and damaged infrastructure and sharply reduced living standards.

Loopholes

Though hailed a “breakthrough” by the U.N., the recently inked cease-fire lacks specificity in many regards and may lead to different interpretations by the parties to it.

Libya's warring sides agreed in Geneva that foreign military forces and mercenaries are to leave the country.

Crisis Group in a report on Nov. 4 highlighted that the main problem is that neither side officially acknowledges being supported by foreign fighters, which could lead to future backtracking.

It said that on Haftar’s side, an estimated 2,000-3,000 Russian Wagner Group contractors, pro-Damascus Syrian fighters and a second collection of Chadians and Sudanese would have to leave Libya.

U.N. experts similarly confirmed in early May that mercenaries from the Wagner Group, a Russian paramilitary organization said to be close to the Kremlin, are fighting in Libya in support of Haftar, alongside Syrian fighters from Damascus.

The GNA on Thursday indicated it would not accept further talks under the presence of foreign mercenaries and their anti-aircraft systems in Sirte.

“There are many obstacles ahead,” Cherkaoui pointed out, “Notably, the implementation of all contentious issues was given to future subcommittees and expelling all mercenaries, on which it lacks leverage, within three months is an uphill battle.”

He added that convincing armed groups to leave is another element difficult to implement while the constant consolidation of the strategic Sirte-Jufra line, roughly the midpoint of Libya's Mediterranean coastline and a gateway to major oil ports, poses another challenge.

Another item agreed to in the cease-fire was that “all military agreements on training inside Libya shall be suspended and training crews shall depart the country.”

Yet almost a day after the agreement became public, the GNA’s Defense Minister Salaheddin al-Namroush declared that the deal “does not include the military cooperation agreement with the state of Turkey, an ally of the legitimate government,” underlining that the agreements were signed by two legitimate governments.

Turkey on Saturday echoed the Libyan position saying it would keep up consultations with Libya and continue military and security training for Libyan forces.

Furthermore, the Libyan and Qatari defense ministers last week signed a similar cooperation protocol for training and building Libyan military capabilities as well as the exchange of expertise.

Entrenched foreign presence

Foreign mercenaries and arms have poured into Libya especially during Haftar’s 14-month offensive on the capital, undercutting diplomatic efforts.

Turkey and Qatar’s support for the legitimate government has prevented the fall of Tripoli and staved off Haftar’s militia, who enjoy backing from countries including the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt, Russia and France.

“Turkey’s support was critical to tilting the offensive on Tripoli by Haftar’s LAAF in the GNA’s favor, preventing a fait accompli,” Cherkaoui pointed out.

Regarding Haftar’s backers, Cherkaoui stated that each has certain interests in the war-ravaged country.

Saying that Russia operates outside international law by supporting efforts against the U.N.-backed government, he said that Moscow is driven by pragmatism, “coveting preferential access to Libya’s resources, further regional leverage and another naval base to outflank NATO and further solve its traditional strategic impediment of a shortage of warm-water bases.”

Russia has built its strategy on plausible deniability by carrying out actions through the Wagner Group, Cherkaoui said, elaborating that though it supported Haftar in the war for Tripoli, Moscow cooled down its support expressing interest in bringing back the Gadhafi family.

Haftar’s most important supporter through the conflict has been the UAE, which has similarly provided mercenaries and supplied weapons and ammunition to its forces while operating a base in eastern Libya, according to the U.N. and rights groups including the Human Rights Watch (HRW).

“The UAE has allocated considerable financial resources to the destabilization of the GNA in Tripoli,” Cherkaoui said, adding that Abu Dhabi’s stance is also aimed at undercutting Qatar’s position on the conflict.

Indicating that France belongs to the UAE-Egypt axis in backing the warlord, the expert said that Paris has tried to play both sides. “Therefore, France is not being seen as sincere by the internationally recognized government. Ultimately, Paris nurtures a long-term goal of enhancing its presence in the region with an eye on Libya’s extensive energy resources,” Cherkaoui said.

Having a border with Libya, Egypt has initially backed Haftar but backed down from this policy as the situation on the field changed, the expert stated. Egypt in recent weeks has invited key GNA figures to Cairo while hosting talks in the Red Sea resort town of Hurghada in October.

“This is indicative of its desire not to be sidelined,” Cherkaoui said.

Is peace sans justice possible?

With the extensive military, financial and diplomatic backing from foreign powers, Haftar has committed serious war crimes throughout his campaign against the capital.

The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) reported last week that Haftar’s offensive involved a pattern of violence and the use of mines by retreating forces that harmed civilians, which is a war crime when used indiscriminately.

Over 100 bodies have been found, many blindfolded and with their hands tied, in mass graves in Tarhuna, 90 kilometers (56 miles) northeast of the capital Tripoli and which Haftar’s forces used as a base to launch their attack in April 2019.

Though the recent cease-fire addresses military and security measures, the issue of accountability seems to have been swept under the rug.

“Failure to see justice done will only hamper aspirations for a durable peace,” the HRW stated on Oct. 29, stressing that accountability for crimes should follow the cease-fire agreement.

“What the agreement does not provide is a clear commitment and a pathway to accountability for the serious crimes and other abuses perpetuated by the conflict parties with the support of their foreign backers,” the rights group highlighted.

“The current UNSMIL political process is designed to allow these war criminals to become part of the future government of Libya,” Muntasser underlined. “Moreover, the perpetrators of war crimes, assassins, and intelligence officers that served those war criminals and carried out their orders will become part of the new military, security and intelligence apparatus.”

Muntasser elaborated that this penetration of state institutions would weaken the state and allow a dictator to wage a coup from within. “In Libya, war criminals are being rewarded not prosecuted,” he added.

Cherkaoui similarly stated that political processes in recent years have “neglected to offer a viable pathway to accountability.”

Institutions for handling justice and human rights issues should be established, he stated yet pointed to the fact that the U.N.’s recently authorized fact-finding mission, led by the Human Rights Council and called for by Libyan activists for years, suffers from a lack of funding and has seen its mandate of investigating human rights abuses in Libya since 2016 delayed.","“Libyans have been promised elections five times in five years,” Emadeddin Muntasser, a Libyan political analyst and human rights advocate, told Daily Sabah.
Dubbed the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF), the talks aimed at hammering out a deal for a new transitional government for the oil-rich North African country.
Furthermore, the Libyan and Qatari defense ministers last week signed a similar cooperation protocol for training and building Libyan military capabilities as well as the exchange of expertise.
Regarding Haftar’s backers, Cherkaoui stated that each has certain interests in the war-ravaged country.
“In Libya, war criminals are being rewarded not prosecuted,” he added."
145,https://www.theelephant.info/features/2020/11/20/why-bbi-will-not-promote-peace-or-prevent-violence/,"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",The Elephant,PATRICK K. MBUGUA - Why BBI Will Not Promote Peace or Prevent Violence,"President Uhuru Kenyatta has touted the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) report as the panacea for peace that will end political and/or election-related violence in Kenya. Mr. Kenyatta has not given Kenyans his definition or understanding of peace, but his lines of argument affirm his minimalist understanding of peace or what peace studies (PS) call negative peace. Students of peace studies caricature this concept of peace as akin to peace between the proverbial happy slave and the slave master.

Overall, Mr. Kenyatta’s arguments on peace and political violence in Kenya are based on flawed premises, among them a very naïve essentialist view of ethnicity, and a tunnel vision of Kenya’s social divides. But that is a topic for another day. Rather, this commentary aims to assess whether BBI is a panacea for peace and whether it can prevent political and/or election-related violence in the future. I will comment on the BBI process and analyse who perpetrated the past political violence and why, and then evaluate BBI’s response to that political violence. The article will end with a comment on an observed and horrifying pattern of current events that negates BBI’s proclaimed intentions.

Exclusive process

A core dictum in peace studies, which originates from Mahatma Gandhi’s moral philosophy, is the unity of processes and ends. The dictum posits that the process that is used to engender social change should be consistent with the goal. This means that if the end goal is inclusion, then the process for attaining this goal should be inclusive because an exclusive process cannot attain inclusion.

The BBI process fails this test because it started as an exclusive and opaque process driven by two men, President Kenyatta and Mr. Raila Odinga. For example, out of the 14 members and 2 co-chairpersons who comprised the BBI task force, 9 were political affiliates of either Kenyatta or Odinga. Therefore, one can infer that the process was heavily skewed towards the interests of the two men and all the public hearings were just a ploy to rubber-stamp a predetermined outcome. We can discern this predetermined outcome from the BBI report’s proposals on past political violence.

Sections on political violence

While the BBI report’s proponents tout it as the solution to past political and election-related violence, neither the 2020 edition nor the 2019 draft mentions or analyses the causes of that violence. However, there are three sections that relate to the issue: i) The section on Ethnic Antagonism and Competition (pages 4-5); ii) the section on Divisive Elections (pages 9-12); and iii) the section on Kenya National Guide on Combating Impunity (pages 43-45) in Annex A. However, the latter section deals with disobedience of the law and court orders by senior civil servants and rich Kenyans; it does not address the nexus between impunity and political violence. Therefore, I will assess the other two sections.

The report refers to ethnic antagonism and competition as a “major threat to Kenya’s success”. It then proffers two solutions: inclusion of national unity, character, and cohesion in the school curriculum, and criminalisation of hate speech and of use of violence before and after elections.

Further, the report mentions divisive elections, but the section is baffling because it provides a very simplistic, almost sophomoric, comment on past elections in just two paragraphs on pages 9 and 10. It then blames “foreign models” adopted from “the democratic West” for engendering what it terms “Us versus Them” election competition, with “Us” and “Them” being based on ethnicity. It adds that “lack of inclusivity” is the “leading contributor to divisive and conflict-causing elections”, and claims that Kenyans associate “the winner-takes-all system with divisive elections”.

The report refers to ethnic antagonism and competition as a “major threat to Kenya’s success”. It then proffers two solutions: inclusion of national unity, character, and cohesion in the school curriculum, and criminalisation of hate speech and of use of violence before and after elections.

From these cursory assertions, the section recommends the expansion of the Executive branch to comprise a president, a deputy president, a prime minister, and two deputy prime ministers as the solution. Supposedly, an expanded executive will be “more inclusive” and will not “generate the same bitterness and tensions as we see when the fight is for the position of the President”. The surprising aspect is its reference to “the power-sharing model of the 2008 Coalition Government” as the standard.

The other paragraphs of the section on pages 10 and 12 do not deal with political violence. Rather, they deal with parliamentary representation and the introduction of Mixed-Member Proportional Representation (MMP).

Reading these two sections is really perplexing. Who perpetrated the past political violence in 1992/93, 1997/98, and 2007/2008, and why? Did peasants die in the Rift Valley in 1992/93 and 1997/98 because the country had no prime minister? Did the rural subaltern wake up one day and attack each other because they were ethnically different? Did the rural and urban subalterns die in 2007/2008 because of the winner-take-all system?

Analytical approach

This article applies a peace studies framework to understanding how the form of violence that occurred in Kenya in the 1990s and 2007/2008 is organised. The framework postulates that the social construction of political violence is a discursive process that is based on five pillars. First, violence organisers discursively construct boundaries of exclusion using pre-existing markers such as ethnic, racial, cultural, linguistic, or religious identities. Second, they rally the common identity within the exclusion boundary around imminent “threats” or “dangers”. That is, they articulate threats and victimhood narratives within the constructed boundaries. Third, they target those outside the constructed boundary as the “threats” and the “enemy-other”, and they demonise and dehumanise them. Fourth, they discursively renegotiate norms of violence. And fifth, they suppress counter-hegemonic and anti-violence voices.

This social construction of violence requires moments of social uncertainty, especially political and economic crises. Using this framework, the pattern of violence in the 1990s was pretty straightforward.

Moments of uncertainty

Over the years during the Jomo Kenyatta and Daniel arap Moi regimes, Kenya became a full-blown autocracy where the party, government, and civil service essentially fused into a single hierarchical structure of power under the personal control of the president. The system was opaque and centralised around the personality of the president. As a result, political practice revolved around personalities and one-on-one closed-door dealings, instead of a predictable public stand on policy issues and coherent ideological positions. The system was a spiral pyramid of patron-client relations, with the president at the apex as the chief patron. Below the president were his clients at the provincial and district levels, who functioned as patrons in the regions.

The institutions of patronage were financed by grand corruption, and buttressed by top-down political tribalism in which regional clients claimed to speak for “unified” ethnic groups. The overall system functioned like a retail market in which political leaders dispensed money, opportunities, and “development” in exchange for blind loyalty. Some scholars have referred to this style of controlling a country as retail politics.

The system was reinforced by political intimidation and instruments of repression, including detention laws and political assassinations. Therefore, those who articulated and pursued alternative forms of organisation, especially social class mobilisation, were either intimidated, imprisoned on trumped-up charges, detained without trial, or assassinated.

When the struggle for multiparty democracy intensified in 1990/91, the Moi regime turned to these oppressive methods. Thus, the police violently repressed public protests in Nairobi and its environs, killing at least 50 young men. Some democracy proponents were detained, others run away into exile, and publications supporting pluralism were banned.

The institutions of patronage were financed by grand corruption, and buttressed by top-down political tribalism in which regional clients claimed to speak for “unified” ethnic groups. The overall system functioned like a retail market in which political leaders dispensed money, opportunities, and “development” in exchange for blind loyalty.

However, the demand for democracy coincided with two factors. First, worsening economic performance and, thus, a decline in revenue and resources for buying loyalty. Second, a greater international concern over human rights violations, which limited the use of formal repression. The resultant political and economic crises created a moment of social uncertainty that shook the Moi regime. In turn, the regime changed its strategies for the looting of the state and enforcing informal forms of repression.

Organised political violence

The central plank of informal repression was unleashing “ethnic” militias and gangs on the innocent civilian population. At first, a group of senior government ministers and KANU politicians would hold a series of public rallies in certain geographical locations, especially in the Rift Valley. The dominant message in these rallies would be hate narratives centred on nativist thinking and autochthonous notions of identity. The narratives would disparage national citizenship and its accompanying rights and instead divide the population into two groups: natives (indigenous or locals) and guests (settlers, immigrants or outsiders). Framing the latter as threats, they would demonise and dehumanise the “guests” as the “enemy-others”. Then they would threaten violence against them. To suppress anti-violence voices, they would label natives who rejected such violence as “ethnic traitors”.

Subsequently, armed militias would attack the innocent civilian population. In some instances, the militias would be dressed in “traditional clothes” and would be carrying “traditional weapons” to disguise the killings as ethnic. Thereafter, government officials, the police, and the pliant media would portray the killings as spontaneous “ethnic clashes” or “land clashes”.

To reinforce the “ethnic clashes” narrative, President Moi would appear in public in a foul mood and accompanied by the same politicians who had organised the violence. He would lecture Kenyans about peace, portray the country as an island of peace in a region of anarchy, claim credit for that peace, and then blame the opposition and the victims. A few days later, an opposition politician or activist would be arrested. This was the pattern in the 1992/93 and the 1997/98 violence.

Therefore, Uhuru Kenyatta and his BBI brigade are dead wrong. The 1990s violence was not ethnic or “tribal”; it was not about ethnicity or cultural or linguistic differences. Rather, it was politically organised and the villains were senior politicians and bureaucrats in the Moi regime. Incidentally, the chairman of the BBI process, Mr. Mohamed Yusuf Haji, was the Rift Valley Provincial Commissioner at the time, while another BBI member, Mr. Amos Wako, was the Attorney-General. Further, the impunity enjoyed by the implicated politicians partly contributed to the violence of 2007/08.

Actually, studies on the 2007/08 violence have noted that President Mwai Kibaki’s biggest failure was his inability to dismantle the structures of informal violence, and their supporting discursive practices, which emerged in the 1990s. Instead, these structures of extra-state violence diffused during the NARC era such that by 2007, politicians were patronising and funding urban gangs that had emerged as a result of autonomous processes of urbanisation, unemployment, and the vacuum of control in urban areas. A key consequence of this impunity was the erosion of confidence and trust in state institutions, especially security and electoral institutions. It is this mistrust that predisposed politicians and their supporters to view elections as a do-or-die zero-sum game.

To reinforce the “ethnic clashes” narrative, President Moi would appear in public in a foul mood and accompanied by the same politicians who had organised the violence. He would lecture Kenyans about peace, portray the country as an island of peace in a region of anarchy, claim credit for that peace, and then blame the opposition and the victims.

In other words, the 2007 election turned disastrous due to the convergence of several factors. Among these was President Kibaki’s failure to address impunity and the discursive practices of the 1990s. Another factor was the intensification of ethnic mobilisation and the generation of new hate narratives by all political formations.

Studies show that vernacular FM radio stations were some of the main propagators of the hate campaigns. For example, a Rift Valley-based vernacular FM station aired materials of a xenophobic nature against the Kikuyu, while FM stations from Central Kenya promoted a siege mentality and disparaged members of the Luo and Kalenjin communities. Studies have also documented some Central Kenya FM radio stations framing one presidential candidate as a murderer and a latter-day Idi Amin Dada.

In essence, therefore, the so-called “tribal violence” and “tribal divisions” are not a reflection of conflicts between distinct and well-organised cultural communities. Rather, they are outcomes of deliberately organised political violence. Indeed, there are reliable reports that have recommendations on these issues, including the Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC) report, the Waki report, and the Kriegler report. Similarly, the 2010 Constitution established several independent institutions to address these issues. It’s quite revealing that Mr. Kenyatta chose the BBI instead of implementing these reports or strengthening the existing independent institutions, including the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC).

Not a peace document

Even though its proponents have hailed the BBI report as being the pathway to peace, it is evident that there is no linkage between the report’s recommendations and the quest for peace and an end to political violence in Kenya. The section on divisive elections proposes an expanded executive and cites the power-sharing model of the 2008 Coalition Government as the reference point. Yet that model was extremely shaky and the prime minister was always complaining.

However, this proposal is horrifying for more fundamental reasons. First, it does not address state-orchestrated violence and impunity that have been the bane of Kenya’s politics since 1990.

Second, nothing in the proposals nor the entire BBI report would stop the losing candidates from perpetrating violence.

Third, the report assumes good faith on the part of the appointing authority and presumes that the president, deputy president, prime minister, and deputy prime ministers will come from different ethnic groups. But good faith cannot be legislated, as President Kenyatta has demonstrated through his multiple actions and omissions that have violated the 2010 Constitution, and his contemptuous disregard of the current Deputy President, William Ruto, since 2018.

Fourth, the proposed expansion of the Executive is perilous as it will validate and reify ethnic boundaries because ethnicity is the assumed basis for allocating the added executive positions. A key lesson from the 2008-2013 era is that the key players in the coalition government became the chief proponents of ethnic mobilisation, hate speech, and impunity in both the 2013 and 2017 elections.

Fifth, the proposal to appoint ANY of the MPs from the majority party or coalition of parties to be prime minister and any other persons as deputy prime ministers is a recipe for factional fighting because it undermines the authority of political parties to choose their own representatives.

Sixth, the proposed structure will perpetuate the current patron-client system and codify the president’s ability to entrench patrimonial and clientilist rule. Indeed, it echoes the late Mobutu Sese Seko’s strategy in Zaire of co-opting would-be opponents, letting them feed at the state trough, rotating them in and out of office, and encouraging them to become wealthy through corruption to neutralise them. But as the collapse of Mobutu’s Zaire shows, such a strategy does not foster durable peace.

The section on ethnic antagonism and competition proposes the inclusion of national unity, character, and cohesion in the school curriculum. But it is baffling how this will stop impunity, top-down political tribalism, or stop the clients of a president from perpetrating violence when it suits them.

Also, the section recommends criminalisation of hate speech and of the use of violence before and after elections. This is equally bizarre because both hate speech and the use of violence during elections are already criminal under current laws. However, hate speech and threats of violence remain rampant in the country primarily due to impunity and selective application of the law. Indeed, there is a horrifying pattern of political practice that outrightly negates BBI’s proclaimed intentions.

Current observations

Keen observation of current events shows that President Uhuru Kenyatta is using the 1990s playbook. His handshake rapprochement with Raila Odinga split his Jubilee Party into two wings. Since then, his Jubilee wing has been consistently articulating threats and narratives of victimhood. They are always demonising and dehumanising the targeted “enemy-other”. They are subtly and discursively renegotiating the norms of violence, and they are blatant in their attempts to suppress alternative voices.

Kenyatta’s Jubilee wing, its Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) handshake partners and its social media bloggers are the most militant hatemongers in Kenya today. Further, politicians and state bureaucrats close to the president have been identified as the planners and financiers of incidents of political violence that have been witnessed in different locations this year. One can infer that the failure of the police and the NCIC to hold any of them to account is a dead giveaway.

Meanwhile, the president is always lecturing Kenyans about peace, praising the handshake as a precursor to peace, and accusing others of threatening peace. Four examples centred on Kenyatta and the interior ministry will illustrate these observations.

Example 1

On 29 October 2020, The Standard and The Star quoted Kenyatta’s self-styled adviser and Jubilee Vice Chairman, David Murathe, criticising the Deputy President, William Ruto. Referring to Ruto as an “outsider” in the Mt Kenya region, he accused the deputy president of radicalising the youth in the region using the rich-poor narrative and compared the narrative to the re-invention of the outlawed Mungiki sect. Murathe’s argumentation strategy was not just articulating threats and victimhood and demonising Ruto and those who support him; he was subtly raising and justifying the spectre of state violence against the deputy president’s supporters the way previous administrations dealt with Mungiki adherents.

Example 2

On 21 October 2020, the Daily Nation quoted Uhuru Kenyatta rebuking the Abagusii people for not protecting their “son”, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i, from insults by “outsiders”. His argumentation strategy was in reality articulating four things. First, he was constructing a boundary of exclusion around ethnic identity by classifying the population into “locals” and “outsiders”. Second, he was articulating a victimhood narrative that was portraying Matiang’I, and to an extent the “locals”, as victims of those he was demonising as “outsiders”. Third, he was privileging ethnic identity and diminishing national identity. And fourth, he was renegotiating the norms of violence so that the “locals” would use “defence of their son” as their justification if violence erupted.

Example 3

On 13 October 2020, the media quoted Fred Matiang’i speaking in Nyamira, which he called his “home”. In his speech, he admonished “outsiders”. While his remarks were directed at Deputy President William Ruto, he, in essence, sought to emphasise the Kisii ethnic identity over Kenyan national identity, erect a boundary of exclusion around the ethnic identity, and portray “locals” who supported those he was calling “outsiders” as ethnic traitors.

Example 4

On 4 October 2020, a group of hired youth attempted to violently disrupt a church function graced by the deputy president at Kenol in Murang’a. Instead of arresting the youth, the police violently dispersed the locals and fired tear gas canisters at innocent civilians in the church. The few violent youths whom the local people arrested confessed in front of cameras that they had been hired by well-known Kieleweke politicians from Murang’a. Further, the organisers of the event publicly claimed that some bureaucrats from the Office of the President financed the perpetrators.

Kenyatta’s Jubilee wing, its Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) handshake partners and its social media bloggers are the most militant hatemongers in Kenya today. Further, politicians and state bureaucrats close to the president have been identified as the planners and financiers of incidents of political violence that have been witnessed in different locations this year.

While the media framed the violence as a “clash between two rival groups” to create the impression of spontaneity, the police initially blamed two MPs who are not favoured by the regime. A few days later, the National Security Advisory Council (NSAC), comprising the same bureaucrats who had been mentioned as the financiers of the violence, lectured Kenyans about the government’s commitment to peace and security. The NSAC then blamed the deputy president’s political wing and revived the discarded Public Order Act to curtail his activities.

Subsequently, the police blamed politicians from “both sides”, but they never explained why no one was arrested or why the NCIC had not acted. Incidentally, a careful reading of Article 7 (1) (a) of the Rome Statute shows that the violence in Murang’a had all the elements of what would qualify as a crime against humanity.

Conclusion

The BBI report is not a document for ending political and/or election-related violence or building durable peace in Kenya. The relevant sections ignore the causes and consequences of past political violence. Instead, the report invents “ethnic antagonism and competition” and “divisive elections” as challenges and hastily jumps to the expansion of the Executive as the solution. Therefore, the only inference that one can draw is that the purpose of the BBI process is to recommend the expansion of the Executive.

Moreover, there is a pattern that shows that the president and his acolytes have borrowed from the 1990s playbook on politically-instigated violence. But they would do well to remember that the widespread use of informal violence, massacres, new wars, and genocides in the 1990s led to the development of international norms, standards, and instruments to deal with these challenges. These norms and standards include those codified in the Rome Statute, whose institutional representation is the International Criminal Court (ICC). Therefore, under the command responsibility principle, the president, senior officials in the interior ministry and state security forces can be held to account for crimes under international law that could result from their court jesters’ hate-mongering and informal violence mobilisation.","I will comment on the BBI process and analyse who perpetrated the past political violence and why, and then evaluate BBI’s response to that political violence.

In recent months, two high-profile climate assemblies—in France and the UK—proposed hundreds of measures and recommendations; and more climate assemblies are planned in Germany, Scotland, Spain, and beyond.

A big reason for the surge of interest in climate CAs—and other deliberative mini-public fora—is the lack of confidence in, and poor track record of, conventional policymaking in tackling climate change. In fact, CAs and mini-publics are now being pushed as a fix to pretty much every knotty policy issue, whether it’s COVID-19 or democratic failure.

But do they work? Will CAs really help address the climate crisis? In short, they could, but assemblies need to help citizens understand the scale and urgency of the challenge, use robust rules and procedures, and create genuine public debates that touch all parts of society. By comparing the respective strengths and weaknesses of the French and UK assemblies, it’s clear that some improvements would increase the chances of achieving results.

French and UK Assemblies Compared

The French and UK events happened simultaneously, but while they shared some similarities, they were different in many ways—not least the proposals generated.

Key Aspects of the French and UK Assemblies Climate Assembly UK (CAUK) Convention Citoyenne pour le Climat (CCC) Framing question How can the UK reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050? How can France reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 percent (from the 1990s level) by 2030, in the spirit of social justice? Participants and selection 108 (sortition and stratified sampling selection according to seven criteria) 150 (sortition and stratified sampling selection according to six criteria) Budget 520,000 British pounds ($672,139) 5.4 million euros ($6.34 million) Duration Four months (January 25–May 17, 2020) Nine months (October 3, 2019–June 21, 2020) Process Three in-person weekend sessions and three short online weekend sessions due to the coronavirus pandemic Seven in-person weekend sessions and one online weekend session due to COVID-19 Political sponsor Six parliamentary select committees1 President Emmanuel Macron Public awareness No poll available yet to assess the extent to which the British population has heard of CAUK In June 2020, a Réseau Action Climat France poll showed that seven out of ten French people had heard about the convention’s proposals Lead delivery organization Involve Missions Publiques, Res-Publica, and Eurogroup consulting Number of final recommendations More than fifty recommendations, covered in a 556-page report 149 measures, covered in a 460-page report

Three Major Similarities

Each assembly was initiated in the wake of protests. The CCC was a response to the yellow vests protests, which were fueled by a proposed carbon tax increase and eventually came to define the divide between citizens and Parisian elites. The CAUK was initiated following the UK Parliament’s declaration of a climate emergency in May 2019, which came on the heels of protests initiated by the movement Extinction Rebellion in April 2019. The movement’s third demand for a citizens’ assembly on the climate and ecological emergency generated momentum for climate CAs across the UK.

Each CA followed a broadly standard format, which includes time for learning, deliberating, and voting. The CAUK and the CCC involved a similar number of people (108 and 150, respectively), who were selected by sortition and stratified sampling to ensure that they reflected their country’s population. Both assemblies were split into groups that explored different topics. Three groups of thirty-six people covered four themes for the CAUK: how people travel; in the home; what people buy; and food, farming, and land use. And five groups of thirty people covered five themes for the CCC: housing, traveling, eating, consuming, and working and manufacturing.

Claire Mellier Claire Mellier is a researcher and facilitator. She was part of the facilitation team at Climate Assembly UK and one of the accredited researchers who observed France’s Convention Citoyenne pour le Climat.

In both cases, citizens have generated far more ambitious policies than politicians have ever come up with. Of course, it’s too early to say whether the CAs will have a significant impact on climate policy, but there is good evidence that the assemblies have had a significant and immediate effect on the climate policy environment in London and Paris. Down the road, the events could be seen as key moments of a step change in climate policy for both countries, but only time will tell.

Eight Major Differences

France’s budget was nearly ten times that of the UK’s. Obviously, the amount of funding has a huge impact on what can be done, and comparisons of assemblies therefore must be seen through this prism.

The CCC was cast as a political chamber, whereas the CAUK existed to inform a political chamber. From its inception, the CCC was highly political. When Macron announced the convention on April 26, 2019, he said there would be “no filter,” implying that he expected the convention to generate policies that would be enacted either through a national referendum, parliamentary vote, or directly through executive orders. From that moment on, the convention was infused with political power that shaped everything—from employing public law experts to ensure that the proposals were legally robust to supporting citizens’ role as spokespeople for the convention. And, of course, the national press started to take note.

The UK process in contrast was cast as an apolitical, independent, rigorous, and deliberative research process to inform policymaking. CAUK was sponsored and partially funded by six parliamentary committees, which ensured it was hard-wired into parliament. There were, however, no individual members of the governing party imbuing the process with political power. Even funding of the assembly had to be gathered mostly from foundations (77 percent of the total budget), making the arrangement good value for money for parliament but raising questions about the government’s commitment to the endeavor.

The CCC’s civil society representatives had a formal, active role in shaping the agenda, whereas CAUK’s civil society members did not. For instance, Gilets Citoyens (Citizen Vests), the civil society representatives on the governance committee in France, had an active role in determining the convention’s framing question. By contrast, it was the UK’s parliamentary committees that set the CAUK’s framing question, without input from the citizens’ advisory panel (which included representatives of Greenpeace and youth organizations). Climate activists raised concerns almost immediately that the CAUK was not ambitious enough, and when considering each assembly’s final recommendations, it’s hard to dispute that the French approach was more ambitious.

CAUK participants were supported to be independent and as representative of “ordinary” people as possible, whereas CCC participants were encouraged to engage with politics. The CAUK aimed to keep the participants as independent as possible—to maintain their representativeness as so-called ordinary citizens. To that end, they were not encouraged to speak to the media, to do additional research on the topic of climate change in between sessions, or even to speak to their own families about the issues at the time of voting.

In France, it was the opposite. the CCC’s citizen participants were given a greater role and agency in seeking outside input. Participants were encouraged to speak to the media and engage with their communities and members of parliament. Working together to generate collective intelligence, they created their own WhatsApp groups to freely communicate between themselves without any third-party interference, they had access to an online platform (J’enparle) to increase engagement, and they attended webinars to support the learning process and maintain momentum between sessions. Many CCC participants started acting as defacto representatives—in some cases, speaking on behalf of the whole convention (or sometimes their region) to the media and gathering input from those they believed they were representing.

The CCC’s citizens were able to shape the process in a way that the CAUK’s citizens were not. With input from experts, the 150 French citizens participating created 149 measures, including recommendations not originally in the convention’s remit, such as on ecocide or on specific trade agreements (one proposal, for example, asks for a moratorium on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement). Also, upon the citizens’ request, a seventh session was added and experts of their choosing were invited. This illustrates a fundamental difference between the two CAs. The CCC was a political chamber where citizens built collective intelligence to influence policymaking; by contrast, the CAUK was a deliberative exercise to inform political chambers (parliament). The UK citizens were consulted on predetermined policy options developed upstream by experts, which generated high-quality robust data, but the citizens were not supported to shape the agenda or process or to come up with their own measures. On the other hand, the French citizens co-created policy measures with input from experts.

The CAUK was structured and facilitated, contrasting with France’s more collective self-organizing approach. For many who specialize in developing participatory processes, one of the most surprising aspects about the CCC was the absence of table facilitators.2 The French table discussions were more likely to be dominated by certain people, and it is typically trained facilitators who (in theory) ensure that all voices are heard and discussions stay focused and productive.3 As a whole, the French process was far less technically rigorous than the UK process. The UK process had clear, agreed-upon ground rules for participation, which were reiterated at each session; the French process had none, trusting citizens to self-organize and self-regulate.

The CAUK was designed to support a social appraisal of predetermined policies, whereas the CCC was a policy development forum. The CAUK’s objectives were to allow citizens to express their personal views—informed by relevant “balanced, comprehensive and accurate” information—and to deliberate as a group on predetermined policy proposals. Each workshop followed a format of presentation, deliberation, and voting so as to generate a high-quality social appraisal of the policy proposals. However, although all 108 citizens voted on larger issues (such as electricity generation, the underpinning principles of the UK’s path to net-zero emissions, and greenhouse gas removal from the atmosphere), some proposals were only voted on by the issue-specific subgroups of thirty-six citizens. This approach raises questions as to the legitimacy of the proposals not voted on by all participants, which will have to be a key consideration for any future CA design. As a result of the format, the support of each proposal varied.

Rich Wilson Rich Wilson is the director of OSCA and a democracy renewal specialist. In 2004, he founded Involve and has since set up numerous democracy initiatives; advised governmental bodies such as the UNDP, OECD, and WHO; and led hundreds of deliberative processes.

By contrast, the CCC aimed to generate and finalize policy proposals through collective intelligence and consensus, respectively. All the proposals were refined over the six sessions before all 150 participants cast their votes in the final session on June 20–21. The 149 proposals were grouped into forty-three blocks of one to thirteen measures. The proposal refinement process and single voting session are likely what generated high levels of support.4 Many of the recommendations received over 95 percent support, which is striking.5

The CCC generated a national debate, while in comparison, the CAUK received far less attention from the public. According to polling a week after the CCC vote, 70 percent of French citizens had heard of the CCC. The process generated a genuine national debate at breakfast tables, cafés, and restaurants across France. According to a poll by Odoxa, the French population supports most of the 149 proposals, an insight that subsequent research has confirmed. This public endorsement has generated a very powerful mandate for change.

Despite some national press coverage of the UK assembly, the CAUK was never designed to create a genuine national debate, and it didn’t. Public awareness of the assembly will likely remain many times lower in the UK than in France.

Improving Climate Assemblies

Many agree that both CAs raised the climate policy bar significantly, but is it enough to get to net-zero emissions by 2050 or to address the climate emergency more widely? To answer this question, two interrelated questions must be asked first: Are the proposals sufficient? And will they get implemented?

No one can say with certainty that the proposals are sufficient to get France and the UK to net-zero emissions by 2050. In France, experts involved in the convention struggled to assess whether all the measures together would lead to the interim target of a 40 percent reduction in emissions by 2030.6 And civil society and citizens are skeptical that politicians will even implement the recommendations.7 Macron has already been criticized for cherry-picking his favorite proposals, and the UK government has not yet committed to picking any.

Furthermore, it’s clear that a successful approach to climate change requires action far beyond what climate assemblies have proposed so far. Well-respected climate scientists believe that “climate progressive” nations such as the UK and Sweden will still fall far short of Paris Agreement targets and that the earth’s rise in temperature is unlikely to stay under a safe threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius. There is increasing evidence from economists and scientists that system change measures—such as removing government subsidies for oil and gas or forcing pension funds to divest from fossil fuels—must be considered to feel confident that the policy mix will lead to net-zero emissions by 2050. Such measures were not on the table at either CA; one way to get them included in future CAs is to assess proposals precisely in terms of the scale of emissions reductions they are capable of delivering—whether transformative or incremental.

Climate modeling is getting ever more accurate and worrying. Much of last year’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, was focused on the possible consequences of climate change (for example, looking at the cities most vulnerable to coastal flooding—such as Mumbai in India, Dhaka in Bangladesh, Miami in the United States, and several cities in Western France and northern parts of the Netherlands—and asking which parts can be saved). This kind of data was not shared at either CA, and although it’s inherently uncertain, it does reflect scientists’ best estimates of the effects of climate change. Had the data been shared, it could have helped citizens understand both the scale of the challenge and the scale of the necessary response.

So, even if the French and UK exercises demonstrated that citizens are better placed than politicians to provide the ambitious leadership necessary on climate, the next generation of CAs needs to go a lot further in addressing the underlying systemic drivers of the climate emergency. This involves being explicit about the need for ambitious systemic change, sharing with citizens the best available forecasts of climate impacts and possible responses, and supporting citizens to emotionally engage with the issue. Emotional engagement is often overlooked but critical for a systemic response, as many people respond to the bleak consequences of climate change with either fight (anger) or flight (denial). People need support to emotionally assimilate to the reality of the situation.

Against this backdrop, ten design principles could help make the next generation of climate assemblies even more impactful:

Make transformative or incremental change a conscious choice. Citizens need to be supported to understand the difference between transformative and incremental change and develop recommendations through that lens. Be future-focused by sharing all possible scenarios. Citizens need access to data that provide the best possible guesses regarding the effects of climate change, but the data should be presented in a tangible way to illustrate the real consequences for people’s lives locally, nationally, and globally. The scenarios should not be sugarcoated but rather include both the bleak and optimistic forecasts and the likelihood of each occurring. Look at mitigation and adaptation as two sides of the same coin. Neither CA focused on climate change adaptation, but even if the Paris Agreement target is met, people’s lives will still be impacted by issues stemming from climate change—such as sea-level rises and food and water security—matters that citizens will have important views on. Citizens should at least be given the choice to discuss adaptation. Design a highly robust independent process. Mainstream climate politics are characterized by passion and polarization. Therefore, it is vital that the CA process and its governance are beyond reproach. Key decisions—such as on the agenda, the selection of experts, and who votes on what—need to have a robust and publicly defensible basis. Maximize representation when possible. CAs gain credibility when they can claim that the whole population is represented. And, of course, the greater number of people involved, the more representative the process will be—to give an analogy, the more pixels you have, the truer the picture will be. Size matters, especially when working on politically charged topics, because politics is a numbers game. Processes involving more people are more resilient to political scrutiny. Create a national debate. Perhaps the most impressive statistics coming out of the CCC were that 70 percent of all French people surveyed had heard about the convention and that 62 percent were supportive of most measures, which—other than the more contentious motorway speed limit reduction from 130 to 110 kilometers per hour—were considered realistic and effective. This not only generated a powerful mandate for change but also a movement of people who engaged with the convention via the media, discussed it with their friends and families, and are now putting pressure on their politicians to implement the recommendations. All future CAs should aim to generate a similar national public debate. Create, and build awareness about, the CA with the involvement of civil society, citizens, government, businesses, and the media. Having all the involved actors set the framing question, agenda, and voting method is essential to ensure buy-in. Allowing citizens to influence the agenda fosters ownership and creativity, and involving the media is necessary to create a national debate. Also, given the key role of businesses, it’s important for them to be seen as partners in the process. Foster emotionally intelligent participation. As already mentioned, many people find it hard to emotionally digest the possible traumatic impacts of climate change, leading them to either downplay their scale and urgency (known as flight) or become part of a highly polarized debate (known as fight). Most climate CAs today do not provide emotional support and stick to what might be called type 1 communication (a simple exchange of opinions) or type 2 communication (a discussion of beliefs and values). Instead, CAs should engage people in type 3 communication (a fostering of governing sentiment that addresses people’s hopes and fears). This is not group therapy but rather, as described by Professor Otto Scharmer, a precondition to developing transformative responses with the critical benefit of dissolving group polarization. Explore how change happens. Probably the biggest block to the impact of any CA is “politics as usual.” Even if an assembly has the support of decisionmakers (for example, members of the executive, such as Macron) as well as their commitment to not filter the recommendations, politics can get in the way, as already seen in France. AmericaSpeaks—which pioneered citizen summits and twenty-first-century town hall meetings (in many ways the predecessor to CAs)—supports participants to understand the wider political environment of how change happens. Sometimes this approach results in citizens’ acting as advocates for their processes, and sometimes it involves developing specific recommendations in light of the environment. Either way, it means that the processes are wise to the demands of realpolitik. Generate hope by design. Although the vast majority of people now believe that climate change is an urgent challenge, there is still little hope that much can be done about it. Many people think that this lack of a positive narrative on tackling the crisis is perhaps the biggest barrier to creating political momentum for change. Anecdotal evidence suggests that both CAs generated significant hope and agency in their participants. Therefore, CAs, especially those that seek to spark national public debates, could become important creators of new hopeful narratives.

Climate Assemblies and Democracy

Climate CAs were primarily created with the hope that they could help break the logjam in climate action. And the resulting proposals tend to be judged by their contribution to tackling climate change. But an equally important question is how such assemblies contribute to democracy—and whether a positive impact on climate action and on democracy necessarily go together.

To answer this question, it’s helpful to go back to democracy’s fundamental principles and ask: what is the point of democracy? In his seminal 1859 essay, “On Liberty,” John Stewart Mill argued that “the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.” The foundation of any system of government must be to keep people safe. So, in theory, if CAs help better protect people from climate change, then they are contributing to democracy’s core function and are a source of legitimacy.

Yet assemblies do not always have such a clear benefit for democratic governments. They do not necessarily help win elections. For example, the last Irish government successfully won support for a suite of reforms by referendum that were in line with its CA’s recommendations. Yet Fine Gael, the party that initiated the CA, lost the election in February 2020 as a range of other factors undercut its popularity.

This gets to the heart of the tension between CAs and democracy. Citizens expect politicians to fix their problems and reward those who best look after their interests. But, increasingly, national politicians struggle to solve problems like climate change that require international cooperation and don’t have easily implementable policy fixes. Citizens then end up seeking strong leaders who are “willing to break the rules” of democracy. For CAs to sit comfortably within conventional democracy, it is vital to instill political leadership that can admit and explain uncertainty to the public and get rewarded for it. The public needs to view the leadership’s initiation of CAs as the intelligent and brave thing to do. The world is not there yet.

Notes

1 This list included the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee; Environmental Audit Committee; Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee; Science and Technology Committee; Transport Committee; and Treasury Committee.

2 Each of the CCC’s five thematic groups comprised thirty citizens. Each group was moderated by one lead facilitator and supported by a facilitator/notetaker, but there were no facilitators during the breakout sessions of smaller groups. For the CAUK, each of the three thematic groups comprised thirty-six citizens, who were then divided into smaller groups of seven people, with one facilitator per group.

3 Qualitative data collected by the researchers observing the table conversations, as well as quantitative data from the research questionnaires, provide evidence on the impact of the absence of table facilitators.

4 In the CCC, the citizens participating challenged the voting methodology. The method had not been discussed in advance with the citizens, which raised questions about the integrity of the process.

5 As reported by the author, Claire Mellier, who observed the assembly meetings as an accredited researcher.

6 The potential of the CCC measures to achieve a 40 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 has not been comprehensively assessed. Only rough estimates of the impact (low, medium, and high) of each measure were provided to citizens, with no assessment of their combined impact. The experts group put these estimates together and sent them to the citizens only days before the vote was held during the final session.

7 Seventy-three percent of French people believe that the country’s executive branch will only implement a small proportion of the measures.","A lot of stock is being put in climate citizens’ assemblies (CAs) to help solve tough political issues.
The movement’s third demand for a citizens’ assembly on the climate and ecological emergency generated momentum for climate CAs across the UK.
The UK process in contrast was cast as an apolitical, independent, rigorous, and deliberative research process to inform policymaking.
Furthermore, it’s clear that a successful approach to climate change requires action far beyond what climate assemblies have proposed so far.

This debate could not come at a better time.

The US House of Representatives recently approved legislation that brought the establishment of an international fund a crucial step closer to reality. The legislation is now progressing through the Senate. Following the election of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, there is a huge opportunity for the UK to get behind a multilateral initiative to provide tangible support to Israeli-Palestinian peace-building and demonstrate to the incoming Biden-Harris administration that the UK is serious about international cooperation.

The US Middle East Partnership for Peace Act – sponsored by the much-respected Democrat congresswoman Nita Lowey – will allocate the fund $110m over five years to support people-to-people projects between Israelis and Palestinians, as well as a further much-needed $140m in investments in the Palestinian economy. But the inspiration for the fund, which has been promoted by the Alliance for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP) and championed here in the UK by Labour Friends of Israel, lies rather closer to home.

During the darkest days of the Troubles in the mid-1980s, the new International Fund for Ireland began investing in peace-building work in Northern Ireland. Those projects provided the civic society foundations upon which the Good Friday Agreement was later built and helped establish a reservoir of public support in both the unionist and nationalist communities that has sustained peace in Northern Ireland through multiple ups and downs over the past two decades.

The US legislation, which has bipartisan support, and the backing of influential Democrats and Republicans in the US Senate, will not simply reverse President Donald Trump’s reckless decision in 2018 to slash US support for coexistence projects. It instead offers a ground-breaking opportunity, albeit in the very different circumstances of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to invest in the same kind of civic society work that proved so important in Northern Ireland. And the legislation, which is totally separate from the Trump administration’s deeply flawed peace plan, would help underpin and support any new Middle East initiative taken by the Biden administration.

However, as conceptualised by ALLMEP, the fund is not supposed to be a US-dominated or solely US-funded institution, and the new US legislation leaves open the door to other international actors both donating to it and participating in its governance. The fund will bring an expert, strategic approach to grassroots peace-building, targeting funding on joint economic development and civil society projects that promote coexistence and broad support for peace even while they improve social and economic conditions on the ground.

There is robust evidence to suggest that – even on their present small scale – the work done by coexistence projects in Israel and Palestine can produce positive results. Peace-building work, research conducted by the academic Ned Lazarus in 2017 found, significantly improves Israeli and Palestinian participants’ attitudes to one another. The US international development agency, USAID, agrees. It has suggested that those participating in cross-border coexistence report higher levels of trust and cooperation, more “conflict resolution values”, and less aggression and loneliness.

Regrettably, however, the UK government has failed to embrace the opportunity provided by the establishment of the international fund. While offering occasional warm words, it has remained steadfastly detached from international discussions and engagement. It has also shown no inclination to offer any form of financial support. Sadly, this reflects the government’s lack of interest in coexistence work more broadly.

In 2016, previous small-scale investment in people-to-people projects through the Conflict Security and Stability Fund was eliminated. A year later, following campaigning by LFI, the government announced a new three-year £3m programme. While we awaited the Department for International Development’s formal evaluation, this programme was conducted in a highly secretive manner with no open process for existing projects to bid for funding and key players on the ground seemingly shut out of participation. The government has now, once again, axed UK support for people-to-people work, despite experts and practitioners arguing that is only through long-term and sustained investment that these projects have any chance of producing real and lasting results.

It is long-term and sustained investment that the fund will offer. The Prime Minister now has the opportunity to show that his much-vaunted ambitions for ‘global Britain’ are not simply meaningless waffle. There would be few better ways of showing it than the government stepping up to support – and invest in – an international fund for Israeli-Palestinian peace.","My fellow Labour Friends of Israel vice-chair Catherine McKinnell has today secured a parliamentary debate on UK support for an international fund for Israeli-Palestinian peace.

Third Northeast India Indigenous Women Peace Congregation 2020 : A Report





Clarion Call for Northeast India Truth and Reconciliation Commission and Inclusion of Women in Peace Talks and Decision Making at the Third Historic Northeast India Indigenous Women Peace Congregation



With the theme, Working Towards Our Collective Peace, Justice and Our Rights, The Third Historic Northeast India Indigenous Women Peace Congregation was held online via zoom at the backdrop of a global pandemic where Indigenous women of Northeast India and the world gathered to share experiences, lessons and to adopt resolutions for their future on 21 November 2020.



The peace congregation was organized by the Manipur Women Gun Survivors Network, Northeast India Women Initiative for Peace & The Global Alliance of Indigenous Peoples, Gender Justice & Peace. The congregation saw the gathering of over 51 indigenous scholars, practitioners and women rights activists from eight states of Northeast India and also from around the world including indigenous women leaders from the Americas, Peru, Japan, Philippines and Bangladesh. Mr Laishram Niketan, a story teller and a pena player from Manipur performed a beautiful song called Yaikairol meaning awakening song at the inaugural session of the peace congregation.



Ms. Binalakshmi Nepram, Founder of Manipur Women Gun Survivors Network and the convener of the peace congregation gave the opening remarks narrating the importance of how she and many others in Northeast India Women Initiative for Peace started the First Women Peace Congregation in March 2015 in Imphal, Manipur followed by the second congregation in August 2016 in Guwahati, Assam with the aim to ensure that women of Northeast India are made equal stakeholders in peace and conflict resolution processes to bring lasting peace in the region. She added Northeast India has been torn by seven decades of armed conflict where over 50,000 people have been killed. She reiterated that lasting peace can come when women are made a part of the efforts.



The keynote speech of the peace congregation was given by Professor Elsa Stamatopoulou, Columbia University where she stated, Indigenous women have bravely taken up the roles of mediators and peace builders have sought to address these issues at the local, national and international levels. At the United Nations, Indigenous women have been advocates and leaders since the very first year of the UN Working Group on Indigenous Populations, in 1982 in Geneva. Indigenous women were active participants and contributors during the two decades of negotiations regarding the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which was adopted by the General Assembly in 2007.



Professor Stamatopoulou further stated, The struggles of indigenous peoples are embraced by International Law and that the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) is a major normative framework for preventing and solving conflicts that contains a number of significant articles where it says that military activities shall not take place in territories of Indigenous Peoples unless justified by relevant public interest or requested by Indigenous peoples concerned and that states shall make effective consultations through appropriate procedures, especially representative institutions of Indigenous Peoples, prior to using lands for military activities. Indigenous Peoples shall not be forcibly removed, no relocation will take place without free, prior and informed consent, and agreement on just and fair compensation; Indigenous Peoples have the right to redress by means that can include restitution, and just, fair, equitable compensation for lands and resources.



She concluded her speech by stating that Resistance, persistence, resilience, vision for life are the four words that embrace indigenous womens struggles for peace.







Third Northeast India Indigenous Women Peace Congregation 2020 : A Report





Mr Niketu Iralu, a prominent Naga intellectual from Nagaland spoke about how the Northeast India has become a region of many wounds. He stated We have hurt one another and the region has become a land of many killing fields, there is a feeling of accumulated hurt that needs to heal. Mr Iralu also joined the call by the organizers of the convening for the setting up of a Northeast India Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate into all forms of deaths, disappearances and acts of ethnic cleansing and genocide that has happened to the people of Northeast India for the past seven decades.



Ms Jarjum Ete, former Chairperson of Arunachal Pradesh Women Commission detailed the rising violence against women in her home state, Arunachal Pradesh, as well as her efforts for women empowerment in the state. She further spoke about the 1995 Beijing World Conference on Women where she attended along with a handful of women from Northeast India.



She also threw light on the attempts taken to take over indigenous peoples lands in her state as it is happening under the Draft Environment Assessment Impact Report 2020 and called for vigilance to protect indigenous peoples rights and land in the Northeast India border regions inhabited by indigenous peoples.



Ms Roshmi Goswami, co-founder of North East Network shared how the strengthening of neoliberal policies are eroding and hurting indigenous culture and struggle. She emphasized the pandemic has maximized the already ongoing struggles of the indigenous peoples who are exploited by the Government authorities and sadly, do not have say in matters regarding their lives and lands.



Moreover, she spoke about the imprisonment of many human rights defenders from the region and called for vigilance in the cooption of women in peace building and for setting terms of negotiation in what she calls Northeast as a Conflict weary region. In her speech, Goswami appealed to the peoples of Northeast to imagine a new peace that is devoid of patriarchal control and one that has transformational justice.



Ms Elvera Sargent, a member of the Mohawk Nation in Akwasne belonging to the Haudenosaunee Confederacy spoke about how there are 524 tribes that live along the international border of United States and Canada and that her people also have a long history of being colonised by both countries with huge impact on the lives of indigenous peoples.



Ms Sargent asserted how schools were built to assimilate her people by the colonisers. She shared her experience of setting up of the Akwasasne Freedom School where their indigenous languages and ways of life are being taught to the younger generation. Ms Sargent concluded with remarks of hope in the election of 6 indigenous women in the recent US elections and how that can help bring positive change.



Ms Tarcila Rivera Zea, an eminent Indigenous woman leader from Peru and founder of the organization Chirapaq from Peru was the guest of honor at the peace congregation. In her speech, she talked about how since the First World Women Conference at Beijing in 1995, indigenous women from across the world have been meeting globally to strengthen the work. She narrated how in her home area in Peru, over 70,000 have been killed in armed conflict as it has happened in Indias Northeast.



She expressed that domestic violence, sexual violence in conflict, environmental violence and racism and discrimination have been common happenings to the indigenous peoples and territories, in her country. She mentioned that indigenous people continue to remain vulnerable and added how access to education and awareness raising remains important to address the difference issues that face indigenous peoples. She drew attention to how Indigenous women have already given 200 recommendations for effective change and called for the strengthening of a global alliance of indigenous peoples to work on these issues.



Ima Lourembam Nganbi, noted Meira Paibi Woman Leader from Manipur spoke about the continued militarization, imposition of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, 1958 and the impact it has on women and children in Manipur. She called for the removal of the Act and to ensure that the security forces who raped and killed a 31 year old woman Thangjam Manorama be brought to book as this has not been done till now. She highlighted the various cases of fake encounter killings in the state of Manipur and strongly called for the inclusion of women in decision making.



Rose Mangshi Haokip, a distinguished Kuki woman leader from Kuki Womens Union, shared how the kuki womens struggle started during the Kuki-Naga ethnic clash in 1993. She highlighted that women came together to help other women, girls and many orphaned in the violence. She joined the others in calling for the inclusion of women in decision making, especially political decision making.



Important sharing was done by indigenous women and men scholars and community peace workers from all across the Northeast and around the world that include among others the following Professor Lalneihzovi from Mizoram University, Homen Thangjam from Indira Gandhi National tribal University, Shibani Phukan, Dr Lianboi Vaiphei of Delhi University, Parboti Roy of University of British Columbia, Tinat Atifa Masood, Pantibolliu Gonmei, Agnes Kharsing, Amita Sangma, Anjali Rai, Rebina Subba, Sangeeta Goswami from Human Security Collective from The Hague, Dr Gyanabati Khuraijam from NIT, Tripura, Sam Simonds, Ringyuichon Vashum, Yuri Luikham, Nongdren, Chanthoi, Shanthalembi, Vipin Kumar, Shaheen Hussain, Shadab Anis, Shubhra Hanjabam, Pushpita Aheibam, Gilbert, Kanchan Sinha, Maisam Arnapal, Mumtaz Begum, Mitzi and Adine from Non-Violence International Southeast Asia and Pradip Phanjaobam, noted media personality from Manipur also attended the congregation.



The online historic peace congregation concluded with a melodious Tangkhul folk song sung beautifully by Ms Chonshimlan Huileng, a class X student from Ukhrul, Manipur. The vote of thanks was given by Ms Reena from Manipur Women Gun Survivors Network. The congregation also adopted the following new resolutions at the historic convening :



RESOLUTION OF THIRD NORTHEAST INDIA INDIGENOUS WOMEN PEACE CONGREGATION HELD ON 21 NOVEMBER 2020 VIA ZOOM ONLINE PLATFORM



The strength of women of Northeast India has been proven historically time and again. The congregation recognizes the 116 year old womens movement in Manipur and Northeast Region that started with First Nupi Lan or Womens War of 1904 against British Colonial Rule, followed by the Second Womens War or 1939 and the setting up of the legendary Meira Paibis in 1980s following the start of counter-insurgency operations. We also recognized the historic work done by Naga Mothers Association, Kuki Mothers Association and many others who paved the way for the emergence of a strong indigenous womens movement in Northeast India.



Inspired by the work of women of Northeast & around the world, Manipur Women Gun Survivors Network along with many others established the Northeast India Women Initiative for Peace in 2009-10 and on 25 March 2015, we brought together indigenous women from Northeast India for the First Historic Northeast Women Peace Congregation held in Manipur. This was followed by Second Northeast India Women Peace Congregation held on 24-25 August 2016 in Guwahati, Assam. Also informed by the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, CEDAW, UNDRIP, UNSCR 1325 and many other conventions that protect the rights of women and indigenous peoples.



We, thus, came together on 21 November 2020 on an online platform due to the pandemic for The Historic Third Northeast India Indigenous Women Peace Congregation with the theme Working Towards Our Collective Peace, Justice and Our Rights and we seek to resolve the following:



1. Set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission for Northeast India to investigation into all forms of death, disappearances and acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing of Indigenous People from Northeast India since 1949 till date. This is important to acknowledge our past, to understand our present and take positive steps for future peace in region.



2. Recognize racial, gender and environmental violence, population engineering, distortion of our histories, cultures, languages, rituals and indigenous ways of life and indigenous faith in our region and find ways to protect this.



3. Acknowledge the rising violence against indigenous women and girls, arms and narco-trafficking in our areas as this has greatly impacted our youth, our security and our democracy.



4. Discuss ways to bring peaceful resolution of political settlement to the conflicts in region and ensure that women are included in all peace talks, negotiations and decision making. No peace without women of Northeast India. No to peace talks without women.



5. Call for the setting up of an anti-racial law to stop racial violence against indigenous peoples of Northeast India and call for repeal the Discriminatory Citizenship Amendment Act passed in Dec 2019 as this Act also impacts and discriminates Indigenous Peoples.



6. The Women Congregation also recognizes that Armed Forces Special Powers Act has been continuously imposed in the Northeast region since 1958 and that its removal will be the greatest confidence building measure that Govt of India can do to the people of Northeast India. Sincere efforts must be made to de-militarized the region so peoples and children of Northeast India can grow up in peaceful, nurturing environment. The Congregation is launching the De-militarise Indigenous Territories Northeast India, Lay Down Your Arms Campaign.



7. Resources spent in militarization, counter-insurgency operations in Northeast India should be rather invested in health, education, fight environment degradation of the indigenous peoples of Northeast India. Extraction industries should not be allowed to destroy the forests and living habitats and biodiversity of indigenous peoples of Northeast Region.



8. Strengthen survivors assistance and ensure economic empowerment programs to help support women and children survivors of violence and all forms of violent conflict. To ensure all perpetrators of sexual violence committed by state and non-state, rape at gun point must stop and justice be done. Till today, the security forces who raped and killed Thangjam Manorama has not been arrested. Those who commit the crime must be punished and not protected.



9. Stop the rising threats and attacks against Indigenous women and other human rights defenders, media etc in the region and protect freedom of expression which is a must for a robust democracy.



10. Increase women in decision making. Aim to ensure 100 indigenous women in decision making positions - socially, economic, political. Gender budgeting with proper allocation of resources must be done at every state in Northeast India so that proper resources can be set aside.



11. Forge alliances with other global indigenous women leaders and communities to work towards ensuring rule of law and deepen democracy.



12. Congregation pay our deepest condolences to families who have lost loved ones in the COVID 19 pandemic and called upon all to work together to help heal lives and go through this crisis together.

Military presence would increase by an additional 1,000 personnel, joining the 4,500 rotational military personnel previously allocated to Poland.

In 2019, Donald Trump and President Duda signed the Joint Declaration on Defense Cooperation Regarding United States Force Posture in the Republic of Poland. As released by the White House, the joint declaration states the U.S. and Poland “…share a history of friendship based on common efforts, shared values, and mutual respect. We have fought shoulder-to-shoulder around the globe … to secure peace and security for our nations and the world. This friendship underpins an increasingly close strategic and defense relationship.”

In June 2020, after some coronavirus lockdown restrictions were eased, President Duda met with Trump at the White House. According to Politico, Poland is one of the most pro-American countries in Europe, and a trip to Washington just days before Duda would stand for re-election in Poland was potentially politically motivated. On August 3rd, a Secretary of Defense statement announced that the U.S. and Poland had completed negotiations for the E.D.C.A. Just a few days later, on August 15th, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Poland’s Minister of National Defense Mariusz Blaszczak signed the agreement on defense cooperation. In a statement released by President Trump, he said the agreement will “…further strengthen N.A.T.O. deterrence, bolster European security, and help ensure democracy, freedom, and sovereignty.”

The U.S. Department of State outlines further details on the agreement. Aside from increasing U.S. forces in Poland, the E.D.C.A. “…supplements the 1951 N.A.T.O. Status of Forces Agreement (S.O.F.A.) and establishes a framework to enhance and modernize [U.S] capabilities in support of the N.A.T.O. Alliance’s collective defense.” This framework includes an outline of the legal status of U.S. forces in Poland, grants U.S. forces access to specific military installations, and shares the logistical and infrastructure cost for U.S. forces present in Poland. According to Trump’s statement, this agreement serves as a model for other nations in “equitable burden sharing.” President Trump has critiqued other North Atlantic Treaty Organization members, particularly Germany, over their share of defense spending. Then the announcement came that the U.S. would withdraw nearly 12,000 U.S. troops. N.P.R. stated that nearly 5,600 of the removed troops would be sent to other N.A.T.O. allies in Europe, including Poland.

The U.S. has similar collective defense agreements with other N.A.T.O. allies neighboring Poland, including Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania. The U.S. Department of State commends Poland for being a strong N.A.T.O. ally since joining in 1999 and for being essential to regional security. More specifically, as detailed by the Department of Defense statement, the E.D.C.A. is intended to strengthen military presence and operations on N.A.T.O.’s eastern flank and enhance deterrence against Russia.

It has raised some speculation that the E.D.C.A.’s ratification was timed shortly after Joe Biden’s election as the next president of the United States. Reuters notes the potentially tense future for Poland, as Poland has emphasized a relationship with President Trump while straining ties with allies in the European Union over democratic values. Reuters also reports that President-elect Biden has accused Trump of backing authoritarian leaders around the world, including in Poland. However, President Duda stated that Polish-American relations should not be affected by the U.S. election results, and Polish officials claim the timing of the ratification has nothing to do with the results of the U.S. election. Reuters quotes the head of Poland’s National Security Bureau, Pawel Soloch: “This is a normal ratification process. The President could only ratify the agreement after the parliament agreed to it and once the new legislation came into force.”

President-elect Biden is likely to review or change Donald Trump’s decision to reduce U.S. forces in Germany, but only time will tell how his presidency will affect future Polish-American relations and defense strategy.","After more than a year of meetings and negotiations, on November 9th, Polish President Andrzej Duda ratified the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (E.D.C.A.

The power-sharing agreement signed by the transitional government and the SRF on October 3 in Juba stipulates that 25 per cent of the transitional government seats will be allocated to ""the peace partners"", meaning the armed rebel movements that signed the peace accord. This comes down to three seats in the Sovereign Council and five ministers.

The two areas

At a joint press conference with leaders of the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) at the premises of Sudan News Agency (SUNA) yesterday, Malik Agar, Vice President of the SRF and Chairman of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North faction in Blue Nile state (SPLM-N Agar), affirmed that he supports the unity of Sudan.

Self-determination of the Two Areas (South Kordofan and Blue Nile state) comes within the framework of a unified Sudan, he stated. ""Fragmentation of the country must be prevented."" A single professional Sudanese army will be formed and consist of all armed forces in the country.

SRF President El Hadi Idris called on ""the Forces for Freedom and Change, all other revolutionary forces, and the military leadership to address all their differences for the sake of rebuilding Sudan"".

Eastern Sudan

The negotiators of the disputed eastern Sudan track in the Juba Peace Agreement, emphasised they would immediately give up their positions if ""one drop of blood is shed among the eastern Sudanese"".

Osama Saeed, head of the Opposition Beja Conference, said they reach out to those who reject the eastern Sudan track accord. He stated that the deal provides the constitutional and legal framework for a comprehensive Eastern Sudan Conference, and guarantees the participation of the eastern Sudanese people in the government. A new $348 million fund will be established for the reconstruction of eastern Sudan.

""The peace accord eliminates political and economic marginalisation,"" Saeed said. Thirty per cent of its revenues from oil and mineral resources will be allocated to eastern Sudan (Red Sea state, Kassala, and El Gedaref). A joint mechanism will be formed to determine the percentage of the revenues from the eastern Sudan ports and agriculture that will be allocated to these three states.

Khaled Idris, head of the Popular Front for Liberation and Justice, said that the East track agreement is beneficial for all citizens in eastern Sudan. He described the agreement as ""strong"" and said it does not contain the ""mistakes"" of the 2006 Asmara East Sudan Agreement. He called upon everybody to actually read the eastern Sudan track peace accord. He also urged all parties to sign it, ""as there is no peace without consensus"".

Northern Sudan

Mohamed Bandak, head of the Kush Liberation Movement, justified that the five Darfur states will be allocated more power than the northern region, which consists of River Nile state and Northern State. He denied that the share for Darfur has been taken from the share of the northern states. Bandak stated that the most basic living conditions are not present in Darfur, which justifies positive discrimination.

The northern Sudan accord delivers great gains for the region, he said. Among them are the cancellation of decisions made during the rule of ousted President Al Bashir regarding farmlands, a review of the contracts with agricultural companies to cultivate lands in the region, an assessment of all mining activities, and accountability for those involved in the Kajbar killings in June 2007.

Darfur

The head of the Sudanese Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), Dr. Jibril Ibrahim, stated yesterday that he does not seek revenge against anyone. By signing the peace agreement we have overcome the bitterness of the past, he said. JEM is fighting to build a better society and a Sudan that can accommodate everyone. He did add that those affected by the war must be compensated, and that justice must be served.

Ibrahim said that the money spent on the war in the past will in the future be spent on providing services and realising development, so that four million displaced can return to their areas of origin in Darfur.

Sudanese Congress Party

Omar El Degeir, head of the Sudanese Congress Party, a driving force behind the Forces for Freedom and Change, appealed to Abdelaziz El Hilu, head of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North, and Abdelwahid El Nur, leader of the mainstream Sudan Liberation Movement, to join the peace negotiations as soon as possible.

He acknowledged that the situation in the country is ""far from good"" and pointed to ""the many pitfalls on the revolutionary track and the mistakes made that need correction"".

El Degeir called for ""an expansion of the political base for the transitional process to democracy"". The FFC is to be restructured to include all forces of the revolution, he said.

He called on the National Umma Party to lift the suspension of its FFC membership, and on the Communist Party of Sudan to review their decision to withdraw from the FFC. The Sudanese Professionals Association should ""unify its ranks"", he said.

It is the first joint host of an EU member state and a country from the Western Balkans and is a confirmation of our strong commitment to the development of the region."" This was stated by Prime Minister Boyko Borissov in his welcoming speech at the opening of the Berlin Summit on November 10.

The Bulgarian Prime Minister reminded that the country has accepted the invitation to jointly host the initiative in 2020 during the meeting in Poznan in July 2019.

We were convinced that such a move is a natural continuation of what was achieved during the Bulgarian presidency of the Council of the EU in 2018 and at the same time - 15 years after the EU-Western Balkans Summit in Thessaloniki, Bulgaria brought the topic of the European perspective of the region back to the agenda, "" said Prime Minister Borissov to the leaders.

The Prime Minister emphasized that today's forum was also marked by the global pandemic of COVID-19, which blocked and overturned the world economy, challenged the foundations of national health and social care systems, but also shook our value systems.

""This pandemic has profoundly and irreversibly changed people's lives and destinies locally, regionally, nationally and globally,"" Borissov said.

According to him, regardless of the challenges, Sofia and Skopje have joined forces to meet the set goals and priorities of the joint presidency. The Bulgarian Prime Minister pointed out the improvement of connectivity in all its aspects - transport, economic, energy, digital, connectivity between people with a focus on youth, education, security.

The launch of a common regional market and a Green Agenda in the Western Balkans and other initiatives contributing to better co-operation and understanding in the region are also of key improtance, Borissov said.

""It is important for us within the Berlin Process to pay special attention to the development of infrastructural connectivity in the region, as this is the circulatory system in the Balkans, through which both business and citizens live,"" said Prime Minister Boyko Borissov and added that connectivity in all its aspects is essential for the region because it will make it stronger and more competitive.

""Let's not forget that the Western Balkans together represent a market for about 20 million people. This will give prospects to young people who are emigrating at a rapid pace and will seek an adequate response to the demographic crisis, regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations."" Borissov added.

Before the leaders, the Prime Minister pointed out that as a joint host of the Berlin Process, Bulgaria is driven by its willingness to help the countries of the region on the path of their European integration, as well as to strengthen good neighbourly relations, regional security and cooperation, which become even more important against the background of common challenges.

Prime Minister Borissov thanked the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Prime Minister of the Republic of North Macedonia Zoran Zaev for their active participation in the important forum today.

***

The summit of the Berlin Process countries took place on November 10 on Sofia. It was hosted jointly by the Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov and the Prime Minister of the Republic of North Macedonia, Zoran Zaev. The meeting was held via video conference.

During talks with EC President Ursula von der Leyen, Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said that the European perspective on the Western Balkans means stability, peace and prosperity.

The foreign ministers had already held talks under the joint presidency of Sofia and Skopje. During the meeting, Germany's top diplomat, Heiko Maas, was adamant that active work was being done on the next step in the enlargement of the European Union, but that the interests of each country must be protected.

The meeting of the leaders of the Berlin Process is the final event in the calendar of this year's Joint presidency of the Republic of Bulgaria and the Republic of North Macedonia.

The summit in Sofia is the seventh high-level meeting since the establishment of the format in 2014, but at the same time it is the first of its kind. For the first time in the history of the Berlin Process, there is a joint host between an EU member state and a country from the Western Balkans.

Bulgaria accepted the responsibility this year to jointly host the process together with the Republic of North Macedonia as a natural continuation of the efforts of our country during the preparation and the Presidency of the Council of the EU to support the integration process of the Western Balkans and achieving stability, peace and prosperity in the region.

Prime Minister Boyko Borissov and the Prime Minister of the Republic of North Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, welcomed from Sofia the other participants in the video conference, including the leaders of the Western Balkans, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, the Prime Ministers of Italy Giuseppe Conte, of Greece Kyriakos Mitsotakis, of Croatia Andrej Plenkovic, of Slovenia Janez Janša. The summit was also attended online by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell, European Neighbourhood and Enlargement Commissioner Oliver Varhei, and Secretary General of the Regional Cooperation Council (RCC). Majlinda Bregu, as well as representatives of CEFTA, the OECD, the European Investment Bank, the Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World Bank and the Regional Center for Youth Cooperation (RYCO).

During the summit, the participants reviewed what has been achieved over the past year and take consensus decisions important for the region and its European perspective.

A key success of the joint host of the Republic of Bulgaria and the Republic of North Macedonia is the preparation of the two declarations - for the Common Regional Market and the Green Agenda, prepared with the strong support of the European Commission, the Regional Cooperation Council, CEFTA and the partners. The declarations, which aim to further bring the region into line with EU norms and standards, are expected to be signed online during a summit in Sofia by Western Balkan leaders.

The Berlin Process for the Western Balkans is a political-diplomatic initiative launched by German Chancellor Angela Merkel in August 2014. Participants in the process are the countries of the Western Balkans - Albania, Serbia, the Republic of North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Kosovo, as well as Germany, Austria, France, Italy, Croatia, Slovenia, Great Britain, Poland, Greece and Bulgaria.

The idea of ​​the Berlin Process is to complement and support the process of European integration of the countries of the Western Balkans. The activity of the process is focused in three main areas: economy and connectivity; reconciliation and good neighbourly relations; security. The aim of the initiative is to create favourable conditions for optimizing regional cooperation through initiatives and projects, the results of which have a real and visible impact on economic security and stability and bring the countries of the Western Balkans closer to EU norms and standards./BNT","""Let's not forget that the Western Balkans together represent a market for about 20 million people.

THE Inspector General of the Namibian Police, Sebastian Ndeitunga today welcomed eleven Namibian police officers who returned from South Sudan where they were deployed under the United Nations (UN) peace keeping mission.

The officers, consisting of two women and ten men, were stationed in South Sudan for a period of two years from November 2018 to November 2020 and were deployed on the request of the UN.

Welcoming the officers who arrived on 14 November, Ndeitunga stated that the participation of 11 Namibian police force members in the international UN peace keeping mission shows Namibia’s solidarity to maintain peace and security in Southern Sudan.

“All of us are a child of international solidarity. As Namibians we have no moral to deny other nations who need our help because for years we have been assisted and supported by different nations and individuals, hence today we are an independent nation,” Ndeitunga noted.

He further stated that the UN prizes Namibia for supporting other nations and as such, Nampol ensures that its presence is felt in peace missions, which has resulted in a lot of experience for the police force.

He thus urged the officers to plough back the knowledge they gained on their mission.

Ndeitunga further noted that conditions in peacekeeping missions or operations are not always conducive, and that they are in most cases complex in nature and demands officers who are committed, fit both physically and mentally and ready to face challenges in such environments.

These may include health threatening conditions such as malaria, allergies, stress, depression and now the outbreak of COVID-19.

Giving a brief overview of their mission, the contingency commander of the group deployed from Namibia, Commander Muyenga Mbauze Celestinus, noted that the civil war situation in South Sudan is currently under control and confrontations usually only happen between cattle raiders and community members who retaliate.

He added that the challenges that the officers faced in South Sudan included a lack of appropriate uniforms for the region which rained heavily, as well as shortage on S&T funds.","Zorena JantzeTHE Inspector General of the Namibian Police, Sebastian Ndeitunga today welcomed eleven Namibian police officers who returned from South Sudan where they were deployed under the United Nations (UN) peace keeping mission.

President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday said threats to peace will not be tolerated.

He praised traditional rulers for their calming influence at the peak of the #EndSARS protests, saying the issues raised by the protesters were being addressed.

“I want to once again thank you for the role you all have played to calm down our youths with wisdom and authority.

“By instilling hope and keeping the peace, you have rendered the country great service.

“We cannot allow anybody or group to threaten the peace or sabotage these efforts,” the President said.

He spoke when he received a delegation of the National Council of Traditional Rulers, led by the Sultan of Sokoto, His Eminence, Muhammadu Sa’ad Abubakar III, at the State House in Abuja.

On the team include Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, Etsu Nupe Alhaji Yahaya Abubakar; Emir of Kano Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero and Amanyanabo of Twon-Brass King Alfred Diete-Spiff.

President Buhari told the royal fathers: “We have heard the loud cries of our youth and children, and we are attending to their concerns.

“Strong, transparent efforts are underway to address those rogue elements of the Nigerian Police Force.

“Simultaneously, the Nigerian Police Force will also undergo the much-needed reform that covers welfare, working conditions and code of conduct that will usher in a more professional workforce.”

The President noted the challenges that come with “our growing youth population”.

He said: “There is no hiding place regarding how we should address insecurity concerns, youth unemployment, job creation, boosting industrialisation and preparing for a transition into a digital economy.”

He stressed that the government required the “support and voice” of the traditional institution “to help amplify the message”.

“Your proximity to the people places you in a unique position to communicate and ensure that our response is targeted and impactful in view of your role as guardians of our traditional values and culture,” President Buhari said.

He urged the monarchs not to compromise their neutrality “because this is what significantly confers on you, your moral authority and legitimacy.”

According to President Buhari, his Chief of Staff, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, would lead senior government officials to various parts of the country to “directly engage with you as part of this process.”

On COVID-19 pandemic, the President noted that economies have been crippled as the response to the pandemic has forced businesses to shut down or devise new means of transacting.

Allow me to extend my sincere gratitude to the Government of Viet Nam for its commitment to the Women, Peace and Security Agenda, and hosting this much-needed discussion to celebrate the landmark 20th anniversary of Security Council Resolution 1325.

In this particular session on THE FUTURE OF WOMEN IN PEACEKEEPING, I want to begin by congratulating Viet Nam for already reaching the 2028 target set by the Security Council to double the number of female uniformed security personnel in field operations. While this is really a commendable development, let me provide perspectives from the lead development agency, on what can be done to complement the effort to increase the number of female peacekeepers.

Women are key to achieving sustainable peace and development solutions. Whether peacebuilding, peacekeeping, or conflict and crisis response, the international community must invest more in the meaningful inclusion of women at all stages from participation to prevention, protection to resolution and recovery. Evidence shows that women’s involvement in peace negotiations contributes to the quality and durability of peace agreements, as well as a higher number of provisions aimed at political reform and higher implementation rates. We all know this in theory, but what is hindering us from translating our commitments to actual results?

In this regard, let me offer you the top recommendation that emerged from the recent International Symposium on Women in Peacekeeping co-organized by Viet Nam’s Ministry of Defense and UNDP on 26 November this year. The symposium highlighted the need to invest in gender-responsive analysis to uncover the norms and stereotypes that block women’s full engagement in peacebuilding and peacekeeping. It also pointed out the importance of promoting an enabling domestic policy environment through dedicated National Action Plans on Women, Peace and Security which should consider policy options, such as maternity and paternity leave and childcare support, for ensuring women are not penalized for care responsibilities.

Subsequently the symposium recommended the creation of gender-strong units in the field, as well as of innovative training for security forces, both police and military to address key capacity gaps. We need to identify promising female police officers and soldiers to participate in high-level officer training to increase the supply of higher ranking female officers for peacekeeping operations deployment. When decision-makers are women, they can better drive gender-responsive efforts.

In the context of COVID-19, let me congratulate Viet Nam for proposing the newly approved UNGA resolution for the establishing December 27 as International Day of Pandemic Prevention. The pandemic issues were also addressed in the symposium. The women peacekeepers stressed the need to: strengthen training for undertaking peacekeeping mission safely in the context of COIVD; providing sufficient PPE for missions on the ground; and guidance to peacekeepers as educators and role models for local communities on preventive behavior.

Distinguished participants,

Let me emphasize that integrated missions and missions in transition are prime opportunities to work across the humanitarian-development-peace nexus and foster gender-responsive peacebuilding efforts beyond the life cycle of the UN missions.

It is critical that our work across the nexus is fully integrated from the very beginning of peacekeeping operations in order to ensure that gender is seen as a whole-of-society issue and not simply a security concern addressed by uniformed services. The UN Country Team must work hand-in-hand with peacekeeping - as sustainable peace and development are mutually reinforcing. Increasing the number of female peacekeepers needs to be complemented by an integrated approach across various sectors, across the government and society.

That is why UNDP engages with peacekeeping missions to advance gender equality, across rule of law and access to justice, security sector reform, human rights, and democratic governance.

For example, earlier this year, in South Sudan, together with the mission UNAMISS, OHCHR, and the UN Team of Experts on Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict, we established the first joint programme to focus on the issue of conflict-related sexual violence, a terrible and profound violation of women’s human rights. In October, the first workshop including senior military commanders and military, prepared the groundwork to integrate the conflict-related sexual violence action plan into the military training curriculum.

And I am also pleased to note that UNDP, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and UN Women are working together under a gender justice partnership to create a women-only roster of judicial and corrections officers in 2021, including government provided personnel, and a training module to promote gender parity in peace operations.

In our approach to sustaining peace, national ownership is key to the success of these initiatives. UNDP supports strengthening of national institutions, national policy development and planning & budgeting exercises.

At the level of political decision-making, our Global Parliamentary Handbook on WPS identifies ways in which parliaments can review national peacekeeping efforts in line with national action plans, secure resources for gender training of security forces and peacekeepers and criminalize sexual exploitation by peacekeepers.

We wholeheartedly welcome the recent adoption by Viet Nam’s National Assembly a resolution on the country’s engagement in UN peacekeeping operations with gneder dimensions. We hope the others will follow suit.

In Somalia for example, UNDP, working with UN partners including the mission, and development partners, supported the Ministry of Women and Human Rights Development to draft the first Somali Women’s Charter. The Charter stands as the gender framework for the new national development plan, a remarkable feat in this context.

UNDP takes a whole-of-society approach to empowering women peacebuilders, peacekeepers, mediators and women as agents of change. We foster partnerships with a wide cross-section of women activists across ethnic groups, youth, elderly, religions, political affiliation, in order to adequately represent the diversity of women’s lived experience, and for addressing violent extremism and promoting peace and security.

Distinguished participants,

To build a just, inclusive and peaceful society where gender equality is mainstreamed requires a coordinated and joined-up cooperation.

UNDP stands ready to support the Government of Vietnam in its ambition to become a regional hub on Women in Peacekeeping that facilitate research and training to foster a community of women peacekeepers to share lessons learned.

I close my remarks by urging us all to build forward better, which we can only do by accelerating the Women, Peace and Security Agenda.

Thank you.","Evidence shows that women’s involvement in peace negotiations contributes to the quality and durability of peace agreements, as well as a higher number of provisions aimed at political reform and higher implementation rates.

158,https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/blog/2020/transformational-partnerships-for-peace--resilience-and-gender-e.html,"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",UNDP,"Transformational partnerships for peace, resilience and gender equality","At the start of 2020, many of us imagined the year would be remembered as the beginning of the UN Decade of Action on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and for marking the anniversaries of UN Security Council resolution 1325 (UNSCR 1325) on women, peace, and security (WPS) and the landmark Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. We saw a world in which trust in institutions was at an all-time low, and considered how we could support the reinvigoration of systematic parliamentary, civil society, and people’s partnerships for peace, resilience and gender equality.

The COVID-19 pandemic has shattered many assumptions. But the hard lessons learned from it, from response planning and implementation to recovering forward better efforts, have affirmed the power of partnerships for advancing and reshaping the WPS agenda as we deal with the COVID-19 crisis, including partnerships between parliaments and civil society. This was the key takeaway of a recent event commemorating the 20th anniversary of UNSCR 1325, hosted by the UK All-Party Parliamentary Group on Women, Peace and Security in partnership with UNDP and Gender Action for Peace and Security (GAPS).

Many of the most effective COVID-19 responses have been those involving strong women’s leadership that enlisted deep grassroots support. In Sierra Leone, the Parliamentary Female Caucus with UNDP’s support joined hands with community-led organizations and women groups to map out more gender-sensitive ways to respond to the pandemic. Based on these dialogues, the caucus has advocated for the diverse participation of women in the fight against the pandemic. It has also urged dedicated support for women-led micro-businesses, hit hardest by lockdown measures, and women community-organizers who have been at the forefront of keeping communities safe. Looking ahead, the caucus is emphasizing the need for well-resourced projects for community revitalization after the pandemic has passed.

Similarly, among the most progressive recovery visions are those that include a recommitment to the complementary visions of the SDGs and the WPS agenda. Such visions recognize that inclusive processes with strong participation and equal leadership opportunities for women can lead to better and more sustainable outcomes of peace processes, crisis response and building back from COVID-19. In its recommendations to the recent Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy by the UK Government, a civil society organization network GAPS advocated for a holistic approach that brings together security, peacebuilding and development.

In many places, women MPs and women-led civil society groups engaging in peacebuilding and dialogue are forging new pathways for women’s political participation as we look to the post-COVID-19 era. Parliamentary cross-party groups, can play important roles in cultivating relationships between decision-makers in parliaments and a diverse representation of women peacebuilders, advocates and civil society. In Kyrgyzstan, the cross-party Forum of Women MPs together with women’s organizations and gender experts, with the support of the UNiTE campaign, have established a Council on Women's Rights and Countering Gender Violence in the Kyrgyz Parliament to jointly monitor the implementation of gender-based violence and gender equality laws. In the UK, GAPS has served as the secretariat of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on WPS, which has provided a platform for an inclusive dialogue on WPS in the country.

For women’s organizations to build and maintain the capacity needed to engage with decision-makers, and to support women’s leadership and full participation more broadly, they need steady and flexible funding. The Government of Norway, which has put partnerships with civil society for gender equality and peace at the cornerstone of its domestic and foreign policy, has championed various instruments that make such funding available directly to women’s organisations. Through budgetary oversight, parliaments in donor countries can help ensure their governments maintain steady levels of impactful and gender-responsive development assistance that reaches and serves those who need it the most.

UNDP, with the support of Norway, is proud to encourage stronger collaborations between parliaments and civil society for more a peaceful, sustainable and gender-equal society. Our Global Project on Parliaments and Civil Society as Partners Supporting WPS is working to empower parliamentarians to find new possibilities and ways of working with women peacebuilders in the grassroots, local government and the media. The project spotlights the societal benefits of having women represented in decision-making and leadership, both numerically and substantively. This work stands alongside other UNDP efforts to make parliaments more gender-sensitive and fit-for-purpose SDG16+ institutions--those that are effective, accountable to people, and invite a systematic and diverse participation of those for who the achievement of the SDGs will make the most difference.

The recently published “Women, peace and human security: a guidance note on parliamentary engagement during and post-COVID-19” charts the ways in which parliaments, civil society and development partners can work together so that 2020 is remembered not only as the year of COVID-19, but also a year where there was decisive action and across the board commitment to see the world we want realized.","We saw a world in which trust in institutions was at an all-time low, and considered how we could support the reinvigoration of systematic parliamentary, civil society, and people’s partnerships for peace, resilience and gender equality.

Millions trooped to the polls across Myanmar on November 8 to elect members of state and national parliaments. Although marred by some hitches, mainly the cancellation of balloting in many constituencies due to security issues, the overall election successfully surfaced the general sentiment of the people.

Last month’s polls were the third since regular elections began in 2010 under the 2008 constitution, and the first in over 50 years under a civilian government. Turnout was over 70 percent, which is about the same level as 2015, indicating the continued zeal of voters to decide on the crucial question of who runs the government.

Although its an essential feature, elections do not by themselves build democracy. Twelve years after having a new constitution and three regular elections, the military in Myanmar continues to have a solid grip on the country’s government.

No thanks to the 2008 constitution, up to a quarter of state and national parliaments are reserved for unelected members from the military, more known as the Tatmadaw. The constitution also vests the Tatmadaw with control of the ministries of defense, home affairs, and border affairs, and one of two vice presidential seats.

Although the commander-in-chief of the Tatmadaw is chosen by the president, the function is almost ministerial as the 11-member National Defence and Security Council — six members coming from the military — nominates the candidate and approves the appointment.

By design, the Tatmadaw is an institution by itself that is not even nominally accountable to the country’s civilian leadership, hence many commentators describe Myanmar as having a dyadic government.

The military also used to control the civilian government through its political proxy, the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), which dominated the 2010 polls. The situation changed in 2015, however, as the National League for Democracy (NLD) swept into power with a landslide win, a feat it repeated last month.

Led by State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, NLD took 80 percent of the contested seats on November 8, and gained commanding control of the bicameral national parliament that elects the next president. The NLD’s overwhelming victory further marginalized the once mighty USDP; from 41 seats in 2015, it captured only 30 in the recent polls. Aung San Suu Kyi has faced widespread international criticism that she has turned back from her democratic credentials by pandering to the Tatmadaw on issues ranging from freedom of the press to the military’s policy in dealing with the Rohingya and other ethnic minorities.

The NLD should be expected to continue democratization initiatives — and must be held to account — as it embarks on a fresh term this coming March. Already, the NLD has scored a major victory in the civilianization of the bureaucracy by taking the General Administration Department, which is a civil service body, out of the military-controlled home affairs ministry.

One key challenge in Myanmar’s journey toward democracy is building a truly federal arrangement that addresses the self-governance aspirations of the country’s ethnic nationalities that were long expressed in the so-called Panglong process. Such an effort, when done in earnest, will help end decades of armed resistance by ethnic revolutionary organizations.

Through adroit diplomacy, the country’s next set of civilian leaders must navigate a complex web of personalities, political and cultural sensitivities, and the military’s often intransigent stance on issues related to the peace process. But as the elected representatives of the people, the country’s civilian leadership must have primacy in instituting a process of building political consensus toward peace.

Beyond the peace process, the NLD must use its existing political space to empower ethnic peoples. For one, it must allow them to lead state governments so they can exercise a degree of self-determination. The NLD must also rethink relations with ethnic political parties which, by the NLD’s sheer dominance, were marginalized in the vote — depriving them of greater participation in government.

Building a truly federal union and overturning the military’s anomalously entrenched role in government would require changing the constitution. Here, proponents need to garner at least 75 percent of votes in the national parliament and, depending on which portion is amended, to gain a majority vote in a plebiscite.

Toward this end, the NLD and ethnic parties can collaborate in the future to defeat the USDP and upend the military’s hold and role in government, so that they can muster that 75-percent support.

Finally, the incoming government must end the systematic displacement of the Rohingya people from their homes and communities in Rakhine state. The same goes for other ethnic peoples in states such as in Kachin and Shan.

The sinister plot, beginning in the mid-1970s, to drive away the Rohingya people from the places they have called their home for centuries is a dark legacy of the military dictatorship that terrorized the country since 1962.

Seeing the Rohingya people suffer at the hands of state security forces is abominable, to say the least. And now that a democratic light has flickered in the country, it is the duty of its elected leaders to fan that light into a blaze and stop the atrocities.

For a multicultural society like Myanmar, the greatest test of democracy is whether the government treats its minorities equal to the majority.

One of the erstwhile democracy icon Suu Kyi’s oft-quoted lines by activists goes: “The struggle for democracy and human rights in Burma is a struggle for life and dignity. It is a struggle that encompasses our political, social and economic aspirations.” We hope that as the leader of this nation with a new mandate, she becomes true and redeems herself in leading her people to genuine democracy and justice.

161,https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/amid-promising-developments-afghan-peace-talks-relentless-increase-violence,"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",ReliefWeb,"Amid Promising Developments in Afghan Peace Talks, Relentless Increase of Violence Putting Future Progress at Risk, Special Representative Warns Security Council - Afghanistan","SC/14391

Reporting on promising developments in peace talks between the Government of Afghanistan and its Taliban opposition, the top United Nations official for the country warned the Security Council during a 17 December videoconference meeting that future progress is imperilled by a relentless upsurge in violence which requires urgent international attention.

“I ask all countries to continue to pressure the parties to the conflict to bring about a sustained reduction in violence and expect that this will be a top priority in the negotiations,” Deborah Lyons, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Afghanistan and Head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), said as she opened the meeting. She thanked Qatar for hosting the talks and the United States and the host country support group — Germany, Indonesia, Norway and Uzbekistan — for their diplomatic efforts thus far.

Ms. Lyons said that, before agreeing on a 22-day recess in the talks earlier this week, the parties agreed to rules and procedures for negotiations, formed a working committee to discuss the agenda and presented initial topics for discussion. “These developments are an early but positive sign that both sides are willing and able to compromise when needed,” she said, expressing hope that the break will allow both sides to consult internally and externally and to resume negotiating with renewed commitment on 5 January 2021.

She reported, however, that, meanwhile, violence has skyrocketed in the country. In the last few months, improvised explosive devices caused over 60 per cent more civilian casualties and child casualties rose 25 per cent over previous periods. In addition, the ongoing security transition and the emerging reality of international troop withdrawals, have added to the deep anxieties felt by the population.

Stressing that any sustainable peace will need to be owned by Afghanistan’s diverse society, she said that achieving it will only be possible if security anxieties are addressed and the process is inclusive from the outset, with meaningful participation by women, youth, minorities, victims of conflict and religious leaders. She welcomed the recent formation of the High Council for National Reconciliation in that light. The Taliban, too, must expand their consultations with Afghan constituencies, she emphasized.

Regional cooperation will also be essential as peace unfolds, she added, including in the areas of trade, connectivity and counternarcotics efforts. She said that she noted a strong commitment among regional partners to such cooperation in recent visits and talks. UNAMA convened three high-level meetings in Geneva on regional cooperation the peace-security-development-humanitarian nexus, and the role of the Afghan private sector in peace and self-reliance.

At the 2020 Afghanistan Conference, in addition, she reported that the international community came together to reaffirm its financial support to Afghanistan. The generous pledges will enable Afghanistan to pursue its core development priorities and to deliver vital services to its people. The Conference also sent a clear message to people that the international community remains committed to peace, development and democracy in Afghanistan, a message echoed at the subsequent Organization of Islamic Cooperation’s (OIC) meeting in Niger.

She cautioned, however, that donors have made clear that their financial assistance comes with expectations of tangible improvements on peace, governance, rule of law, anti-corruption and human rights, especially women’s rights and protection of civilians and civil society leaders and media workers. At the same time, as the country is now facing a new wave of COVID-19, she encouraged the international community to continue their generous assistance for the pandemic.

She stressed that 2021 will be a pivotal year for Afghanistan, given the critical stage of peace negotiations and security transitions along with the socioeconomic challenges of COVID-19. “Clearly Afghanistan will continue to move forward; but equally will continue to need the dedicated support of this Council,” she said.

Dian Triansyah Djani (Indonesia), Chair of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1988 (2011), noted that the Committee’s main goal is to deter the Taliban from continuing to support Al-Qaida and its affiliates, as well as to deter Taliban attacks against the Afghanistan Government through the use of its sanction measures. The ongoing Afghanistan peace negotiations in Doha are encouraging, he said, expressing hope that the work of the 1988 Committee can support the creation of an environment conducive for lasting, sustainable peace. However, he also urged all States to conduct national reviews while remaining mindful that Taliban action — or the lack thereof — to further reduce violence, make sustained efforts to advance intra-Afghan negotiations, and otherwise cease to support activities threatening peace will affect the review. In its May report, the monitoring team noted that relations between the Taliban, especially the Haqqani Network, and Al-Qaida remain close. As such, securing the counter-terrorism gains to which the Taliban have committed will represent a challenge, as it would require them to deny groups, including Al‑Qaida, the use of Afghan territory as a source of international threats.

He went on to report that the Taliban’s ongoing profiting from narcotics will continue to pose a challenge, according to the team’s report. The scale of the problem has been further complicated by a boom in methamphetamine production and trafficking. Moreover, Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan suffered setbacks and was nearly eradicated from its main Afghan base in Nangarhar Province in November 2019. It also incurred further losses in its new refuge in neighbouring Kunar in early 2020. Taliban forces played a significant part in inflicting those defeats, as did the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces and their international allies. However, attacks throughout the year in Afghanistan’s provinces constitute stark reminders that the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan remains a threat, he observed.

Moreover, he noted that Afghanistan’s people still endure an active and deadly military campaign by the Taliban, as highlighted by the recent fighting in Helmand Province. As such, the overall effectiveness of the 1988 sanctions measures relies heavily on close coordination with the Afghanistan Government and regional Member States. In early 2020, the Committee’s monitoring team travelled the region to discuss the implementation of 1988 sanctions measures, as well as to conduct threat assessments. The team also met virtually with the National Security Advisor of Afghanistan in November to discuss the 1988 Committee mandate, he recalled.

Shkula Zadran, Afghan Youth Representative to the United Nations, recalling how she became a child refugee in Pakistan after her family left Afghanistan during the civil war in Kabul, said she is representing a generation born and raised in violence and conflict — one whose “dreams are being buried every day”. Speaking on behalf of those lost, she said that terrorists are afraid of Afghan youth and target educational institutions because they know that an educated and informed generation will never allow terrorism and extremism to grow in their country. She said her message to terrorists and those that support them is clear: “You tried to bury us; you didn’t know that we were seeds.”

Ms. Zadran, noting that most Afghan youth support the end of war through peace negotiations, cautioned that this peace must constitute more than just an immediate ceasefire — it must also ensure increased access to education, improved health‑care systems, vibrant civil society and leadership space for Afghan women. She said that, since the signing of the peace agreement between the Taliban and the United States, tension and conflict have increased, civilians are being killed and youth are targeted. Questioning why the Taliban is destroying public infrastructure if it wants a peaceful and prosperous country, she urged the Taliban not to destroy Afghanistan for the sake of others’ interests.

She stressed, however, that the Taliban is not the only party responsible for war crimes. International forces in Afghanistan with a mandate to maintain law and order and protect human rights and democracy have also committed such crimes — bombarding villages and homes instead of targeting terrorist training centres in Pakistan. She called on the international community to accept its mistakes, apologize to the Afghan people and avoid such inhumane acts in the future, before detailing measures demanded by Afghan youth to bring peace and maintain stability and order in Afghanistan. Calling on all leaders to trust the youth of Afghanistan, she said this group is “the patriot generation that you will never regret investing in and counting on”.

After those briefings, representatives of Council members took the floor, welcoming the progress made in talks between the Taliban and the Government in Afghanistan and urging that they continue. At the same time, they called strongly for an end to the rising violence, troubled by both the devastation caused to civilians and the threat to negotiations. Most speakers also stressed the need for significant participation of women and youth in the peace process, with many emphasizing that gains made in women’s rights should be strengthened and not weakened in the talks. Among other concerns voiced, speakers also pointed to the need to protect media workers, fight corruption and ensure adequate security reform during the transition of forces. Following Council members, the representatives of Afghanistan and Iran also made statements.

Germany’s representative echoed the view that 2020 brought about profound shifts in Afghanistan with the peace process gaining traction in Doha. However, violence in the country has reached new highs, making Afghanistan the least peaceful country in the world, he said, calling on the Council to form a united front to advance the peace process. Noting procedural developments within peace talks, he said all parties to the talks must use the coming month to identify avenues that can accelerate deliberations. He lamented that the Taliban continues conducting attacks while also engaging in the peace process and called for a comprehensive ceasefire, stressing that UNAMA must continue to safeguard the rights of victims in the country to foster sustainable development. He told the Council that at present the conditions needed to lift sanctions imposed on the Taliban do not exist.

The representative of Indonesia, speaking in his national capacity, told the Council that immediate action is needed to curb high levels of violence across the country and the mounting threats posed by Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/Da’esh). To that end, all parties must pursue a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire and engage in an inclusive political process. The effectiveness of such measures hinges on ensuring the participation of all segments of Afghan society, he said, underscoring that women and young people play an indispensable role in fostering stability. Sustainable peace and a regionally connected Afghanistan will yield greater economic integration and security, which will benefit everyone. He concluded by noting UNAMA’s tangible contributions on the ground to promote the peace process, reconciliation, protection of civilians and respect for human rights.

The speaker for France highlighted the need for inter-Afghan negotiations, recalling the importance of the women, peace and security agenda for lasting peace. The fight against terrorism must remain a priority, and as such, France condemns terrorist attacks on journalists which threaten freedom of expression in Afghanistan. The conflict has led to too many civilian victims and an immediate ceasefire is urgent in this regard. Moreover, the fight against drugs is also important, and drug production must be eradicated to guarantee lasting peace in Afghanistan. No progress towards peace will be possible unless the conflicting parties commit to negotiations, she emphasized, noting that the Taliban’s commitment in this regard remains to be demonstrated. Revisions to sanctions can only be considered if the Taliban renounces its activities that threaten peace, stability and security. She recalled the €1.2 billion pledge made by the European Union in November that will support modernization and development in Afghanistan over a four-year period, including in terms of the fight against corruption. However, this support is not unconditional, she pointed out, calling for respect for democratic gains made.

China’s representative said the Afghan peace and reconciliation process has entered a crucial period and welcomed the intra-Afghan talks launched in Doha. The next stage will feature substantive discussions and both sides must show more political wisdom and resolve. Afghan issues can only be resolved by political means, and as such, he expressed hope that both sides will consolidate and preserve the positive momentum during negotiations. Moreover, the international community should fully respect the will of the Afghan people and ensure an Afghan‑owned and Afghan-led process. Recalling that the 1988 Committee has played an important role contributing to peace and reconciliation, he expressed support for the renewal of its monitoring team’s mandate. He also noted that the number of violent incidents in October was the highest reported since 2007, and as such, called on all parties to respond positively to the Secretary-General’s call for a global ceasefire. As well, the withdrawal of foreign troops should be orderly and responsible in order to avoid leaving a security vacuum. Durable peace cannot be possible without economic and social development, he observed, describing a number of China-supported projects for youth in Afghanistan. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, China has also sent medical teams and equipment and will continue to provide support in this context.

Belgium’s representative expressed hope that the intra-Afghan negotiations will bring peace to the Afghan people, but underscored that progress achieved over the last two decades must be maintained — particularly on human rights and strengthening the position of women in the country. Turning to the issue of sanctions against the Taliban, she said that “nothing is automatic” and that delisting is contingent on satisfying the conditions of Council resolution 2513 (2020), including progress in negotiations and decreased violence. She condemned the high degree of violence against human rights defenders, journalists and civilians — particularly children — and welcomed UNAMA’s work on victim-centered justice. Affirming Belgium’s commitment to Afghan peace and prosperity, she added that Brussels has earmarked $8.4 million for acquiring vaccines and medical equipment for the Afghan army.

The speaker for the Russian Federation said that UNAMA plays an important role in coordinating international humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan. Noting that intra-Afghan negotiations have been delayed to 5 January 2021, she expressed hope that this pause will not halt progress between the parties. Turning to the security situation in Afghanistan, she said that the country is regularly shaken by terrorist attacks that have become an everyday occurrence for the Afghan people. ISIL/Da’esh is behind many such large-scale attacks, which is evidence that its Afghan wing continues to maintain its ability to commit terrorist acts throughout Central Asia. On the issue of sanctions, she said that extending the mandate of the monitoring team assisting the 1988 Committee will allow the team to continue providing the Committee with necessary assistance, but that resolving the issue of sanctions review should be discussed separately.

The representative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines expressed concern about the continuing high level of violence in Afghanistan, particularly in the country’s southern areas. The primary goal should be the prevention of violence and condemnation of terrorist attacks, she said, stressing that it is critical that the Afghan Government and the Taliban enhance their cooperation and negotiation efforts. In addition, climate fragility risks must be considered in the creation and implementation of policies, including those aimed at creating peace and stability in Afghanistan. Calling on international donors to honour their commitments in the country, she said improved development cooperation, enhanced trade and investment, and expanded economic opportunities for all Afghans are vital for lasting peace.

The speaker for Viet Nam said the continued support of UNAMA, regional countries and other international partners will be crucial to maintaining the momentum of peace talks in Afghanistan. He urged all parties to fully respect international humanitarian law, immediately stop targeting civilians and allow unhindered access to humanitarian services in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Strengthened efforts are also needed to combat the increasing presence of terrorist groups in the country, he said, emphasizing that long-term peace and stability require robust development and sustainable livelihoods for the people. In that regard, the Afghan Government and international partners should continue to work together in promoting economic development and reconstruction. He went on to express concern that 11.15 million people, more than one third of the country’s population, are facing high levels of food insecurity, and that number could increase to 13.15 million during the approaching cold‑weather months.

The representative of Niger, expressing concern over the increase of violence in Afghanistan, encouraged all stakeholders in the country to commit themselves to non-violence so that the critical peace process can make progress. Civil society, women, young people and journalists must be enabled to participate in that process to give it a firm basis. It is also crucial for the country to tackle security reform, corruption and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic to lay the groundwork for a stable and peaceful country, he emphasized.

The Dominican Republic’s representative, reaffirming support for the intra‑Afghan talks, said that dialogue must continue between the parties with input from all sectors of society. He stressed that women must participate fully, fairly and significantly at all stages of the peace process; their rights are not negotiable. Young people must also be included in shaping their future. Noting recent devastating attacks against civilians, he firmly condemned them, calling for those responsible to be brought to justice. He also called for a humanitarian ceasefire. Child protection, in addition, must be strengthened, and the Taliban must break their links with international terrorist organizations. Increased cooperation is needed by all stakeholders, including international partners, to face the humanitarian and peacebuilding challenges in Afghanistan and afford the negotiation process a chance to succeed.

Tunisia’s representative expressed deep concern about the continuing high level of violence and the security situation in Afghanistan. Recent attacks attributed to the Taliban, resulting in numerous casualties among Afghan forces, including 13 police officers on Wednesday, and the civilian population could seriously complicate negotiations. All parties must take necessary measures to prevent civilian casualties, he stressed, underlining the need to investigate violations of international humanitarian and international human rights law and hold perpetrators accountable. He expressed particular concern over the targeting of civil society and media organizations, the latest being the murder of journalist, as well as women and children’s rights defender, Malalai Maiwand, earlier this month. The Afghan National Defence and Security Forces should continue to be fully supported and more efforts should be made to fight drug trafficking, which continues to fuel the illicit economy and finance terrorist groups. The Taliban should end their attacks, honour their counterterrorism commitments and negotiate in good faith with the Government of Afghanistan, she said.

The speaker for the United States said that the people of Afghanistan continue to face terrible violence and strongly condemned attacks on human rights leaders, journalists, Government officials and others. “This violence must stop,” she stressed, calling for a comprehensive ceasefire. The two sides are capable of tackling difficult topics as they demonstrated in recent talks. That momentum must be maintained, and the parties must resume talks in January. Recalling the United States-Taliban agreement, she said United States force reductions remain condition-based and will continue to be implemented in consultation with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies and partners. Through support to security forces and delivery of critical aid, the United States has pledged $300 million in civilian assistance for 2021, she reported, noting that another $300 million may be available depending on progress made during the peace process. As such, she called on Afghanistan to follow through on plans for the return of refugees, recalling that the United States has provided $277 million in humanitarian assistance for internally displaced persons and returnees. Noting that nearly half of Afghan children face acute malnutrition, she added that the international community must increase funding for humanitarian aid. As such, the United States has provided more than $33 million towards the COVID-19 response in Afghanistan.

The representative of the United Kingdom recalled that Afghans took a significant step towards peace on 12 September with the start of negotiations in Doha. “It is vital that negotiations resume swiftly in January,” she said, noting that a challenging process lies ahead. A successful outcome will require a long process of building trust, finding common ground and compromise. However, appalling levels of violence continue in Afghanistan, with the Taliban responsible for most of it. “The Taliban claims to want a part in Afghanistan’s future,” she said, adding that this requires an end to violence, as well as a permanent break from terrorism, including from Al-Qaida. The outcome of the peace negotiations is for Afghans to decide, she pointed out, noting that the parties must recognize that Afghanistan is not the place it was 20 years ago. A peace settlement must be inclusive and preserve the rights and freedoms of all Afghans, including women, youth and minorities. As well, to maintain international support, the new Afghanistan must adhere to treaty obligations, including those regarding human rights. She also reported that, in November, the United Kingdom pledged $207 million in development assistance for Afghanistan for 2021.

Estonia’s representative noted a 38 per cent increase in armed clashes in Afghanistan over the past year, with civilians bearing the brunt of the violence. As such, UNAMA must be given the resources to ensure the perpetrators of attacks on civilians are brought to justice and that children who suffer from the conflict receive all necessary assistance. All parties to the conflict must incorporate a victim-centered approach to the political process, he said, adding that the number of people in Afghanistan requiring humanitarian assistance has climbed to 18.4 million. “We reiterate our call for an immediate, permanent and comprehensive ceasefire,” he stated, underscoring to the Council that 2021 presents a momentous opportunity for Afghanistan to move closer to long‑awaited peace and stability.

The representative of South Africa, Council President for December, speaking in his national capacity, welcomed the launch of the Afghan peace negotiations in September and the ongoing discussions, and urged all parties to continue building on this momentum towards a just, durable and inclusive peace. Moreover, the peace process must be Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and inclusive of all Afghans and the progress and gains made in women and girl’s rights must be preserved. On the security situation, he expressed regret about the soaring rates of violence and related high civilian casualties, stressing that hostilities by all parties must be brought to an end. In order for the Afghan peace talks to be effective, a cessation of violence and hostilities is necessary to create an environment conducive for meaningful progress. In particular, all those responsible for acts of grave violations, particularly against children, women and the most vulnerable in Afghanistan, should be brought to justice and held accountable. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change and the long conflict have all contributed to a dire humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, he pointed out.

Afghanistan’s representative, recalling the General Assembly’s recent adoption of a resolution on the situation in her country, said that this landmark document underlined the immediate need for a permanent ceasefire and supported the long-lasting peace, stability and prosperity that every Afghan desires. She cautioned against changing existing sanctions’ mechanisms for the Taliban, stressing that such mechanisms should not be considered incentives for peace; rather, they are reflections of reality. The security situation in Afghanistan remains highly volatile for civilians, and the Taliban is engaging in targeted killings, attacks against public infrastructure and the use of human shields. Adding that 18.4 million Afghans urgently require humanitarian assistance, she asked the international community to fully fund the $1.3 billion humanitarian response plan for her country.

She then thanked the Security Council for extending the mandate of the monitoring team assisting the 1988 Committee, but expressed regret that Afghanistan’s concerns and reservations were not fully considered on this matter. Nevertheless, any leniency regarding sanctions against the Taliban — without real progress and reciprocity from that — will be counterproductive and detrimental to peace negotiations. Noting that intra-Afghan negotiations will resume on 5 January 2021, she said that the Government is ready to begin discussing agenda items that will pave the way for a dignified, sustainable peace and pointed to several Government initiatives aimed at protecting and promoting the human rights of the Afghan people.

The representative of Iran, emphasizing the bonds between his country and Afghanistan, stated that: “We consider Afghanistan’s stability as our own stability”. In that context, he affirmed the importance of a comprehensive, Afghan-led peace process involving all factions, including the Taliban, supported by neighbouring, regional and international partners. He also called for more engagement of the United Nations in the process and signalled his country’s readiness to further contribute in that context. The process must build on all past achievements and continue the commitment to fight terrorism, he added. It will not progress, however, until the Taliban halts its attacks against Afghan security forces. Maintaining that the presence of foreign forces is another source of Afghanistan’s instability, he cautioned, however, that their withdrawal must be done responsibly in concert with the strengthening of the National Afghan Defence and Security Forces. Effective assistance must also be extended to Afghanistan in combating the illicit production and trafficking of narcotic drugs and improving economic conditions. For its part, despite what he called “a savage [United States] economic war”, his country is hosting millions of Afghan refugees and pursuing economic cooperation with the country, most recently with the inauguration of the Khaf-Herat railway, and is committed to further enhancing mutual relations.

For information media. Not an official record.","The ongoing Afghanistan peace negotiations in Doha are encouraging, he said, expressing hope that the work of the 1988 Committee can support the creation of an environment conducive for lasting, sustainable peace.
Germany’s representative echoed the view that 2020 brought about profound shifts in Afghanistan with the peace process gaining traction in Doha.
China’s representative said the Afghan peace and reconciliation process has entered a crucial period and welcomed the intra-Afghan talks launched in Doha.
Affirming Belgium’s commitment to Afghan peace and prosperity, she added that Brussels has earmarked $8.4 million for acquiring vaccines and medical equipment for the Afghan army.
He stressed that women must participate fully, fairly and significantly at all stages of the peace process; their rights are not negotiable."
162,https://www.openglobalrights.org/long-termist-human-rights/,"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",OpenGlobalRights,From Barbuda to the World: Love (and Peace and Happiness) in the Time of Climate Emergency,"“The future is already here. It’s just not evenly distributed yet,” the sci-fi writer William Gibson has famously said. For a peek into the future of human rights in a warming planet, there are few better places than the small Caribbean island of Barbuda. Barbuda is a microcosm of larger trends and issues – from climate-induced displacement and disaster capitalism, to greenwashing of policies that undermine climate resilience. If this future is to be avoided in Barbuda and elsewhere, the world must pay close attention to current developments in the island whose stunning calm and beauty made it Princess Diana’s favorite vacation spot and inspired Robert de Niro to call his planned luxury tourism project there, “Paradise Found.”

The first thing to note is the government’s double standard. In early December, 2020, the central government of Antigua and Barbuda, located on the island of Antigua, virtually convened a meeting of the Latin American and Caribbean states that had signed the landmark Escazú Agreement in 2018. This binding treaty guarantees public participation in significant decisions about the environment, rights to information and access to justice in environmental matters. It also offers important protections for environmental activists, who face acute risks across the continent.

The government self-identifies as “one of the front runners within the region with a progressive climate agenda,” recently receiving $39.4 million from the Green Climate Fund. When the Category-5 Hurricane Irma decimated Barbuda in 2017, a smaller island located 40 miles north of Antigua, Prime Minister Gaston Browne said “Three years from now, we’ll be having a different conversation; we’ll be looking at a Barbuda that’s climate-resilient, that’s totally green.”

Three years later, the conversation is very different. While championing the Escazú Agreement, PM Browne is simultaneously rolling out plans to transform Barbuda’s 62 square miles into a haven for luxury hotels and sprawling estates for billionaires, all the while dismissing strong opposition from locals and violating basic human rights protected by the Escazú Agreement and international law -- including Barbudans’ right to have a say in decisions affecting their lives and lands.

Since the time of slavery under British colonial rule, Barbudans and Antiguans have lived very differently. While Antigua’s economy is fueled by large-scale tourism, like most of the Caribbean, all land in Barbuda is “owned in common by the people of Barbuda,” and “no land in Barbuda [can] be sold” – a centuries old system formally recognized in these words of the Barbuda Land Act of 2007. Barbudan culture and identity is intimately tied to the land. Barbudans steward their dry, limestone island in balance with its delicate ecology: harvesting lobster, hunting, implementing slash and burn farming techniques and allowing select eco-tourism projects through its local governance mechanism, the Barbuda Council.

Today, Barbuda’s past and future identity hang in the balance.

After Hurricane Irma hit in September 2017, the central government evacuated all 1,800 Barbuans to Antigua. It was necessary, they said, because a second storm was imminent. When no storm arrived, armed military personnel continued to seek out and remove those who wished to remain and rebuild. Barbudans remained on Antigua for several months, while their possessions rotted from the salt and sun.

Within days of the evacuation, developers and construction crews arrived and began round-the-clock work on an international airport a third of the size of New York’s LaGuardia, without any environmental assessment. “That’s when we realized that the government wasn’t interested in having Barbudans back,” told us John Mussington, an activist and Principal of Barbuda’s secondary school, “they wanted to redevelop the island as a private real estate venture.”

This is the second feature of Barbuda’s story that encapsulates future challenges for human rights in the climate crisis. As Naomi Klein has written, this is disaster capitalism for the twenty-first century: the use of a crisis and military force to enact economic reforms that would not have been possible under normal circumstances.

Within months of the hurricane, the government summarily repealed the communal land protections of the 2007 Barbuda Land Act. The scope of the development since then is striking, especially given pending legal challenges to this repeal and to several individual projects. Much of the development is inside Codrington Lagoon National Park, a wetland protected under the Ramsar Convention. As the below map shows, the projects cover most of the island’s Caribbean side.

(Figure 1: Developer’s map of planned projects / Source: Uknown; Figure 2: Map of projects currently in process and Ramsar protected areas / Source: Dr. Rebecca Boger)

One development is “Peace, Love and Happiness,” funded by American business magnates Steve Anderson and Jean Paul DeJoria. This project alone, for which construction is well underway, covers 650 acres of the National Park, nearly 2% of the island. The proposal includes around 500 homes, golf courses and a marina within the Codrington Lagoon to harbor the mega-yachts of the rich.

Meanwhile, the central government has extended little peace, love and happiness to Barbudans. “Those who may intend to become economic terrorists in this country, they would have to face the full extent of the law for any infractions whatsoever,” said PM Browne in 2015. This is how he referred to those opposing his plans for the “Disneyfication of Barbuda,” as environmental anthropologist Sophia Perdirakis called the reforms in a webinar organized by the Climate Litigation Accelerator at the New York University School of Law’s Center for Human Rights and Global Justice. This is a remarkable contradiction for a government presenting itself as a champion of a treaty (Escazú) whose original contribution to international law is the protection of environmental defenders’ rights.

The contradiction has recently sharpened. In July 2020, after Barbuda's only member of parliament Trevor Walker attended a protest against PLH, PM Browne told the press “Anytime they do anything illegal over there I am sending the police and army … I rather fight them and resign than to turn a blind eye.” In September 2020, at another peaceful protest against PLH, two Barbudan Councilmembers were arrested and charged with trespass and breaking COVID rules for not wearing facemasks.

The third warning Barbuda offers for the future is the following: just as the climate crisis presents an existential threat to human rights, human rights violations open the door to environmental deterioration and further global warming. According to the Global Coral Reef Alliance, the projects in Barbuda “will cause significant, and probably irreversible, deterioration of water quality in Codrington Lagoon, Barbuda’s major fish nursery ground.” The golf courses, resorts and houses will consume land essential for farming, animal breeding and pasture, and protected species. The developments need vast amounts of fresh water, requiring large-scale desalinization, a process that generates a toxic sludge that can seriously damage coral and sea life. Replacing mangroves, sedges and wetlands with shore-line structures will drastically weaken Barbuda’s resilience to sea level rise and other extreme weather events that will intensify yearly, as the 2020 hurricane season laid bare.

Today, Barbuda’s past and future identity hang in the balance. If the government is to take seriously its proffered commitment to international human rights, the environment and future generations, it needs to respect “communal land rights and conserve Barbuda's heritage, culture and environment,” as the Barbuda Silent No More movement has demanded.

The rest of the world should be paying close attention. Barbuda's fate, for better or for worse, will be evenly distributed across the world before too long.","For a peek into the future of human rights in a warming planet, there are few better places than the small Caribbean island of Barbuda.

As per our prior December 16 urgent action, below you will find concerning rights situations requiring your attention and action.

Black U.S. Actor and Activist Assaulted by Police in Cartagena (Bolívar)

On December 15, police officers in Cartagena, Bolívar department assaulted Kendrick Sampson—a Black U.S. actor and Black Lives Matter Activist. A video of the incident circulated through social media, which showed a uniformed officer harassing Kendrick, punching him in the face, and pulling a gun on him. The police officers then withheld Kendrick’s documents and detained him at a police station for several hours.

The Afro-Colombian Labor Council (Consejo Laboral Afrocolombiano, CLAF) denounced the incident on December 17 and noted that it draws attention to systemic racist policing and an excessive use of force by the police against Black Colombians, including individuals like lawyer Dr. Alcides Arrieta; physician Dr. Benjamín Luna; community leader Miguel Salgado; and young athlete Harold David Morales, who was killed. The statement also indicated that racist mistreatment and abuse is prevalent among police ranks in Colombia. The CLAF called for a national dialogue to address and transform this systemic racial abuse and violence.

On December 17, WOLA published a Twitter thread addressing this episode of police brutality. It discussed how disproportionate and sometimes lethal use of force by Colombian police—especially against Black Colombians—is a structural problem. To take a basic first step in supporting police reform in Colombia, and to better protect Black and Indigenous Colombians, the United States should place a moratorium on sales of crowd control weapons until the Mobile Anti-Disturbance Squadron (Escuadrón Móvil Antidisturbios, ESMAD) has either been replaced or undergone a full overhaul.

Female Afro-Colombian Displaced Leaders at Risk (Valle del Cauca)

On December 22, WOLA, the National Association of Internally Displaced Afro-Colombians (AFRODES), and the International Institute for Race and Equality urged U.S. policymakers to guarantee the safety and security of AFRODES leaders in Cali. Among the targeted are Silvia Helen Rodríguez Quintero and Ruby Cortes Castro.

Quintero is the president of the Community Action Group in the Villa San Marcos neighborhood of Cali and the legal representative of the Arts and Trades Foundation for Vulnerable Afro-descendant Women (Fundación de Artes Y Oficios para Mujeres Vulnerables Afrodescendientes), one of AFRODES’ member organizations. On December 10, Silvia suffered an attempt on her life at the Foundation’s soup kitchen, narrowly surviving a bullet wound to her neck. She is now recovering at a secure location provided by the Secretary for Public Security and Justice of the Office of the Mayor of Cali. The Secretary’s office provides such protection for 15 days, with the possibility of another 15 days’ extension; however, the level of protection offered is not sufficient given the immediate threat to Silvia’s life.

AFRODES leader in Cali, Ruby Cortes Castro is the mother of Jair Andrés Cortes, who was killed along with four other young men in the August 11 Llano Verde massacre. After speaking out, Ruby received a death threat on September 4 in the form of a pamphlet at her home warning her to “keep her mouth shut” and stop seeking justice for her son. Ruby reported the threat to the Attorney General on September 5 and requested protection from the National Protection Unit on October 1st. To date, she has received no response from the Unit. Please read the full letter for recommendations made on steps required to provide both women with protection to guarantee their safety.

Defend the Peace Coalition Urges UN Security Council to Advance Peace

On November 24—four years after the signing of the 2016 peace accord between the Colombian State and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)—Defend the Peace Colombia (Defendamos la Paz Colombia, DLP) published a statement addressed to Ambassadors before the United Nations Security Council. DLP, a broad coalition composed of many sectors of Colombian civil society and of which WOLA forms part, urged the Security Council to demand a greater commitment by the Colombian government to the peace accord’s implementation.

DLP’s statement expressed deep concern with ongoing threats against the physical and legal security of FARC ex-combatants, the assassinations of social leaders, and a disturbing trend of massacres. Rather than taking the measures in the accord to prevent and condemn violence in the territories, the government uses the violence as an excuse to deepen its campaign to discredit the peace process. The coalition notes in international settings like the UN, the government sustains a pro-peace discourse while simultaneously engaging in anti-peace discourse inside Colombia. The window of opportunity for peace remains open. DLP trusts in the Security Council’s cooperation to use existing mechanisms to verify and defend human rights throughout this path to peace and to demand the Colombian government hold to its commitments.

Ethnic Commission Demands Implementation of Peace with an Ethnic Focus

On November 24, the Colombian Ethnic Commission for Peace and Defense of Territorial Rights (Comisión Étnica para la Paz y la Defensa de los Derechos Territoriales) urged for the full and comprehensive implementation of the 2016 peace accord with a focus on the Ethnic Chapter. Armed actors have assassinated over 1,065 social leaders since the accord was signed, of which 287 were Indigenous peoples and 75 Afro-descendants. Over 850 of these assassinations occurred under the Duque administration, and as of the publication of this statement, over 77 massacres have taken place in 2020. Different paramilitary groups continue to execute systematic threats and enjoy impunity.

The Commission pleads with all sectors of civil society to pressure the government to resume the Ethnic Chapter’s implementation framework. According to the Commission’s latest report, only 10% of implementation indicators have been fully complied with. Though the government claims differently, its data does not reflect the realities on the ground. The Commission asks for the international community’s accompaniment to ensure peace reaches the communities most affected by violence.

Communities Affected by Violence Reiterate Call for Global Humanitarian Accord

On November 25, the Inter-Ecclesial Commission for Justice and Peace (Comisión Intereclesial de Justicia y Paz, CIJP), alongside urban and rural communities that form part of the #SomosGénesis movement, reiterated their call for a Global Humanitarian Accord and welcomed the Putumayo Regional Table of Social Organizations (Mesa Regional de Organizaciones Sociales, MEROS) to the peace movement. Since March, the organizations have urged for a humanitarian accord, which was initiated in the face of a peace process in crisis due to the government’s failure to comply with implementation and further dialogue. As violence continues to increase in the territories, the communities plead for humanitarian efforts and plan to coordinate communication with the United Nations Security Council.

Killings of Human Rights Defenders in 2020 Exceed Total in 2019

On November 26, Somos Defensores, a non-governmental organization that documents attacks and killings of human rights defenders and social leaders, reported on its July to September 2020 data. The organization’s data reveals 40 human rights defenders were killed, in 15 departments of Colombia, between July and September. The number of murders stood at 135 by the end of September. Somos Defensores’ tally surpassed its figure for all of 2019, 124, in August. Counting all types of aggression for which a responsible party can be alleged, neo-paramilitary groups are believed responsible for 54 attacks, FARC dissidents for 20, the ELN for 11, and the security forces for 8.

Social Leader Killed in Home (Antioquia)

On December 17, armed men assassinated social leader Alirio de Jesús Serna Sierra, a community projects manager in Andes, Antioquia department. Caracol Radio reported Alirio had not received prior threats before the armed men arrived at his home and shot him dead. The attack also injured an elderly person. His wife, President of the La Esperanza hamlet community action board, was not home at the time of the attack and currently fears for her life.

Afro-Colombian Female Social Leader Assassinated (Cauca)

On December 16, as reported by Communities Constructing Peace in Colombia (Comunidades Construyendo Paz en Colombia, Conpazcol), armed men assassinated Afro-Colombian female leader María Adriana Díaz León. The armed men ambushed and shot her dead as she climbed onto a motorcycle in Santander de Quilichao, Cauca department.

Female Defender Killed, Another Eight Female Defenders at Risk (Antioquia)

On December 11, Elizabeth Betancur, a rights defender with the National Network of Community Women of Colombia (Red Nacional de Mujeres Comunales de Colombia), was killed in El Atajo located within the municipality of Yolombo in Antioquia department. The Inter-American Commission for Human Rights (IACHR) condemned her death. The regional organism urged the Colombian State to investigate both the material and intellectual authors of this crime.

At the same time, activists involved in the Ríos Vivos Movement reported increased threats against eight female environmental defenders in the areas affected by the Ituango hydroelectric dam in particular the municipalities of Valdivia, Tarazá, Nechí, and Cáceres where armed groups have a strong presence. According to Isabel Zuleta, the President of the Ríos Vivos Movement, threats against female leaders are particularly aggressive. The increased insecurity faced by these leaders is due to advances made by the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (Jurisdicción Especial para la Paz, JEP) in attempting to clarify what occurred to potential victims of forced disappearances whose remains are buried in the area under Hidroituango’s influence. The week of December 11, five bodies located in the Orobajo de Sabanalarga cemetery with signs of violence were transported to a lab for forensic analysis. In 2020, eight bodies in similar conditions were found.

Social Leader Murdered in His Home (Valle del Cauca)

On December 6, Joaquín Antonio Ramírez, leader with the Community Council of the Pacific Cimarrones (Consejo Comunitario Pacífico Cimarrónes Cisneros), died due to bullet wounds fired at the hands of armed men. This occurred in El Credo near Cisneros in Buenaventura municipality.

Indigenous Governor Assassinated by Paramilitaries (Chocó)

On December 3, alleged Gulf Clan paramilitaries kidnapped, tortured, and later killed Indigenous Governor Miguel Tapí Tito in Bahía Solano municipality, Chocó department. Ombudsman Carlos Camargo Assis denounced the assassination and incursion and noted that authorities have been unable to recover Governor Tito’s body due to conditions in the area. Earlier this year in April, the Ombudsman had issued an alert about the critical situation of Indigenous communities in the region, and as of then, over 195 families—more than 900 people—have been internally displaced.

Armed Men Kill Indigenous Man (Cauca)

On November 30, the Association of Indigenous Councils of Northern Cauca (Asociación de Cabildos Indígenas del Norte del Cauca, ACIN) condemned the assassination of Romelio Ramos Cuetia, a 31-year-old Indigenous resident, father with two children, and farmworker of the Alejandría village of the Cerro Tijeras reservation. A group of armed men shot and killed Romelio in a rural area of the Suárez municipality. Authorities ruled out the crime as a theft gone wrong since his motorcycle and belongings were found at the scene. ACIN reiterated the critical humanitarian crisis occurring in Cauca department and appealed to human rights organizations for urgent action.

Man Assassinated by Alleged Paramilitaries (Sucre)

On November 24, unknown armed men on motorcycles assassinated Jorge Armando Tous with a gunshot to his forehead. The crime occurred in the Toluviejo hamlet, Sucre department, which borders Montes de María. Members of the community believe the Gulf Clan paramilitary group, known to conduct its operations in this region, were responsible for Jorge’s assassination. Human rights organizations and leaders in the region demand investigations, as well as truth, reparations, and justice in the face of persisting violence and impunity.

Social Leader and Family Internally Displaced After Murder Attempt (North Santander)

On December 7, Caracol Radio reported social leader Alexander Donado Quintero and his family were internally displaced following an assassination attempt. Alexander is a member of the Movement for the Popular Constituent (Movimiento para la Constituyente Popular, MCP), Vice President of the Brisas del Porvenir neighborhood in the El Tarra municipality, and member of the Alternative Indigenous and Social Movement (Movimiento Alternativo Indígena y Social) political party. He fears for his life because of the work he has developed as a social leader in the region and pleads to authorities to investigate the sources of the threat, as he has no personal issues with people or armed groups. With little protection from state authorities for social leaders, Alexander felt forced to flee.

Paramilitaries Threaten Environmental Defenders in Magdalena Medio (Antioquia)

Between November 4 and 5, using widely-distributed pamphlets, the Magdalena Medio Bloc of the Black Eagles paramilitary group threatened to assassinate over 18 environmental defenders giving them 24 hours to flee the area. The defenders are engaged in raising awareness of environmental damage and its links to corruption in the Magdalena Medio, a resource-rich region.

In September 2020, to determine its environmental impacts and viability, the Colombian government began a process to select companies and grant contracts for fracking pilot projects in the Magdalena Medio. ECOPETROL, in alliance with ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, PAREX, and the mining company Drummond, expressed interest in the projects. As this process proceeds, environmentalists have continued to indicate that fracking will cause serious social and environmental problems. The recent threats by the Black Eagle paramilitaries coincide with the civil society decision-making processes that will affect the interests of extractive companies planning to undertake significant operations in the region.

The international community is called upon to urge the Colombian State to:

Fulfill its responsibility in protecting environmental defenders

Guarantee ethnic communities’ right to prior, free, and informed consultations

Effectively dismantle paramilitary groups and clarify potential ties with extractive companies

Ratify the Escazú Agreement as a show of political will to acknowledge and protect those who defend the environment

Maximize political and financial support for transitional justice mechanisms

Encourage the National Protection Unit to grant the necessary measures that they agreed upon for at-risk environmental defenders

Paramilitaries Threaten to Kill Social Leaders Promoting Coca Crop Substitution (Chocó)

On December 11, CIJP confirmed the existence of plans by Gulf Clan paramilitaries to assassinate social leaders Argemiro Bailarín and Jaime Mecheche. According to CIJP, on December 5, community members who live along the Jiguamiadó river basin in Chocó department spotted 15 paramilitaries with large weapons inspecting the area. The paramilitaries approached a resident and announced their intention to enter the Embera Indigenous Peoples’ Alto Guayabal reservation to assassinate leaders who approved the eradication of more than 150 hectares of coca crops in August 2020. On December 8, Jaime received a phone call from the paramilitaries threatening to kill him and Argemiro. Strategic and appropriate protection measures are needed for Colombian social leaders, especially amid the pandemic.

Social Leaders Arbitrarily Detained by State Authorities Granted Freedom by Judge (Bolívar, Meta, and Nariño)

Between December 15 and 16, state authorities arbitrarily detained three prominent social leaders—Teófilo Acuña, Adelso Gallo, and Robert Daza Guevara—in the Bolívar, Meta, and Nariño departments, respectively. The three men are social leaders who have dedicated their lives to defending their territories through grassroots advocacy. According to the statement published by the People’s Congress (Congreso de los Pueblos), the Colombian government uses state institutions to undertake unfounded prosecutions of social leaders, who then have to defend themselves against trumped-up charges for carrying out their community-building work. Armed actors continue to assassinate social leaders in various regions of the country, and rather than protect their at-risk lives, the Colombian government stigmatizes and criminalizes their work.

National and international civil society organizations joined in solidarity to call for their freedom and to redirect the government’s efforts to effectively address the killings and massacres of social leaders. On December 21, the judge presiding over the case granted the three defendants their freedom, ruling they are not threats to society. The judge also ordered an investigation into the irregularities carried out by Duque administration officials in the case.

Armed Group Intercepts and Steals Vehicles of Black Community Leaders (Cauca)

On November 28, an unidentified armed group with large weapons intercepted two protection vehicles assigned to directors of the Association of Community Councils of Northern Cauca (Asociación de Consejos Comunitarios del Norte del Cauca, ACONC). The bodyguards driving were stripped of their weapons and forced to hand over the protection vehicles, identified by license plates GCT465 and GLM275, to the armed men. Fortunately, no one was harmed. However, ACONC vehemently rejects these violent actions that threaten the physical, mental, and emotional well-being of ACONC members and Black people in general. They are calling for an investigation into this incident and that authorities provide adequate guarantees for protecting the life and ancestral territory of the Black People of northern Cauca.

LGBT+ Community Target of Grave Violations (Nariño)

On November 26, Colombia Diversa—an LGBT+ rights organization—issued an alert to the international community about the grave human rights violations occurring against Afro-Colombian LGBT+ people, as well as the lack of security guarantees for armed conflict victims in Tumaco. The alert outlined incidents like extortions against LGBT+ business owners, threats against members of local LGBT+ organization Afro-Colombian Rainbow Foundation (Fundación Afrocolombiana Arco Iris), six beatings of gay men and trans women in public, and at least four homicides of LGBT+ persons committed by alleged members of illegal armed groups. Colombia Diversa noted that some victims of the recent spate of attacks have also suffered conflict-related violence in the past.

This violence is not investigated, prosecuted, or punished, and LGBT+ victims receive no protection or support from authorities. Colombia Diversa expressed concern that the government’s inaction and the increasing militarization of the municipality could also hinder participation in the transitional justice system. The organization calls on the international community to incorporate an LGBT+ perspective with discussions and actions on human rights and peace accord implementation in Colombia and to press the government to investigate, prosecute, and punish those responsible for these grave violations.

Southwestern Department Faces Increased Political Violence (Cauca)

On December 17, the Cauca Coordination of Social Organizations denounced the increased political violence occurring in Cauca department, located in southwestern Colombia. Of the 85 massacres and 291 assassinations of social leaders reported in Colombia this year, 25 massacres, 145 assassinations of social leaders, and 90 assassinations of FARC ex-combatants occurred in Cauca. The statement claims the Duque administration’s policies to address the armed conflict work against the people of Cauca; the government stigmatizes, persecutes, and imprisons people who defend human rights, and responds to the right to protest with increased militarization. It also made mention of the three social leaders—Teófilo Acuña, Adelso Gallo, and Robert Daza Guevara—recently detained with trumped-up charges. The coalition called for continued social mobilization, as well as solidarity to peacefully resist the government’s increased militarization and its legal prosecutions that attempt to instill fear.

Truth Commission Condemns Violence Affecting Ethnic Communities (Cauca)

On December 6, Colombia’s Truth Commission fervently condemned the violence affecting the livelihoods of Afro-Colombians, Indigenous, and campesinos in the northern region of Cauca department. Between December 5 and 6, in less than 12 hours, four violent incidents occurred including a massacre; two homicides of community members, among them the son of an Indigenous leader; an individual threat against an Indigenous Guard coordinator; and a collective threat against ACIN. As of the publication of the statement, 12 massacres have occurred in Cauca department this year, as well as the systematic assassinations of social leaders, human rights defenders, and former combatants participating in the peace process’ reintegration program. The Commission expresses solidarity with the entire population of northern Cauca.

As part of its mandate to ensure non-repetition of the armed conflict, the Commission has gathered information that reveals the multiple alliances of armed, economic, and political actors in the region that go beyond issues of drug trafficking. As such, the Commission calls on state authorities at all levels to come together to protect the lives affected by ongoing violence by investigating and sanctioning all actors responsible.

Environmental Defender in Need of Protection (Putumayo)

On December 15, Peace Brigades International (PBI) issued a call to action to protect the life and integrity of human rights and environmental defender Jani Silva. Silva persistently fights for the conservation of the Amazon ecosystem and the rights of campesinos in Putumayo department. Oil slicks pollute the soil and drinking water of hundreds of farmers, animals, and plants, which is why Silva has campaigned for years against oil extraction. In 2017, as a result of death threats in response to this work, Silva and her family were internally displaced from their community. These death threats from illegal groups, the military, drug traffickers, and multinational companies have not stopped, underscoring how Colombia is the most dangerous place in the Americas to be an environmental defender.

Paramilitary Group Threatens Environmental Defender (Santander)

On December 1, members of the ‘Caparrapos’ paramilitary group threatened environmental social leader Nini Johana Cárdenas of the El Carmen de Chucurí municipality. On two separate phone calls, Caparrapos paramilitaries, who identified themselves as Commander ‘Bajirá’ and ‘Michael Sierra,’ berated Cárdenas for her work as president of a regional village’s community action board. They informed Cárdenas that paramilitary members were ready to assassinate social leaders who did not comply with their policies, threatened her family, and advised that she leave the region if she planned to not comply. Cárdenas works to raise awareness about the effects of resource extraction in the region and also conducts research on bee pollination. Multiple human rights organizations in the region denounced the threats and urged Santander Governor Mauricio Aguilar and Secretary of Interior Camilo Arenas, the Attorney General, the Ombudsman’s office, the armed forces, and the police to provide effective protection to Cárdenas.

Indigenous File Complaint Against Armed Incursion (La Guajira)

On December 15, representatives from the Porciosa and Damasco Indigenous communities filed a complaint with the Attorney General’s office against an armed group made up of 17 Wayuu Indigenous men. The armed group entered the Porciosa community in the morning of December 15 and shot at homes. The incident ignited panic in the community, as a previous incident killed two people and hurt two others, among them an authority from the Porciosa community. The Colombian State has not responded despite numerous complaints spanning back several years, which Indigenous authorities continue filing for the government to grant appropriate protection.

Buenaventura Strike Committee Members at Grave Risk (Valle del Cauca)

On November 23, in a statement to President Iván Duque, the International Office for Human Rights Action on Colombia (Oficina Internacional de Derechos Humanos Acción Colombia, Oidhaco) issued an alert about the adverse security situation of at least three people from the Buenaventura Strike Committee including Leyla Andrea Arroyo—social leader from the Black Communities Process of Colombia (Proceso de Comunidades Negras de Colombia, PCN), John Janer Panameño—President of the Isla de La Paz neighborhood community action board, and Danelly Estupiñan—prominent social leader from PCN, as well as Adriel Ruíz Galván—Coordinator of the Foundation for Coexistence and Social Development (Fundación Espacios de Convivencia y Desarrollo Social, FUNDESCODES).

Arroyo recently received a death threat from unknown armed men at a restaurant she frequents often. Panameño has recorded surveillance against him and has received death threats to his phone. Estupiñan has also recorded persistent surveillance and threats, and as a result, has internally displaced. On November 2, Galván received death threats through the messaging application WhatsApp, among many threats since June. Deeply concerning, the Oidhaco statement noted that ethnic social leaders made up 65% of recorded assassinations in 2019, and this number has risen since.

Oidhaco urges the Duque administration to:

Guarantee comprehensive and immediate investigations by the Attorney General’s office into these matters

Enforce comprehensive protection measures for the affected individuals

Implement the 2016 peace accord

Protect social leaders, especially women social leaders who face gender-specific risks

Implement the 2017 Buenaventura Strike deal

To halt the dredging of the San Antonio Estuary

Rights Organizations Denounce Controversial Ombudsman Appointment (Atlantic)

On November 24, several human rights organizations in the Atlantic department denounced the appointment of Carlos Julio Manzano as Ombudsman for the region and vowed to sever ties and communication with the office until his appointment is reversed. The organizations noted that Manzano’s involvement in various corruption scandals, such as the multimillion dollars embezzlement of FoncolPuertos, and his numerous entanglements with the Colombian justice system cast serious doubts on his ability to transparently take on the human rights work at the institution. His appointment not only demonstrates the national government’s intention to continue taking over all forums and institutions for the interests of the ruling party but also to continue weakening the rule of law. Following public outcry, Manzano submitted his resignation on December 4.

San José de Apartadó Peace Community Suffers Ongoing Violations (Antioquia)

On November 15, alleged paramilitaries—from Nuevo Antioquia, Turbo municipality—initiated a fight at a public establishment in San José. A Campesino community member was injured. Police officers stopped the fight and confiscated weapons from those at the scene. However, the weapons seized by the police officers were later returned to two well-known paramilitaries in the region, identified by aliases ‘Deiner’ and ‘Sebastian’. Witnesses and community members are deeply concerned about this close coordination between public forces and paramilitaries, which according to them, occurs often.

On November 18, the SJA peace community received the Constitutional Court’s ruling T-342/20. Judges Alejandro Linares, Antonio José Lizarazo, and Luis Guillermo Guerrero decided the final verdict. The ruling reviewed a lawsuit the community had filed two years prior—on September 28, 2018—against the Military’s XVII Brigade. The final ruling concluded that the lawsuit slandered the reputation of the XVII Brigade and the complaints “did not have the support of binding legal sentences.” According to the SJA community, this ruling goes against legal precedents that have previously defended victims’ rights and contradicts decisions made by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, declarations made in the United Nations General Assembly, and statements published by the United Nations Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression. There is an abundant chain of complaints and convictions for human rights violations by the XVII Brigade, and the SJA community denounced the ruling as a blow to the credibility of legal institutions for victims.

On November 21, SJA community members found Eliécer Morales badly injured on a road near the community, close to the La Victoria hamlet. Eliécer died in the hospital a few days later from the injuries sustained. Though some believe he fell off his mule, others allege he was attacked.

On November 22, Reinaldo Areiza David—a founding member of the SJA peace community— died in the village of La Union after drinking counterfeit liquor. Reinaldo had denounced the February 2005 massacre of SJA peace community leaders and children in the Mulatos and Resbalosa hamlets, and later endured attacks and slanders from congressional members and military leadership for this work. Reinaldo consistently resisted efforts to undermine the peace community and its grassroots work. The community deeply mourns his death.

On November 23, paramilitaries arrived in the villages of El Porvenir and La Nieves demanding 200,000 Colombian pesos from each Campesino family to give Christmas gifts to the children. The SJA peace community denounced this action as one of many that inflicts abusive control over the civilian population and its economy, using the fear of weapons.

On November 27, paramilitaries unloaded electrical poles and materials from a helicopter near the La Resbalosa hamlet. In 2018, these paramilitaries forcibly installed electricity infrastructure using money taken from Campesinos in the La Resbalosa, Naín, La Resbalosita, Baltazar, and Alto Joaquín hamlets, as well as in other areas along the border between the Córdoba and Antioquia departments. Now, Medellín Public Enterprises (Empresas Públicas de Medellín, EPM), the residential public utilities company, seeks to legalize these electrical networks that paramilitaries installed using money that was forcibly taken.

On November 28, SJA peace community members reported seeing a paramilitary group with large weapons in the Arenas Bajas hamlet. The group remained in the area for several days.

Over the course of the last week of November, information about paramilitaries allegedly coordinating with the Attorney General’s office circulated in the SJA peace community. This coordination is supposedly occurring to obtain information about individuals filing complaints against the paramilitaries at the Attorney General’s office. The SJA peace community explained that this is reminiscent of episodes in the past when many victims filed complaints at the Attorney General’s Office and the information was relayed back to paramilitaries who would retaliate.

In the first week of December, reports circulated that paramilitaries in the region are implementing new plans to recruit members to their structure with the lure of higher payments. Aliases ‘René,’ ‘Jesusito,’ and ‘Samuel’ are actively trying to recruit new members in the La Unión, El Porvenir, Las Nieves, La Esperanza, Arenas Bajas, and Arenas Altas hamlets, as well as surrounding areas. According to the SJA peace community, the government attempts to hide paramilitarism, its criminal activities, and complacency by state forces.

On a more positive note:

Coal Mining Labor Union Successfully Ends Longest Strike (La Guajira)

On November 30, after a 91-day strike, the longest in its history, coal mining labor union Sintracarbón and mining company Cerrejón signed a new collective bargaining agreement that will run until December 31, 2023. According to the National Union School (Escuela Nacional Sindical, ENS), the agreement maintained historic benefits for the coal mining workers including education support, healthcare, vacation leave, and holiday bonuses. The coal mining company also converted 100 fixed-term contracts to an indefinite status, reinstated 200 workers, provided 700 housing loans, and will continue to provide daily transportation to all of La Guajira, Valledupar, and Barranquilla.","DLP’s statement expressed deep concern with ongoing threats against the physical and legal security of FARC ex-combatants, the assassinations of social leaders, and a disturbing trend of massacres.
The three men are social leaders who have dedicated their lives to defending their territories through grassroots advocacy.
Of the 85 massacres and 291 assassinations of social leaders reported in Colombia this year, 25 massacres, 145 assassinations of social leaders, and 90 assassinations of FARC ex-combatants occurred in Cauca.

Infectious diseases such as COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); and the diseases caused by the Ebola, Nipah, and Zika viruses have exposed countries’ susceptibility to naturally occurring biological threats. Even though scientists from multiple countries concluded that the virus responsible for the coronavirus pandemic shifted naturally from an animal source to a human host,1 the international community should not ignore the possibility of pathogens escaping accidentally from research labs and threats of deliberate manipulation to create more dangerous bioweapons.

India is especially vulnerable to such infections because of its geographical position, large population, low healthcare spending, minimal expenditure on research that benefits public health, weak coordination between central and state health authorities, limited involvement of private actors, poor awareness of biosecurity, and the rickety state of public health infrastructure. Most recently, COVID-19 has revealed the deep fault lines in India’s public health infrastructure, including a shortage of healthcare workers, lack of trained epidemiologists, scarcity of medical equipment, poor access to healthcare facilities in rural areas, and inefficient disease reporting and surveillance in most states. The pandemic should therefore be a wake-up call for India to assess gaps in its public health infrastructure and divert its resources toward the healthcare sector to prepare itself for both natural and man-made biological emergencies.

Like any country, India faces three major biological threats: naturally occurring infections in humans or animals, or agricultural infestations; infections arising from accidental release of pathogens into the environment; and possible outbreaks caused by deliberate weaponization of dangerous pathogens that affect humans, animals, or crops. These threats—either alone or together—will force India to strengthen its capacity to detect and respond to them.

In all of this, there is a further challenge to wisely manage the trade offs between regulations to reduce the risks of accidents and attacks, on the one hand, and on the other, policies that enable government, scientific researchers, and industry to develop and market beneficial applications of biotechnology. Breakthroughs in biotechnology will be necessary to treat or vaccinate people against naturally occurring diseases as well as to detect and counter potential human-made threats and their consequences. This means researchers, businesses, regulators, media platforms, nongovernmental organizations, and voters must strive to educate themselves and their audiences or constituencies about possible threats and about the socially beneficial ways to prevent and manage them.

This paper addresses these varied challenges faced by India. It is based on interviews and informal conversations with leading government officials, scientists, academicians, and private-sector experts, as well as insights from workshops, roundtable discussions, and extensive literature review. Given India’s vulnerability to infectious disease outbreaks, the goal is to provide all stakeholders and the Indian public with an understanding of the biological risks facing India and the existing policies and involvement of various agencies working to enhance safety, security, and responses to threats. The paper further provides a brief assessment of how these policies are being implemented today and the scope of enhanced and better implementation in the future. The aim is to highlight the vital roles that bioscience, technology, and industry can play to advance the well being of Indian citizens while reducing risks of natural or human-induced afflictions.

Threats and Risks

Naturally Occurring Infections

Given India’s climate conditions, the country is vulnerable to vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, among others.

A high-density livestock population and a poorly guarded animal-human interface make India susceptible to zoonotic infections such as avian influenza, commonly called bird flu; pig influenza, commonly called swine flu; Nipah virus disease; and coronavirus diseases, such as COVID-19.

Poor patient adherence to antibiotic treatment, nontherapeutic use of antibiotics to promote growth in farm animals, self-medication, and illegal over-the-counter access to antibiotics makes antibiotic resistance an emerging health threat that demands immediate policy attention.

Safety Concerns

India has multiple laboratories with different biosafety levels (BSLs) set up across the country. Although new biosafety guidelines issued by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) mention certification and validation for the higher-standard BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs, the country lacks accredited government or private agencies to certify and validate the lower-standard BSL-2 laboratories’ compliance with safety rules.

In interviews, some scientific experts emphasized that the sudden ban on plastic in India in 2018 has made it difficult to use autoclavable plastic bags to dispose of laboratory waste. This has complicated the implementation of the proper disinfection protocol to dispose of biomedical waste, posing a serious biosafety hazard.

Unforeseen infection of laboratory personnel or the accidental release of pathogens or other biological materials from designated laboratories, either due to negligence or poor understanding of biosafety protocols among laboratory workers.

Deliberate introduction of genetically engineered organisms for beneficial purposes might have unintentional harmful consequences.

Security Concerns

Disease-causing pathogens are abundantly available in nature. Technologies needed to manipulate them are becoming more easily accessible. Actors with nefarious designs could purposefully weaponize such technologies and naturally occurring pathogens.

India is vulnerable to zoonotic diseases. Naturally occurring zoonotic pathogens can be manipulated in the lab to enhance their virulence, transmissibility, and/or resistance to therapeutic interventions.

Because India shares porous borders with most of its neighboring states, the possibility of cross-border infections is another major biological threat.

In addition to manipulating pathogens that affect human health, bad actors could release naturally occurring invasive pathogens or synthetically created pathogens or pests to weaken the agricultural supply chain.

Safety and Security Regulations and Policies

To address safety and security risks, India follows two different approaches—biosafety and biosecurity. Biosafety seeks to protect humans from pathogens while biosecurity protects pathogens from humans.2 Though these two concepts and practices reflect diverse scenarios and mitigate different risks, they complement each other. Robust implementation of biosafety protocols, in addition to reducing the risk of accidental exposure, limits risks of intentional theft or misuse.8

Biosafety regulations in India are defined under the 1986 Environment Protection Act, with implementation broadly distributed between the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MOEFCC). These regulations have three aims:

To prevent biological materials from escaping designated places in laboratories

To prevent laboratory workers from unintentional exposure

To prevent unintended consequences when genetically modified organisms are released purposefully into the environment

Like biosafety, biosecurity regulations in India, although not clearly defined and categorized, empower different ministries or agencies that are responsible for sectors usually associated with human health, food safety, agriculture, livestock, and the environment. As no uniform definition of biosecurity exists globally, the concept differs across human, animal, and plant health sectors. Biosecurity for public health often refers to “the protection of microbiological assets from theft, loss or diversion, which could lead to the inappropriate use of these agents to cause public health harm.”4 However, because biosecurity for plant and animal health entails protecting biological resources from foreign or invasive species,5 regulations in India are broad enough to cover four major aims:

To prevent unauthorized or ill-conceived release of naturally occurring biological agents

To prevent cross-border entry and movement of dangerous pests and pathogens

To prevent theft or acquisition of sensitive research, organisms, and information for nonlegitimate use

To prevent weaponization of pathogens by both state and nonstate actors

Implementation

Even though India has enacted laws and regulations to protect the country from biological threats, the coordination and monitoring of their implementation remains irregular.

For the first category of biological threats—diseases emerging from natural sources—India has invested in a public health infrastructure and has various laws and guidelines that drive preparedness and response to naturally occurring disease outbreaks. However, India’s response to the avian influenza, Nipah virus disease, and COVID-19 has exposed the country’s rickety public health infrastructure, poor disease surveillance network, inadequate coordination between ministries to prevent zoonotic infections, absence of a national policy on biological disasters, and dismal investment in scientific research. Rather than using the time between outbreaks to develop national guidelines to tackle infectious diseases, India mostly relies on ad hoc notifications and guidelines, along with World Health Organization (WHO) advisories.

For the second category of threats—diseases caused by accident—India has developed comprehensive biosafety guidelines to monitor the safety of biotechnological research. Although implementation of biosafety guidelines falls under the ambit of the Ministry of Science and Technology and MOEFCC, researchers often work in labs supported by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, which are research bodies set up under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare. The multiplicity of organizations operating under different ministries makes it difficult to ensure implementation of biosafety guidelines across the country. Moreover, the system often experiences poor coordination between center and state regulatory units. In addition, some experts interviewed during the project note that while scientists or researchers perform all necessary safety tests before approaching the regulatory authorities, the approval agencies, perhaps influenced by activist groups, perform additional safety tests that delay the clearance of such products.6 Whether such additional tests are necessary or not is often disputed.

For the third category of biological threats—threats emerging from intentional sources—India has no specific biosecurity policy or legislation but has a multiplicity of regulations that address threats emerging from different sources. However, entities set up under different ministries with inadequate collaboration among them leaves India vulnerable to a variety of foreign threats. While security agencies, such as the National Security Council Secretariat, are responsible for investigating a security threat, response to an event is often coordinated by civilian ministries.7 Because threats emerging from biological sources have a technical component, security agencies often include experts from other government departments, such as the Defence Research and Development Organisation, for their scientific inputs. Some experts, however, highlight that biosecurity discussions are mostly confined to closed policy circles and rarely involve experts from outside the government, leading to poor nationwide biosecurity awareness in India. Further, most regulations cover the export and import of pests and pathogens but do not adequately cover commercially ordered (mostly through e-commerce platforms) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequences that may encode virulent genes. At present, biosecurity regulations often empower customs officials as the only authority that can check the baggage of incoming passengers. But most customs officials are inadequately trained to identify specific pests or pathogens. In addition, there seems to be no systematic assessment of vulnerabilities in the existing system nor development plans and methodologies to build a sustainable, functional, and well-equipped system to counter biothreats.

Beyond the need to prevent outbreaks caused by safety and security lapses, any system must also be able to respond to threats whether they occur through human action (and inaction) or through natural processes. Although security agencies require time to investigate if an outbreak is natural or man-made, the mitigation strategy to tackle the threat must be prepared in advance and implemented immediately after detection of an outbreak.

Major Recommendations

As the spread of infectious diseases is a long-term, continuous, and evolving threat, India may need an agency specifically responsible for preventing and managing biological threats. India could consider investing in an agency that can coordinate policy responses for any biological emergency. A full-time Office of Biological Threats Preparedness and Response (BTPR) under the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is being suggested as an alternative. This paper sketched out this idea to stimulate further dialogue among interested stakeholders. This office could focus on naturally occurring diseases, threats emerging from laboratory accidents, and deliberate weaponization of diseases. Because India has numerous organizations that sometimes perform overlapping roles with limited or no coordination with each other, the office could become a nodal agency that brings together experts from different ministries, representatives from the private sector, and experts from the academic and scientific community.

Whether or not a new office is set up, it is important for India to review domestic measures needed to predict, prevent, and respond to both natural and man-made biological threats. These measures include:

Periodic training of healthcare workers on nursing practices, safe handling of samples, decontamination procedures, and proper disposal of biomedical waste;

Introduction

Outbreaks of life-threatening infectious diseases such as the Ebola virus disease in West Africa, the Zika virus disease in South America, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China, and the Nipah virus disease in India are not only limited to the region but frequently put people all over the world at risk. Most recently, COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, originated in China in late 2019 and rapidly evolved into a global pandemic, clearly demonstrating the harm infectious diseases can cause to the world economy and health security.

Natural processes of mutation and transmission caused these threats to human society. Human beings could create similar or even more dangerous threats—by accident or on purpose. Such accidents happened, for example, in 2003 when a Singaporean researcher acquired SARS from inadvertent cross-contamination of viral samples.8 In 2004, the accidental release of the SARS virus from a Chinese laboratory infected nine people, one of whom died.9 In 2014, a researcher working in a lab in India was accidentally infected with buffalopox virus,10 and in 2019 more than 3,000 brucellosis cases were detected in China due to contaminated exhaust from a brucellosis vaccine–making company.11 Going further back in history, during World War II, Japan deliberately used pathogens to spread plague, anthrax, typhoid, cholera, and other diseases among Chinese military and civilians.12 The United States and the Soviet Union developed major biological weapons programs during the Cold War,13 which Russia, then part of the Soviet Union, continued illegally even after it signed the Biological Weapons Convention in 1972.14 Yet, if societies and governments overreact and impose ill-conceived regulations to control these risks, they would defeat themselves by depriving the world of the great benefits that bioscience and technology can provide. The study of genes and their functions—genomics—enables researchers to understand the genetic causes of human, animal, and plant maladies. Synthetic biology and gene-editing tools such as the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR associated protein 9 (Cas9) can be used to modify genes to fix maladies and to create new functionalities—for good or ill, as discussed below. Bioscience and technology together are needed to produce vaccines that prevent the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and medicines that treat people who could not be vaccinated. New biotechnologies also promise to advance prevention and treatment of other human afflictions and to boost agricultural productivity and sustainable development.

This paper is divided into five sections. The first section describes how different stakeholders perceive and think about the possible benefits of biotechnology and the factors that could prevent these benefits from being realized. Based on interviews and informal conversations with leading government officials, scientists, academicians, and private-sector experts, as well as insights gleaned from workshops, roundtable discussions, and extensive literature review, the paper highlights India’s vulnerability to three major categories of biological risks:

Those produced by nature (like the Ebola and Nipah viruses) Those produced by human accident Those produced on purpose by hostile individuals or governments

Based on these perspectives, the paper argues that societies need to create a healthy balance between innovation, commerce, and regulation to ensure safety and security. This means researchers, businesses, regulators, media platforms, nongovernmental organizations, and voters must strive to educate themselves and their audiences or constituencies about possible threats from biotechnology and about the socially beneficial ways to prevent and manage them so that this technology can be used to enhance social welfare.

Next, the paper focuses on the first category of risk, which is probably the largest biological danger if multiplying the probability of occurrence with the consequences of occurrence. And, because naturally occurring sources of infectious disease in human beings and animals will occur, even if human-made ones do not, this paper, through brief case studies, explores India’s plans and capacity to detect and mitigate biothreats once they have dispersed into the larger environment and human population. Assessing the gaps in India’s response to disease outbreaks, this section of the paper suggests that New Delhi must create, fund, and deploy capabilities to detect, mitigate, and eventually prevent naturally occurring outbreaks. Most, if not all, of the policies and capabilities needed to respond to natural outbreaks would be vital also in responding to biological attacks and accidents, which is an argument for prioritizing them.

The third and fourth sections elaborate on how India seeks to protect against infections arising from accidental or deliberate release of pathogens through biosafety and biosecurity regulations, respectively.

While biosafety is the protection of humans from pathogens, biosecurity is the protection of pathogens from humans.15 Though these two concepts and practices reflect diverse scenarios and mitigate different risks, the paper argues that they share a common goal of keeping biological materials and the world safe and secure.

The final section of the paper identifies areas where stakeholders can work together and proposes a new nodal organization called the Office of Biological Threats Preparedness and Response (BTPR), operating under the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), to strengthen India’s capacity to tackle biological threats. Whether or not the office is set up, this section proposes other recommendations to strengthen India’s public health infrastructure, necessary to tackle both natural and manmade biological threats.

Biological Risks in India

Emerging technologies can provide immense and widespread public health benefits by enabling the global scientific community to improve diagnostics and treatments of diseases that afflict human beings, animals, and plants. The benefits of some methods and new biotechnologies sometimes entail risks such as the accidental spilling of pathogens from the labs or the deliberate misuse of technology to create more dangerous pathogens. Other types of research may come with risks that are commensurate to the potential large-scale benefits they could provide. For example, to evaluate the effectiveness of current and future public health interventions, scientists in the United States have re-created the Spanish flu virus, the pathogen responsible for the world’s deadliest pandemic to date.16 To develop better vaccines and cancer therapeutics, Canadian researchers have synthetically reconstructed an infectious horsepox, a close relative of smallpox.17 Gain-of-function experiments, which increase transmissibility or virulence of pathogens, if undertaken with extreme care, can develop better vaccines by enhancing the pathogenicity of potential pandemic pathogens, such as coronaviruses, in laboratories in order to test new ways to kill or slow them.18

While such research promotes scientific understanding and provides tools to design medical countermeasures to reduce global disease burden, experts in India understandably worry that wide applications of dual-use technologies and decreasing barriers to access them raise safety and security concerns.

Naturally Occurring Diseases

Given India’s geographical placement and history of infectious disease outbreaks, there are three major concerns that exist under this category:

Vulnerability to vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever Susceptibility to zoonotic infections, such as COVID-19 and Nipah virus disease Growing rate of antibiotic resistance

India lies within the distribution zone of disease vectors, such as Aedes aegypti, a mosquito that carries and transmits viruses. India is therefore prone to mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever, malaria, Japanese encephalitis, and chikungunya virus disease. The vulnerability to vector-borne diseases is exacerbated by its tropical climate and annual monsoon season.19

Additionally, several scientific and academic experts in India stress that among a myriad of different diseases, viral infections—especially the ones that jump from animals to humans, called zoonotic diseases—have the potential to cause devastation in India.20 Scientific experts further suggest that smaller genomes, higher replication speed, and greater transmission rates make it easier for certain pathogens, especially viral pathogens, to cause infections. Moreover, the high density of livestock and the difficult-to-regulate interface between human and animal populations make India more vulnerable to contagious viral zoonotic diseases. West Nile, avian influenza, swine flu, SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Ebola virus disease, Nipah virus disease, and COVID-19 are examples of such zoonotic diseases. This is compounded by the unhygienic maintenance and breeding of livestock for human consumption.

Some industry and scientific experts in India emphasize that viral infections lead to secondary bacterial infections. Increasing rates of antibiotic resistance, a subset of antimicrobial resistance, is an emerging health trend in the country.21 Human pathogens frequently isolated from infections in patients and hospital sources have been growing more resistant to commonly used broad-spectrum antibiotics. Major contributors to this growing problem include poor patient adherence to antibiotic treatment, nontherapeutic use of antibiotics for growth promotion in farm animals, self-medication, and illegal over-the-counter access to antibiotics.

Biosafety Concerns

There are four major biosafety threats in India:

Unforeseen infection of laboratory personnel or the accidental release of pathogens or other biological materials from designated laboratories, either due to negligence or poor understanding of biosafety protocols Lack of proper certification and validation mechanisms for biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) labs that sometimes work with dangerous biorisk group 3 pathogens Improper disposal of biological waste and animals used in drug testing and clinical trials Unintended consequences of the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms in the environment

Several scientific, academic, and industry experts stress that personnel in some of the laboratories might have a poor understanding of the prescribed laboratory procedures and/or may be inadequately trained to follow them. This can result in ignorant mishandling of pathogens, cross-contamination of samples, inadequate oversight in a laboratory, or uncontrolled experiments.22

Several scientists in India note that by improperly handling a live attenuated strain of virus that is being used to develop a vaccine, for example, laboratory personnel could unintentionally make the pathogen more virulent. This could either lead to an unforeseen infection of the personnel or their local communities, or even a pandemic.

These risks are not unique to India. In 2001 in Australia, for example, scientists hoping to render a mouse infertile instead accidentally created a lethal mousepox virus.23 In the Soviet Union in 1979, anthrax spores were accidentally released from a Soviet military microbiology facility, causing livestock deaths and a few human fatalities.24 Almost seventy-five scientists from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were exposed to anthrax because researchers failed to kill the bacteria and accidentally shipped live strains to other CDC labs that were not equipped to handle them.25 In another incident involving the CDC, a scientist cross-contaminated a benign strain of bird flu virus with a deadly bird flu strain, causing unintentional death of chickens, though it did not result in any human infection.26 These episodes demonstrate why layers of safety procedures and physical protection are necessary. Reviewing some of them, a few scientific and industry experts in India highlight that the absence of mechanisms to certify that all relevant laboratories are actually implementing safety standards for facilities, personnel training, and operations might lead to similar accidents in India in the future.

Moreover, multiple laboratories with different BSLs have been set up by the network established under the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) across the country to deal with pathogens relevant to public health.27 Although a Department of Biotechnology (DBT) memorandum has introduced an application form to make certification and validation of BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs by the Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation mandatory,28 experts in India worry about the lack of national guidelines and absence of any accredited government or private agency for the certification and validation of BSL-2 labs, which are widely distributed all over the country.29 This is important because some of the BSL-2 labs sometimes work with biorisk group 3 pathogens, thereby raising safety concerns. Based on the objective of the laboratory, certification includes physical inspection of the facility to ensure that the building and infrastructure meet the design criteria and the basic requirements of protecting people and the environment from infectious agents. Validation, on the other hand, is necessary to review that the prescribed processes and procedures are followed within the laboratory. This includes having standard operating protocols and a training record of personnel in the laboratory. Certification and validation, according to experts, is necessary to ensure basic minimum standards are promoted and implemented to avoid unintentional exposure to high-risk pathogens.30 Scientists also emphasize that without proper disinfection, disposal of biomedical waste, including animals used for clinical and drug trials, is another serious biosafety hazard that might have ramifications for public health.31 Large numbers of coronavirus patients all over the world have produced garbage contaminated with bodily fluids and other infectious material. Maharashtra, a state in central India, for example, observed maximum coronavirus cases in the country, generating an average of 1,500 kilograms of coronavirus-contaminated waste per day. According to civic bodies in the state, improper segregation of waste and inadequate equipment provided to garbage collectors increased the risk of transmission.32

In addition to the biosafety of laboratory operations, participants in this project have also expressed concern about safety outside the laboratory. Genetically engineered organisms could be introduced for purposes such as mosquito control, agriculture, environmental remediation, biofuels, and medications. These experiments or applications, according to some experts in India, raise the possibility of unintentional interaction with naturally occurring organisms, which if not adequately addressed and monitored, could lead to unintended consequences. Despite these concerns, some scientists emphasize the importance of genetically engineered organisms in reducing India’s vector-borne disease burden.33

Biosecurity Concerns

The four major biosecurity threats relevant to the Indian context are:

Intentional release of invasive pests or pathogens to disrupt India’s agricultural supply chain Deliberate introduction of naturally occurring infectious disease-causing organisms, such as anthrax or coronavirus, by nefarious actors or hostile states to cause human infections Synthetic creation of dangerous organisms from scratch, either by using genomic information available online or acquiring information through unauthorized means for nonlegitimate use Vulnerability to cross-border infections

Most experts in India acknowledge the value of biotechnology applications to improve the yield and nutritional quality of crops and to boost their resistance to diseases and drought.34 Naturally evolving pests and plant pathogens may be extremely invasive and costly to Indian agriculture. They can reduce crop production as well as negatively influence international trade. For example, the European Union in 2014 temporarily banned the import of Alphonso mangoes and a few vegetables from India after the consignment was found to be contaminated by pests—a potential threat to the union’s salad crop industry and to Indian agricultural exports.35 Similarly, accidental introduction of blight-causing fungus from Asia led to the loss of American chestnut trees in the eastern United States.36

Some experts in India therefore worry that actors with nefarious intentions might deliberately release naturally occurring invasive pathogens or synthetically create pathogens or pests to target the agricultural supply chain.37 Individuals, businesses, terrorists, or hostile states could seek to bypass or break rules for a variety of reasons. Some might seek profit from more productive crops or livestock. Terrorists could seek to create panic and distrust within the society by introducing or claiming to introduce infectious disease into livestock. An enemy state could seek to impair military responses, paralyze government functioning, and decimate the economy.

Several experts in India also worry that nefarious actors could release naturally occurring known pathogens that have the capacity to cause widespread harm, such as anthrax or coronavirus. To influence election results in the U.S. state of Oregon, the Rajneesh group deliberately contaminated salad with the naturally occurring Salmonella bacteria, to reduce voter turnout on election day,38 and the Bacillus anthracis bacteria strain, isolated from an infected cow in Texas decades earlier, was used for the anthrax attack in 2001 that targeted prominent U.S. senators and media outlets, infecting seventeen Americans and killing five individuals.39 These real-world examples point to the fact that the development of biological weapons does not necessarily require genetic engineering.

More sophisticated malicious actors—both inside and outside the lab—could take advantage of genomic data that is now online and new and inexpensive synthetic biology tools to engineer deadly pathogens in a lab. Even for the information that is not available publicly, these actors can compromise the information system to gain unauthorized access to confidential genomic information. Thus, as one former government official emphasized, access to a pathogen’s culture is no longer a precondition to develop biological weapons.40 Custom-made genes can now be ordered online to produce drugs, vaccines, or other disease therapies. For example, do-it-yourself biologists, a group of amateurs who conduct biotechnology research outside a formal institutional setup, teamed up online to create coronavirus test kits and vaccines.41 Even though do-it-yourself biologists are independent researchers not linked to formal institutions, India does not have any policy to regulate them, thereby raising both safety and security concerns.42 Moreover, synthetic biology allows actors to develop pathogens from scratch in the lab. Large strands of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) can be created artificially, with the cost of DNA synthesis dropping from a dollar to less than ten cents per base pair in the last decade.43 Actors with nefarious intentions could order custom-made DNA strands online to create dangerous pathogens with enhanced virulence, transmissibility, and/or resistance to therapeutic interventions.

Individuals and groups have demonstrated intentions to get involved in such activities. A senior biodefense researcher in the United States was believed to have mailed anthrax—obtained from a government lab—in letters that killed five people and infected seventeen others in 2001.44 A laboratory technician in the United States was charged in 1998 for stockpiling plague and anthrax and conspiring to use it as a weapon.45 Al-Qaeda reportedly made repeated attempts to acquire biological weapons,46 and operatives from the self-proclaimed Islamic State are known to have accessed information to weaponize pathogens.47 It is reasonable to assume that other such cases have been intercepted by various countries’ intelligence and security services without publicity.

Although advances in biosciences and technology can help contain and eradicate naturally occurring outbreaks, experts in India worry that since pathogens responsible for such infections are freely available in nature and the tools and technologies needed to manipulate them are easily accessible, developments in technology can lead to purposeful weaponization of such diseases. Not all pathogens have this versatile nature, and it requires tacit knowledge to weaponize them; for this reason, some government officials believe that it is more difficult than it might seem for an adversary to create and/or steal a bioagent with bioweapon potential and use it in devastating ways.

As pathogens do not respect national borders, some experts emphasize that they can be intentionally or unintentionally carried across borders. India shares porous borders with most of its neighboring states, so it is vulnerable and needs to secure its frontiers as much as possible and check travel and trade to prevent the proliferation of biological weapons.48 Recently, the director general of the police in Jammu and Kashmir claimed that Pakistan is pushing coronavirus-positive militants into Kashmir to spread the disease throughout the valley.49 Although the government in Pakistan has rebutted this claim, it indicates India’s vulnerability to cross-border infections.50

Risks of Opportunity Costs

Discussions of biological risk naturally focus on the dangers of human action or inaction, purposeful or accidental. This is because human actions are controllable in ways that natural mutations of organisms are not. Human beings also fear losing things they already have more than they fear not gaining things in the future.51 From the perspective of societal well-being, then, some stakeholders in India see potential risks in restricting or burdening research, development, and applications of bioscience and technology without adequate evidence that the social benefits of such restrictions outweigh both their direct and opportunity costs. The two major areas that have faced strong public resistance in India are vaccines and genetically modified food/crops.

The World Health Organization (WHO) notes that fear of vaccine side effects has led to vaccine hesitancy.52 Although there is no organized antivaccination campaign, resistance to vaccines prevails in some parts of India, as concluded by a study that was commissioned after the reemergence of eradicated vaccine-preventable diseases such as diphtheria. The main reasons behind this growing trend are often the lack of trust in the government, fear of safety and efficacy of vaccines influenced by rumors, and poor communication regarding the benefits of vaccines.53 For example, resistance to the polio vaccine in some parts of North India was spurred by religious suspicions that the immunization drive was part of the government’s agenda to control the high birth rate among the Muslim population. Similar resistance was observed with the human papillomavirus vaccine after rumors connected the vaccination to death among girls.54 Although dubious information is mostly spread by people with little or no scientific background, virus conspiracy theories are sometimes spurred by discredited researchers, as observed during the coronavirus pandemic.55 Such uncorroborated rumors regarding vaccines can sometimes jeopardize public health efforts to fight vaccine-preventable infectious diseases.

Similarly, people in India are more alarmed by the possibility that modifying plant genetics will accidentally reduce harvests or raise the costs of seeds for farmers than they are by the possibility that prohibiting such modifications will deprive them of faster growth in the future.

Experts have highlighted that no restrictions exist for plants or other organisms modified through traditional techniques. They added that traditional biotechnology techniques such as selective breeding, hybridization, and fermentation have been used to modify living plants for improved yield or enhanced nutritional value. In addition to producing the desired product, these traditional breeding techniques can lead to random mutations. With improvements in knowledge about the role of individual plant genes, modern biotechnology techniques can be used to edit the specific gene to produce a desired variety, thereby reducing the possibility of off-target effects.56

Despite widely documented economic, health, and environmental benefits of genetically modified crops, public backlash against these varieties, irrespective of their validity, has created a difficult political atmosphere in India where stringent measures have been developed to restrict transgenic research, field trials, and commercial product release.

Some Indian experts have witnessed mixed and varied reactions from the public and the government, depending on the product in question. They believe that it is not the technology but the way the product is perceived by the public that affects whether a product receives government backing. The primary example they used to highlight this was the contrasting treatment of genetically modified cotton and brinjal. The former is a cash crop widely accepted and in use, while the latter, a food crop, is still facing resistance to its introduction to the market.57

To address public concerns regarding biotechnology-derived products, the Indian government adopted a multilayered regulatory system to examine the safety of biotechnology products before their commercialization. However, the hierarchical setup is often plagued by coordination issues between various bodies at different levels. Bureaucratic delays in approving products sometimes lead to regulatory uncertainties. As a result, the private sector and the venture-capitalist community limit their investment in the biotechnology sector, constricting the scope of research in India.

The Way Forward

First and foremost, it is important for India to periodically update the three categories of risks mentioned above. Once risk cataloging is complete, the next step is to identify and assess regulations that deal with each of these different categories of risk. For the first category—diseases occurring because of natural mutations—it is important to understand the functioning of India’s public health infrastructure to identify gaps and limitations in the existing system. For risks emerging either from lab accidents or deliberate release, it is important to evaluate existing regulations against recent developments in biotechnology. Next, it is important to identify stakeholders that would be involved in dealing with each of these categories of risks. In addition to assessing regulations and identifying stakeholders, it is imperative for India to invest in scientific communication strategies to build a bridge between the scientific community and Indian society. This would help in fighting misinformation and would also help address public resistance to biotechnology-derived products, thereby spurring innovation.

Assessing India’s Capacity to Deal with Naturally Occurring Diseases

As discussed above, biothreats can emerge from natural events, human accident, and/or malicious human action. This chapter focuses on India’s capacity to tackle the first category of risk—the ones emerging from natural sources.

In case of any disease outbreak, the central government issues specific notifications and guidelines to control and monitor the disease and has in several instances set up new ad hoc response committees. Like any naturally occurring biological disaster, accidental release or intentional attack also affects a country’s health infrastructure. Case studies of India’s responses to naturally occurring outbreaks can foster understanding of the health infrastructure.

India’s Performance in Tackling Biological Emergencies: Five Case Studies

To assess India’s capacity to handle human-induced biological threats, it is important to understand India’s responses to naturally occurring infections. The five case studies discussed in this section highlight India’s response toward agricultural infestations, such as the recently observed locust attacks; diseases that affect animals and have not yet infected humans, such as avian influenza; and zoonotic infections that have jumped from animals to humans, such as the Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), Nipah virus disease, and more recently COVID-19.

How Did India Respond to Kyasanur Forest Disease?

In 1957, India adopted an interdisciplinary approach to tackle an outbreak of KFD, a tick-borne viral hemorrhagic fever. The disease, commonly called the monkey fever, primarily infects primates and spreads to humans through ticks. The Rockefeller Foundation extended financial and technical support, including laboratory facilities to investigate the disease outbreak. Scientific expertise was provided by researchers at the National Institute of Virology, a lab set up by the Rockefeller Foundation (now under the ICMR). In addition, WHO supported an ornithologist who started the Bird Migration Project under the Bombay Natural History Society, which traces the origins and transmission of KFD.58

Epidemiological investigation of KFD was one of the early successful examples of the multidisciplinary approach needed to tackle zoonotic infections.59 However, no detailed studies have been carried out on any zoonotic pathogen in India, including the KFD virus, especially after the Rockefeller Foundation pulled its support in the 1970s.60 Even though most experts in India speculate that the next pandemic may also move from animals to humans, India has developed a more reactive approach to disease outbreaks rather than developing measures to prevent such infections. Independent ministries that are responsible for agriculture, animal husbandry, environment, and public health often work in silos and do not coordinate with each other. This leads to inadequate information sharing, which results in a weak surveillance mechanism needed for timely diagnosis of zoonotic infections.

It is therefore important to break the silos, develop robust coordination mechanisms for better information sharing, and develop a strong disease surveillance mechanism for early detection of diseases.

How Did India Respond to the Avian Influenza?

A high-density poultry population combined with the illegal movement of poultry and poultry products makes India vulnerable to avian influenza, a viral disease that affects both wild and domestic birds alike but very rarely infects humans. India has so far reported avian influenza, commonly called bird flu, almost every year, starting from 2005 until 2015. Fresh cases were again reported in 2020. Although state governments have been successful in minimizing human infections so far, the response strategy mostly involves the mass culling of birds, as is done in other Asian nations. This policy response, however, entails huge financial cost for farmers and the poultry industry in general, without appropriate compensation. Most of these bird flu cases are restricted to rural areas; as a consequence, the lack of awareness along with the huge financial burden on farmers sometimes lead to underreporting of cases.61 It is therefore important to strengthen India’s disease surveillance mechanism that monitors and reports diseases in animals. Early detection of diseases in animals might help contain the spread of zoonotic infections, one of the major biological threats in India.

How Did India Respond to the Nipah Virus Outbreak in Kerala?

Nipah, a zoonotic virus that moved from bats to humans, killed seventeen people in the southwestern state of Kerala in 2018. Kerala’s State Surveillance Unit of the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), an initiative led by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), reported the Nipah outbreak to the Central State Surveillance Unit of the IDSP. The Manipal Centre for Virus Research (now Manipal Institute of Virology [MIV]) at the Manipal Academy of Higher Education confirmed the Nipah outbreak, which was later reconfirmed by the National Institute of Virology in Pune.62

Following the confirmation of the outbreak, a multidisciplinary team from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) was sent to Kerala to work locally with the state government to investigate and respond to the infection. The team was headed by the director of NCDC, with representatives from the National Institute of Virology; All India Institute of Medical Sciences; Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital; the Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairy, and Fisheries; and the Division of Emergency Medical Relief. This team was sent to support the local authorities to train medical personnel to detect and isolate active cases, trace their contacts, provide treatment, discard hospital waste, and safely dispose of the deceased. NCDC also activated the Strategic Health Operations Centre to monitor the outbreak and issue daily situation reports. In addition, WHO also provided support in terms of technical materials and guidance on the Nipah virus to both the MOHFW and the state health authorities. These coordinated and collaborative efforts of the central and the state government, along with WHO’s technical support, led to an effective containment of the outbreak.63

Despite the successful containment of the outbreak, the central government determined that the lab that detected Nipah was underqualified, so it was dropped from a central list of virus research and diagnostic labs in 2019. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) suspended the lab’s account under the 2010 Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), which regulates foreign donations based on national security implications, for collaborating with the U.S. CDC for its research on the Nipah virus. Some government officials noted that “the lab was being used to map the Nipah virus, which can be used to develop a vaccine, the intellectual property right of which will not be with India. Importantly, understanding how the human body reacted to the virus will also produce a more virulent form of virus for biological warfare.”64 The laboratory, however, issued a clarification, emphasizing that the CDC was only involved in training to detect Nipah and was never involved in the actual Nipah investigation. Detection of the outbreak was exclusively funded and carried out in close collaboration with the ICMR. Samples for virus isolation were transferred to the National Institute of Virology. The statement issued by the laboratory further clarified that “the research at MIV was not connected to any vaccine development and no intellectual property right was generated or transferred.”65 Given that government bodies at the central level were aware of the research, including MIV’s capacity to detect Nipah, the Health Ministry’s sudden allegation and withdrawal of the lab’s FCRA license undermines the capacity of the lab and creates disincentives for other labs.

Not only does it undermine the potential of private labs, it also threatens prospects for global cooperation needed to tackle biothreats. Because biological threats, especially infectious diseases, are transnational in nature and cannot be tackled individually by national governments, international cooperation is both necessary and important in all facets of disease control—prevention, detection, warning, response, and the development of drugs and vaccines. While commercial considerations and debates around intellectual property are important, India’s biosecurity policy should foster global cooperation to advance knowledge and strengthen infrastructure to tackle biological threats.

How Did India Respond to Locust Attacks?

Contrary to previous locust infestations that were localized to the northwestern states of Rajasthan and Gujarat, a latest locust attack that started in April 2020, much ahead of the normal July to October interval, damaged crops in the states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. Because winter crops were harvested and monsoon crops were yet to be sown, locusts in search of fodder moved deeper into India, affecting new states. Moreover, strong westerly winds from the Cyclone Amphan in the Bay of Bengal also influenced their widespread movement.66 Pandemic-induced economic slowdown made it difficult for the Indian government to tackle the invasion in a timely manner.

Locusts are transboundary pests that damage crops and threaten food security. Repeated locust infestations in India led to the 1939 establishment of Locust Warning Organisation, which in 1946 was integrated with the Directorate of Plant Protection Quarantine and Storage under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare.67 To combat the locust invasion, the organization worked closely with the MHA, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Communications, relevant state departments, and other pertinent stakeholders, including farmers. At an international level, the Locust Warning Organisation coordinated with the Food and Agricultural Organization, a United Nations body that performs monitoring of possible locust outbreaks and issues timely warnings.68

Some states noted this locust invasion as “mid-season adversity” under the government-sponsored crop insurance program known as Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, which processes insurance claims for farmers’ losses.69 Although part of the claim is disbursed based on a joint survey conducted by the concerned insurance company and the state government, the remaining payment depends on the result of crop-cutting experiments that map damage from locusts at a village level. However, the methodology to conduct such experiments is skewed and depends on random selection of any four fields in the village. Because locusts do not affect all fields uniformly, random sampling sometimes does injustice to farmers, thereby causing financial strain.70 Moreover, pesticides used to limit the spread of locusts also adversely impact food crops, causing further financial troubles for the farmers.71

Given the impact of locusts on food security and agricultural supply chain, scientists all over the world are trying to genetically engineer locusts to control their spread.72 However, these experiments raise security concerns because the same techniques can be used to modify locusts or other insects in ways that would make it harder to control them.73 For example, scientific experts have raised concerns around the U.S. Insect Allies program that uses insects to spread viruses to create genetically engineered crops. While the program intends to develop healthier crops, some bioethicists and scientists believe that this technology poses serious safety and security risks.74 It is therefore important to strengthen India’s capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to natural infestations to better prepare for man-made invasions.

How Is India Responding to COVID-19?

India observed its first few COVID-19 cases almost a month after Chinese authorities officially reported the coronavirus outbreak to the WHO. The first three cases were reported in Kerala from January 30 to February 3, 2020, among students who came back from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the initial outbreak took place.75 Because health is a state subject in India, the Kerala government declared COVID-19 a state disaster as soon as it reported its third case. A multidisciplinary state response team was composed of experts in epidemiology, community medicine, infectious diseases, pediatrics, drug control, and food safety. This team was supported by other state-level teams to enhance the surveillance of the outbreak, train medical personnel, and strengthen the state’s public health infrastructure. In addition to the state response team, rapid response teams were also constituted at the district level to facilitate micro-level planning.76

A month later, in the first week of March, India witnessed a sudden spike in the number of coronavirus cases across the country. Recognizing the severity of the situation, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) took charge. The response was guided by a team of more than thirty health experts and scientists who worked relentlessly to fight the contagion. This team was divided into two groups—one comprising health professionals and the other consisting of researchers from the ICMR and secretaries from the DBT, the Department of Science and Technology (DST), the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), and the Defence Research and Development Organisation.77Based on their recommendations, the government imposed severe travel restrictions to limit cross-border movement of people. In addition, all states and union territories were advised to invoke section 2 of the Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897 (EDA), which allowed them to take preventive measures to contain the spread of coronavirus in their respective states.

While measures taken by most states and union territories moved in the right direction, lack of uniformity across multiple states led to complications and impediments. To overcome this, the Indian government declared COVID-19 a notified disaster under the 2005 Disaster Management Act.78 As a result, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is also the chairperson of the NDMA, announced a nationwide lockdown, starting from late March through May 2020. Most states followed the central government’s guidelines and directives to tackle the pandemic, but some states did not comply with the central government-issued advisories. This was caused by ambiguity in the constitutional structure, where health is classified as a state subject and disaster management, though not explicitly stated, falls under the concurrent list. While only state governments have the power to create laws for subjects falling under the state list, both central and state governments have powers over subjects mentioned in the concurrent list, with the center’s decisions prevailing in case of differences. Because the central government declared COVID-19 a disaster, it gave both central and state governments the authority to draft rules and regulations to tackle the pandemic, with the central government playing an upper hand. Some states, however, argued that because health is a state subject, the states should have more flexibility in tackling the pandemic. This ambiguous nature of center-state relations complicated India’s fight to contain the pandemic.79

Recognizing the need to ramp up domestic capacity to strengthen India’s response to COVID-19, a task force was set up under DST with representatives from CSIR, DBT, DST, and ICMR; the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology; Atal Innovation Mission; the Ministry of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises; Startup India; and the All India Council for Technical Education. This group tried to identify startups with market-ready solutions to develop affordable testing kits and to scale up manufacturing of equipment supplies such as masks, protective gear, sanitizers, ventilators, and respirators. The task force was also constituted to identify data-mapping solutions to develop an effective surveillance for coronavirus in India.80 Taking lessons from other countries, India also developed a contact-tracing app, called Aarogya Setu, to detect, trace, and isolate people who came in contact with COVID-19 patients.

Although the government took strict measures to implement social distancing, the country did not have adequate capacity to handle the pandemic.81 Personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline medical workers was not easily accessible. Respirators, ventilators, and other equipment required to set up isolation wards were available in limited quantity. Diagnostic kits were also not available in sufficient quantity. In addition, the former Indian Health Secretary Preeti Sudan wrote a letter during the coronavirus pandemic stating that India needs to hire epidemiologists on a “war footing” because they are a “critical element in the effective management of the pandemics like COVID-19.”82 Hiring epidemiologists and microbiologists in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic indicates the shortage of trained personnel in India to fight the disease.83 Moreover, an academic expert in India highlighted that most scientific institutions in India prefer to recruit personnel who have received their degrees from abroad rather than hiring people who have been trained locally and have a better understanding of the Indian scientific and administrative environment. Such hires unfortunately lack an initial vision about the crisis from an Indian perspective and take time to adjust to the local system, which creates a longer lag phase and loss of valuable time, a crucial element during health emergencies.84

The above case studies clearly underscore India’s reactive approach toward infectious disease outbreaks. Rather than using the time between two outbreaks to develop national legislation to tackle infectious diseases, India mostly relies on ad hoc notifications and guidelines. Invoking the 2005 Disaster Management Act to tackle the COVID-19 crisis when this enactment is not geared toward handling epidemics in the first place highlights the poor state of India’s preparedness in combating infectious diseases.85

Complicating matters further, the Modi government reconstituted the NDMA and downsized it. The vice-chairman post was downgraded from Union Cabinet Minister to Cabinet Secretary, and members’ ranks were changed from Union Minister of State to Union Secretary of the Union government. According to the former vice chairman of the NDMA, this has weakened the organization, and “there will be difficulty in coordination with the states in this regard. If a Vice-Chairman of Cabinet Minister status goes to a state, he will be meeting the Chief Minister more easily than somebody of Cabinet Secretary level. These are issues with protocol also.”86

Gaps in the Existing Capacity to Tackle Naturally Occurring Diseases

Capabilities, like the ones discussed in the previous section for tackling threats that naturally occur, would also be required to deal with human-induced outbreaks resulting from safety or security lapses. However, India’s responses to naturally occurring disease threats have exposed its poor disease surveillance network, inadequate coordination between ministries needed to prevent zoonotic infections, lack of a nationwide policy on biological disasters, rickety public health infrastructure, and minimal investment in research, all of which will be elaborated below.

State of Disease Surveillance in India

For rapid surveillance and response to disease outbreaks, the NCDC, under the Indian MOHFW, set up an IDSP. The IDSP is a decentralized surveillance system that establishes surveillance committees at the central, state, and district level (see figure 1). The state surveillance committee is set up under the secretary of health; the district surveillance committee is under the chairmanship of the district collector or district magistrate. Information is relayed from the district unit to the state unit to the central surveillance unit on a weekly basis using an IDSP portal. This weekly data gives insights on the disease trends and the seasonality of infections. In addition to these surveillance units, IDSP has also established multidisciplinary rapid response teams at the district level for early detection and containment of infectious disease outbreaks.87

Some public health experts in India have, however, raised serious concerns about the infrastructure and the human resource capabilities needed to accurately detect and report an outbreak. In addition to the IDSP, the Indian Health Ministry, under the National Health Mission, runs several other disease surveillance programs such as the National Vector-Borne Disease Control Programme, Revised National Tuberculosis Programme, and National Leprosy Eradication Programme.88 Moreover, there are additional surveillance programs such as the National Polio Surveillance Project (NPSP) that run beyond the ones included under the mission. These organizations sometimes collect data for the same disease, but often not with similar standards and practice. For example, both IDSP and NPSP record data for polio incidences in India. They use differing case definitions with little or no coordination (and often bureaucratic turf battles), which leads to different disease numbers being reported under different programs.89

Moreover, all these surveillance programs only mandate a few institutions, mostly government affiliated, to report disease outbreaks. This makes it difficult for organizations excluded from this network to report diseases. Limited involvement of private labs and practitioners in the disease reporting network leads to severe underreporting of disease outbreaks.90

In addition to disease surveillance programs that gather information on human infections, India runs parallel surveillance programs that collect data for livestock diseases. The National Animal Disease Reporting System, a computerized network set up under the Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairy, and Fisheries (within the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry, and Dairying), collects and collates animal health information at the block, district, and state level.91 The National Animal Disease Referral Expert System is another web-based interactive livestock disease database that operates under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, a body under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare.92

These multiple disease surveillance programs, set up under different ministries, work in silos and sometimes collect data for the same disease with different standards. This leads to the collection of redundant data, resulting in a convoluted, uncoordinated, and ineffective disease-mapping mechanism.

Status of Policy on Biological Disasters

India’s response to biological disasters, both natural and man-made, is specified under the non–legally binding guidelines for managing biological disasters, issued by the NDMA in 2008. The guidelines have clearly outlined the role of separate ministries in the wake of biological emergencies. MOHFW is responsible for handling naturally occurring biological disasters. The MHA is in charge of events arising through bioterrorism; the Ministry of Defence is responsible for events related to biological warfare; and the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare has been put in charge of animal health and events related to agroterrorism. In addition, the guidelines mention the role of the community, medical care professionals, public health personnel, and veterinary professionals in preventing, responding, and mitigating the impact of any biological emergency.

Although the guidelines mentioned that the EDA should be repealed and a national-level policy for biological disaster should be framed, there is still no formal legislation for biological disasters. Because of the absence of a nationwide policy, many states have developed their own public health legislations to deal with disease outbreaks.93

The NCDC and the Directorate General of Health Services jointly prepared a 2017 public health bill, which was introduced in the parliament as the first step toward a formal legislation. The 2017 bill, which is now lapsed, was an attempt to replace the archaic 1897 EDA. Unlike the EDA, this proposed bill clearly defined an epidemic and identified thirty-five epidemic-prone diseases and thirty-six bioterrorism agents, high-priority pathogens that pose public health risk.94

This bill, however, has certain issues: it is more reactive than proactive, the measures included in the bill are insufficient and lack clarity, and it does not address the balance between public health and human rights.

Even though the NDMA’s 2008 guidelines for biological disasters mention preventive options such as immunization of first responders or stockpiling of medical countermeasures, the new public health bill is not comprehensive enough and does not cover any prophylactic procedures. It only specifies scientific and containment measures that must be followed once the outbreak has happened. Key themes such as disease surveillance and identification of disease hotspots, development of vaccines, establishment of fully equipped hospitals, training for medical professionals, and coordination and collaboration among scientists and the biomedical industry appear to be missing in this proposed legislation. Besides this, the bill has not addressed the human resource component needed to contain disease outbreaks. For example, training of public health professionals, epidemiologists, and other frontline workers seem to be notably absent from the bill. Moreover, it fails to address budgetary challenges needed to create a robust public health infrastructure that is capable of tackling epidemics, bioterrorism, and biological disasters.

Although the bill empowers local governments to take measures to contain various diseases, it does not clearly explain the organizational structure that will operate in case of an emergency. Even though the bill mentions both natural and man-made biological threats, it has not clarified whether the setup would be operational under the guidelines issued by the NDMA or if a new authority will be established under the newly proposed bill.

In addition, some experts emphasize that the bill violates basic human rights and gives enormous powers to medical officers to inspect any location, isolate patients, limit their movement, conduct medical investigations, and treat them irrespective of their consent.95 To get a glimpse of what these powers might look like, consider a 2017 example where the Tamil Nadu state health department, under the Tamil Nadu Public Health Act of 1939, tried to make the measles-rubella vaccination mandatory for all children under the age of 15 without parental consent.96 Privacy concerns were also raised during the coronavirus pandemic when the Indian government deployed the Aarogya Setu contact-tracing app, meant to detect, isolate, and treat contacts of COVID-19-patients. Anyone using any public transport had to have the app installed on their phone, although it was not mandatory to download the app otherwise. Some data experts in India raised apprehensions regarding the privacy and consent framework of the app.97 The public health bill, if it is enacted, would need to be modified to include measures to prepare for a biological emergency and introduce provisions that balance public health and human rights.

State of Public Health Infrastructure

Even though the MOHFW in 2016 conceded that India’s public expenditure on health as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) is far lower than countries classified as “poorest” in the world,98 the latest financial budget has increased the expenditure only marginally from 1.5 percent to 1.6 percent of the GDP.99 According to a few public health professionals, the Indian government’s plan to increase its public health expenditure to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2025 looks disappointing when the global average will be about 6 percent.100

Given India’s minimal investment in public health, the coronavirus pandemic exposed the bleak reality that India only has 8.5 beds and eight physicians per million people, with even lower numbers reported in rural areas.101 Although the WHO recommends a ratio of 1 doctor to 1,000 people, a recent study showed that India only has one government doctor per 10,819 people and one nurse per 483 patients, highlighting a deficit of 600,000 doctors and almost 2 million nurses.102

On top of this personnel deficit, healthcare workers tested positive for coronavirus, owing to the lack of protective health supplies such as masks, gloves, and gowns. The lack of healthcare workers and shortage of PPE kits both seem to have jeopardized India’s efforts to respond to the coronavirus disease. To divert all available public health resources to combat the pandemic, most hospitals in India closed their outpatient departments, thereby creating a huge problem for non-COVID-19 patients. As India has limited beds and facilities, several reports noted that patients with surgical procedures, routine checkups, and follow-up visits were deferred to avoid extra hospitalizations.103 Some states also halted immunization and reproductive health outreach to free up community healthcare workers for COVID-19-related surveillance and contact tracing. As a senior official in the Health Ministry reportedly noted, India, with its high disease burden, would fare best by avoiding a situation like the Democratic Republic of the Congo was in after the Ebola crisis, where more people died of tuberculosis, malaria, and measles than from Ebola.104

State of Expenditure on Research

India’s research and development spending fluctuates between 0.7 to 0.9 percent of its GDP, much lower than other countries like Brazil (1.3 percent), Canada (1.6 percent), the United Kingdom (1.7 percent), China (2.1 percent), France (2.2 percent), the United States (2.8 percent), Germany (3 percent), Japan (3.2 percent), South Korea (4.5 percent), and Israel (4.6 percent).105 Among various scientific departments, the Department of Health Research, set up under the MOHFW, received only seven crore rupees for the development of tools and technologies needed to combat disease outbreaks such as the new coronavirus. Furthermore, the department’s apex research organization, the ICMR, which is responsible for setting up diagnostic laboratories across India, has always faced budgetary constraints. In 2016, the then director general of ICMR reported that although ICMR had asked for 10,000 crores for a five-year plan from 2012 to 2017, only 50 percent of the amount was sanctioned.106 Similar reports highlighted that in 2020, when ICMR budgeted 2,300 crores for operations, it was allocated 1,795 crores.107 This mismatch between demanded and allocated funds, along with minimal investment in research to set up diagnostic labs, could be one of the many factors that contributed to India’s abysmally low testing numbers toward the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Because the research pipeline is not adequately developed, the country also struggled to ramp up domestic production of diagnostic kits. Several experts noted that this budget crunch might be detrimental to research and might impact innovation in public health.108

The Way Forward

Repeated outbreaks of infectious diseases along with a huge burden of noncommunicable diseases should be a warning for policymakers in India to invest more in public health, build capacity to face a biological emergency, strengthen its disease surveillance mechanism, enhance interministerial collaboration to avoid bureaucratic bottlenecks, and spend time to develop a strategy to respond to disease outbreaks (see box 1).

Box 1. Ways to Strengthen India’s Public Health Capacity The following are a set of recommendations for tackling diseases that emerge from natural sources: Restrengthen the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to reduce bureaucratic challenges and to coordinate effective prevention and response strategies needed to tackle biological emergencies. Create a new nodal agency such as the Office of Biological Threats Preparedness and Response (BTPR) under the NDMA to coordinate the policy responses during biological emergencies. Invest in basic healthcare, strong disease surveillance mechanisms, and public health research, as well as work with state governments to improve public health infrastructure. Introduce clearer and stronger incentives for personnel to identify and report disease outbreaks among plants, animals, and humans to strengthen the disease surveillance network. Aggregate data obtained from different disease surveillance programs that collect data on plant, animal, and human health to get a holistic view and to detect outbreaks in a timely manner. Develop reporting standards for common diseases to harmonize data collection from all organizations reporting disease outbreaks. Involve private stakeholders in the disease surveillance programs for better and more expansive outreach. Create an epidemiological model for diseases that considers the geographical location, demography, socioeconomic circumstances, and environmental conditions that are associated with disease occurrence. Develop public-private collaboration and identify stakeholders in advance who can ramp up the manufacturing of products and services needed during a biological emergency. Enhance interministerial collaboration to detect outbreaks, especially zoonotic infections, in a timely manner. Divert more money and resources to research bodies such as the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. Conduct simulation exercises to train, monitor, and assess the capacity of India’s emergency plans, procedures, and policies.

Assessing India’s Biosafety Landscape

To deal with the second category of risks (that is, risks emerging from human accidents), India has developed a series of biosafety guidelines and related rules and adherences to monitor and address the safety of research and its applications.

Biosafety seeks to keep laboratory workers and the surrounding environment physically safe from any unintentional exposure to dangerous or genetically engineered organisms. Personal protection such as laboratory coveralls and PPE to avoid accidental contact with blood, body fluids, and other potentially infectious material is necessary to ensure the safety of lab workers. Facility design and training to ensure safe handling of samples is important to reduce the possibilities of unintentional release of any organism into the environment.

Biosafety regulations and practices in India generally have three aims:

To prevent biological materials from escaping designated places in laboratories To prevent laboratory workers from unintentional exposure To prevent unintended consequences when genetically modified organisms are released purposefully into the environment

Existing Regulatory Framework

India’s 1989 Rules for Manufacture, Use/Import/Export, and Storage of Hazardous Microorganisms/Genetically Engineered Organisms or Cells (commonly called Rules 1989), notified under the 1986 Environment Protection Act, focuses on maintaining biosafety for all biotechnological experiments. These rules are supported by a series of guidelines issued by the DBT.109 These separate guidelines take into consideration the rapid pace of biotechnological advancements and the need to strengthen oversight for those involved in biotechnology research.

Under Rules 1989, DBT created the Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation (RCGM) to monitor the safety-related aspects of ongoing research projects or activities involving hazardous organisms. The RCGM includes representatives of DBT, the ICMR, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, and other experts in their individual capacity. RCGM may appoint subgroups to assist RCGM on matters related to risk assessment and in reviewing existing and preparing new guidelines.110

In 2017, RCGM consolidated all existing guidelines issued by the DBT and released a new paper titled, Regulations and Guidelines on Biosafety of Recombinant DNA Research and Biocontainment. These guidelines prescribe containment measures for storage, growth, research, manufacture, exchange, import, and export of genetically engineered and non–genetically engineered organisms (microorganisms, animals, plants, arthropods, and aquatic organisms) and products of such organisms. It provides clarity on biosafety requirements and recommendations for facility design, biosafety equipment, PPE, good laboratory practices, and waste management.111

Rules 1989 assigns biosafety governance to two separate ministries—the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MOEFCC). These rules apply over three different phases—pre-research, research, and commercial release. RCGM oversees the research on genetically engineered organisms and permits small-scale field trials. The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), set up under MOEFCC, monitors deliberate and commercial release of genetically engineered organisms.

Six governmental bodies advise, oversee, and in some cases, monitor the implementation of regulations produced by the Ministries of Science and Technology and of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (see table 1).

Table 1: Competent Authorities Under Rules 1989 Competent Authorities Role Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee Advisory Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBSC)

District Level Committee (DLC) Monitoring SOURCE: Ministry of Science and Technology, Department of Biotechnology, Regulations and Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research and Biocontainment 2017 (New Delhi: Government of India, 2017).

The Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, constituted by the DBT, takes note of all national and international biotech developments and recommends suitable and appropriate safety regulations for India in recombinant research.

Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBSCs) are constituted by all centers engaged in genetic engineering research. They are the nodal points for implementing biosafety guidelines and for interaction within institutions. Based on internal deliberations, IBSCs notify the RCGM if the host institution has enough biosafety capacity and infrastructure to safely conduct the study, without any risks.

A RCGM constitutes a team with its own members (and sometimes even external experts) who periodically monitor the safety of ongoing research projects or activities involving hazardous microorganisms, genetically engineered organisms, and their products in the areas of human and animal healthcare, agriculture, industry, and environmental management.112

After the RCGM recommends product safety measures based on small-scale trials and preclinical data, GEAC approves activities involving the large-scale use of hazardous microorganisms and recombinant products in research and industrial production. GEAC also examines data from clinical trials with respect to living modified organisms and grants clearances pertaining to the discharge of genetically engineered organisms from labs and hospitals into the environment.

At the state level, the State Biotechnology Coordination Committee (SBCC) inspects, investigates, and takes punitive action in case of safety violations and on-site control measures to reduce the damage, if any, due to release of genetically engineered organisms.

District Level Committees (DLCs), headed by a district collector, monitor safety regulations in installations engaged in the use of genetically modified organisms and their applications in the environment.

In addition to these authorities, RCGM and GEAC sometimes constitute committees on a case-by-case basis with experts from different disciplines drawn from public-sector institutions. For agricultural products, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research is responsible for conducting biosafety analysis.113 Specific to medicines, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, headed by the Drugs Controller General of India, is responsible for approving preclinical and clinical trials, new drug applications, and the importation of drugs.114

Gaps in the Existing Framework

Although India has multiple authorities set up at each step to ensure safety of biotechnological research, experts in India point out that illegal cultivation of genetically modified cotton and brinjal in different pockets of the country exposes the weak implementation of biosafety guidelines and limited communication with the society.115 GEAC approved the commercial cultivation of genetically modified cotton in the southeastern state of Andhra Pradesh, despite the absence of SBCC and DLC monitors in the state. Field trials of this cotton in most areas were carried out without prior intimation from designated state authorities. These examples reveal poor coordination between central and state regulatory bodies and weak implementation of biosafety regulations.116 Moreover, regulatory bodies at the state level do not have a meeting schedule, which sometimes results in approval delays for private-sector developers of transgenic crops.117

Distrust between the scientific community and regulatory bodies is another challenge that sometimes leads to delayed approvals. While scientists or researchers perform all the necessary safety tests before approaching regulatory authorities, the regulators, perhaps influenced by activist groups, perform additional safety tests that delay the clearance of such products. Whether such additional tests are necessary or not is often disputed. This regulatory uncertainty and the slow approval process create commercial risks that often result in limited monetary support from banks, private-sector developers, angel investors, and venture capitalists. As a result, government is the sole driver of research and innovation in the country. Unfortunately, most of this government funding is exhausted before products reach the market phase. This creates a huge gap between research and commercialization of products.

In 2013, the Ministry of Science and Technology introduced to Parliament the Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India Bill, which has now lapsed.118 The bill mandated the creation of a Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India (BRAI) with the head office in the National Capital Region and the capacity to set up regional offices across the country, in concurrence with the central government. This authority was proposed to replace the GEAC and the RCGM and act as an independent statutory body related to all biosafety matters. BRAI would have had the power to regulate the research, transport, import, manufacture, and use of organisms to ensure human and animal health. The bill did a commendable job in making this authority the single nodal agency for international activities, monitoring, reviewing, and analyzing national and international policies that might affect the government’s priorities in relation to the modern biotechnology sector.

To promote interdepartmental cooperation for effective implementation of the regulatory system, the bill also had provisions to set up an interministerial governing board and biotechnology advisory council with representatives from the Ministries of Food Processing Industries; Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare; Animal Husbandry, Dairying, and Fisheries; Health and Family Welfare; Science and Technology, Environment, Forest, and Climate Change; Commerce and Industry; and External Affairs, along with members from scientific and research organizations. This interministerial board was to promote interministerial or departmental cooperation for the effective implementation of the regulatory system.119

Unlike the GEAC, which is a multidisciplinary authority responsible for approval of genetically engineered products, the BRAI was proposed to include only scientific experts. Scientists have the capacity to assess the implications of their research on both public health and the environment, but they might not be suitably trained to take policy decisions and build public trust in their decisions.120

The Way Forward

Biosafety infrastructure in India aims to ensure that genetically modified plants, animals, and insects would only be introduced into society after experiments have proven it safe to do so. However, coordination issues often hamper the effective and smooth functioning of this regulatory setup. It is therefore important to introduce measures that can ensure rigorous monitoring of biotechnological experiments, bridge gaps between the regulators and the scientists, build public trust, and ensure no lab accidents occur (see box 2).

Box 2: Ways to Strengthen India’s Biosafety Infrastructure The following set of recommendations address the gaps in India’s biosafety infrastructure: Ensure better coordination between central and state regulatory authorities to minimize chances of illegal cultivation of transgenics. In addition to frequent regular on-site visits by regulators during large-scale field trials, surprise inspections will help in better implementation of biosafety guidelines. Perform rigorous monitoring of research and the commercial cultivation of transgenic crops, but also monitor social responses and attitudes—an imperative to avoid illegal cultivation of genetically modified crops. Develop a standard evaluation form for researchers to harmonize application protocols and to ensure efficiency. For transparent decisionmaking, regulators should also publish the evaluation strategy and reports. Introduce mandatory certification and validation mechanisms for biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) labs that sometimes work with high-risk pathogens Monitor the implementation of protocols needed to discard biomedical waste and dispose of animals used in drug testing and clinical trials to ensure there are no biosafety lapses. Initiate a mechanism that encourages reporting of accidents when they occur. Even though there have not been a significant number of lab-acquired infections in India, it is important to have a process in place to prevent such accidents. Incentives can be introduced for those who report a lab accident. Conduct periodic training of laboratory personnel on the safe handling of samples, decontamination procedures, and the proper disposal of biomedical waste. Broaden the proposed scope of Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India (BRAI). If the BRAI bill is ever reintroduced into the parliament, include representatives from the scientific and academic communities as well as members from the appropriate government departments, the private sector, bioethicists, security forces, and the civil society groups that represent farmers’ interests.

Assessing India’s Biosecurity Landscape

For risks arising through deliberate sources, India still does not have a formal biosecurity policy, but it has numerous guidelines, laws, and rules to govern biosecurity.

Biosecurity supports governments to defend against actors that might seek to divert technology or biological material for offensive military or terrorist purposes. Terrorists are the most obvious threat here, but so are criminal networks seeking sensitive intellectual property and other data they could sell. But such actors could be abetted by people working within bioresearch institutions. This is one reason why securing a laboratory and safeguarding its assets (such as organisms, information, tools, and technologies) are of paramount importance. Institutions that harbor such facilities, researchers working there, and the governmental authorities regulating such research have a collective responsibility to prevent unregulated access.

Security regulations therefore have four aims:

To prevent unauthorized or ill-conceived release of naturally occurring biological agents To prevent laboratory insiders from causing harm To prevent theft or acquisition of sensitive research, organisms, and information for nonlegitimate use To prevent weaponization of pathogens

Existing Regulatory Framework

Multiple entities work to implement the five major pieces of legislation that regulate the protection of humans, plants, animals, and the environment from disease-causing organisms in India. Together, these laws reflect differing objectives and public concerns.

First, the 2006 Food Safety and Standards Act was primarily legislated to guarantee the availability of safe and wholesome food to ensure human biosecurity in India. The act established a single-point reference system for food safety called the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), which is under MOHFW. The authority formulates science-based standards for food articles and regulates their manufacture, import, storage, and distribution. FSSAI also collects data regarding the incidence and prevalence of biological risks and coordinates with central and state governments to implement crisis management procedures.121 FSSAI is assisted by several scientific panels and a central advisory committee for its overall functioning. Though standards and regulatory frameworks are developed by FSSAI, enforcement of this legislation lies with the state governments and union territories through the state commissioner for food safety and panchayats and municipal bodies.

Second, the 1914 Destructive Insects and Pests Act (DIP Act) regulates the introduction and movement of any insect, fungus, or other pest that may be destructive to crops. The aim is to strengthen agricultural biosafety and prevent the emergence of biosecurity threats in India. Recognizing the impact of globalization and developments in biotechnology, in 2003 the Plant Quarantine (Regulation of Import into India) Order was issued under the DIP Act.122 The order expanded the scope of the original 1914 act to include germplasm, genetically engineered organisms, and transgenic material for research and was an effort to harmonize India’s regulations with international standards.123 The new order established the Plant Quarantine Organization of India, under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, as the national plant protection organization. The central government, through the Joint Secretary in Charge of Plant Protection in the Department of Agriculture Cooperation and Family Welfare can relax conditions relating to the import of any consignment.124 However, the import and export of plants and plant products for commercial purposes is still separately regulated under the Rules 1989 issued by the MOEFCC under the 1986 Environment Protection Act.125

Third, the 1898 Livestock Importation Act (LI Act), which was amended in 2001, prevents biosecurity threats associated with the import of livestock affected by infectious or contagious disorders. The act empowers customs officials at every port, airport, inland container depot, and land customs station to regulate, restrict, or prohibit the import of livestock or livestock products that pose a threat to animal or human health.126 State governments also have the power to make rules for the detention, inspection, disinfection, or destruction of imported livestock and other items, as well as to regulate the powers and duties of the officers it may appoint.127 In addition to the LI Act, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare also coordinates the import and export of livestock and livestock-related products through animal quarantine and certification services. The MOEFCC, under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, is responsible for maintaining wildlife health in sanctuaries and national parks. The Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairy, and Fisheries is responsible for monitoring and coordinating the various institutions associated with animal health.128

Fourth, the 2009 Prevention and Control of Infectious and Contagious Diseases in Animals Act provides for the prevention, control, and eradication of infectious diseases of animals to avoid such diseases having an adverse impact on the economy of the country, to prevent interstate transmission of animal diseases, and to meet India’s international obligations for export and import of animal and animal products.129

Fifth, India enacted the 2005 Weapons of Mass Destruction and Their Delivery Systems (Prohibition of Unlawful Activities) Act that fulfills India’s commitment to the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), including nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. The act was adopted to exercise controls over the export of materials, equipment, and technologies and to prohibit unlawful activities in relation to WMD and their means of delivery. The act declares that “no person shall unlawfully manufacture, acquire, possess, develop or transport a biological or chemical weapon or their means of delivery.”130This law was most recently in the news afte","Because India shares porous borders with most of its neighboring states, the possibility of cross-border infections is another major biological threat.
Whether or not the office is set up, this section proposes other recommendations to strengthen India’s public health infrastructure, necessary to tackle both natural and manmade biological threats.
Rather than using the time between two outbreaks to develop national legislation to tackle infectious diseases, India mostly relies on ad hoc notifications and guidelines.
For example, training of public health professionals, epidemiologists, and other frontline workers seem to be notably absent from the bill.
Invest in basic healthcare, strong disease surveillance mechanisms, and public health research, as well as work with state governments to improve public health infrastructure."

The Kenosha Black Activist Gregory Bennett Jr. was a major protest leader following the shooting of Jacob Blake last summer. A 10-year Army veteran, Bennett is the founder of Peace in the Streets and a sought-after motivational speaker. I met Bennett in the Milwaukee Marshall High School parking lot where he was helping give out food packages to needy families from Milwaukee’s North Side. He is 41 and a father to three children. He has a strong, serious personality and exudes self-confidence.

Gregory, let’s start out with where you grew up.

I was raised in Kenosha and went to the schools there. Growing up in Kenosha, it was the same as it is today but a lot rougher in the ‘80s and ‘90s. The neighborhoods were more cut-throat. You screw up on the streets, you get taught a lesson. My mom, me, and my brother were homeless for a short time, but she got married when I was 11, and life got better. The world’s getting better, but Kenosha isn’t much better. After high school, I ended up in the military, the Army. Started out at Fort Polk, then was sent to Germany, then Kosovo, and three years in Iraq for two tours, and also Fort Lewis near Tacoma, Washington.

Kenosha’s an old industrial town, a smaller version of Milwaukee and with the same kind of racial problems.

In the ‘80s and ‘90s, lots of people worked for Chrysler, General Motors or Case in Racine. Now it’s more warehouse work through Amazon and Uline Shipping, and the jobs pay less. My pop, he’s my stepfather, he worked at Chrysler and was in the National Guard. Mom worked at Jupiter Transportation and she did Microsoft work when computer software was first coming out.

Where did you go to high school?

I went to Bradford but graduated from Reuther Central High School. I got expelled from Bradford because I told the History teacher “I’m tired of learning your version of history, Teacher.” I got tired of hearing about George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Not Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Nat Turner, Frederick Douglas, or Harriet Tubman. I had to do my own research on those activists. At Reuther, they let the students do our own teaching based on what we chose to study. I liked that experience. Reuther had a performing arts curriculum and a military academy.

Friends of the Shepherd Help support Milwaukee's locally owned free weekly newspaper. LEARN MORE

Moving forward, what did you do after you got out of high school?

I did 10 years in the Army, stationed all over the world. I was 30 when I got out. I stayed in Tacoma, Washington for four years. Me and my battle buddies from the war owned a record label and had a distribution deal. We traveled around the world doing music. In 2014, my mom ended up getting sick, and I came back to Kenosha. That’s when I started noticing that the streets hadn’t changed that much. I stepped up to help. Kenosha needed a community center. I started doing my Peace in the Streets barbecues, talent shows, and basketball. Mayor Bosman worked with me, and we opened up three community centers. I ran for Alderman a few times. Then some children got arrested for not picking up trash at Lincoln Park, wasn’t their trash, but the cop had ‘em on the ground. I consulted my lawyer. We went down to the station and got the kids released. Too many cops instill fear instead of helping. I figured I had the responsibility to lead from the front.

Philosophy of Activism

When did you start your movement, Peace In The Streets?

I started Peace in the Streets unofficially in 2014, but in 2018 when I got the money, I did the official paperwork as a 501 C4 corporation. I’d do street barbecues, maybe 500 people at a time. We were teaching baseball. We had software experts teaching kids computer code and creating Apps. Chess competitions, ping pong competitions. Doing things for the kids.

On the broader subject, the cancer of racism, prejudice and hatred. I’ve been writing about the Milwaukee inner city. I’ve spent a fair amount of time in the hardcore neighborhoods, talking to residents and on the ground leaders. I feel the mainstream media have not told the stories of everyday people who live in these neighborhoods. I ask what the residents want, the ones who put up with crime, drug dealing, reckless driving, shootings. They want to be rid of the criminal element. They want peace and safety.

In Kenosha, people were pretending everything was OK. But the ignorance of racism was always there. Black businesses aren’t allowed to thrive. Banks put them on probation for two years and don’t give them a chance. Result? Restaurants, clubs, candy shops closing. Trump gave ignorance a voice. Not long ago, when we did the protest walk from Kenosha to Milwaukee, somebody spit at us. Black people are tired of having to deal with this kind of ignorance. thought we were past this. Yet, we Americans are still divided. Why do we have to march to be included in the budget, in the boardroom, in the planning phases? We are tired of just talking. Aldermen have been here too long saying the same things. To unite, it is gonna take equity and equality. Kenosha doesn’t have that.

I am very troubled by this hatred between Americans, between the races, the tribes, the economic classes. The Black inner city culture is considerably different than the rural culture 40 minutes west of Milwaukee. But can’t we just understand and accept our different ways? Is that possible?

I do think it’s possible. Think about it. Take any street in West Allis, then take North Richards Street in Milwaukee. The residents want the same thing. They want to be understood, they want equality, and they want peace. They want to live their lives and have a piece of the pie. We’re in the number one state for incarcerating Black males. Milwaukee, Kenosha and Racine have the majority of African Americans. By the time they are 18, a lot of Black kids are on probation. In the Army I was a Combat Engineer, a sapper, it’s like Special Forces. My specialty was disarming IED’s, raiding houses, interrogating people. That kind of danger is addicting, the adrenalin rush. But we also built schools. The people appreciated us. When I got back to Kenosha, I started working with the DWD on Chase Street in Milwaukee, then worked for the Department of Corrections as a probation and parole agent. But even with my credentials they had to let me go for budget reasons. Same with teachers who have credentials. In some cases, our children are teaching our children. It’s not inclusion or equality. Me and you want peace and can have a dialog, but when will our politicians institute actionable items?

The Problem of Crime

Inner city Black residents are trying to live a life in 53206 and obey the laws, but they are concerned about several major problems. One, the amount of crimes in their neighborhoods, and two the lack of fathers, lack of strong Black male role models. Then there are the Black on Black crimes, domestic violence, shootings and murders. And recidivism, Black criminals let out of prison to repeat their crimes.

Let’s change the narrative. If we put a released prisoner on parole or probation after serving his crime, what success rate does he have? How can he get a job? It then becomes a jungle, a dog eat dog world. When he gets out of prison, the resources need to be available.

But you have to think of the welfare of the majority of the residents who live in neighborhoods like 53206 where crime is common. They don’t want drug dealers, car thieves, gang violence.

Criminals are not in the majority. I worked as a parole officer. I can tell that mental health was a huge issue. All my clients were mental health patients, and they were in prison instead of in treatment. We need mental health facilities.

A lot of young Black men and boys look up to the gang leaders and drug dealers because they don’t have strong male role models.

Who’s glorified on TV? The media glorifies the gangsters, we got all these gangster movies and TV shows, and news is filled with crime. Without fathers, mothers may be on assistance, and then the kids do anything to help mom out. Next thing you know, a gang leader puts a bag in their hands and they are making more money than their moms. African Americans are working at poor jobs, warehouse jobs.

What would you have them do?

What happened to unions? What happened to carpenters, plumbers, electricians? Apprenticeship programs in the DWD are great, but some employers won’t accept a man with a prison record.

Two Black leaders I’ve gotten to know, Vaun Mayes and Frank Nitty. They want to see money spent to train Black men in the trades.

That is exactly what is needed. Along with that, landlords and slumlords should be held accountable, and also the tenants who also have to take care of the places. Cops need to protect and serve, not just arrest people. As a cop, you should be walking the streets, shaking hands, getting to know the residents, helping, not punishing. It’s called protect and serve.

The Use of Public Money

Here is an idea I’ve heard from on the ground leaders. The city of Milwaukee has all kinds of abandoned buildings and houses. Why can’t they be given to residents, educational entities, and business people who will fix them up, make improvements, actually use these buildings?

I tried that with the old Bain Elementary School in Kenosha. City told me no, and then they tore it down and made a new fire department when the police department was still in the county building. They tell me I need the money to purchase it. I go to a bank and find the overhead is too high for me to make it work. Just give me a 2-year contract of rent to own and let’s see what I can do with it. If I can get a small shopping center, I can make businesses work for our community. Think about this. We put $2 million in a trolley streetcar that makes older Blacks think about the time they had to ride on the back of the bus.

You should hear the Black city council members scramble when I ask them how they could have voted for the trolley when the streets of the inner city are cracked and pot-holed and the alleys are filled with garbage and many buildings are abandoned.

Nobody rides that trolley. It’s just running. They made jobs for a driver to run it, a few mechanics to maintenance. Couldn’t we use that money for something better?

Changing gears, you said you are a motivational speaker, that you speak at the Sturtivant Institution, Racine Correctional Institution, KCDC, the Milwaukee pipeline program. You told me you will be a graduation speaker at a Racine high school in January. What is the message of your speeches?

My biggest message is stay motivated. First, you gotta break down and then build back up. I get the participants to break down their doubts and fears, and then I tell them to get rid of them. They have to realize that they are worthy. I get them to do that. Then, I get them to over-stand until they understand. The goal is to get you to realize you have capabilities and you are just as worthy as anybody else. Why don’t you feel like voting matters or getting a regular job matters? Why don’t you realize that homes, families, fathers, sons, daughters, mothers, wives matter? No, currently being a playboy is in, and being a hot girl is in. Now we got women’s rights, LGBTQ rights, then we got blue lives matter, but we need to realize that African American men’s lives matter too. My message? If we create peace and we create true unity, and if we finish with what JFK, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, if we finish their work, then imagine the legacies we can leave for our children.

Prejudice and Systemic Racism

Here is something I’ve done, though sporadically. When I talk to some Black inner city residents and we have a connection, I will admit that I am prejudiced, that I’m an older white man who grew up in an all-white small town and that I do have prejudice against some Black people, mainly younger Black men who make me afraid. I tend to assume they are gangbangers. This opens a dialog where the residents tell me they have prejudice against some white behavior. OK, let’s start the understanding from there. This doesn’t mean we can’t get along and respect each other’s cultures.

Prejudice and systemic racism are two different things. You can be prejudiced toward fat people or people who are too loud. I need to honor your honesty. That’s cool, you feel me? But the systemic portion means you whites control the bank, the jobs, the money, the housing. We are trying to break down social injustice. In an AA meeting, you admit that you are an alcoholic. So then admit you are part of systemic racism and then help fix it.

Systemic racism is also where some whites have white guilt but they rope themselves off into closed neighborhoods, profess they support BLM but don’t get involved with Black people on the ground.

Because they know it will mess with their livelihoods. Any time somebody like you or me stands up for justice and civil rights, we are at risk of being a martyr and being hurt or killed. I’ve even had death threats.","× Expand Photo Credit: Tom JenzThe Kenosha Black Activist Gregory Bennett Jr. was a major protest leader following the shooting of Jacob Blake last summer.

Mali’s geographical position in a Sahel that has been plagued by insecurity for many years exposes the country to security instability that is aggravated continuously by attacks by non-State armed groups present in the region, including jihadist groups, armed bandit groups, and community vigilante groups, particularly in the border areas with Algeria, Burkina Faso, and Niger. As a result, Mali has been experiencing instability and conflict period since the military coup of 2012 and the north of the country’s occupation by armed groups.

The country’s security situation creates many uncertainties, particularly about its economic and social development. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how security and development are linked in the specific context of the Sahel. It is against this backdrop that this monograph has been prepared, offering a situational analysis of critical issues related to security, development, and population dynamics in Mali.

Despite the signing of two peace agreements between the various players in Ouagadougou in June 2013 and in Algiers in June 2015, central and northern Mali’s situation continues to deteriorate. In the North, violence continues to escalate. Jihadist groups continue their attacks and many armed groups with a wide range of demands are organizing. At the same time, the conflict has moved to the country’s centre, where insecurity is increasing, and there is a rise in organized crime and communalism. Moreover, and as with everywhere else in the Sahel, Mali has become a transit point for all kinds of trafficking over the last ten years or so, particularly in migrants, cigarettes, drugs, etc. All these facts illustrate the complexity of Mali’s security problem, highlighting the interactions between several issues, including governance, legitimate violence, justice, land issues, inter-community divisions, regional integration, organized crime, climate change, development, and even patriarchal institutions.

To date, instability with regard to the country’s security has resulted in thousands of casualties and hundreds of thousands of displaced persons. The number of deaths continues to rise dramatically each year, and civilians seem to pay a heavy price for this. This has established Mali as the fourth most deadly country in armed conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa, after Somalia, Southern Sudan and the Central African Republic. Other acts of grave violations committed include violations of the right to life, torture, sexual violence, arrests, arbitrary detention, violations of property rights, and collective punishment.

The social and human consequences of all these acts of violence, beyond the immediate cost of death and injury, include migration or displacement of people, closure of businesses, reduced investment, decline in tourism, and lack of institutions’ legitimacy. The result is a considerable increase in new public expenditure for reconstructing destroyed infrastructure, assistance to displaced populations, and the resettlement of displaced persons and refugees in their homes and regions of origin. There is also significant new public expenditure involved in the costs of negotiating and implementing the peace and reconciliation agreement in Mali and establishing the new institutions that will be created under that agreement.

At the same time, the deteriorating security situation has prompted the country’s authorities to define new programmes for internal and external security and strengthen the law enforcement apparatus.. Thus, Mali has become caught up in an arms race, sharply increasing its defence and security spending. From 2010 to 2018, the government’s military spending effort increased quite significantly. In fact, there was slightly more than a threefold spending increase during this period. Mali’s military expenditure increased by 233% between 2010 and 2018, which corresponds to an average annual increase of 14% over this period.

However, these increases in military spending have taken place in a context where the State’s resources have not increased much. Over the same period (2010-2018), the overall state budget grew at an average annual rate of only 7% and tax revenues by 6%, well below the annual growth rate of military expenditure (14%). Under these conditions, the reallocation of resources is the only option open to the Malian State to support these new military expenditures. The reallocation of resources consists of a readjustment of expenditures in line with the forecasts in the original Budget Act. In the new security environment, reallocation has become an increasingly common means in Sahelian countries to finance new needs in internal and external security and management of the implications of conflict.

The immediate implication is that with the government’s limited overall budget, the increase in military spending has a crowding effect on other government spending components such as education and health spending in Mali. The analysis indicates that quite a strong crowding-out effect is occurring as a result of central government spending in the health sector. The health sector is the biggest loser of the increase in defence budget allocations. Between 2010 and 2018, the share of public health expenditure in the State budget was maintained at an average of less than 5 percent, while military expenditure doubled from 7 percent to 14 percent of the State budget.

The crowding-out effect on public spending on education is equally present, though less apparent. The share of education expenditure in the State budget has remained broadly stable, fluctuating around 17 per cent over the 2008-2018 period. At the same time, the share of military expenditure in the overall State budget has been steadily increasing. A catch-up effect was even observed towards the end of the period, when the military spending share reached almost 15%, while the public education spending share dropped to 15%.

These crowding-out effects are all the more worrying given Mali’s overall capital performance alarming. Despite the efforts made over the past six decades, Mali has a severe human capital deficit. It is among the African countries with the lowest score on the human capital index published in 2018. With a score of 0.32 out of a maximum of 1, Mali is ranked 40th, just ahead of Southern Sudan and Chad, and at the same level as Liberia and Niger.

Mali’s score of 0.32 on the Human Assets Index means that the level of income that a child born in Mali today can expect to achieve as an adult will be 68% lower than it would have been if he or she had been fully educated and lived in good health. Mali’s score of 0.32 also means that the country could reach a future GDP per worker three times higher if it reached the level corresponding to complete schooling and full health.

Furthermore, it should be noted that the human capital deficit could worsen in the future due to uncertainty with regard to the country’s security and in particular, due to population growth. All population projections indicate that Mali will experience a considerable increase in its population by 2050, regardless of the total fertility rate (TFR) variation.

Over the next three decades, Mali’s population will continue to grow regardless of the trend in the TFR, mainly due to population momentum.

In its quest for accelerated economic and social transformation of the country, the Government of Mali should pay particular attention to this demographic dynamic and its impact on development. This cannot be achieved by focusing on the economic dimension alone. Demographics are also a determining factor. Human capital (the potential of each individual) is the most crucial investment that Mali will have to make in this perspective.

Analysis of the costs associated with the investments needed to close the human capital gap shows that this objective is in fact achievable if the State implements bold policies that allow it to generate sufficient fiscal margins to finance these investments. The prerequisite, however, is to create the conditions for just and lasting peace, which would enable the country to mobilize itself to initiate and implement the reforms needed to increase the growth rate and the level of mobilization of the State’s resources (increase tax rates).","Thus, Mali has become caught up in an arms race, sharply increasing its defence and security spending.
From 2010 to 2018, the government’s military spending effort increased quite significantly.
In fact, there was slightly more than a threefold spending increase during this period.
However, these increases in military spending have taken place in a context where the State’s resources have not increased much.
At the same time, the share of military expenditure in the overall State budget has been steadily increasing."
167,https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/ethiopia-nobel-peace-laureate-goes-war,"Wed, 09 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting,"In Ethiopia, a Nobel Peace Laureate Goes to War","NAIROBI, Kenya — Last year he won the Nobel Peace Prize. This year, he went to war.

But to those familiar with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's life and political career, his morals haven't changed.

A onetime soldier, his country's current fight has ignited a refugee crisis and may further unsettle the precarious Horn of Africa region. A Pentecostal Christian in a religiously diverse nation — still the youngest leader on the continent at age 44 — he's shown a penchant for shaking up the status quo.

His career shaped by conflict abroad and ethnic divisions at home, Abiy — who in his Nobel acceptance speech said war creates savage men — responded to an attack last month by an armed separatist movement in the nation's northern Tigray region with a military campaign of his own. Experts say the resulting civil conflict is the inevitable result of Abiy's attempt to unify under a central government the many ethnic groups of Africa's second most populous nation.

""Ethiopia's federalism is unique,"" said Ken O. Opalo, a professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service. ""Nowhere else in Africa do you have subnational units that are allowed to run their own militias and police forces. Regional governments are allowed to arm themselves — and that is part of Abiy's challenge.""

After the Tigray People's Liberation Front attacked federal military bases in early November, Abiy retaliated with an air and ground campaign meant to oust the TPLF. The conflict has killed hundreds of soldiers on both sides as well as thousands of civilians. Nearly 2 million people are in need of food assistance in and around Tigray, and an estimated 1 million people have been displaced, according to the United Nations. At least 45,000 Ethiopians — mostly Tigrayans — have fled as refugees to neighboring Sudan.

On Nov. 28, Abiy declared victory after his Ethiopian National Defense Force seized the Tigrayan regional capital of Mekele. But reports suggest the fighting is far from over, with the TPLF preparing for a protracted insurgency that could drag on for months or even years if Abiy's military doesn't manage to swiftly apprehend its leaders.

The irony of a recent Nobel Peace Prize winner heading to war has not been lost on observers. Some believe the prize is intended to nudge leaders in the right direction.

President Obama received his prize after just one year in office. Cited for his calls of increased cooperation between the Muslim world and the West, he would go on to launch 542 drone strikes across the Middle East and Africa that killed at least 324 civilians in Muslim countries. His ouster of Libyan dictator Moammar Kadafi led to total state collapse that became fertile ground for a refugee crisis that continues to this day.

In Myanmar, activist Aung San Suu Kyi spent 15 years in prison for her attempt to democratize the nation. She won the prize in 1991, but since becoming the government's leader in 2016 has formed close ties with Myanmar's military and did little to stop the 2016-17 genocide and mass displacement of minority Rohingya Muslims in the majority-Buddhist nation.

A Military Man

Ethiopia's Nobel Peace laureate is no stranger to war.

Abiy came to peacemaking from the ground up. As a teenager, he worked as a radio operator in the fight to end the 13-year dictatorship of Mengistu Haile Mariam. After Mengistu's ouster in 1991, a Tigrayan named Meles Zenawi ruled Ethiopia until his death in 2012.

During the Meles years Abiy became a soldier. He was deployed as a U.N. peacekeeper to Rwanda following the 1994 genocide, in which 600,000 to 800,000 Tutsis were slaughtered by Hutus. Abiy saw firsthand the carnage that can result when ethnic tribalism escalates into violence.

""My short engagement in the mission allowed me to bear witness to the devastation caused by intolerance,"" Abiy said in an April 2019 speech commemorating the 25th anniversary of the genocide. He called on those in attendance ""to strengthen our commitment to never allow such tragedies in any corner of the world.""

But Abiy didn't know peace for long. Upon his return to Ethiopia in 1998, he was dispatched to the Eritrean border to oversee communications and intelligence during a war that claimed tens of thousands of lives and ultimately led to Eritrea's independence.

Abiy ""was a military man, so by definition, he wasn't some peacemaker,"" said Opalo. In his ascendance to power, ""he was a politician doing what politicians do.""

Navigating a Nation Along Ethnic Lines

Abiy himself is a mixture of Ethiopia's most prominent religions and ethnicities. His mother is an Orthodox Christian and his father was an Oromo Muslim.

In addition to speaking Oromo, Amharic and English, Abiy studied the Tigrinya language and made a name for himself among Tigrayan military leaders.

In 2010, Abiy returned to his hometown to mediate between Muslims and Christians after the killing of Christians there. Later that year he was elected to Ethiopia's Parliament and soon began brokering peace between his native Oromo and the neighboring Amhara.

The Oromo are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia but have long been sidelined from national politics. When mass protests broke out across Ethiopia in 2015 and 2016 by Oromos demanding reforms, Abiy ""just so happened to be at the right place at the right time,"" said Opalo.

""There was increasing pressure to change leadership and to have an Oromo prime minister,"" said Opalo, and Abiy ""emerged as the most prominent Oromo politician because of his military and intelligence background.""

In 2018, Abiy was appointed prime minister of Ethiopia by Parliament, at age 41, not only making him the youngest leader in all of Africa, but the first Oromo to lead the country.

Peace Deal Followed by War

""His ascendance to prime minister was really dramatic,"" said Yohannes Gedamu, an Ethiopian lecturer of political science at Georgia Gwinnett College — and so were his first acts in power. ""He expanded the media space, the political space. He invited formerly marginalized parties — the Gambela, the Somalis — he brought all of them together.""

""The freeing of [political] prisoners, the freeing of the press, plans to privatize banks, telecommunications and other parts of the economy — those are big things given what Ethiopia has looked like"" historically, said Opalo.

In 2018 Abiy met with Isaias Afwerki of neighboring Eritrea. The two leaders agreed to normalize relations and trade after a nearly two-decade standoff, earning Abiy the Nobel Peace Prize last year.

But that peace deal may have inadvertently set the stage for today's war.

""The Ethiopian state making peace with the Eritrean state — in doing so he was undercutting the hard-liners within TPLF,"" whose soldiers had fought the brunt of Ethiopia's war against Eritrea, said Opalo. Suddenly, many TPLF leaders felt betrayed by Abiy. This dissatisfaction would simmer until last month, when it escalated into all-out war.

The Death of a Singer and Human Rights Violations

Abiy faced a major test of his leadership when the popular musician Hachalu Hundessa was shot and killed in the capital of Addis Ababa in June. Like Abiy, the 34-year-old Hachalu was Oromo, and his music served as a soundtrack for the 2015-16 protests that paved the path to Abiy's rise.

Massive protests decrying Hachalu's killing turned violent as security forces arrested thousands of people and hundreds were killed over several days. To quell the protests, Abiy's government imposed an internet blackout — a tactic condemned by the U.N.

Abiy knows the power of information well. He once directed Ethiopia's Information Network Security Agency, which oversees cybersecurity. Upon taking power he unblocked websites and TV channels, only to begin imposing new internet blackouts months later. He rarely speaks with journalists, and Ethiopia's Embassy in Nairobi has refused visas to journalists wishing to cover the conflict in Tigray. Abiy's press office declined to respond to discrepancies between his recent claim that not one person was hurt by the federal military offensive in Tigray and Red Cross reports from hospitals that hundreds have been wounded.

Under Abiy's leadership, African journalists have been arrested and detained. Earlier this year police arrested Jawar Mohammed, an Oromo nationalist politician and media owner who often criticizes Abiy.

Since his ascendancy, Abiy's security forces have committed rape and extrajudicial killings, burned down homes and arbitrarily arrested people en masse, according to Amnesty International. In 2019 police beat detainees whom they had arbitrarily arrested, and shot and killed civilians passing by on motorcycles.

""Given the institutions we have inherited, we realize that law-enforcement activities entail a risk of human-rights violations and abuse,"" Abiy wrote in a September op-ed. ""The mindset and tactics of the past are not so easy to unlearn. Security and judicial reforms take time.""

Some analysts say that by failing to reform his security forces, Abiy is undermining his own legitimacy and tarnishing his name as a broker of peace. But Abiy's defenders contend that his heavy hand is a necessary part of his attempt to unify a nation of 110 million people who for decades have defined themselves along ethnic lines.

""Abiy wants a centralized strong state that can direct traffic from the center,"" said Opalo.

Before Abiy's rule, ""group rights were promoted, but it came at the expense of individual human rights, meaning people who lived in different parts of the country are subject to different laws,"" said Gedamu.

But many Oromo in particular became disillusioned with Abiy upon witnessing his security forces clash violently with people of their own ethnicity after Hachalu was killed this year.

""Oromos are dying when the Tigrayans are in power, and Oromos are dying even now. So what is the difference?"" said Fekadu Diriba, an Ethiopian living in Nairobi, Kenya.

""As someone who sees himself as a young modernizer, he has a reformist side, which was the 'early' Abiy. Everyone was very hopeful about that,"" said Opalo. ""But ultimately he's also a military man. He definitely has a small attention span when it comes to debating issues or being open to criticism, and I think that shows in his approach to dissent both in the Oromia region and across country.""

Analysts say Abiy's decision to form a new political party and expel all Tigrayans from his Cabinet — and lawmakers' October decision to cut funding to Tigray — paved a path to the current conflict. ""Public opinion was also against negotiating with the Tigrayans,"" said Opalo. ""They saw them as spoiled brats who had dominated the state since 1995.""

Now that the TPLF are out of office and onto the battlefield, Abiy ""realizes the country is facing an existential threat,"" said Gedamu. ""Just think about Texas attacking one of the army bases in Florida or New Mexico — what would you expect?""

""It's not sustainable to have lots of armed subnational groups challenging the state,"" agreed Opalo. ""He is doing what any state would do when faced with a subnational rebellion, which is trying to defeat it by force.""

Africa has shown itself to be a leader on climate-related security risks. Indeed, Kenya’s winning bid for a seat on the United Nations Security Council included a pledge to ‘‘seek lasting solutions to security challenges caused by erratic climatic conditions’’.

The African Union, for its part, is one of very few regional intergovernmental organisations to explicitly address climate-related security risks within its peace and security architecture.

But what does all this mean in practice? How can we prevent peaceful societies from being undermined by the impacts of climate change and resource scarcity?

The Horn of Africa is a region prone to violent conflicts. It is also a region in which large populations rely directly on natural resources and natural systems for their livelihoods: pasture and water for livestock, fertile and well-watered arable land, healthy fish stocks, or productive forests. As a result, “Whatever changes appear in the pattern of the natural resources we use affects us in a very significant way,” in the words of Eskedar Awgichew Ergete, director of the Environment and Natural Resources Law Centre at Ethiopia’s Mekelle University.

This can have implications for security. Nicholas Orago, a lecturer at the University of Nairobi, notes that: “What makes climate change a multiplier of conflict is that it impacts the natural resources people rely on for their livelihoods.” This can increase the risk of violent conflict in different but related ways. For example, competition over resources made scarcer by the impacts of climate change can exacerbate existing tensions in an area; so can the arrival of migrants displaced by flooding, drought or storms or violence.

Somalia has been a case in point in recent years. Pastoralists and farmers have clashed as traditional herding grounds have been ravaged by drought. Large numbers of people have left their land and taken refuge in camps and informal communities, where they have been prey to recruiters for the extremist insurgent group Al-Shabaab. These migrations have changed the demographics of some areas, undermining carefully negotiated power-sharing arrangements and efforts to build governance institutions, according to on-the-ground research.

Nicholas Orago and Eskedar Awgichew Ergete were members of a Horn of Africa Climate Security Working Group, that held a series of meetings between 2018 and 2020. This diverse group included civil society representatives and senior academic climate and security ex­perts from around the Horn of Africa to discuss how regional, continental and international efforts to bring peace could adapt to the new reality of climate change and its impacts on security.

Based on a wealth of direct experience and contextual knowledge, the Working Group was unanimous in calling for peace processes and agreements in the Horn of Africa to become more climate sensitive.

This implies a step change in how climate security issues are dealt with. For example, it means that civil society representatives and climate change specialists from the region should be more strongly involved in conflict prevention efforts and peace negotiations.

Somalia offers a positive case study. A number of steps that greatly reduced the human cost of drought in Somalia between 2017 and 18 included the creation of a joint Drought Operations Coordination Centre. The centre has now become a permanent institution, and a cross-sectoral Recovery and Resilience Framework helps the government build long-term resilience.

UN Assistance Mission in Somalia appointed its first dedicated climate and security adviser in June this year. And looking beyond Somalia, the AU’s new dedicated climate cluster, a platform that seeks to integrate climate security into the AU’s work, is another encouraging development.

Moreover, violent conflicts in the Horn of Africa often transcend national borders. Against this background, cooperation on climate security must be between as well as within countries, as well as coordinated with the relevant regional processes of the AU, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, and civil society. What is needed is a collective climate security framework for the region.

Finally, local communities affected by the double burden of conflict and climate change need to be given opportunities, time and resources to participate in peace processes. It is precisely at the level of those communities that climate-related insecurity takes root, making it vital to understand their experiences, their vulnerabilities, their knowledge and their solutions.

Together, these steps offer the best chance to ensure that conflict prevention, peace processes and agreements leave societies, both in and beyond the Horn of Africa, better able to cope with the impacts of future climate change.

After over two years of fighting and at-times intense clashes, a tentative resolution may be in sight for Myanmar’s high-profile civil war in Rakhine State.

On December 9, representatives of the Myanmar military and Arakan Army (AA) met in person to discuss the possibility of a bilateral ceasefire. Since November 2018, fighting in northern Rakhine State and neighboring Paletwa Township in Chin State has displaced over 236,000 people.

The area has now seen no clashes in over a month, after the AA called on the Myanmar military to allow elections in areas of Rakhine State where voting for the country’s recent general election had been canceled.

Myanmar’s general elections on November 8 saw Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) party retain power in a landslide victory. In much of Rakhine State, however, as well as parts of Shan, Kachin, Karen and Mon states and Bago Region, election authorities canceled voting, citing security reasons. The move effectively disenfranchised around 1.2 million people in Rakhine, or 73% of voters in the state, but it is not without precedent—many of the constituencies affected also saw voting canceled ahead of the country’s last election in 2015.

In a November 12 letter, the AA offered to cease hostilities and help coordinate the additional voting before December 31 and the Myanmar military and government welcomed the move.

“The situation can get worse if there is no space for politics and democracy,” said AA spokesperson Khaing Thuka. “To avoid fiercer clashes, dialogue is the best solution. Only political dialogue will solve political problems.”

The Myanmar military continues its conflicts with many ethnic armed groups elsewhere in the country and the dialogue with the AA—whether it succeeds or not—may offer important signals as to the military’s current stance on peace negotiations. As recently as December 7, two ethnic armed groups in Shan State—the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) and Restoration Council of Shan State (RCSS)—fought over territory in Namtu Township. The RCSS is a signatory of Myanmar’s 2015 Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement; the TNLA is not.

Tentative dialogue begins between AA and Myanmar military

The two sides then met virtually on November 25, when representatives discussed how to get food and medical supplies to civilians in conflict areas as well as the issue of holding elections.

Any polls will face the challenge of Myanmar’s ongoing “second wave” of COVID-19, as Rakhine State remains one of the hardest-hit areas in the country after Yangon. Efforts to contain the outbreak and support those affected have been severely hampered by the conflict in Rakhine, according to reports by the Arakan Humanitarian Coordination Committee.

Despite the possibility of a ceasefire, the Myanmar military has treated the AA conflict differently from other conflicts with ethnic armed groups in the country and this remains a barrier to peace negotiations. On December 1, the Myanmar military extended a unilateral ceasefire which has been in place for months. The ceasefire applies to all areas of the country except for Rakhine State and southern Chin State; the Myanmar government and military declared the AA to be a terrorist group in March and the military’s ceasefire excludes areas controlled by terrorist groups.

“Political conflicts are the cause of the fighting in Rakhine State,” Ann Thar Gyi, a resident of Minbya township who works with displaced people, told The Irrawaddy. “I want to see political issues solved at the table and not by military means.”

U Tun Aung Kyaw, a representative of the Arakan National Party’s Central Executive Committee, voiced support for the talks.

“The fact that the two sides have held talks on a ceasefire in consideration of public interests is good for Rakhine State,” U Tun Aung Kyaw told The Irrawaddy. “I hope they will be able to meet around a table and successfully solve the problems through political means.”

Talks begin over Rakhine conflict despite stalled peace process elsewhere

For supporters of Myanmar’s peace process, the emerging dialogue between the AA and the military may offer lessons on how to put a hold on hostilities in light of shared goals. The country’s beleaguered peace process has been a key focus of criticism of the NLD.

As independent Myanmar analyst David Scott Mathieson said recently, “The peace process has been one of the most glaring disasters of the NLD, failing to be all-inclusive of groups outside the now-discredited Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement…with international donors pitchforking lavish funding into a non-performing process.”

As in the past, third parties appear to be key to opening up new possibilities for dialogue. Japan’s special envoy to Myanmar, Yohei Sasakawa, is playing a role in the developing negotiations and has worked closely with military chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, who reportedly asked him for help. Ethnic leaders have also welcomed Japan’s involvement, according to recent reports. Notably, Japan has expressed support for Myanmar during the ongoing genocide proceedings at the International Court of Justice.

Though there have been no clashes between the AA and the military, a landmine blast in Maungdaw on November 17 killed three civilians and injured six. The military claimed that the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) was behind the explosion but the group denied involvement.

In August 2017, the Myanmar military responded to a series of ARSA attacks by launching genocidal “clearance operations” in Rakhine that pushed over 700,000 Rohingya into Bangladesh. Despite the bombing, Rakhine’s conflict areas now appear to be more stable than any time in the past two years.

As far as measures to support those impacted by the AA conflict, the Arakan Humanitarian Coordination Team has suggested cash transfers for displaced families as well as channeling financial support through local community organizations who can purchase supplies for those in need.","EditorialAfter over two years of fighting and at-times intense clashes, a tentative resolution may be in sight for Myanmar’s high-profile civil war in Rakhine State.

opinion

A month after Ethiopia launched a military operation against Tigray, a new face of war is emerging in the Horn of Africa. In the trenches of Tigray a new fighter is born, armed with an AK-47 or a rocket launcher, a twitter account and a Facebook page but evading sorties by lethal unmanned drones or stealth jets in increasingly ethnic but internationalised wars.

Scholars have termed the new fighter ""the devoted Actor"" who is willing to fight and die in intergroup conflict and where in-group bonds are more important than power, material or other incentives.

Tigray's ""devoted Actor"" is a product of failure by new African leaders to manage diversity.

Once at the helm of power, the Tigrayan fighter has returned to the battle field with grievances galore.

Ethiopia's second civil war, which started on November 4, reflects the new drift towards militarism and authoritarianism in the Horn.

The military is not only ethnicised, but its professionalism is replaced with loyalty. In a twitter message a few days into the war, Abiy reshuffled Ethiopia's army chief, head of intelligence and foreign minister.

Accusing Tigray's leaders of treason and issuing an arrest warrant against TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael, Addis Ababa closed all legitimate avenues for a negotiated a solution.

Dissident region

The regime now targets prominent Tigrayans, accusing World Health Organisation boss Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus- the highest-profile Tigrayan abroad - of lobbying in favour of the dissident region - a charge Dr Tedros denied.

Like pre-genocide Rwanda and Burundi in the 1990s, Ethiopia faces the tragedy of marginalising and waging war against a powerful minority, with the Tigrayans vowing they are ""ready to die"" and retreating into the mountains for a guerrilla war.

The war is drawing in rival regional forces and changing the nature and context of proxy wars raging in Yemen, Libya and the Middle East. Tigray politicians have claimed they are under attack ""on several fronts"".

Tigray has accused Eritrea of sending 16 divisions of its 200,000-strong military into Tigray.

The TPLF has been keen on internationalising the war. Gebremichael confirmed Tigray fired at least three rockets at Eritrea's capital, Asmara.

Eritrea has insisted it is ""not part of the conflict"". And Abiy, in yet another tweet, said Ethiopia can realise the ""objectives of the operation by itself"".

In Somalia, the Tigray war is complicating the fight against al-Shabaab. The sacking of African Union security chief Gebreegziabher Mebratu Melese following a request from Ethiopia has undermined its counter-terrorism operation.

At least 200 Tigrayan troops in Ethiopia's AMISOM peacekeeping force have been disarmed. Ethiopia has also reportedly redeployed more than 3,000 troops previously involved in combating al-Shabaab. With this, Sector 3 of AMISOM including Gedo, Bay & Bakool regions is now at risk.

Security vacuum

Kenya is watching closely, as a security vacuum could give al-Shabaab room to attack.

The Tigray war has also emboldened and inspired Somalia's populist President Mohamed Farmaajo to ponder launching a similar military operation against rival federal states, particularly Jubaland and Ahmed Madobe.

Facing elections in a few months, Farmajo is riding on the authoritarian wave and the air of belligerence fostered by the war to retain power by hook or crook.

Having won in 2017 by demonising Ethiopia, Farmaajo is hedging his bets on whipping up Somali emotions against Kenya to a fever-pitch ahead of 2022.

Claiming Kenya is interfering with the upcoming election, Farmaajo recalled Somalia's Ambassador to Kenya and instructed Kenya's Ambassador to Somalia ""to depart to Kenya for consultation"". He expects Kenya to respond by taking draconian measures against Somalis.

He also hopes to whip up public emotions against the presence of nearly 4,000 Kenyan troops in Amisom, leading to their exit from Sector 6 (Kismayu and parts of Jubaland) and their replacement by the friendlier Eritrean forces. Then he can commence a military operation against Jubaland, along the lines of Ethiopia's war against Tigray, and use this to post-pone elections and extend his rule indefinitely.

Eritrea's alleged involvement is likely to draw in Sudan, which is already hosting more than 45,000 people displaced by the war. In the face of the dispute over the Grand Millennium Dam that Ethiopia is building on the Blue Nile, Sudan and Egypt have strengthened their ties. On November 14, Egypt and Sudan launched a joint military exercise.

Sudanese prime minister Abdullah Hamdok offered mediation as the chair of IGAD. Uganda's president Yoweri Museveni, another IGAD leader, also offered to mediate. But Abiy has insisted that this is an internal issue.

But ties with Ethiopia could get complicated. And it is doubtful Sudan will manage to cut off any supply lines to the TPLF through its border, which is ""awash with contraband weapons smuggling"". Cairo is poised to support Khartoum in resisting pressure from Ethiopia.

In a tweet, the TPLF spokesman Getachew Reda, Tigray accused Ethiopia of deploying drones from a military base in Assab Eritrea belonging to the United Arab Emirates. Since 2017, UAE has been launching drone operations in Libya and Yemen against the Houthis.

The UN estimates nine million people are at high risk of being displaced by the fighting.","opinionA month after Ethiopia launched a military operation against Tigray, a new face of war is emerging in the Horn of Africa.

That we would want to revert our dear country to anarchy and vandalism after 14 years of violent killings and destruction just to satisfy a political party or candidate is sad.

A CANDIDATE LOSING an election should always know there are more opportunities ahead, and such experience from a poll just signals a need to return to the drawing board and re-strategize for future election. Current President George Manneh Weah is a glaring example of the benefit of exercising patience and self-control, for when God's-appointed time comes, you will have it all without much sweat.
