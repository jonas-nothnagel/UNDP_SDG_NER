The number of people unemployed around the world stands at some 188 million. In addition, 165 million people don’t have enough paid work, and 120 million have either given up actively searching for work or otherwise lack access to the labour market.

“For millions of ordinary people, it’s increasingly diﬃcult to build better lives through work”, said ILO Director-General Guy Ryder. “Persisting and substantial work-related inequalities and exclusion are preventing them from ﬁnding decent work and better futures. That’s an extremely serious ﬁnding that has profound and worrying implications for social cohesion.”

Earlier in January, a UN report on the economy showed that developed countries are experiencing slow growth, and some African countries are stagnating. The consequence is that not enough new jobs are being created to absorb the growing labour force as it enters the market. In addition, many African countries are experiencing a drop in real incomes and a rise in poverty.

BREAKING: We've just released our annual flagship report, which explains why it's becoming increasingly difficult for people to build better lives through their work.

Eradicating poverty is an important element of the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development but, according to the ILO study, moderate or extreme working poverty – deﬁned as earning less than the equivalent of $3.20 per day – is expected to edge up in 2020-21 in developing countries.

Inequalities related to gender, age and geographical location continue to plague the job market, with the report showing that these factors limit both individual opportunity and economic growth.

Some 267 million young people aged 15-24 are not in employment, education or training, and many more endure substandard working condition.

The rise in trade restrictions and protectionism, which could have a significant impact on employment, is seen as a potentially worrying trend, as is the significant drop in the share of national income in the form of wages, compared to other forms of production.

The report’s authors recommend that countries ensure that economic growth and development occurs in a way that leads to the reduction of poverty and better working conditions in low-income countries, through structural transformation, technological upgrading and diversiﬁcation.","In addition, 165 million people don’t have enough paid work, and 120 million have either given up actively searching for work or otherwise lack access to the labour market.

And National Union of Aviation and Allied Workers (NUAAW) president Happy Phiri says without workers’ education on labour matters there can be confrontations at work places.

Addressing newly elected Bushtracks NUAAW branch officials during an induction workshop under the theme: ‘Empowering knowledge to branch officials’ at Lilamono lodge, Mwanza said decent work entails workers must be in secure and fairly paid employment.

“The theme underscores the reality facing the workers as they strive to secure decent working conditions. Only decent work can promote sustained and inclusive economic growth. Your members need decent salaries, full employment, social protection and rights at work,” Mwanza said.

She added that she was aware of the challenges facing employees that NUAAW represents such as prolonged periods for negotiations, low wages, threats of dismissal, delayed remittance of pension contributions and casualisation.

Mwanza, who is also the district labour officer, said union leaders were key to promoting dialogue and enhanced improved working conditions for members.

And Phiri said NUAAW has introduced a pension scheme with Madison Insurance to benefit its workers upon retirement.

He also revealed that NUAAW had created a cooperative that would help support members with small loans.

Phiri said it was sad that some employers were denying their workers the right to belong to a union of their choice.

“This leads to frustrations among workers as well as low productivity at the place of work. Enough is enough, one day workers will be freed,” said Phiri.

Bushtracks NUAAW branch chairman Francis Chileka said his union, which affiliated to the national aviation labour movement last September would strive to do the best in labour matters despite being new.

“We may face challenges but with the help of the national leadership we will do the best,” said Chileka.","ONLY decent work can promote sustained and inclusive economic growth, says Livingstone acting district administrative officer Hellen Mwanza.

Opinion: For Reagan, an improved economy meant morning in America. For Trump, it's thunderstorms everywhere, all the time.

The 2020 election will be ugly, unpleasant and, if you pay too much attention, torturous. (Photo: AP)

I dread the upcoming electoral season. It is sure to be a monumentally dispiriting enterprise.

And there will be no escaping it in Arizona. We are a battleground state for the presidency and the U.S. Senate. Three of our congressional districts will be targeted, to at least some extent, by one party or the other. We will be inundated with the worst the country’s politics has to offer.

Elections should be, at least in some measure, a celebration of self-governance. There, however, is unlikely to be anything edifying or uplifting in this one. It will be ugly, unpleasant and, if you pay too much attention, torturous. And I have a professional obligation to pay too much attention.

What strikes me is how disconnected the nature of our politics is to the actual conditions of the country and state, which are relatively good.

Trump has a decent economic record

There’s a contradiction in the position of Democrats regarding the economy.

On the one hand, they say that the good numbers in economic growth and jobs are a continuing dividend of the policies of the Obama administration, not to be credited to the presidency of Donald Trump. On the other hand, they say the economy stinks, is rigged, and is leaving average Americans behind.

In reality, there’s an observable uptick in economic performance since the Trump policies of corporate tax cuts and deregulation have been implemented. The most notable is much improved wage growth for those without a college degree. Trump’s policies have increased the demand for labor across the board.

Despite the caterwauling from the Democratic presidential aspirants, the results demonstrate that markets, given the appropriate political economy, still work, including the labor market.

Things are going well in metro Phoenix

Gov. Doug Ducey has been in the practice of issuing year-end reviews, sort of an annual report. I suppose it’s Ducey in his CEO motif.

The annual reports always say that things are going swimmingly for the state, and Ducey’s policies deserve much of the credit. His PR apparatus floods social media with digestible nuggets.

This is obviously self-serving. It can be irritating and produce a cynical response. I may have succumbed to that in the past.

But, in reality, things are going well in the state, particularly in the Phoenix metro area. We have regained our position prior to the housing bubble and bust as one of the country’s most dynamic and successful regional economies.

The extent to which Ducey’s policies are responsible is less clear. He has turned out to be a tinkerer rather than a reformer. But he has tinkered adroitly, both substantively and politically.

State government is in far better shape than when he was first elected. And his pro-business attitude and engagement do make a contribution to our economy regaining its dynamism.

At a minimum, Ducey hasn’t screwed things up. And with respect to political economy, having politicians who don’t screw things up is a considerable asset.

But to Trump, it's all mess and venom

So, if things are generally going well, why are our politics so dour and dispiriting?

The answer is clearly Donald Trump.

Trump is a one-trick pony when it comes to campaigning: attack your opponent in as personal of terms as possible. All the time, with no bottom to be reached. He is incapable of making a policy argument.

Now, American politics were nasty and personal before Trump. But Trump takes it to new extremes. And he’s an accelerant, increasing the venom from others, friend and foe.

There’s this paradox: Any other Republican running on Trump’s record would undoubtedly win in a walk. The Democrats would be in the process of repeating the McGovern debacle of 1972. Trump is the only Republican they have a reasonable chance of beating.

Why is the GOP imitating his politics?

This is what makes Trump’s hold on the Republican Party so hard to understand. He’s an incredibly weak candidate. In 2016, he ran behind other Republicans in state after state, including Arizona.

In 2016, John McCain’s vote exceeded that of Trump by more than 100,000. Trump carried the state by just 3.5 percentage points. Four years earlier, Mitt Romney carried Arizona over a much tougher opponent, an incumbent president, by 9 percentage points.

In such circumstances, the logical thing for other Republican officeholders to do would be to support Trump’s policies where they are well directed, but let Trump stew in his own juices regarding the way he practices politics. Instead, they have become loyalists and imitators.

A Republican running for re-election on Trump’s record should be about to reprise Ronald Reagan’s “It’s morning in America” campaign of 1984.

Instead, with Trump, it’s thunderstorms everywhere, all the time.

In fact, the company’s strategy of selling products at heavily discounted prices has helped it remain on the growth trajectory. Additionally, a differentiated product range enables the company to provide an upscale shopping experience for members.



Moreover, sturdy labor market, steady wage gains and improved consumer sentiment are other catalysts. Cumulatively, these factors have been aiding the company’s top line performance, in spite of operating in a fast-changing retail landscape.



We note that Costco registered an increase 5.6% in total revenues during the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Looking ahead, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter and fiscal 2020 indicates year-over-year growth of 8.1% and 6.6%, respectively. Certainly, decent comps run remain one of the key factors behind incremental sales.



The operator of membership warehouses had witnessed comps growth of 9% during the month of December. This follows an increase of 5.3% in November, 5.7% in October and 4.2% in September. Meanwhile, net sales improved 10.5% to $17.04 billion in the December month, following a rise of 6.7%, 6.8% and 5.6% in November, October and September, respectively.





Few Other Aspects



With the wave of digital transformation hitting the retail sector, Costco is rapidly adopting the omni-channel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience, whether online or in-stores. It is steadily expanding e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan and Japan. E-commerce comparable sales surged 43.1% in the month of December. In the last reported quarter, the company’s e-commerce comparable sales had risen 5.5% year over year.



We believe that Costco’s business model and commitment toward opening membership warehouses will continue to drive traffic. The company also remains focused on ramping up investments in the wake of rising competition from the likes of Dollar Tree DLTR, Dollar General DG and Target TGT.



It’s no wonder that Costco has been able to create a niche for itself in the industry. Notably, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has surged 42.7% in a year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 36.3%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.



Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a Generation



Be among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity. Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices. In the process, it’s expected to create 22 million jobs and generate $12.3 trillion in activity.



A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech. Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft in the 1990s. Zacks’ just-released special report reveals 8 stocks to watch. The report is only available for a limited time.

4,https://www.thestar.com.my/opinion/letters/2020/01/09/right-of-workers-to-decent-working-hours,"Thu, 09 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",The Star Online,Right of workers to decent working hours,"THE Malaysian Employment Act 1955 defines a work week as 48 hours, with a maximum of eight hours per day and six working days a week. It also provides for 10 days of paid holidays.

A worker’s rest day should be respected, so if he or she is requested to work on that day, the law stipulates that the individual needs to be compensated with a wage payment at the rate of 2.5 times the normal sum.

Ten days of holiday a year (“10 Gazetted Public Holidays”) is provided for all employees. A break of 30 minutes should be provided by employers for each five hours in excess of eight hours of work.

The exception to the eight-hour day is when the specific project or work needs to progress continuously over two shifts.

These rules are expected to apply to all government, commercial and industrial and other professions. The employer who violates or contravenes any provisions of this law has committed an offence and would be held accountable by the director-general of Labour.

All employees need to review their conditions of employment to ascertain that indeed these guidelines are outlined in their contracts. It is imperative under the terms of international labour laws set by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the United Nations labour laws and Malaysian labour laws that these provisions be upheld by employers irrespective of their status.

These labour laws and working conditions and hours need to be upheld by all employers, including international companies or corporations operating in Peninsular Malaysia.

Conventions set by ILO are legally binding international treaties that may be ratified by member states. Recommendations are non-binding guidelines.

In many cases, a convention lays down the basic principles to be implemented by ratifying countries while a related recommendation supplements the convention by providing more details.

International labour standards refer to conventions agreed upon by international actors, resulting from a series of value judgments “set forth to protect basic worker rights, enhance workers’ job security, and improve their terms of employment on a global scale”.

The intent of such standards is to establish a worldwide minimum level of protection from inhumane labour practices through the adoption and implementation of the said measures.

From a theoretical standpoint, it has been maintained, on ethical grounds, that there are certain basic human rights that are universal to humankind.

Thus, it is the aim of international labour standards to ensure the provision of such rights in the workplace, such as against workplace aggression, bullying, discrimination and gender inequality.

Talking to various Malaysian employees, their families and friends, I have come to realise that some local employers disregard and blatantly ignore the above guidelines and terms of their employment.

They pay no attention to the Employment Act 1955 and its approved amendments made by Parliament.

The long hours and adverse conditions enforced on Malaysian employees, if allowed to continue, could result in a terrible health toll on them and their families.

The adverse conditions under which employees work should not be ignored by the director-general of Labour and the Human Resources Ministry.

Long working hours enforced by employers and the related stress can lead to increased incidence of depression and hypertension, which can subsequently lead to cardiovascular damage and stroke. This state of affairs would lead to loss of morale and less efficiency in the workplace.

The negative impacts on family life and health of Malaysian employees cannot continue. They should and must be corrected by stricter enforcement of the law by the director-general of Labour.

International corporations must also comply with the Malaysian Employment Act, including the provision on working hours.

Any international corporation that fails to follow the provisions of the Malaysian Employment Act must be cited and reported to the relevant authorities in their home country, for example the State Department in the case of the United States, for further action.

The long hours and working conditions of Malaysian workers need to be examined critically to determine a solution.

5,https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/business-report/why-can-t-jamaica-have-decent-growth-_186494,"Fri, 07 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",Jamaica Observer,Why can't Jamaica have decent growth?,"The last time Jamaica saw any decent level of growth was in the 1960s. During that period we saw growth as high as 12 per cent, and the average for that decade was in fact around six to seven per cent. Since then we had about three to four years of growth averaging around six per cent in the 1980s, but even though the growth rates were decent during the 1980s, it was not sustainable.

I say it wasn't sustainable during the 1908s because debt to gross domestic product (GDP) also reached a record 212 per cent, which implied that growth was being driven by the high levels of debt.

Don't get me wrong though, as I think that the debt was necessary to take us out of the significant decline of the 1970s, where the economy declined a whopping 20 per cent approximately.

Coming out of the 1980s, we never capitalised on the debt momentum, which started in the 1980s, and in addition to not setting the environment for growth we also continued the high levels of borrowing, which eventually led to our financial crisis in the 1990s (FINSAC).

Even with the high levels of debt in the 1990s we were lucky to achieve three per cent in any one year.

Fast forward to today, and even after the sacrifices made by Jamaicans, we are still not able to achieve more than one per cent growth in any year. This is even after the reduction in the debt to GDP to under 100 per cent (with the programme across administrations) and the boom in construction in recent years.

Again, I think that both the economic programme, started by Phillips, and the construction boom, under Holness, were necessary to get us to where we are today. And we are certainly in a far better position than we were in 2013.

The question though is why have we been unable to achieve any sustainable respectable levels of growth since the end of 1971/2, which was some 48 years ago?

Think about the implications if you for 48 years you are making less progress than others around you. You would end up, as Jamaica did, in a much worse position than you were relatively 48 years before.

I was speaking to a leading figure in the financial industry recently, and he asked me the question, what is the use of having the high levels of foreign exchange reserves if we are unable to bring some stability to the currency markets. And despite what the authorities want to say, the instability in the FX market matters to business people, as was demonstrated in the explanation for the third consecutive quarter of decline in the business index.

My answer to him was simple, if you look at the economic advancements made in this country it has not come as a result of the fiscal policies we have implemented over the past 48 years. Growth has come as a result of sacrifices made by Jamaicans (such as more taxes), debt (high debt to GDP levels), foreign aid, and sacrifices made by the business community.

In particular the financial industry in 2010 and 2013 gave up hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars, to bail out the Government and country through the two debt exchanges. Let us not fool ourselves, if that sacrifice was not made (because they could have said no and walked away like institutions in other countries) the country would have been in serious trouble as a debt default was imminent.

So as I said to my friend, when you think about it, we have not, since the 1960s seen any real sustainable and respectable GDP growth. As I said the 1980s growth was based on increasing debt levels, as necessary as it was.

So why have we not been able to achieve any sustainable growth levels without the aid of the crutches mentioned above?

The fact is that we have made very poor fiscal policy decisions. We should all remember that growth is achieved when there is value added, and the truth is that we have not really had much value added in Jamaica.

Sure we see tourism numbers increasing every year, but we negate it with high levels of food imports. Sure we see booming construction in the economy, but most of the inputs are imported. And the list goes on and on, as we always seem to have an equal or greater negative value to every added value we create — when growth is nothing more than an increase in value added over the corresponding prior period.

So in our case, growth would be the additional value created in the economy from labour productivity or other forms of local input, above the value of the imported inputs.

The problem we have is that even while our production is increasing and more employment is created, we are importing most of the inputs to produce, or sustain the growth, when high levels of real growth will only come when the rate of increase of the local inputs far exceed the rate of increase of the imported inputs.

As well intentioned as those in authority are, the fact is that our policy framework and our production rules are not structured for us to achieve that sustainable growth.

The only way to change the effect positively, is to change the environment in which we operate. But to change the environment requires bold decisions to go against the political trend.

For example, there is one primary thing that can be done to give us much greater value added while also significantly reducing our FX inputs, but I don't know if we will ever see the political will to address it. — all we need to do is provide a very efficient and secure transportation system.

This is not difficult to do but it means getting beyond the political order of providing jobs, taking strong action against indisciplined driving, and changing our mindset about funding for a proper transportation system. If this is done it will enhance productivity (less traffic), reduce our energy bill significantly (less cars on the road), reduce our FX requirements as a result (less need to import cars), and as a result leave more income in the hands of Jamaicans and increase living standards.

Will we ever make the right fiscal decisions in defiance of preferred political ones? I don't know, but what I do know is that if we don't then we will continue to only chug along.

In the midst of a global economic collapse it may not be the best idea to shell out $20 to rent a movie that was supposed to be in theaters, but that’s the current state of the world, and what I did yesterday to watch The Hunt, a movie which has had its theatrical released canceled twice over now before finally giving up and going on demand.

The Hunt was pulled from theaters the first time many months ago in the wake of mass shootings in Dayton and El Paso, as its subject matter about humans being hunted from sport seemed in bad taste. It may still be in bad taste, yet this time it was an unprecedented global pandemic that closed down all theaters and shelved its re-release date. So onto streaming services it went.

The literal plot of the film is that rich liberals get together and hunt “deplorable” conservatives for sport in the woods. So, on the surface, you may think that it’s a kind of conservative answer to the somehow more subtle The Purge, where rich and/or unhinged mainly exterminate the poor for a similar reason.

And yet I’m not even sure that’s what’s happening here, and getting through the film feels less like it’s going after liberals and more like it’s attacking the entire concept of horror movies as political satire in general.

The Hunt Universal

It’s both sides that are stereotyped to a truly absurd degree. Yes, the liberals are the “bad guys,” and they literally sit around calling each other “comrade” and screaming things like “climate change is real!” as they murder people. It’s a parody of a parody. But similarly, the right-wingers being hunted fit into their own stereotypes, like the FOX News-watching veteran or the conspiracy theorist podcaster ranting about “globalist cucks.”

The only somewhat “normal” character in the film is what, after several false starts and executions, turns out to be Betty Gilpin’s Crystal, a military vet who ends up giving the film a You’re Next vibe when the hunted becomes the hunter.

The political stuff, whether it’s actually trying to mock liberals, conservatives, or both, is massively stupid and doesn’t work at all. And yet The Hunt kind of works as a halfway decent action film, particularly once Crystal gets rolling.

I actually appreciate both how The Hunt assembled a pretty solid cast of known faces (Emma Roberts, Justin Hartley, Ike Barinholtz) and is content with killing them off extremely quickly in ways that are both gory and genuinely unexpected, as you figure you’re watching who is supposed to be the lead of the film right up until the moment a sniper round blows through them or they step on a land mine.

Once we finally do land on our lead, however, the film gets better, as watching Crystal disassemble a bunker full of hunters and their national guard training instructor is pretty fantastic (minus the dumb political one-liners throughout), as is her final dual with Hillary Swank which is as brutal as anything you might see in a John Wick film. I have been a fan of Gilpin since I saw her in Netflix’s GLOW, and she’s the standout of the film for her mercifully understated performance and her capacity for action heroine violence.

The Hunt Netflix

I do believe that horror movies can pull off effective political commentary. I just watched The Platform on Netflix, which does just that, and while I think most of the Purge movies are pretty ham-handed with their metaphors, The First Purge, which directly takes on racial violence, does it very well.

This is not what The Hunt gets right. I’m not saying that because I don’t agree with its politics. I genuinely don’t think that it really even has politics, and it’s more making fun of anyone who would take it to be a serious examination of one side or the other. But that portion of the film is cringey and bad and sadly offsets some pretty decent action throughout the rest of it.

Would I recommend it? Yeah, maybe, if you’re a curious horror fan like I was. But not for a $20 rental. Wait until that comes down, which I imagine will happen soon enough here.

Follow me on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Pick up my new sci-fi novel Herokiller, and read my first series, The Earthborn Trilogy, which is also on audiobook.","The literal plot of the film is that rich liberals get together and hunt “deplorable” conservatives for sport in the woods.

Government is currently prioritising the containment of the corona virus and working towards attaining normal status post COVID-19, Minister of Employment, Labour Productivity & Skills Development, Mr Mpho Balopi has said.

Speaking during a media briefing on COVID-19 state of public emergency in Gaborone on Sunday, he said in the world of work, including the ease of doing business and facilitating sustainable long-term economic development, the Labour Sector Tripartite was currently working through an instrument called the Botswana Decent Work Country Programme (BDWCP).

Its objective, he said, was to recognise the importance of people generally as well as labour and employment issues as key components of growth and development anywhere and in any nation.

He said the decent work programme entailed a contract, which had been entered into and signed by the Botswana Government, Botswana Trade Union Federations (BFTU and BOFEPUSU), Business (represented by Business Botswana), as well as the International Labour Organisation.

He said the current programme, which was signed and consented to, by all four parties mentioned above took effect from February 18, 2020 and would run until 2024.

While the impact was concentrated in the second fortnight of March 2020, analysts expect cement volumes for the sector in Q4FY20 to fall by around 10 percent YoY.

The disruption has come at a time of seasonally peak demand period for cement causing higher volume loss and resulting in an estimated overall 10-12 percent volume decline for the industry, according to brokerage Motilal Oswal.

Despite a dip in volumes, analysts are of the view that the cement companies would show decent earnings performance during the March quarter led by high cement prices and low fuel cost.

All-India average cement prices stood firm, rising 4 percent QoQ and 3 percent YoY led by high prices in the north and central India regions. Cost tailwinds continued during the quarter as domestic petcoke prices declined 15 percent YoY to Rs 7,597/tonne. The cost of imported coal and fuel prices also remained benign during the quarter.

In 4QFY20, analysts at Motilal Oswal expect aggregate EBITDA for cement companies under to rise 10 percent YoY and 24 percent QoQ, driven by 5 percent YoY and 3.5 percent QoQ improvement in realization.

“This should result in 23 percent YoY/QoQ improvement in EBITDA per tonne to Rs 1,113/tonne. Aggregate net profit should also rise 2 percent YoY/34 percent QoQ despite an expected 12 percent YoY volume decline due to plant shutdowns from March 23 owing to the COVID-19 outbreak,” the brokerage said in a report.

Among cement companies, Edelweiss Securities estimates UltraTech Cement’s blended realisations to rise 3.5 percent and EBITDA to grow 41 percent, QoQ. Blended EBITDA/tonne is expected to rise 24 percent YoY to Rs 1,231 (up 30 percent QoQ).

Ambuja Cement’s realisations are likely to rise 3.5 percent QoQ given its minimal presence in the troubled South region. With benefits of falling fuel cost, estimate EBITDA to surge 32 percent YoY. EBITDA/tonne at Rs 1,045 is expected to rise 44 percent YoY (25 percent QoQ), according to the brokerage.

ACC is expected to clock over 4 percent on quarter rise in core profit and realisations are expected to hold up firm, rising 3.5 percent QoQ. With some cost benefit expected from falling fuel prices, estimate EBITDA to dip marginally by 1 percent YoY. EBITDA/ton at Rs 770 is estimated to rise 9 percent YoY (up 11 percent QoQ).

Going ahead, Edelweiss Securities expects the outlook for the next 12 months remains challenging amid the 21-day lockdown in India to contain the outbreak of COVID-19.

“In our assessment, this would severely affect demand in H1FY21, and that the recovery would follow H2FY21 onwards. While we estimate FY21 earnings to see significant downward revision, we are hopeful that FY22 will be a normalized year, implying a sharp earnings recovery,” the brokerage said.","Despite a dip in volumes, analysts are of the view that the cement companies would show decent earnings performance during the March quarter led by high cement prices and low fuel cost.

However, it is disheartening that today we commemorate this day at a solemn moment in the history of our country and indeed the world. As you all know, millions of people around the world have been infected by the coronavirus, or COVID-19 while billions of lives have been adversely affected by this pandemic. Its impact on the global economy has been severe as we also witness markets plunging to historic low levels.

We commemorate this day, when millions of workers around the world including in Botswana are at home because of the restrictions that have been imposed on them in efforts to curb the spread and transmission of the COVID-19 virus. It is a time when many are unsure of what the future holds for them regarding their jobs or the future of their companies.

Traditionally, the commemoration of this day is marked by celebrations locally and globally. However, it has not been possible to do this year because of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Betsho, I would like to assure you that as Government we are committed to the welfare of workers in this country as evidenced by the robust measures that have been put in place to cushion workers and companies during the on-going national lockdown. This strategy will ensure that workers do not lose their jobs and companies do not collapse during this crisis. Similarly, Government is working on an Economic Stimulus Package that will be implemented post the COVID-19 virus.

Fellow Citizens, allow me to take this opportunity to express my profound gratitude to all workers across Botswana for the significant contribution that they continue to make towards the socio-economic development of this country. Their commitment and dedication to work truly demonstrates clear patriotism towards their country.

Bagaetsho, let me remind you that Labour Day, is not just an ordinary day. It is one of the oldest and most celebrated worker's holidays across the globe and it symbolises the emancipation of workers from poor and inhumane working conditions. This is a Day that provides a platform for all of us to take stock in earnest, of the progress that we have made in our endeavours to improve the working conditions of our people, while at the same time, reflecting on our shortcomings.

To this end, I wish to underscore that, improving the working conditions of workers is not an end in itself, but rather, it is a process that requires the concerted efforts of all strategic stakeholders. We can only make meaningful progress for this country and our people when we are united, because as it has been said before, 'The ties that bind us are stronger than the ties which divide us'.

I wish to remind you that the working conditions of employees are of paramount importance as they border on social justice and socio-economic progress for all, and can determine the political and economic stability of any country. It is therefore important for us to create decent working conditions and decent jobs. We also have to ensure security in the work place and provide social protection for families.

As a show of commitment to improving working conditions, Government, the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Botswana Federation of Trade Unions (BFTU), Business Botswana (BB) and the Botswana Federation of Public Sectors Union (BOFEPUSU) signed the second generation Botswana Decent Work Country Programme (BDWCP) 2020-2024 in February this year of our Lord 2020.

The BDWCP is a consensus tool that, among others, aims to promote workers' rights, productive and decent employment opportunities, as well as enhance social protection and strengthen social dialogue in our country.

The adoption of BDWCP is a demonstration of our resolve as Government to place decent work as one of the cornerstones of our national development strategies. I have no doubt that with the support of all stakeholders, we will effectively and efficiently implement the BDWCP for the benefit of our workers.

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, or the SDGs particularly Goal 8, puts decent work at the centre of economic development. In that regard, it is a requirement for every society to create working conditions that provide quality and sustainable jobs that will enhance the economic growth of our countries. The Government of Botswana is committed to this Goal.

In conclusion, as we continue to fight COVID-19, I urge you to remember to maintain social distancing, continue washing your hands with clean water and soap. I also urge you to continue staying at home during the national lockdown to protect yourselves and your country.

We are optimistic that we shall win the battle against COVID 19. Our factory machines shall grind again, our productive forces shall once again get back to work and contribute meaningfully towards the rebuilding of our economy. When that time comes I urge our labour force to give everything their all and ensure that we rise again.

“We’re just having a bit of an earthquake here Ryan, quite a decent shake here,” she said, looking up and around the room. “But, um, if you see things moving behind me.”

New Zealand sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is sometimes called the Shaky Isles for its frequent quakes.

Monday’s magnitude 5.6 quake struck in the ocean about 100 kilometers (62 miles) northeast of Wellington, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

The quake hit just before 8 a.m. and was felt by thousands of New Zealanders who were getting ready to start their work weeks. It was strong enough to rattle food from shelves and stop train services.

But there were no reports of major damage or injuries.

Ardern continued on with her interview, telling the host the shaking had stopped.

“We’re fine Ryan,” she said. “I’m not under any hanging lights, I look like I’m in a structurally sound place.”

Ardern, who has been leading the country’s health and economic response to the coronavirus pandemic, said later that the thought going through her head when the quake struck was: “Are you serious?”

It closed at Rs 366.6, down 1.3 percent over its previous close after hitting a high of Rs 386.40 intraday.

Quarterly revenues rose 31 percent year-on-year to Rs 1140 crore, operating profit grew 17 percent to Rs 2169 crore, operating margins slipped to 202 basis points to 19.5 percent, and profit after tax surged 145 percent to Rs 617 crore.

The company completed its acquisition of US-based Arysta LifeScience in February 2019 and hence the March quarter numbers are not comparable with those of the same period during the previous year.

After adjusting for the acquisition, quarterly revenues grew by 26 percent, driven by a 29 percent growth in volumes. EBITDA grew 25 percent, margins came in at 19.5 percent and PAT declined by 18 percent. The PAT for the fourth quarter of the previous year had been inflated by a tax reversal.

The company reported strong growth across geographies, Latin America region grew by 27 percent, India grew by 36 percent, North America grew by 45 percent, and the rest of the regions, by 33 percent.

Revenue growth at 13 percent vs expectations of 8-10 percent

Net debt reduced by Rs 4400 crore vs expectations of Rs 3150-3500 crore

FY20 cost synergies at Rs 770 crore was also ahead of target

“However, if we treat perpetual bonds as debt, then the net debt has reduced by only Rs 1200 crore in FY20 to around Rs 25000 crore,” says a report by broking firm Motilal Oswal.

“And hence net debt (including perpetual bonds) to EBITDA would still stand at 3.4X in FY20 (vs accounted net debt to EBITDA at 2.9X). And this would mean that this is likely to reduce to 2.7X in FY21,” the note added.

Another cause of concern for UPL investors is rupee depreciation. UPL in its release last month had said that its net debt stood at $2.9 billion at the end of FY20, compared to $3.8 billion in FY19. The rupee was 69 to the dollar at the end of FY19 and was 76 to the dollar at the end of FY20. So the effective reduction in debt in rupee terms would be lower. UPL has 44 percent of its debt in US dollars, 40 percent in euros, 10 percent in yen, 3 percent in rupees, 2 percent in real, and 1 percent in other currency.","Shares of crop protection major UPL drifted lower despite the company reporting a decent set of the fourth quarter and full-year numbers on Friday.

As we expected, global smartphone sales plummeted during the first quarter of 2020. Data from research firms Canalys and Counterpoint Research show global shipments fell 13% compared to the same period in 2019.

The crash is not unexpected as the COVID-19 pandemic has affected global supply chains for everything from cheese to chipsets. The biggest decline came from China, where Counterpoint says smartphone shipments dropped 27% compared to a year ago.

China holds an enviable position in the world’s smartphone supply chain, so when the pandemic struck in December it was expected that it would drag the entire industry into a difficult spot. Even companies like Samsung that have their manufacturing bases in Vietnam and South Korea still got hit because they need crucial supplies from Chinese factories. The Korean company endured a 17% drop in smartphone sales.

However, while other phone brands suffered major declines, by up to 40% for some, Transsion’s Tecno emerged almost unscathed.

Transsion’s Tecno Sold 4.6m Smartphones in Q1

Tecno sold 4.6 million smartphones in Q1 2020, data from Counterpoint shows. That’s a 2.13% decline compared to Q1 2019 where it sold 4.7 million devices; a relatively decent result.

Counterpoint data shows Tecno sold 4.6 million phones in Q1 2020.

One explanation for this is Transsion’s major market: Africa.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, Tecno smartphones accounted for 20% of all the sales in Africa. Together with other Transsion brands (Infinix and Itel, Tecno) control 52.5% of the continent’s phone market.

Unlike other regions, Africa recorded its first COVID-19 case late in Q1. However, due to slow testing, reported cases did not immediately escalate. African governments didn’t fully implement lockdown measures until late March and April.

So Transsion retailed its devices normally and supplies from its factories in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Ethiopia continued until the end of the quarter.

Q2 may be tough for all smartphone companies

However, analysts expect that Q2 would witness the peak of the impact of the pandemic and most companies could see a significant drop in sales.

“Most smartphone companies expect Q2 to represent the peak of the coronavirus’ impact,” says Ben Stanton, Senior Analyst at Canalys. “It will test the mettle of the industry, and some companies, especially offline retailers, will fail without government support,” he said.

The Q2 decline is certain since, in April, a number of countries implemented lockdown that further disrupted global supply chains.

Transsion operates factories in five countries: China, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Ethiopia. But three of these countries implemented lockdowns between March and April.

Its Indian factory was grounded for 40 days. Some reports say the country’s smartphone industry recorded zero sales in April as government restrictions permitted eCommerce companies to deliver only essential products. Smartphones and electronics were deemed non-essentials.

Bangladesh, where Transsion is the fifth biggest phone company, was on lockdown for three weeks. The company produces 450,000 devices in Bangladesh, and 90,000 of them are smartphones. But in late March, ahead of the lockdown production levels was expected to drop by 40%, said Rezwanul Haque, CEO of Transsion Bangladesh.

“We’re failing to launch new products due to the shortage of raw materials… This situation will worsen if the crisis prolongs,” Haque said in March.

Meanwhile, Pakistan started its lockdown on March 23 and will ease restrictions by May 9. This has slowed down activities in Transsion’s Karachi plant which reportedly has the capacity to produce three million smartphones a year.

The Chinese phone company has hinted at the possibility of a decline in sales. In its full 2019 financial report released in April, Transsion said the pandemic “has adversely affected the economic operations of many countries and regions around the world.”

“If the epidemic is not effectively contained and will spread further around the world, the company’s overseas operations will be affected to a certain extent, which may cause annual results negative effects.”

Transsion’s path to a good Q2

However, the challenge for Transsion is two-part. It has to reactivate factories quickly and it has to contend with falling demand in its biggest African markets like Nigeria.

Its factories in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh may be reopened in May as governments in these countries ease lockdown restrictions. Bangladesh’s crucial garment factories reopened last week.

Operations in Transsion’s Ethiopian factory may still be in full swing since the country never went into lockdown. Meanwhile, factories in China have gradually reopened since late March.

In its latest financial report, Transsion said it has built a robust logistics network with warehouses in Ethiopia and Dubai. It told investors it has adopted “comprehensive use of air, sea and other transportation methods to achieve rapid delivery of products and raw materials in Africa, Southeast Asia, South Asia and other regions.”

But we’re already midway through the second quarter, as the month of April was disrupted by the lockdowns. In addition to Transsion, companies like Foxconn and Xiaomi are rushing to restart factories in places like India.

However, manufacturing industry stakeholders say it will take between two and four weeks for factory units to return to pre-lockdown levels.

“This quarter would be a write-off for the entire India,” MS Unnikrishnan, an Indian industrialist, told Bloomberg. “By the second quarter, we will learn to live with the disease.”

Beyond factories, Transsion may have to worry about falling demand in key African markets like Nigeria. The West African country is suffering the dual impact of the pandemic and the crash in oil prices. Both issues are affecting income levels and the purchasing power for millions of people.

IDC expects the country’s smartphone market to decline by 3.9% in the second quarter. But that prediction came in March and may not have accounted for the lockdown that followed in April.

However, analysts predict that low-end devices could suffer the most decline. While mid-range devices and high-end ones will suffer minor drops.

Transsion would need to take these into consideration as it tries to make a rebound from the minor decline in the first quarter.","While other companies recorded major drops in Q1, Transsion’s Tecno saw only a minor drop in sales.

Over all, Florida has 6,633 people who have paid a deposit to enroll as freshmen in the fall. That's down 1 percent from where Florida was last year at this time, but is still above its target (6,550). But Florida's entire deficit in freshmen has a single source: international students. Last year at this time, Florida had 322. This year the total is 155.

When all is said and done, Florida expects the same number of students in the fall -- 50,000, counting undergraduates, graduate and professional school students -- as it had last fall. And it's been checking in all the way along the path.

For public research universities, the admissions picture is cautiously stable. Plenty of things could still happen between now and when students actually show up. Summer melt -- those students who make a deposit and don't come -- could be far worse than in the past. But right now, the numbers are largely OK.

Regional public universities are experiencing much more of a mix, with some institutions holding steady and others losing ground. But that's the way it was last year and the year before and the year before that. Some, like California State University's 23 campuses, are doing fine (despite saying that they will be mostly online) because the population of California is growing. Others are struggling, but largely because of demographic changes in the states in parts of the country that are losing population, not the pandemic.

Of course community colleges are a key part of public higher education, but they tend to recruit throughout the summer, so Inside Higher Ed will review their enrollment strategies and successes in two months. Inside Higher Ed reviewed private colleges' performance last week -- finding that some are doing well and others not.

The picture that is emerging is not one that was predicted just a month or so ago. Survey after survey found that high numbers of freshmen -- perhaps 20 percent or more -- were planning to alter their previous plan for colleges, perhaps by going to a community college, and perhaps not going to college.

Elizabeth Johnson, chairman of SimpsonScarborough, which produced two of those surveys, said she agreed (with some hope) that the picture has changed.

""It’s important to remember that we collected our data before any institutions made any announcements about opening in the fall,"" she said. ""That was still a big open question at the time. Now, so many schools have announced they will open and the kids and families are indicating they are going to show up.""

SimpsonScarborough is currently planning another survey.

What the Numbers Show

Many public institutions do not release numbers this early in the year (any year). But enough agreed to provide some inside information to get a sense of trends.

Among public research universities, the trends were positive.

North Carolina State University currently has deposits from 4,913 freshmen (on a target of 4,775) and 1,495 transfer students (on a target of 1,400).

At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, more students than ever have committed to attend in the fall. The previous record was 4,355, and the campus aims to enroll 4,200.

There are many theories on summer melt this year. Some say universities will lose more than a few hundred students. Others, however, primarily where most students come from the state, say they may lose fewer than in the past, as students prefer to stay in their home states.

At the University of Washington, in Seattle, where the pandemic first hit the United States, 7,698 people have committed to enroll as freshmen in the fall, up from 7,018 on the same date last year, and well above the total goal of 7,000. Most of the increase is from U.S. nonresidents of Washington State.

At the University of Virginia, 4,000 freshmen have committed to enroll; the target is 3,748. Brian T. Coy, a spokesman, said that ""more attrition than normal"" was expected.

In the Midwest, the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities is expecting 6,776 freshmen in the fall (compared to 6,733 at this point last year).

And the University of Michigan has 7,298 deposits from freshmen, while the target is 7,182.

At the University of Colorado at Boulder, a spokeswoman said the institution was on target to be the same as last year: 7,113 students.

One reason public research universities are confident of reaching their totals is that, if they get more summer melt than expected, they have waiting lists (which some have already used).

A spokeswoman for the University of Texas at Austin said via email, ""Based on where we are now in terms of registrations, we are cautiously optimistic about fall enrollment, though like other institutions around the country we are watching carefully to see how conditions from the pandemic could affect the situation.""

The University of California system has not yet released its numbers this year, but off-the-record positive reports from campuses were confirmed by Sarah McBride, a spokeswoman, who said via email, ""We do know that campuses are working diligently through their wait lists, and at most campuses both California resident and nonresident enrollment is closing in on targets similar to past years.""

Pennsylvania State University says it currently has 16,744 freshmen signed up, an increase of 0.4 percent over this time last year. ""However, we do want to note that we expect these numbers to fluctuate as they do every year before student arrival and even after student arrival due to a number of reasons (e.g., students do not show up; we gain more students due to rolling admissions; students leave prior to our official fall count, etc.). Of course the global COVID-19 pandemic has major implications for all aspects of higher education. So this figure is not an official count,"" said Lisa M. Powers, a spokeswoman.

Michael Reilly, executive director of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, said, ""Summer enrollments seemed strong across higher education, which was a bit of a surprise given students' general dislike of the virtual format. I agree that fall does not appear to be as bleak as some predicted as little as a month ago.""

He said he still sees reason to worry. ""Two concerns I see are whether first-time freshmen will choose to begin their studies online or delay their start, and how having more than 30 million Americans out of work will impact the ability of individuals and families to pay for college in the fall.""

Regional Publics: ‘All Over the Place’

At regional public universities, admissions this year is ""all over the place"" and there's ""no consistency,"" said Mildred García, president of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities.

Frank Sobrino, a spokesman for the City University of New York, said, ""While our fall 2020 projections need to be taken with caution, we are projecting an overall enrollment decline of approximately 4.4 percent for the fall. We are seeing similar trends for senior colleges compared to last year, but enrollment is open through the end of August and we expect these numbers to fluctuate.​​""

CUNY, of course, was hit hard, as was everyone at a New York City college, by the pandemic. But a 4.4 percent decline is notable for not being the 20 percent or more that surveys suggested.

Eastern Michigan University, like many regional publics, does not use the May 1 (or this year June 1) deadline day to reply to an admissions offer. Currently, the university is down 8.4 percent on new students for the fall, but it has two more registration dates in June to close that. The university is also offering students who want them a single room.

At the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, freshman deposits are down 1.7 percent across its campuses.

But the Pennsylvania system has been losing students for years.

In North Carolina, East Carolina University currently has deposits from 4,629 freshmen, with a goal of 4,454. ""We continue to be hopeful that we will meet that goal as of fall census. However, like our higher education colleagues across the state and country, we are unsure how COVID-19 will ultimately affect students’ decisions and these numbers,"" said Jeannine Manning Hutson, chief communications officer.

At Winston-Salem State University, a historically black college in North Carolina, Joel Lee, the assistant vice chancellor for enrollment management, said, ""We are on pace to meet our freshman class target.""

The university estimates that it needs 1,500 people making a commitment to ""yield 1,000 actual enrollments,"" Lee said. The university is currently at 1,450, 7 percent ahead of last year, and still talking to lots of potential students.

At Longwood University, in rural Virginia, Justin Pope, chief of staff and vice president, said, ""Right now we’re feeling cautiously optimistic that we have avoided some of the more dire forecasts for across higher ed.""

As of Thursday, total incoming freshman and transfer deposits were 1,046, which is about 77 ahead of last year (8 percent). ""Considering what the world looked like in March and April, we are immensely pleased to have a meaningfully larger incoming class than a year ago,"" Pope said. ""We think our small college-town setting and a trend of Virginia students looking for good options closer to home have helped.""","For public research universities, the admissions picture is cautiously stable.
Regional public universities are experiencing much more of a mix, with some institutions holding steady and others losing ground.

Three words that are like a panacea to so many bike riding advocates and yet at the same time the cause of so much angst. Right now, in the midst of a bicycle boom and calls for further measures by central and local government to introduce more measures to protect anyone riding a bike and to limit the amount of vehicles on the roads, those advocates (or some of them anyway) are frothing at the mouth in frustration.

The focus of their anxieties? Mainly local government. Probably Grant Shapps would get it in the neck if he was in their crosshairs, but the most obvious target is the council. Why so much frustration right now? Because the government has made it clear that anyone not using a vehicle and not using public transport to move around during their daily existence is doing us all a favour. If you walk, or just ride a bike then in effect, you are a transport hero. And heroes need protecting right?​

Yes, they do. But it is not that easy. Painting a line is the easy bit and we know it is almost worse than pointless. Paint doesn’t protect anyone.​

“Officers are working really hard to deliver, and councillors are often making it quite a lot harder”

HM Government – Boris and Grant – has made old new money available for councils to implement traffic management measures to help with social distancing as we emerge from COVID19 in a new normal https://www.justridethebike.com/the-new-normal. Accessing that money is not so quick or easy. Closing dates for councils to apply for the first tranche of the money – and they needed to put in plans to win the cash – was early June. Some far-sighted councils with cash to spare have begun doing some traffic management work – widening footways and inserting protected bike lanes.​

But a lot of these councils are hamstrung by either the smoke and mirrors world of accessing central government funding – the current zeitgeist of ‘make public announcement now, worry about the actual spending later’ – lack of expertise, lack of leadership or straightforward arguments about what schemes to implement. Recent praise for the City of London foresight is laudable. But has the Square Mile got the same issues as inner-city Nottingham, Glasgow, or Northampton?​

We spoke to one council policy manager last week. They said: “I’ve just spent an hour on video conference discussing what schemes to implement. We have no idea what money we will get from government. And we have to cover the whole county. Too many councillors don’t have the foggiest idea about process; health and safety; contracting; procurement; traffic regulation; land ownership and lots more. That’s not to defend them, it’s to say officers are working really hard to deliver, and councillors are often making it quite a lot harder.”​

“Who knew that introducing improved cycling infrastructure during 2020 was such a minefield?”

Politicians are stoking up arguments, jumping on bandwagons and generally lacking expertise. It used to be the case that politicians would blame other politicians, but since this government decided blaming civil servants was an easy way out of a sticky situation of their own causing, this has come down the line to local authorities as well. One could argue that social media isn’t helping either. However, if you navigate carefully there is a lot of excellent advice from not just advocates of active travel, but cyclists and pedestrians that have an inside view on traffic management and street planning.​

Who knew that introducing improved cycling infrastructure during 2020 was such a minefield? Some of those guys on Twitter knew and so did the council officers – who often cannot do right for doing wrong. It is fair to say that some cycling infrastructure is rubbish. But is also reasonable to argue that most is improving – but that it is not a quick fix by any means.​

“One thing we do need to focus on is that cycling – just riding a bike – helps communities”

One thing we do need to focus on is that cycling – just riding a bike – helps communities. Streets can be brought back to life, shop sales boosted, exercise can be taken, and a social atmosphere lifted with the right decisions made by a combination of transport policy teams, highways engineers and politicians. They need a bit of time. Given the time they will choose to implement the right walking and cycling plans in the right areas – not middle class tree-lined avenues but some of the inner city areas where life needs to be allowed to flow freely and where good planning, backed by sensible political words and a decent budget can revitalise a community.

20,https://www.thestar.com.my/opinion/columnists/along-the-watchtower/2020/06/10/the-right-to-decent-housing,"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",The Star Online,The right to decent housing,"A HOTBED for infectious diseases. That’s how Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah described the congested living conditions of foreign workers in Malaysia.



The high number of Covid-19 infections at immigration detention centres and the discovery of outbreak clusters at construction sites and places where foreigners make up the majority of workers, have confirmed that these are the major breeding grounds of the deadly virus, which has killed 117 and infected more than 8,000 people in the country.



Among the lessons that Malaysia has learned from the pandemic is that we have to look at different ways of doing the usual things and one of the urgent matters to resolve is the management of the country’s migrant workers.



How many foreign workers, registered or otherwise, do we have now? No one knows, because the number remains a guesstimate.



In its report “Malaysia: Estimating the Number of Foreign Workers” last year, the World Bank cited the Home Ministry in stating that four out of 10 foreign workers were “irregular”, based on its enforcement and amnesty programmes.



The report implied that in 2017, there were 1.2 million illegal foreign workers out of the total of three million foreign workers in the country.



“None of these figures are backed up by rigorous analytical methods, except the estimate by the Institute of Labour Market Information and Analysis, which estimates the total foreign worker population to be 3.5 million using foreign worker-linked insurance data,” the report noted.



Today, it is believed that the number of foreign workers – both legal and illegal – may well be above six million.



It is a reflection of the Federal Government’s policy failures relating to migrant workers and a stark reminder of the country’s overdependence on low-cost labour to sustain the oil palm and manufacturing industries without giving due regard for alternative strategies and the basic human rights of migrant workers.



In April, while the number of Covid-19 cases rose significantly, the Malaysian Employers Federation assessed the number of illegal foreign workers to be at 3.3 million, compared with 2.2 million registered foreign workers. Some 180,000 refugees also added to the employment equation.



MEF executive director Datuk Shamsuddin Bardan noted that although a “conservative estimate” put the number of illegal foreigners in the country as the same as documented workers, it was assumed that there were about 1.5 illegal workers for each legal one.



Most of them have 3D (dirty, dangerous, difficult/demeaning) jobs avoided by Malaysians.



It has been estimated that 36% are in the manufacturing sector while 19% are in construction. They are also in plantations (15%), services (14%) and other agricultural activities (9%), while 7% are domestic helpers.



Compared with Thailand and Singapore, Malaysia has the highest number of foreign workers, but unlike our closest neighbours, we have millions of migrant workers in both urban areas – living in shophouses converted into dormitories and in low-cost flats – and rural areas, often in ramshackle lodgings near or on plantations and farms.



Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, there were already many cases of tuberculosis, malaria, filariasis, hepatitis B, leprosy and even sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis and HIV, due to gaps in health screening before their arrivals and as a result of living in confined, unhygienic shelters.



It’s better late than never but positive changes are under way courtesy of recent amendments to the Workers’ Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities Act 1990.



The Bill was passed by the Dewan Rakyat in July 2019. The amendments were gazetted a month later and came into force on June 1.



On May 27, the Human Resources Ministry said employers had been given three months’ grace – or until Aug 31 – to meet the stringent requirements.



The amended law, to be enforced on Sept 1, would make sure that minimum standards are extended to all sectors providing housing to foreign workers. Before the changes, this only applied to mine workers and workers in plantations that were at least eight hectares in size.



The law has also enhanced the 2018 Labour Department’s foreign workers’ housing guidelines to employers to ensure minimum standard living space, basic amenities, safety and hygiene.



The amended Act, however, applies only to Peninsular Malaysia and Labuan. It was reported that Sabah and Sarawak had agreed to include similar provisions in their respective labour ordinances.



From Sept 1, employers will be compelled to provide decent accommodation for workers and segregate housing based on gender.



They also need to ensure employees’ safety and well-being, fire safety and electrical wiring systems, and medical assistance whenever needed.



While they can collect rent from workers through salary deductions, they are also liable to be charged for breaches of the Act and can be fined up to RM50,000.



The question being asked now is: Can employers meet the stipulated conditions for foreign workers by Sept 1? As expected, the MEF has sought more time – at least six months – to comply with the requirements.



But why should there be further delays when employers could take advantage of not-so-new technologies such as the industrialised building system (IBS) or the offsite manufacturing system (OSM), to speed up housing construction?



The use of “prefabrication” of various parts of a building – beams, walls, doors, windows, and even bathrooms – in factories before assembling them at the needed site, can be traced to the 1900s. It was used to build houses quickly after World War II to meet the acute shortage after the wanton destruction on both sides.



Today, with high-tech robotics and better precast materials, a wide range of projects – from houses and condominiums to hotels and airports – have been built in countries such as the US, Australia, Japan, Singapore and even in Malaysia.



Workers’ housing, whether dormitories or one-stop immigrant housing centres, can be erected rapidly. In addition to reducing time, IBS and OSM can reduce costs with less wastage and ensure higher standards and quality.

The Ministry of Social Development on June 23 identified about 33,000 current or recent main benefit recipients who could be eligible for the CIRP.

There were only 16,524 people receiving the CIRP as at July 10 - of which 2,717 had transferred from Jobseeker Support.

Those who lose full-time work due to Covid-19 can get a CIRP worth $480 a week for a maximum of 12 weeks. Those who lose part-time work (15-29 hours a week) can get $250.

A single person without children would be much better off receiving the CIRP than they would be on Jobseeker Support, which pays $250.74 a week after tax.

The other upsides of the CIRP over Jobseeker Support are that it’s tax-free and easier to qualify for if one has a relatively high-income earning partner.

As at July 10 there were 192,063 people on Jobseeker Support - 47,047 more than as at March 20.

People have been able to apply for the CIRP from June 8, and have had the ability to switch over from Jobseeker Support provided they lost their job due to Covid-19 after March 1.

Asked by interest.co.nz why only 16,524 were receiving the CIRP, and whether the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) proactively got in touch with people to tell them they might be eligible, the Ministry’s deputy chief executive of service delivery, Viv Rickard, said: “We have proactively engaged with clients, who based on the data we hold on them look like they could be eligible for the CIRP.

“We encourage anyone who has lost their job as a result of covid-19 to contact MSD to see what options are available. There is information on the MSD website to check if you’re better off on CIRP or a benefit.”

Social Development Minister Carmel Sepuloni said MSD has sent out “mass emails” and has been pushing the CIRP through its website.

Finance Minister Grant Robertson acknowledged 16,524 was a low number and had asked MSD to look into it. Treasury in May forecast around 230,000 people could end up receiving the payment.

Anyone who loses their job before October 30 is eligible to apply.

The extended wage subsidy will start running out from mid-August.

CIRP recipients have to look for work, accept suitable jobs offers or accept opportunities for redeployment or training.","Tens of thousands of people who have lost their jobs due to Covid-19 are likely to be missing out on a higher level of support offered via the Covid-19 Income Relief Payment (CIRP), than the regular benefit.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York sharply condemned GOP Representative Ted Yoho of Florida for verbally accosting her outside the steps of Capitol Hill and criticized what was, in her view, an insufficient attempt at a public apology.

Speaking on the House floor on Thursday morning, Ocasio-Cortez began her speech by saying that Yoho had called her a ""f----- b----"" after confronting and verbally assaulting her, an incident that was first reported by The Hill on Tuesday.

""I was minding my own business walking up the steps and Rep. Yoho put his finger in my face, he called me disgusting, he called me crazy, he called me out of mind, and he called me dangerous,"" she said. A reporter from the Hill who overheard the exchange said Yoho confronted Ocasio-Cortez over remarks she had made connecting increases in crime to unemployment.Yoho, a four-term representative for Florida's third district, is retiring after this term.

Ocasio-Cortez said she had encountered verbal abuse before as a bartender in New York City and that Yoho's language was ""not new"" nor was she ""deeply hurt or offended"" by his comments. But she noted that she ""could not let go"" of Yoho's further statements on the House floor, when she said he ""made excuses"" and did not own up to his actions.

""I could not allow my nieces, I could not allow the little girls I go home, I could not allow the victims of verbal abuse and worse to see that, to see that excuse, and to see our Congress accept it as legitimate and accept it as an apology,"" she said.

She also criticized Yoho for using his wife and daughters as ""shields and excuses for poor behavior"" in his own remarks.

""Mr. Yoho mentioned that he has a wife and two daughters. I am two years younger than Mr. Yoho's youngest daughter. I am someone's daughter too. My father, thankfully, is not alive to see how Mr. Yoho treated his daughter. My mother got to see Mr. Yoho's disrespect on the floor of the House towards me on television. I am here, because I have to show my parents, that I am their daughter, and they did not raise me to accept abuse from men.""In a floor speech on Wednesday, Yoho did not deny the confrontation with Ocasio-Cortez and said he now regrets ""the strife he injected into the already contentious Congress"" and apologized for the ""abrupt manner"" in which he addressed her.

""Having been married for 45 years with two daughters, I'm very cognizant of my language. The offensive name-calling words attributed to me by the press were never spoken to my colleagues and if they were construed that way, I apologize for their misunderstanding,"" he said, adding that he ""cannot apologize for my passion or for loving my God, my family, and my country.""

Ocasio-Cortez said that Yoho's behavior using vulgar language in front of the media is far bigger than her, but ""gave permission to use that language against his wife, his daughters, women in his community.""

She added: ""I believe having a daughter does not make a man decent. Having a wife does not make a decent man. Treating people with dignity and respect makes a decent man. And when a decent man messes up, as we are all bound to do, he tries his best and does apologize.""

In a news conference, House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy said he believed Yoho's apology was sufficient saying, ""In America, people make mistakes. We're a forgiving nation. I also think when someone apologizes, they should be forgiven.""","""I believe having a daughter does not make a man decent,"" Ocasio-Cortez said Thursday.

Recently, the company launched an instant Rs 1,000 cash-back offer thus bringing the effective price to Rs 20,999.

It is understood to be the successor of the A30s. On paper, it has a decent upgrade over the predecessor in terms of the processor, battery and also comes with an additional camera sensor for better pictures.

I have been using the Galaxy A31 for a little over a week and here are my thoughts about Samsung’s new phone.

Design, display and build quality:

The new Galaxy A31 flaunts smooth glossy shell with visually appealing geometric patterns and when looked from different angles, it reflects a dazzling array of vibrant colours similar to the premium flagship Galaxy S and Note series. Our Prism Crush Blue review unit looks stunning in the daylight condition and have to say, its an instant eye turner.

Despite the massive 5,000mAh battery capacity, the phone is light to hold, and it is probably due to the polycarbonate material used for the back-case. That being said, the phone when held in the hand, gives off sturdy feel.

However, it is dirt magnet, as the glossy cover gets finger smudges within no-time. Thankfully, the company is offering a free transparent silicone case, which not only saves us the time to wipe the dirt, but also protects the device from getting damaged from accidental falls. Have to appreciate that the design of the protective case, as it protrudes a bit on the front, just enough to save the display from getting cracked when it falls on a flat surface.

On the front, the Galaxy A31 sports a 6.4-inch full HD+ super AMOLED Infinity-U display design. Despite the thick chin at the bottom, there is not much distraction and I really had a good time watching high-resolution videos on it. The screen is wide and tall and works out well to watch movies or attend video conference calls or online classes for long.

For people with small hands like me, may find a bit difficult to use the phone single-handedly in terms of reaching the apps on the top. But, the One UI interface has come tricks for such scenarios. It has screen edge shortcuts just near the volume rockers and you can assign shortcuts to 10 most-used apps and functionalities.

As far as the in-screen fingerprint sensor is concerned, it is a bit slow to respond to the finger imprints. It's better to use the face unlock in the good lighting conditions and go for the former in the pitch darkness to open the phone.

One peculiar thing I noticed in the Galaxy A31 is the SIM+microSD tray. I never have seen such an oddly big thing on a phone. But, I am complaining, as it can slide in and out easily and most importantly, can accommodate two SIMs and a storage card so that consumers never have to compromise between the two, which is not the case in most phones in the market.

Performance:

Samsung Galaxy A31 houses 2.0GHz Mediatek 6768 octa-core CPU backed by Android 10-based One UI 2.1 OS, 6GB RAM and 128GB storage (expandable up to 512GB via microSD). It performs smoothly in terms of normal activities like launching the app, loading the camera or a game, or switching between the multiple apps.

As far as the battery is concerned, it comes with a 5,000mAh cell and easily lasts two days under mixed usage. Even if you go extreme in terms of long sessions of video chat or binge-watch on multimedia content on Over-The-Top (OTT) apps, it can get you through the day.

However, it should be noted that the battery life will drain faster if you use mobile data for the aforementioned activities and it also applies to online gaming as well. It is advisable to switch to Wi-Fi if the activity involves high internet data consumption. In the box, it comes with Type-C 15W fast charger

Camera:

Samsung Galaxy A31 houses quad-camera module-- 48MP main sensor + 8MP(Ultra Wide) + 5MP( for Macro)+ 5MP (depth) sensor on the back.

In natural bright sunny conditions, the Galaxy A31 takes good quality pictures with sharpness, but couldn't help but notice, the camera software tends to go overdrive mode when the subject, particularly flowers with red/orange/pink colours and the resultant images tend to be saturated.

It is better on switch on the Scene optimiser, which helps in adjusting the camera settings to take decent shots in various lighting conditions and there is less burden on the user. He/she can focus on capturing the moment rather than wasting time in tweaking camera modes.

There is also ultra-wide angle mode and it works fine expanding the coverage area to capture the image.

But I am very disappointed that the Galaxy A31 doesn't have a dedicated Night mode. During the low light condition, the user has to switch on the auto LED flash mode and as far as the picture quality is concerned, it is decent at best not great.

Also, it is strange that the Samsung phone doesn't have 4K video recording. If it was two years ago, this would have been outrageous request, but we are in 2020, there are lesser priced phones in the market with 4K recording, but sadly missing in the Galaxy A31.

But, this is not a deal-breaker, as the high-resolution 4K videos gobble up storage in no time and full HD video are good enough to view on the super AMOLED screen of the phone.

On the front, it houses a 20MP camera and takes good selfies. I couldn't help but notice, there is slight smoothening of the skin and I am not complaining as it clears some of my acne scars and makes it more presentable on social media.

Also, there is AR (Augmented Reality) Zone, which offers tools to create personalised emoji, AR Doodles, GIFs, and fun stickers to share on social messenger apps. This is a really good value addition to the camera user-experience.

Final thoughts:

Over-all, Samsung Galaxy A31 is a decent mid-range phone and what I loved in the phone is its beautiful design language, delightfully great display, reliable camera, and long battery life.

If you are looking for a phone for entertainment purposes like binge-watching multimedia content on OTT apps, the Galaxy A31 will serve you long. Also, it is a good option for the salaried class who do long hours of video chat for official work and even for children, who are now compelled to attend online classes at home due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

25,https://www.arabnews.com/node/1723816/lifestyle,"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Arab News,Russell Crowe’s ‘Unhinged’ off to decent start as theaters slowly reopen,"Burj Al-Arab’s SAL: Come for the views, stay for the food at this Dubai hotspot

DUBAI: First things first: If you’re familiar with the Instagram account @influencersinthewild, then chances are you’ll spot similar examples of the content it posts at Burj Al-Arab’s SAL. Because for every few individuals who are at the venue for the resplendent views and excellent hospitality, there’s that one “influencer” at work, taking part in an impromptu photo shoot. It would be extreme to claim that they’re ruining the experience for everyone else, but you’ll probably pause and have a chuckle or two at the confidence of it all.

That being said, to reduce SAL to a social media “hotspot of the moment” would be doing it a disservice because judging by our own experience, there’s so much more to it than a backdrop for Insta-models. Jumeirah Group describes SAL, which opened in the second half of last year, as a “chic lifestyle experience at Burj Al Arab where barefoot luxury at an iconic pool and beach destination meets culinary excellence in a striking new dining venue.” With hues of blue forming the picture-perfect landscape, the restaurant overlooks the main star of the venue, the 100-meter infinity pool.

Jumeirah Group opened SAL in the second half of last year. Supplied

However, we’re here to dine, not dip (into the pool), and our entire meal was a feast for the eyes and the stomach. Headed by Culinary Director Marco Garfagnini, SAL’s menu “pays homage to the sea,” with the majority of the dishes made for sharing.

Greeted by a very welcoming and friendly team of hosts, we were guided to our seats before being offered a detailed run-through of the menu.

The heirloom tomato carpaccio, feta cheese and black olives was laid out on a platter in a pretty pattern. Supplied

To start, my dining partner and I opted for the heirloom tomato carpaccio, feta cheese and black olives, and the tuna tartare with caviar. As we waited, we were served water from freshly cut coconuts.

Once our appetizers arrived, it became clear that our phone photography would be reserved for the dishes and not only for the view. The carpaccio was delicately laid out on a platter in a pretty pattern, while the tartare was served in a perfect circle with a dash of gold dusting on top.

The tartare was divine. Its citrus-based Ponzu sauce marinade offered the perfect balance, “cooking” the fish to eliminate any offending aftertaste sometimes experienced with tartare. In fact, it was one of the best tartare dishes I have ever sampled.

The main course certainly had a lot to live up to, bringing us to the first — the recommended Portuguese dourada, a gilt-head sea bream fish common in the Mediterranean. At SAL, it’s served baked with tomatoes and potatoes. Again, absolutely flawless. Its cod-like meatiness paired with a spinach-infused sauce made for a moreish main that was delightful on the palette.

Another fish dish we were recommended was the sea-salt-crusted seabass for two, but since my guest isn’t the biggest fan of seafood, we opted to try the third recommendation — the stone-oven-baked lemon chicken empanada, with French fries and baby spinach salad. Now, SAL likes to entertain guests, so similarly to the seabass, this one is carved and served right in front of you. Given the show, we were expecting something big, but if there was one dish that was more “meh” than “marvelous,” it was this one. It was underwhelming after it was cut open and presented, looking more like some lemon chicken in pita bread rather than a baked turnover. It still tasted delightful, but we both agreed that if we could, we would advise the restaurant to serve it as is, as it looked much more appealing at the start.

It was nearly time to wrap up, and as much as we wanted to go for something sweet, we were simply running on full. One lovely staff member did try to tempt us with the dessert trolley offering a selection from the restaurant’s master pastry chefs, but we stayed strong. In the end, we were presented with a cute little meringue-based dessert topped with fresh berries — just the right amount of sugar to conclude our visit with.

Needless to say, this Burj Al-Arab beach restaurant is definitely one to add to your must-visits. As someone who has been based in this region for many years, this was easily one of the best meals I have had in a long time.

I don’t make that claim lightly.

26,https://www.standard.co.uk/business/dividends-covid-funds-yields-returns-a4527786.html,"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Evening Standard,The top five shares and five funds offering a decent dividend,"M ining giant BHP’s decision to slash its dividend by £362 million today takes to £13.8 billion the amount of money lopped off payments to investors by FTSE-100 companies during the Covid crisis so far.

All the companies cut their half-year payments to hold onto cash during this period of unprecedented uncertainty, but each reduction will have caused anguish to thousands of investors who rely on dividend income to fund their living.

BHP’s cut of £371 million makes it the latest in long run of companies playing Scrooge at a time savers have been left high and dry by near-zero interest rates on practically all other assets.

However, some companies have been able to retain their divi payments. Housebuilder Persimmon, for example, kept its payout going today.

According to AJ Bell research, although £13.8 billion of divis have been cancelled, cut or deferred by 31 companies, a further 26 firms have maintained or even increased their payments, totalling £9.2 billion. Four have restored payments worth a total of £1.5 billion so far.

Those retaining their payouts include BHP rival Rio Tinto, which paid £1.51 billion after beating market expectations with its profits.

BAT paid £1.21 billion, Diageo £1.1 billion and GlaxoSmithKline £953 million.

In further good news, many of these companies still have lowly share prices relative to the value of their expected dividends. GlaxoSmithKline, for example, is yielding 5.2%, while Rio Tinto yields 6.2%.

It should be noted that those yields are based on the expected future dividend payments which, in these uncertain times, may prove wrong.

And remember, the higher the yield, the greater the chance of a nasty cut in the pipeline.

But here are the biggest 10 payers so far during the half-year earnings season.

Top 10 retained dividends and yields

Rio Tinto: half-year payout £1.51 billion, indicative yield 6.2%

BAT: £1.21 billion, 8.2%

Diageo: £1.09 billion, 2.6%

GlaxoSmithKline: £953 million, 5.2%

AstraZeneca: £913 million, 2.5%

Unilever: £860 million, 3.3%

Reckitt Benckiser: £519 million, 2.3%

Legal & General: £294 million, 7.8%

RELX, £263 million, 2.6%

Phoenix, £234 million, 6.6%

Source: AJBell, Bloomberg

Clearly, from that lot, the standout winner is BAT, with a yield of 8.2% and the second highest payer in pounds and pence in the market.

Should you buy the shares? If you don’t mind people dying to fund your income, then probably, yes. Tobacco stocks are relatively cheap because they are catering for a slowly dwindling customer base and fall foul of some investors’ ethical standards.

BAT’s shares have fallen sharply over the past couple of years as it has failed to pay off debt as quickly as hoped since buying Reynolds in the US.

However, its leverage is still sharply down, and it pays off enough cash for it not to threaten the dividend, all things being equal.

Personally, though, I still prefer insurance to cancer sticks (although as actuaries will tell you, the prospects of one can depend on use of the other).

L&G and Phoenix’s yields look tempting.

They are high because their sector is unfashionable at a time when investment returns on their funds are weak due to low interest rates.

Some analysts fear L&G will struggle to keep raising its divi (which has already increased 7% over the past three years) due to sliding profits.

Fans counter that new business in pension transfers and investments in new assets such as housing and urban regeneration will bring in the cash.

Phoenix owns old books of life insurance business. As the policies mature, the cash that generates is paid out as dividends. The nature of its work means you can see for years ahead what shape the business will be in, and how much it will be able to return. The guidance is steady, reliable growth.

Rio Tinto's recent dividend payout looked especially healthy after BHP's cut today, and Glencore's previous reduction.

Clearly, the shares look cheap compared with the divi because markets suspect it may not be able to pay up next time.

Much depends on the iron ore price - itself dependent on the global economy. But Rio has a decent track record of delivering on the divi and has plenty of cash to cover its current payments. At these levels, it looks worth a bet.

The other standout yielder is GSK, which also strikes me as a decent bargain for 5.2%.

Like its rival AstraZeneca, for years it was struggling with a dwindling pipeline of potential blockbuster medicines and ever rising research and development costs.

Both have launched multi-year restructuring projects to focus down on fewer, more promising medicines.

AZ began restructuring first, and has pulled out of the other side earlier, hence its lower yield. But GSK is getting there, albeit after being waylaid by Covid restricting patients’ visits to doctors for vaccines.

As the dividend culling trend has impacted individual stocks, it has also hit the performances of funds, particularly (obviously) those chasing income.

Investment advisory group Sanlam just published its review of income funds.

It found those backing more FTSE-100 size companies fared better than those backing smaller businesses. During the crisis, big was better when it came to gaining access to capital.

Bigger companies also had wider spread risks, and so tended to be insulated more than smaller ones from the lockdown in the UK.

Following that thought, Sanlam advises investors to seek funds sourced from outside the FTSE-100, too. There seems little sense limiting one’s potential hunt to a “shrinking pool of heaviweights”, they advised.

Its picks go into what it calls the White List of top income funds with proven track records of strong income distribution, volatility and overall performance over five years.

The winner came out as the Liontrust Income Fund, run by Robin Geffen, which was praised for having fared well in the recent volatile period as well as over the preceding few years. According to Sanlam, £100 of investment would have returned £25.30 since 2015.

The Santander Enhanced Income Fund came second, with manager Graham Ashby and Duncan Green beating many rivals thanks to a good dividend. It would have earned you £30.70 over five years.

The LF Miton UK MultiCap Income Fund came third thanks to a good recent performance although it dropped off the White List in the previous review. The five year income on £100 was £19.40.

BlackRock’s UK Income and ES River & Mercantile UK Equity Income came in fourth and fifth with five year income of £23.60 and £23.10 on £100 respectively.","It should be noted that those yields are based on the expected future dividend payments which, in these uncertain times, may prove wrong.

HMCL has posted a notable operating performance in these tough times. The narrative around rural demand is positive, but supply chain ramp-up and broad-based demand are important for demand sustainability. We upgrade our EPS estimate by 9% for FY21 to factor in faster volume recovery. But, we maintain our Neutral rating, with TP of Rs 3,045 (~16x Sep’22 S/A EPS + Rs 98/share for Hero FinCorp).

Revenues fell 63% y-o-y to ~Rs 29.7 bn on a ~69% y-o-y decline (-58% q-o-q) in volumes. Realisations were up 21% y-o-y (+12.8% q-o-q) to Rs 52.7k, driven by BS6-related price increases and no discounts. Gross margins fell 80bp y-o-y (-120bp q-o-q) to 29.5%, as it didn’t load contribution margins on BS6 cost pass-through. Lower other expenses supported Ebitda margins to 3.6%. As per mgmt., margins were at 12% after excluding fixed cost of Rs 2.5 bn during lockdown. Ebitda was at ~Rs 1.1 bn and PAT fell ~90% y-o-y to ~Rs 613 m.

Highlights from commentary

Strong demand recovery: Demand does constitute only pent-up demand; recovery seems sustainable. Rural is seeing a V-shaped recovery, while urban is lagging behind due to sporadic lockdowns. 10–12% of demand is owing to purchases being brought forward.

Customer profile: Purchases for commuting to work and additional vehicles have gone up significantly, while replacement demand is down.

Company is quite confident of market share gains in Q1 sustaining, driven by rural buoyancy, response to BS6 products, a refreshed portfolio (Passion, Glamour), and the plugging of product gaps (Scooters and premium). Operations have recovered to 80–90% of pre-COVID-19 levels, and would fully normalise in the coming months. 95% of its dealers are fully operational. It took a price hike of Rs 250 in Jul’20 & Rs 1,000 in Q1FY21. Leap-2 targets cost-cutting by 100bp (2x target), capex phasing, and Project Mileage for overheads.

Valuation and view

Considering the favourable outlook for rural, HMCL should continue to see good demand recovery. However, the sharp price increase in 2Ws over the last two years could lead to adverse mix restricting margins and EPS growth (8% CAGR over FY20–23e). The stock trading at 18.5x/15.9x FY21/FY22e EPS is a fair reflection of the current market condition and expected recovery.

More importantly, the SEZ programme is used as a critical tool for accelerating the country’s industrial development agenda. This programme is mandated by the SEZ Act, which was proclaimed in February 2016. The purpose of the SEZ programme is, among others, to attract foreign and domestic investments, increase the number and value of exported products, accelerate the development of industrial infrastructure, help accelerate the beneficiation of the country’s resource endowments, and to create decent jobs.

To date, there are 11 approved Special Economic Zones in seven provinces; the latest one is Tshwane Automotive SEZ, launched by President Cyril Ramaphosa in November 2019. In addition, there are five additional proposals that the Department of Trade, Industry, and Competition (the DTIC) is exploring in partnership with provinces.

The SEZ Programme continues to make a meaningful contribution to the country’s economy. It has to date attracted 234 investors, with an estimated value of over R61-billion; 135 of these investors are operating in SEZs, creating approximately 15 000 direct jobs. Coega and Dube TradePort SEZs continue to be at the forefront of sustaining this growth in investment attraction. Substantively, Coega’s value of operational investments grew from R7.063-billion to R11.292-billion, while DTPSEZ experienced growth in excess of R500-million in this regard.

The geographic location of designated and proposed SEZs

Our SEZs

South Africa has eleven SEZs located in different provinces, namely:

– Coega SEZ (Eastern Cape)

– Richards Bay SEZ (Kwazulu-natal)

– East London SEZ (Eastern Cape)

– Saldanha Bay SEZ (Western Cape)

– Dube Tradeport SEZ(Kwazulu-natal)

– Maluti-a-phofung SEZ (Free State)

– OR Tambo International Airport SEZ (Gauteng)

– Musina/Makhado SEZ (Limpopo)

– Atlantis SEZ (Western Cape)

– Nkomazi SEZ (Mpumalanga)

– Tshwane Automotive SEZ

In an effort to further optimise the country’s comparative and competitive endowments, there are additional pending SEZ applications that are at various stages of development. The most notable of these include the proposed Bojanala SEZ (NW), Namakwa SEZ (NC), Vaal SEZ (GP), Tubatse SEZ (LP) and Wild Coast SEZ (EC).

SEZ TAX INCENTIVES

To complement the DTI’s SEZ strategy, a package of tax incentives will be available to companies located in certain SEZs, subject to specific criteria. The tax incentives that companies may qualify for include VAT and customs relief if located within a Customs-Controlled Area (CCA), an employment tax incentive, a building allowance and a reduced corporate income tax rate.

The design and eligibility criteria for each incentive seeks to strike a balance between achieving the objectives of higher levels of investment, growth and employment creation, and ensuring that the incentives are appropriately targeted for efficiency purposes, while minimising any deadweight loss to the fiscus.

Businesses located within a CCA will qualify for VAT and customs relief (similar to that for the current IDZs). The employment tax incentive will be available to businesses located in any SEZ. Businesses operating within approved SEZs (by the Minister of Finance, after consultation with the Minister of Trade and Industry) will be eligible for two additional tax incentives. Firstly, all such businesses can claim accelerated depreciation allowances on capital structures (buildings) and, secondly, certain companies (carrying on qualifying activities within an approved SEZ) will benefit from a reduced corporate tax rate (15% instead of 28%).

VAT AND CUSTOMS RELIEF

Companies located within a CCA will be eligible for VAT and customs relief, as per the current IDZs.

Characteristics of a CCA include the following:

• Import duty rebate and VAT exemption on imports of production-related raw materials, including machinery and assets, to be used in production with the aim of exporting the finished products;

• VAT suspension under specific conditions for supplies procured in South Africa; and

• Efficient and expedited customs administration.

More information on CCAs can be found on the SARS website www.sars.gov.za

EMPLOYMENT TAX INCENTIVE

All employers of low-salaried employees (below R60 000 per annum) in any SEZ will be entitled to the employment tax incentive (ETI). This aims to encourage employers to hire young and less experienced work seekers. It reduces an employer’s cost of hiring people through a cost-sharing mechanism with government, while leaving the wages the employee receives unaffected. The employer can claim the ETI and reduce the amount of Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) tax payable by the amount of the total ETI calculated in respect of all qualifying employees.

BUILDING ALLOWANCE

Businesses operating within approved SEZs (by the Minister of Finance, after consultation with the Minister of Trade and Industry) will be eligible for an accelerated depreciation allowance on capital structures (buildings). The special rate of capital (depreciation) allowances in lieu of normal allowances will be available for erecting or improving buildings and other fixed structures. This rate will equal 10% per annum over 10 years.

Companies engaged in the following activities, based on the Standard Industrial Classification Code issued by Statistics South Africa, will not qualify for the building allowance:

• Spirits and ethyl alcohol from fermented products and wine (SIC code 3051)

• Beer and other malt liquors and malt (SIC code 3052)

• Tobacco products (SIC code 3060)

• Arms and ammunition (SIC code 3577)

• Bio-fuels if that manufacture negatively impacts on food security in South Africa.

REDUCED CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE

Certain companies will qualify for a reduced corporate income tax rate of 15%, instead of the current 28% headline rate. To qualify, the following conditions must be satisfied:

• The company must be located in a SEZ that is approved by the Minister of Finance;

• It must be incorporated or effectively managed in South Africa;

• At least 90% of the income must be derived from the carrying on of business or provision of services within that SEZ; and

• The company must not be engaging in activities listed in the Government Gazette No. 39930.

The SEZ programme is a central part of South Africa’s efforts to reignite economic growth by attracting strategic investments with the greatest potential for sustainable growth and development. Since the introduction of the SEZ Act in 2016, there has been massive interest from investors to locate in the SEZs. This is attested by the rand value of signed and not yet operational investors.

Atlantis SEZ expands greentech sector

The youth of Atlantis has benefited from training, mentoring and exposure to greentech due to the Special Economic Zone there

In December 6 2018, the Atlantis Special Economic Zone (ASEZ) was officially launched by President Cyril Ramaphosa. This priority development node is about 40km north of Cape Town and 76km south of Saldanha Bay. It lies between the N7 to Namibia and the R27 West Coast Road.

The president described Special Economic Zones as manufacturing hubs for the entire African continent, capable of reaching and servicing a rapidly growing market for goods and services. The Atlantis SEZ is expected to grow the greentech sector in the Western Cape more broadly, and revitalise Atlantis as a key industrial node in the region.

Greentech refers to green technologies that reduce or reverse the impact of people on the planet. Wind turbines, solar panels, insulation, biofuels, electric vehicles, materials recycling and green building materials are all examples of green technology.

The impact of investment in the Atlantis SEZ

Situated on South Africa’s West Coast, the Atlantis SEZ capitalises on the Western Cape province’s already booming renewable energy and green technology sector, and taps into the $3-trillion global clean technology market.

The zone welcomes manufacturers, service providers, suppliers and other players in the value chains of green technology manufacturing. Investors have access to extensive investment support through the One Stop Shop and the rest of the investor support ecosystem, which includes InvestSA, GreenCape, the City of Cape Town and Wesgro. Together, the ecosystem provides information and advocacy; market intelligence; facilitated access to permits and licences, planning and development approval; and skills training.

Through these combined investment promotion efforts, R700-million has already been invested in the Atlantis SEZ, including manufacturers of wind turbine towers, geotextiles, double-glazed windows, wind tower internals and acetylene gas. More than 332 new jobs have been created in the zone to date; most of the positions are filled by Atlantis residents.

The combined work of Wesgro, City of Cape Town (InvestCT), InvestSA and GreenCape in promoting and landing investors is a uniquely effective approach that has yielded results recognised by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development on more than one occasion.

Living Lab for green industrialisation

The Atlantis SEZ aims to operate as a viable industrial hub contributing to green technology industrialisation and job creation in South Africa. As such it represents South Africa’s leading foray into green industrialisation and is a tool to unlock green industrial development, manufacturing, employment, technology development, enterprise development and skills development, among others. These initiatives will provide investors with a secure and well-serviced operating environment and build the credibility of their greentech credentials. The aim of the SEZ is to work together with investors to create mutually supportive systems that enhance performance and reduce impact on the environment.

There are three key principles that underpin the greentech concept:

1) Low carbon goods and production: pursuing production of goods that help reduce the utilisation of carbon (such as solar power) and, where possible, encourage production processes that use substantially less or zero carbon (for example, utilisation of solar power in production, or energy efficient production).

2) Resource efficient goods and production: pursue resource efficient production. This includes low carbon/zero carbon production processes, but also extends to water and waste efficiencies (cleantech), either in the way goods are produced and/or production of goods that enable much greater resource efficiency among consumers.

3) Socially inclusive production processes: encourage production of goods and services in the SEZ in a manner that builds the social and economic capital of Atlantis and surrounds. This means prioritising skills and enterprise development in Atlantis and surrounds, in particular maximising the “spillover” backward and forward linkages of companies operating in the SEZ.

In a nutshell, these principles aim to reduce or remove the impact of humans on the environment. The ASEZ is a “living lab” that seeks to embody these objectives in the way it services and runs the zone. It has ambitious goals such as building skills and enterprise in and around Atlantis for the green economy, supplying its own renewable energy, being a net-zero water user and having little to no waste to landfill.

In future, all industrial development should be done this way, especially if we are to achieve a semblance of sustainability, grow the circular economy and tackle the drivers exacerbating the climate crisis. This concept is closely aligned to the Eco-Industrial Parks framework. The in 2017, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization defines eco-industrial parks as: “…an earmarked area for industrial use … that ensures sustainability through the integration of social, economic and environmental quality aspects into its siting, planning, operations, management and decommissioning.”

One of the major implications of this approach is, in fact, to grow social inclusion.

The community’s role has been fundamental to the ethos of the development of the ASEZ. The designated area of the SEZ is embedded in the existing Atlantis Industria and is mere blocks from the residential area. The work with community members in Atlantis has been unique in the landscape of economic infrastructure development. In 2019, the ASEZ successfully established an ASEZ Community Stakeholder Network. This elected group of 15 community members represents eight sectors in a structure that acts as a conduit for communication between the ASEZ and the Atlantis community.

In addition to jobs and investments, the people of Atlantis have also benefited in a number of other ways. Skills development has been prioritised to ensure local skills meet the needs of industry located in the area. To this end, the youth has benefited from training, mentoring, exposure to greentech, and participation in the annual Atlantis Renewable Energy Challenge and career expo, all of which will potentially help them tap into greentech job opportunities emerging from the Atlantis SEZ.

In 2018, 88 learners received tutoring through the Atlantis Ikamva Youth Programme; 81% of grade 12 learners passed their matric exams, with 68% achieving bachelors and diploma passes. Skills development and training for adults has taken the form of training sessions on solar PV for people from Atlantis and surrounds, and the recruitment of three female interns from Atlantis to work in the SEZ project office. The women successfully transitioned into permanent appointments at the SEZ project office in 2016. Other benefits for Atlantis include the upgrade of the power supply, fibre connectivity and MyCiti transport links.

Creating an environment for regional economic development

• Owing to its strategic location and envisaged growth, the ASEZ is demonstrating its potential to contribute towards regional economic and spatial development. Here are some key ways in which the ASEZ contributes to growth in the region:

• Supporting the growth of the West Coast Development Corridor through strategic positioning, linking the Saldanha Bay SEZ, Port of Saldanha, Atlantis SEZ, Port of Cape Town and the economic nodes in the City of Cape Town.

• Contributing to the achievement of the national, provincial and city green economy vision through green industrialisation and manufacturing.

• Enabling the socioeconomic development leg of the National Development Plan (NDP) by supporting three NDP Strategic Infrastructure Projects (SIPs) — SIPs eight, nine and 10 — which focus on greening the South African economy, electricity generation and electricity transmission.

• Supporting local content manufacturing, linked to the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme and driven by the national department of energy.

• Developing gas-to-power projects: The conversion of Ankerlig to gas creates an opportunity for additional gas-to-power and gas for industrial applications in the zone.

• Contributing to climate change adaptation through green economic growth and industrialisation.

Collaboration creates momentum

The Atlantis SEZ is the result of six years of collaborative effort with the City of Cape Town, the Western Cape government and the national department of trade and industry (the dti).

After the signing of a memorandum of understanding with the dti in 2013, the Western Cape government submitted an application in 2015 to the dti to have parts of the Atlantis Industrial area declared an SEZ.

The dti held public consultations in October 2017, and received overwhelming support in favour of establishing the Atlantis SEZ. On June 7 2018, the South African Cabinet approved the decision by the then minister of trade and industry to designate the ASEZ. This was after the Special Economic Zones Advisory Board was satisfied with the rationale and scale of economic opportunities in the region, and recommended that the minister designate the proposed area and grant an SEZ licence to the Western Cape provincial department of economic development and tourism. On December 6 2018, the ASEZ was officially launched by President Cyril Ramaphosa.

The zone complements the Western Cape Government Green Economy Strategy Framework, and the City of Cape Town’s Atlantis 2023 strategy.

Why would investors want to invest in the Atlantis SEZ?

There are strong and growing South African and African markets for greentech. The South African greentech manufacturing market is worth at least R5-billion, with a growing greentech market in the neighbouring countries. South Africa has opportunities in energy, waste, agriculture, transport and other sectors and is a great entry point to the SADC market.

Atlantis is a great location and development ready. Ninety-three hectares of zoned City of Cape Town land is available for leasing to investors. Bulk infrastructure is in place and Atlantis has new public transport, fibre connectivity and shipping links. Atlantis is also close to major ports, roads, universities and greentech markets.

Investors have access to extensive investment support through the One Stop Shop for investor support and the rest of the investor support ecosystem, which includes InvestSA, GreenCape, the City of Cape Town, and Wesgro.

Investors and tenants are accessing attractive incentives in the form of tax relief and allowances, employment tax incentives, fast-tracked development approvals, fee exemptions and subsidies.

There is an attractive, wide-ranging skills base to recruit from, with five universities and many more colleges in the province, and a large range of unskilled, semi-skilled, technical and professional candidates.

Musina-Makhado SEZ takes the next step

An artist’s impression of the Musina-Makhado Special Economic Zone

Special Economic Zones (SEZs) have emerged as strategic platforms to spur industrialisation, job creation, technology transfer and economic growth in various countries across the globe.

SEZs are one of the most important tools for a sustainable economic recovery after the debilitating Covid-19 lockdown. The SEZ Programme was mandated by the SEZ Act of 2016, where they are described as a tool to help:

• promote industrial agglomeration

• build the required industrial infrastructure

• promote co-ordinated planning among key government agencies and the private sector, and

• guide the deployment of other necessary development tools.

The Musina-Makhado SEZ SOC (MMSEZ) is one of the more recently promulgated SEZs. The project was initiated by the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition through an act of Parliament. This month it took the key step towards its corporatisation with the launch of a new corporate identity and website, as part of a brand re-launch. Since its establishment it has so far managed to attract investment of up to R150-billion for the province and is expected to create between 21 000 and 26 000 jobs in its initial stages.

Lehlogonolo Masoga, MMSEZ Chief Executive Officer, expands on its purpose: “The MMSEZ has positioned itself as a platform to revitalise the Limpopo economy through industrialisation. Our focus is to generate much-needed base-load electricity, establish a metallurgical complex, develop a manufacturing hub, enhance agro-processing and develop a regional logistics centre. The close proximity of the Beit Bridge border post and abundance of mineral and agricultural resources gives the MMSEZ its competitive advantage.”

Thabo Mokone, MEC for Limpopo Economic Development, Environment and Tourism, says: “Our ambition is not just to build an industrial park but rather to use the SEZ as a catalyst to unlock a plethora of other opportunities, including the potential of realising a new smart city.”

The MMSEZ development will cover approximately 11 500 hectares of land situated along the N1 highway that connects South Africa to the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region and the rest of the continent via Zimbabwe. The overall development will include the building of a power station and smelters.

“Given our strategic location, the MMSEZ will be the epicentre of the SADC,” says Mokone.

Limpopo Premier Chupu Mathabatha says that the SEZ is expected to be a major catalyst in the fight against unemployment and stimulation of business opportunities. In his State of the Province Address earlier this year, he noted that the external master plans for both the Southern and Northern sites of the MMSEZ have been completed.

It is estimated that construction of the infrastructure for the MMSEZ will take between 15 and 30 years to complete. The SEZ aspires to strengthen South Africa’s terms of trade through the production and export of value-added commodities, the creation of stronger value chains and provision of much-needed jobs in previously disadvantaged regions. It will also add to industrial diversification in the province through the establishment of an energy and metallurgical processing complex. Iron ore, coking coal and other minerals that are key inputs into the iron and steel production process will be part of the downstream value addition process. The MMSEZ will also include light and medium industries, logistics and agro-processing that will be supported by strong retail, residential centres and recreational facilities.

What the Musina Makhado SEZ comprises

The MMSEZ comprises two geographical locations that address unique industrial clusters: the site in Musina targets the light industrial and agro-processing clusters, while the Makhado site is a metallurgical/mineral beneficiation complex.

The SEZ is strategically located along the N1 North-South route into the SADC, close to the border with Zimbabwe. It forms part of the Trans-Limpopo Spatial Development Initiative and has been developed as part of greater regional plans to unlock investment, economic growth and employment, and to address the development of skills.

Newly built infrastructure enables full utilisation of the area’s unique combination of mineral endowments and supports industries in the full value chains for mineral beneficiation, agro-processing and light industrial manufacturing.

With the MMSEZ’s location in close proximity to the main land-based route into SADC and the African continent, together with supporting incentives and a good logistics backbone, the intention is to brand it as the location of choice for investment in the mineral beneficiation, agro-processing and petrochemical industries.

Water Resources

Extensive studies on security of water supply have been conducted in the last few years, which concluded that existing surface and groundwater in the region are not ideal to sustain the project. Other options were explored and are currently under further vigorous scientific research to determine the volumetric of sources, abstraction models, infrastructure roll-out, commercial viability, funding options and governance models.

Our options have been disclosed in the published (01/09/2020) Environmental Impact Assessment and there is a Draft Report for consultation with stakeholders.

In the main, our investigations have recommended two primary sources, the first being harvesting runaway annual flood water in the Limpopo basin and a cross-border water transfer scheme. We have no intention of exploiting the already distressed alluvial aquifers in the Limpopo basin.

MMSEZ is a two-in-one project made up of two sites, a heavy industrial park for energy generation and metallurgical complex and a light-to-medium industrial hub focusing on general manufacturing, agro-processing and logistics. The latter site, which already has an environmental authorisation, requires pretty much minimal water supply compared to the former. The two towns of Musina and Makhado have been classified as growth points by the provincial government and they require new water sources with or without the MMSEZ. The SEZ is currently conducting a comprehensive feasibility study on the development of a multi-billion rand new dam, anchored on harvesting the flood water from the Limpopo River.

This initiative will mitigate the velocity of the destructive floods which annually cause unspeakable destruction at the river downstream in Mozambique. Similarly, the regular discharge of the water from the storage facility will help to continuously replenish the dry river for the benefit of water users downstream. The other study on water reconciliation is from our neighbouring country Zimbabwe to determine the capacity of their existing sources and potential surplus available for sharing is being conducted by the Department of Water and Sanitation. — Eamonn Ryan","More importantly, the SEZ programme is used as a critical tool for accelerating the country’s industrial development agenda.
The most notable of these include the proposed Bojanala SEZ (NW), Namakwa SEZ (NC), Vaal SEZ (GP), Tubatse SEZ (LP) and Wild Coast SEZ (EC).
SEZ TAX INCENTIVESTo complement the DTI’s SEZ strategy, a package of tax incentives will be available to companies located in certain SEZs, subject to specific criteria.

As students navigate the new world of pandemic schooling, it’s hard to imagine what post-secondary school education will be like in the next decade. But it’s safe to assume the cost will continue to rise.

Between 1995 and 2015, the average cost of one-year of undergraduate university tuition nearly tripled to $6,191 from $2,333, according to Statistics Canada.

A more recent survey from StatsCan pegs the current tuition cost of a four-year university degree at $27,000. If the trend continues, that degree will cost $81,000 in 20 years.

The costs can be daunting for young parents faced with the burden of paying for a child’s education, especially if it requires living away from home. Those who start saving early can help ease that burden by investing in a federal government program called a registered education savings plan (RESP).

The RESP matches the annual contributions of a parent by 20 per cent up to $500, to a lifetime maximum of $7,200 per child. To maximize the full government grant, parents needs to contribute an average of $2,500 each year. Unfortunately for struggling parents, the maximum grant amount has not been increased to reflect the rising cost of education.

Unlike registered retirement savings plans (RRSPs), which have decades to grow, RESPs only have up to an 18-year time horizon. That means the money in the plan needs to be invested for a shorter period of time, to be withdrawn over a short period of time.

Since the funds need to be invested in the broader markets to grow, there are risks when investing in an RESP. The money can be invested in just about anything – stocks, bonds, guaranteed investment certificates (GICs), mutual funds, exchange traded funds – just like investments in a RRSP or tax-free savings account (TFSA).

However, there are investment products tailored to RESPs, which a qualified advisor should be able to recommend. Most financial institutions including banks, credit unions and mutual fund companies provide RESPs. Scholarship plan dealers – companies that only sell RESPs – offer individual, family and group plans.

The contributions and grants grow tax-free while in an RESP, but unlike an RRSP, they can’t be deducted against a parent’s income. Instead, the RESP is taxed when withdrawn in the hands of the low-income student, who is typically taxed at a lower marginal rate.

If a child decides not to continue after high school, or if too much money is accumulated, tax must be paid on the money earned in the plan as interest. This money is called ""accumulated income."" It will be taxed at the parent’s regular income tax level, plus an additional 20 per cent. The money that the parent puts into the RESP is returned.

The grant money that comes with the RESP can be shared with a brother or sister if they have room available – otherwise, the grant must be returned to the Canadian government.

There is a lifetime limit of $50,000 for each child.

To get a better idea of how much an RESP needs to grow to keep pace with the rising cost of a post-secondary school education, the Ontario Securities Commission provides two online calculators on a website called getsmarteraboutmoney.ca.

The Education Cost Calculator estimates the cost for attending a specific college or university program as well as typical food, residence and other living expenses.

The RESP savings calculator estimates whether your planned savings will be enough to help meet those costs.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) Stock's Been Sliding But Fundamentals Look Decent: Will The Market Correct The Share Price In The Future?","It is hard to get excited after looking at Cisco Systems' (NASDAQ:CSCO) recent performance, when its stock has declined 11% over the past three months. But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. Specifically, we decided to study Cisco Systems' ROE in this article.

Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.

Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems

How To Calculate Return On Equity?

Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cisco Systems is:

30% = US$11b ÷ US$38b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2020).

The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.30.

What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?

We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.

A Side By Side comparison of Cisco Systems' Earnings Growth And 30% ROE

First thing first, we like that Cisco Systems has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 6.7% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Given the circumstances, we can't help but wonder why Cisco Systems saw little to no growth in the past five years. So, there could be some other aspects that could potentially be preventing the company from growing. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.

As a next step, we compared Cisco Systems' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 3.6% in the same period.

The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is CSCO worth today? The intrinsic value infographic in our free research report helps visualize whether CSCO is currently mispriced by the market.

Is Cisco Systems Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?

The high three-year median payout ratio of 54% (meaning, the company retains only 46% of profits) for Cisco Systems suggests that the company's earnings growth was miniscule as a result of paying out a majority of its earnings.

In addition, Cisco Systems has been paying dividends over a period of nine years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 47%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Cisco Systems' future ROE will be 30% which is again, similar to the current ROE.

Conclusion

In total, it does look like Cisco Systems has some positive aspects to its business. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return. Investors could have benefitted from the high ROE, had the company been reinvesting more of its earnings. As discussed earlier, the company is retaining a small portion of its profits. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

How Is ROE Calculated?

The formula for return on equity is:

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for HMS Holdings is:

6.5% = US$58m ÷ US$890m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2020).

The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.06.

What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?

So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company.

HMS Holdings' Earnings Growth And 6.5% ROE

At first glance, HMS Holdings' ROE doesn't look very promising. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 8.8%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. In spite of this, HMS Holdings was able to grow its net income considerably, at a rate of 31% in the last five years. Therefore, there could be other reasons behind this growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.

As a next step, we compared HMS Holdings' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 23%.

The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth.

Is HMS Holdings Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?

HMS Holdings doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above.

Conclusion

Overall, we feel that HMS Holdings certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Despite its low rate of return, the fact that the company reinvests a very high portion of its profits into its business, no doubt contributed to its high earnings growth.

(Photo: mm2 Entertainment)

Rating: PG13

Length: 107 minutes

Director: Stanley Tong

Cast: Jackie Chan, Yang Yang, Ai Lun, Mu Qimiya, Xu Ruohan, Zhu Zhengting

3.5 out of 5 stars

Vanguard is an enjoyable, if slightly mindless, popcorn flick. Fortunately, it's done quite tastefully, which means the focus is firmly on the action, with the humorous parts used to support the action rather than to elicit cheap laughs. Boasting a good-looking cast, Vanguard is actually a decent film to catch this month.

The movie revolves around an independent security team, Vanguard, that is tasked to rescue a businessman and his estranged daughter. However, they discover that the businessman holds knowledge of a deadly secret — a secret that could put a powerful weapon in the hands of violent terrorists. If Vanguard doesn't stop the terrorists, then thousands of lives may be at stake.

Vanguard knows what you're there to watch and gives you what you want to watch. It's one of those films that meet expectations perfectly, neither exceeding nor falling short of expectations. It's all about the action and fighting, which is inventive and well-executed. It's simply a spectacle to be enjoyed, which is probably what audiences are looking for when they pick a film like this. There's some semblance of a plot, but all that really does is give an excuse for the cast to get from country to country, as well as to set up a loose romance thread.

Thankfully, the budding romance happens between two very good-looking cast members - spunky environmentalist Fareeda (Xu Ruohan) and dashing agent Lei Zhenyu (Yang Yang). It's not too serious though, so the film doesn't purposefully detract from the action to indulge in love scenes. Rather, it makes sure that there are just enough sparks to add another dimension to the plot, without trying too hard to remind viewers that there's something going on.

Unfortunately, Jackie Chan's talents are wasted on the film. He plays Vanguard leader Tang Huanting, and he also participates in many of the action scenes. But he doesn't do all that much, and you get the sense that he would have been better used in another role (villain, maybe?). It's disappointing how Vanguard fails to make use of Chan effectively in the film, and just chucks him in action scenes to increase the number of warm bodies fighting.

Story continues

The variety of locations makes for interesting visuals, since the show goes from London to Africa and then to Dubai. You can see how it's supposed to be this globe-spanning plot that shows the scope of Vanguard's reach as well as the tremendous scale of the villain's plans. And true enough, it is a fairly grand, international production. But it doesn't work quite as well in the implementation because everyone speaks only Mandarin (Cantonese in some regions) or English. It tugs at your suspension of disbelief a fair bit, especially because the villains speak such heavily accented English. However, it's understandable given that it's marketed to a predominantly Chinese audience.

The scope doesn't come off as being quite that grand either. In fact, it often toggles between cartoony and world-threatening, especially with incongruous elements like gold-plated cars, villainous superweapons, lions and hyenas, and rubbing chilli padi in the eyes of villains. Oddly, the superweapon isn't half as threatening as the film makes it out to be, since it's thwarted almost too easily. Still, the movie makes a sincere attempt to excite and enthrall, so kudos to that.

Vanguard is bookended by incongruous Chinese New Year elements at the beginning and end – the movie was meant to be released earlier this year during the traditional CNY season. This might be a little jarring, since cinema-goers would be watching the movie long after the pandemic delayed its release.

But it serves its purpose as well, and makes for decent popcorn fare. A behind-the-scenes featurette accompanies the credits, so stay back for some interesting shots of how the action scenes were filmed (including the one where Jackie Chan nearly drowned).

Washington [US], September 9 (ANI): Northrop Grumman has named its next space station resupply ship after Dr Kalpana Chawla, an astronaut of India decent.

The ""S.S. Kalpana Chawla,"" Northrop Grumman's next Cygnus spacecraft to launch to the International Space Station, is christened in honor of the Columbia astronaut, company officials announced on Tuesday (September 8)

""Northrop Grumman is proud to name the NG-14 Cygnus spacecraft after former astronaut Kalpana Chawla. It is the company's tradition to name each Cygnus after an individual who has played a pivotal role in human spaceflight. Chawla was selected in honor of her prominent place in history as the first woman of Indian descent to go to space,"" Northrop Grumman said in a statement.

""Today we honor Kalpana Chawla, who made history at NASA as the first female astronaut of Indian descent. Her contributions to human spaceflight have had a lasting impact. Meet our next Cygnus vehicle, the S.S. Kalpana Chawla,"" the aerospace and defense technology company tweeted.

Northrop Grumman, NASA's resupply contractor further added, ""Liftoff is targeted for September 29 from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.""

The Cygnus spacecraft will deliver approximately 3,629 kg (8,000lb.) of cargo to the space station. The S.S. Kalpana Chawla will be launched into orbit from Virginia Space's Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) Wallops Island, Virginia.

Northrop Grumman will load critical cargo into S.S. Kalpana Chawla (Cygnus spacecraft), 24 hours before the scheduled launch. Upon arrival at the International Space Station, the cargo will be unloaded from Cygnus. Once the spacecraft departs the station, S.S. Kalpana Chawla will host the Spacecraft Fire Experiment -V (Saffire-V) to study the behavior of large-scale fires in microgravity after which it will perform a safe, destructive reentry into Earth's atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean.

Kalpana Chawla, the spacecraft's namesake, the path to becoming an astronaut began in Karnal, India. Chawla -- known to her friends as ""K.C."" -- knew that she wanted to be an aerospace engineer at an early age. She was influenced by watching the planes from the local flying clubs and by her father.

""Every once in a while,"" Chawla said, ""we'd ask my dad if we could get a ride in one of these planes. And, he did take us to the flying club and get us a ride in the Pushpak and a glider that the flying club had,"" the fallen astronaut often said in interviews.

She graduated from Tagore School, Karnal, India, in 1976 and received a bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering from India's Punjab Engineering College in 1982.

Then, she moved to the United States to go to graduate school at the University of Texas-Arlington, where she received a master's degree in aerospace engineering in 1984. Then, she moved to Boulder, Colo., to pursue a doctorate in aerospace engineering, which she received in 1988.

Her career with NASA began in 1988 when she went to work for the Ames Research Center in California. Chawla's work at Ames centered on powered-lift computational fluid dynamics, which involves aircraft like the Harrier.

After a brief career outside NASA, she returned as an astronaut candidate in December 1994. Her first flight was STS-87, the fourth U.S Microgravity Payload flight, on Space Shuttle Columbia from Nov. 19 to Dec. 5, 1997. She returned to space on Jan. 16, 2003, aboard Columbia for a 16-day research flight. The STS-107 crew conducted more than 80 experiments.

Chawla and her six STS-107 crewmates perished Feb. 1, 2003, over Texas as Columbia was re-entering Earth's atmosphere. (ANI)

It’s time to apply those same lessons to SDG 8, says ShareAction’s Simon Rawson.

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic unleashed economic turmoil, warning lights were already flashing about the challenges of achieving SDG 8: Sustainable economic growth and decent work for all.

Global growth was slowing and risks to workers across the world, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable, were on the rise. 16 million people remained victims of modern slavery.

Now, as we reflect on the fifth anniversary of the SDGs, and with 10 years to go to achieve the 2030 agenda, hundreds of millions of jobs look set to be lost as the global economy contracts in the worst recession since the Great Depression.

It is not only a drop in the number of jobs that is concerning. This will inevitably be accompanied by a fall in the quality of employment.

Following the financial crisis in 2008, the number of people in low-paid insecure work rose. The US Bureau of Labour Statistics calculated that, by 2017, 10% of workers relied on ‘alternative employment arrangements’ for their main job. And in the EU, between 2011 and 2016, most net new employment created was in non-standard forms of employment.

Only 30% of companies report whether they had identified any risks to workers’ rights in their tier one supply chains – even to report that none were identified. If oversight of companies' direct suppliers is so poor, how can there be any expectation of good work for the hundreds of millions of workers in tier two and beyond?

This year, garment factories and slaughter houses have been the site of coronavirus clusters as vulnerable, low-paid workers, unable to afford to take unpaid time off to self-isolate, work in conditions that are not COVID-safe.

Now, these workers are most likely to lose their livelihoods, with some 1.6 billion informal workers – many in global supply chains – at risk, according to the International Labour Organisation.

Responsible investors have an opportunity to ensure it is different this time.

Reflecting on investors’ response to climate change is instructive. While there is still some way to go to deliver the action we need, there are also things we can learn from how investors got to this point.

Despite the pandemic and the economic pressure that has come with it, climate action appears to be resilient and shareholder support for climate change resolutions at annual meetings rose by about half this year, according to Proxy Insight.

Today we have common metrics and reporting frameworks, such as those advanced by CDP and the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, we have accepted standards like those from the Climate Disclosures Standards Board and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, and we have clear goals, notably the Paris Agreement, all of which act as unifying objectives. These have enabled both investor and corporate action, and also driven consumer behaviour and regulation, which further reinforce progress.

While there has been much talk of the need for investors to focus on the ‘S of ESG’, in response to societal vulnerabilities that COVID-19 has exposed, in reality we are still a long way behind the climate movement.

Recent ShareAction research[SR1] found that while 76% of the world’s largest asset managers say they have a commitment to human rights in their policy documents, when you look closely, it becomes clear that these efforts do not go nearly far enough. Just 4% of managers have a dedicated policy on human rights.

We need to develop our system of metrics, reporting frameworks, standards and targets to respond rigorously and robustly to pressing social issues, such as decent work.

We may have some way to go on the ‘S of ESG’ to reach the movement we’ve started to see on climate, but there is nothing stopping us from doubling down on disclosure today. It played a critical role in advancing action to tackle climate change.

Since 2016, the Workforce Disclosure Initiative [SR2] (WDI) https://shareaction.org/wdi/ has been working to shape this system. It has developed a meaningful and comprehensive framework for salient workforce issues that stands to enable real impact in peoples’ lives. For example, it takes a broad definition of worker, including all types of employment, both in direct operations and in the supply chain – critical, since global supply chains account for 94% of workers.

The framework is also universal, or sector-agnostic, because crucial workforce issues are relevant in every single company.

With the backing of a diverse and growing coalition of investors, WDI calls on increasing numbers of the world’s biggest companies to disclose this information.

There are signs that this is working. Companies disclosing to the WDI make 23% more data available to the public than those that don't complete the survey. They also make progress over time, moving from being able to complete an average of 36% of the survey in the first year, to 40% in the second year and 48% in the third year.

And what companies already disclose is giving us insights into the challenges we face to achieving the aims of SDG 8.

The vast majority of companies report having a human rights due diligence process in place, but just over half provide data on how they monitor the implementation of their commitment to respect supply chain workers’ rights. Only 30% of companies report whether they had identified any risks to workers’ rights in their tier one supply chains – even to report that none were identified. If oversight of companies' direct suppliers is so poor, how can there be any expectation of good work for the hundreds of millions of workers in tier two and beyond?

We may have some way to go on the ‘S of ESG’ to reach the movement we’ve started to see on climate, but there is nothing stopping us from doubling down on disclosure today. It played a critical role in advancing action to tackle climate change. Just 38% of companies responding to the CDP supply chain survey for the first time report having an emissions reduction target in place. By the third year of responding this increased to 69%.

Only when we have data can we start to translate the SDG 8 targets into business commitments, like today’s Net Zero climate pledges. With a framework to measure against, companies could commit to become net positive contributors of decent work.

Workforce disclosure may be the step we need right now, to keep advancing good work and economic opportunity in this moment of global crisis.

Who are GAWU?

Ghana’s General Agricultural Workers’ Union (GAWU) is the nation’s biggest trade union organizing farmers and agricultural workers both in the formal and informal sectors of our country. GAWU has been working together with smallholder farmers and other non-wage rural workers since formation on the 9th of February, 1959.

We are currently working in over 200 communities across all the regions of Ghana. The Union is non-partisan and hence not affiliated to any political party in Ghana. The ultimate goal of GAWU is to organize Ghana’s agricultural workers in the formal and informal sectors and to champion the cause of agricultural workers through consistent empowerment, policy advocacy, and proper representation at the highest levels.

GAWU is one of the affiliates of The International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers’ Associations (IUF), an international federation of trade unions. The IUF is composed of 425 affiliated trade unions in 127 countries representing over 10 million workers. GAWU joined the IUF in 1994.

As GAWU, we pride ourselves in the over 60 years of advocating, promoting and negotiating for Decent Work in the Agricultural Sector of Ghana.

What is Decent Work?

Before there was a United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in 2012, there was a GAWU that was fighting alongside, advocating for, and negotiating together with Ghana’s farmers for a better economic standing from their daily work.

That is where our pride comes from. It’s from the FACT that the many decades-long activities of Ghana’s General Agricultural Workers’ Union (GAWU) ties in very strongly with Goal 8 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals: Decent Work and Economic Growth.

The 4 Pillars of Decent Work illustrate its true meaning.

Dignity Equality Fair Income Work Safety

Going by the above definition, the United Nations educate us that no country is immune to a lack of Decent Work. Everyone is entitled to Decent Work. The jobs and economy of the future will be urban. It is estimated that about 60% of the world’s population will live in cities by 2030. This highlights why proper care and advocacy for our agricultural farmers, who are predominantly rural folk, should be prioritised.

Agriculture in Ghana is known to be the main source of work for those in our rural communities. A significant portion of Agricultural activities also involves the formal sector. Access to Decent Work for those in Agriculture is directly correlated to national development because Agriculture remains the backbone of Ghana. By extension, the work of GAWU affects each and every Ghanaian.

Our work towards the Decent Work agenda is cut out for us. About 45%-90% of the world population already operate within the informal economy. Worldwide, there are over 150million children in Child Labour. Women earn anywhere between 4%-36% less than men. All these are to be tackled if Decent Work is to be attainable for all. Many local governments all over the world have already taken measures to ensure that the solutions to these challenges are being worked at.

GAWU and the Decent Work Agenda.

GAWU has extensive experience in seeking to enhance the right to organisation and collective bargaining in Ghana. GAWU addresses the rights deficits in the world of work in the rural areas by seeking to extend and grow social protection to the benefit of rural informal economy workers, especially women. We also enhance the participation of the rural working people in decisions that implicate their quest for decent work and life.

One of GAWU’s aims is to tackle the manifold manifestations of Decent Work deficits in the rural areas of Ghana. We do this through the further consolidation of the organisation of small-scale producers and champion their focused pursuit of furthering their Decent Work agenda. We build on our organisations by focusing on communities in all the Districts we operate in, so as to work towards developing social dialogue between the organised district level structures and the decentralised governmental structures, even including the district Directorates of the Ministry for Food and Agriculture.

GAWU uses its recognition at the national level to leverage the processes of establishing district level social dialogue mechanisms. GAWU’s representation at various national structures and its leading role in the Food Security Policy Advocacy Network (FOODSPAN) greatly contributes to their establishment in an inclusive manner.

In relation to the Decent Work agenda, GAWU has already been promoting productivity, employment creation and income-generating activities among the rural producers through its collaborations with organisations like the FNV. We feel that the time has come to scale-up, expand geographical coverage and consciously pursue the mutually reinforcing strategic objectives of the Decent Work Agenda, in a manner that throws up more lessons for the extension of trade union organization to the rural and informal economy.

In a move to adapt to the dynamic nature of modern economic trends and challenges, GAWU also appointed the first-ever Business Advisor to the Union. This move was to improve the understanding of and reduce the vulnerability of farmers in their entrepreneurial endeavours. There have been a number of Forums held by the Business Advisor in conjunction with GAWU that help educate the farmers on Fair Market Practices, alongside relevant discussions on market policies, modern innovation, and learning from one another.

The Leadership

Leadership in GAWU has over the decades been vital to the creation of our successful strategies and internal cultures. It, therefore, goes without saying that a strong leader has been instrumental in GAWU’s recent strides towards materially contributing to Goal 8 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Currently, the General Secretary of GAWU is Mr Edward Kareweh, a renowned trade union leader that has risen through the ranks of GAWU, occupying the roles of Local Union Secretary, Regional Industrial Relations Officer, Head of Industrial Relations, Deputy General Secretary of the Union, and now General Secretary of GAWU.

Mr Kareweh draws on his experience as a seasoned organiser, negotiator and a farmer himself. Mr Kareweh has been involved in various policy discussions on the implications of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), World Trade Organisation (WTO), World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for Africa’s development, particularly Ghana. He has been part of Ghana’s Trade Experts’ team that worked at the ECOWAS level on the EPA between the European Union (EU) and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries.

Mr Edward Kareweh is an alumnus of the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa, where he obtained a Master’s degree in Industrial Sociology in 2008. He had earlier on obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics and Sociology from the University of Cape Coast in 2006. He also studied for a Diploma in Labour Studies from the same University in 2001.

In his quest to further improve his capacity to champion the cause of workers, the vulnerable and the excluded in society at large, Mr Kareweh is currently pursuing the Professional Law Course at the Ghana School of Law after obtaining an LLB Degree from the Mountcrest University College. He is also a lecturer in Labour Studies with the School for Development Studies at the University of Cape Coast.

It is important to list out his merits, for this same Mr Edward Kareweh, the current GAWU General Secretary, was elected in 2016 as the Titular for the Agricultural Workers Trade Group (AWTG) of The International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers’ Associations (IUF) in West Africa. He coordinates the work of the Group.

The 3rd National Farmers Delegates' Conference (29th Oct.) and The 11th Quadrennial Delegate Conference (30th Oct.)

In recognition of the over six decades of immense contribution to the quality of life of Ghana’s agricultural workers, the Theme for 3rd National Farmers Delegates' Conference and the 11th Quadrennial Delegate Conference is: ""60 years of Promoting Decent work In Agriculture, the Role of Farmers"".

GAWU is one of few Unions with membership across the country that organises both formal and informal workers. International Labour Rights Forum recently conferred on GAWU the 2020 Labour Rights Defender's Award in respect of work done by the union on Child Labour in Cocoa. This is evidence of how vital the work of GAWU has been in the lives of the agricultural workers in Ghana.

Special Guest will be the Minister for Employment and Labour Relations, Hon. Ignatius Baffour Awuah. The Venue will be Noda Hotel in Kumasi, on 28th-30th October 2020. COVID Protocols will be observed. I’ll keep you updated!

However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Particularly, we will be paying attention to XTEK's ROE today.

Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.

View our latest analysis for XTEK

How To Calculate Return On Equity?

The formula for ROE is:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for XTEK is:

2.1% = AU$303k ÷ AU$14m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2020).

The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.02 in profit.

What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?

Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.

XTEK's Earnings Growth And 2.1% ROE

As you can see, XTEK's ROE looks pretty weak. Not just that, even compared to the industry average of 10%, the company's ROE is entirely unremarkable. However, the moderate 17% net income growth seen by XTEK over the past five years is definitely a positive. Therefore, the growth in earnings could probably have been caused by other variables. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.

Story continues

As a next step, we compared XTEK's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 17% in the same period.

The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is XTEK fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.

Is XTEK Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?

Summary

On the whole, we do feel that XTEK has some positive attributes. Even in spite of the low rate of return, the company has posted impressive earnings growth as a result of reinvesting heavily into its business. While we won't completely dismiss the company, what we would do, is try to ascertain how risky the business is to make a more informed decision around the company. Our risks dashboard would have the 4 risks we have identified for XTEK.

We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Realty Income's ROE in this article.

Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.

Check out our latest analysis for Realty Income

How Is ROE Calculated?

The formula for ROE is:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Realty Income is:

4.7% = US$486m ÷ US$10b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2020).

The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.05 in profit.

What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?

So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.

A Side By Side comparison of Realty Income's Earnings Growth And 4.7% ROE

On the face of it, Realty Income's ROE is not much to talk about. Yet, a closer study shows that the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 5.0%. Even so, Realty Income has shown a fairly decent growth in its net income which grew at a rate of 13%. Considering the moderately low ROE, it is quite possible that there might be some other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.

Story continues

As a next step, we compared Realty Income's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 14% in the same period.

Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is O fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value has everything you need to know.

Is Realty Income Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?

Realty Income seems to be paying out most of its income as dividends judging by its three-year median payout ratio of 85%, meaning the company retains only 15% of its income. However, this is typical for REITs as they are often required by law to distribute most of their earnings. In spite of this, the company was able to grow its earnings by a fair bit, as we saw above.

Additionally, Realty Income has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 79%. As a result, Realty Income's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 5.2% for future ROE.

Conclusion

Overall, we feel that Realty Income certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Namely, its high earnings growth. We do however feel that the earnings growth number could have been even higher, had the company been reinvesting more of its earnings and paid out less dividends. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

Among the biologics, its anti-TNFs (~68%) have captured the major portion of the market owing to well-established efficacy, safety profile, physicians familiarities, and their long presence in the market. Among the anti-TNFs, etanercept and adalimumab were holding around 50% of the total in the 7MM market share in 2017.

were holding around 50% of the total in the 7MM market share in 2017. Among the currently approved advanced classes, the growth of anti-TNF, T cell inhibitor, and B cell Inhibitor are expected to be relatively flat mainly due to the entry of biosimilars which ultimately leads to erosion of sales value.

As per DelveInsight's analysts the JAK inhibitor class expected to grow with a significant CAGR during the forecast period owing to market penetration of already approved products, entry and adoption of emerging drugs, and increase in physicians familiarities, and placing of JAK as a treatment option in the first line.

The Biosimilars started entering the United States and EU (i.e. Remicade biosimilars) and due to this sales value has started declining and the impact will be more pronounced when biosimilars/ generics of some blockbuster drugs like Humira (i.e. 2023 in the US), Xeljanz (i.e. 2025 in the US) will going to hit into the market and this will impact the growth of RA market significantly.

Among the recently launched and upcoming therapies, upadacitinib and filgotinib have the potential to impact the market owing to more selective oral JAK1 inhibitors and better clinical profile compared to already approved JAKi. Although upadacitinib will have a slight edge over filgotinib owing to order of entry, slightly better efficacy data, and recent FDA rejection of filgotinib.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, progressive, inflammatory autoimmune disease and is characterized by chronic pain and joint destruction that usually progress from distal to more proximal joints. Even after years of research, the cause of rheumatoid arthritis is still unknown. Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms include joint pain, stiffness, swelling, and decreased movement of the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis is done by a combination of patient's symptoms, results of doctor's examination, assessment of risk factors, family history, a joint assessment by ultrasound sonography, and assessment of laboratory markers such as elevated levels of CRP and ESR in serum and detection of Rheumatoid Arthritis -specific autoantibodies. Rheumatoid Arthritis has a predilection to affect women, that's why the incidence and prevalence rates in women for RA is 2- 3 times more as compared to men. The total prevalent cases of Rheumatoid Arthritis in the 7MM were observed to be 4,356,793 in 2017 which are estimated to rise during the study period (2017–2030). The United States accounted for the highest number of cases in the 7MM.

Rheumatoid Arthritis Treatment Market

The Rheumatoid Arthritis treatment paradigm includes medicine, supportive treatment and surgery. Currently, there are three primary treatment options for severe and advancing Rheumatoid Arthritis which include DMARDs, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids. Rheumatoid market consists of many different drug target agents forming different drug classes. Conventional DMARDs are a group of drugs (i.e. methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine) that have been shown to affect the underlying cause of RA by damping down over-activity of the immune system, which helps to ease pain, swelling and stiffness, and prevent changes occurring within the joint. Among csDMARDS, methotrexate (MTX) is considered as a part of the first treatment strategy. MTX remains the anchor drug in RA; along with usage as monotherapy, it is also the basis for combination therapies, either with GC or with other csDMARDs, bDMARDs or tsDMARDs.Patients refractory to csDMARDS or with severe symptoms usually treated with a wide variety of biologics DMARDs classes like anti-TNF, T cell inhibitor, B cell Inhibitor, Interleukin Inhibitors and targeted synthetic DMARDs like JAK Inhibitors. The drug classes include blockbusters Anti-TNF (Etanercept, Infliximab, Adalimumab, Certolizumab-pegol) JAK inhibitors (tofa citinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib, Peficitinob) B-cell inhibitors (Rituximab), Interleukin Inhibitors (Tocilizumab, Sarilumab), T-cell inhibitors (Abatacept), DMARDs, other novel inhibitors, etc.

Biological DMARDs showed promising results in treating RA patients and market penetration is expected to be more in the future and this class is expected to drive the growth of the market. Oral classes such as JAKi and upcoming BTKi due to patient convenient RoA are also expected to contribute to the Rheumatoid Arthritis market growth. The market for Rheumatoid Arthritis possesses fierce competition but still, there is a high demand for new therapies having similar or better efficacy, however, improved safety profile as well as patient adherence. Because of high competition, the new entrants are expected to be met with some resistance and will experience slow uptake, as the market is currently dominated by the anti-TNFs and entry of biosimilars will further pose significant challenges to new and upcoming treatment. It goes without saying that the dynamics of the Rheumatoid Arthritis market is expected to change because of the launch of emerging therapies, companies like GlaxoSmithKline [Otilimab (MOR103/GSK3196165)], Taisho Pharmaceutical [Ozoralizumab (TS-152)], Gilead and Galapagos NV [Filgotinib (GS-6034; Jyseleca)], and R-Pharm (Olokizumab) with their key candidates are in registrational or late clinical-stage. In addition to this, companies like Merck KGaA (Evobrutinib), Pfizer (PF-06650833, and PF-06651600), Roche (Fenebrutinib), and several others in phase II clinical development stage with their investigational candidates.

As many potential therapies are being investigated for the management of Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is for sure that the treatment space will experience a significant impact during the forecast period of 2020–2030.

But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Medibank Private's ROE today.

Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.

See our latest analysis for Medibank Private

How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?

Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Medibank Private is:

17% = AU$316m ÷ AU$1.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2020).

The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every A$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated A$0.17 in profit.

What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?

So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.

A Side By Side comparison of Medibank Private's Earnings Growth And 17% ROE

To begin with, Medibank Private seems to have a respectable ROE. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 9.5% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. However, we are curious as to how the high returns still resulted in flat growth for Medibank Private in the past five years. Therefore, there could be some other aspects that could potentially be preventing the company from growing. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.

Story continues

As a next step, we compared Medibank Private's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 4.2% in the same period.

Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for MPL? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.

Is Medibank Private Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?

The high three-year median payout ratio of 83% (meaning, the company retains only 17% of profits) for Medibank Private suggests that the company's earnings growth was miniscule as a result of paying out a majority of its earnings.

In addition, Medibank Private has been paying dividends over a period of five years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 87%. As a result, Medibank Private's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 21% for future ROE.

Conclusion

On the whole, we do feel that Medibank Private has some positive attributes. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE. Bear in mind, the company reinvests a small portion of its profits, which means that investors aren't reaping the benefits of the high rate of return. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

( ) started a new chapter on Thursday with incoming chief executive Ken Murphy starting his tenure at the grocer.

He replaces Dave Lewis, who announced his shock departure a year ago.

Lewis said the decision to step down was “a personal one"" and that he believed “the tenure of the CEO should be finite"".

The idea had already been floated behind closed doors, and in fact, the board immediately announced the appointment of Murphy, poached from the role of chief commercial officer and president of global brands at Walgreens Boots Alliance.

Murphy has big shoes to fill after Lewis turned Tesco around, led a corporate restructuring and rebuilt the balance sheet.

External woes

“Whereas Mr Lewis faced into a tsunami of internal challenge, he passes a leadership ‘ball’ onto his successor at the right pace, direction and height,” noted analysts at Shore Capital.

“Whilst this is so, it would be incorrect to suggest that Mr Murphy does not face challenges.

""His issues, however, are largely external, now that Tesco is a well-oiled operating machine and considerably more solvent, something that should be notably enhanced assuming that the Asia disposal completes before Christmas 2020”.

If anything, what Murphy is about to face is not unique to Tesco but a case of shared woes across the retail sector notable the economic recession, the coronavirus crisis and fragile UK-EU relations.

Internal strategy

Looking at the internal strategy, the market has been wondering when Tesco Bank can be offloaded, whether the price match is sustainable and how retail underlying margins can be protected with the move to online.

Shareholders are not keen on the bank, which is expected to swing to a full-year loss of between £175-200mln from last year’s profit of £193mln due to potentially higher bad debts amid a drop in global GDP.

“There’s a lot of capital tied up in the bank and it only delivers modest upstream benefits to the parent company,” fund manager Richard Buxton, of Tesco shareholder Jupiter, told the Evening Standard.

“The regulatory burden and oversight that’s needed with owning a bank is huge. It would be better that a traditional bank owned it and Tesco supplied the customers.”

As for the coronavirus, the ‘Big 4’ supermarkets are benefitting from the increase in online penetration in the UK market accelerated by the COVID-19 crisis, which is leaving discounters behind due to the operational challenges of establishing an e-commerce platform.

""In the short-term, the strong customer metrics, sustained sales growth and substantially lower COVID-19 costs point to upside risks to full-year estimates, while the approval of the Asian deal in October or November should return £5bn to investors in the second half,"" UBS analysts said.

A new board

Murphy will also be leading the FTSE 100 company in the absence of Charles Wilson, managing director of Booker and “one of the industry’s true leaders”, according to Shore Capital, who is set to leave Tesco by the end of February 2021 and will be replaced by Andrew Yaxley.

Chief financial officer Alan Stewart is also due to leave no later than April 2021 but no successor has been selected yet.

“Mr Lewis has left the business with it in good shape, with a 51p special dividend and enhanced solvency, particularly around the pension responsibilities, to come,” Shore Capital concluded.

“The grocery retail sector market opportunity is enhanced by social change, notably working from home, and Tesco has seized the online food opportunity well; doubling capacity in a capital-light manner and seeing the channel turn to profit.”

Shares in Tesco were trading 1% lower at 211.19p on Thursday afternoon, the same level of March lows after a rollercoaster few months, including a peak of 248p in May.","Lewis said the decision to step down was “a personal one"" and that he believed “the tenure of the CEO should be finite"".

43,https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/earning-a-decent-living-claudio-farrugia.822286,"Sun, 04 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",Times of Malta,Earning a decent living,"The recently published survey results of the National Statistics Office (NSO)’s Statistics on Income and Living Conditions showed a widening gap of income inequality. Prompted by these poor results, the government hastily announced that it had commissioned a report on the basic living income. Hopefully, this report will not end up collecting dust.

The NSO survey revealed that in Malta, almost one in five persons is seriously struggling with meeting daily requirements for survival and inclusion. Moreover, almost one in three families cannot afford at least a week’s holiday away from home once a year.

The survey results also show that the number of households with dependent children that are at risk of poverty and social inclusion keeps increasing.

A report entitled Wage Income Distribution and Mobility in Malta, issued by the Central Bank in 2018 concluded that in Malta, wage mobility, that is, the ability of a person to increase his income regardless of overall wage growth, is very low.

Unlike the national minimum wage, which is set through a government-set mechanism on an annual basis, the living wage is an informal benchmark based on how much a worker/family needs to get by.

Pope Francis often reminds us that each person is responsible to care for and assist those less fortunate

Since Pope Leo XIII’s influential 1891 encyclical, Rerum Novarum, every pope has strongly advocated the principle that wages should offer adequate income for the family. In his encyclical Quadragesimo Anno, Pope Pius XI promoted the concept that all workers had the right to receive sufficient wages to support themselves and provide for their families.

This concept was influenced by the writings of a contemporary priest-economist Heinrich Pesch. Pesch’s ideal was based on what he had termed ‘solidarism’ where economic systems should promote social justice and prosperity may be attained by everyone.

Free-market advocates object to the government dictating what employers pay their employees. They also caution that the introduction of the living wage could result in job losses, affecting mostly those who are on lower wages. Supporters of a living wage argue that substandard wages come at a cost to businesses, due to high staff turnover, constant recruitment, training costs, customer service and lower consumption.

The concept of the living wage has had its fair share of debate in the local scene.

In 2010, the Malta Employers’ Association published a position paper. Some of the arguments that it put forward, such as avoiding the welfare trap and discouraging low productivity, were sensible cautions. However, drawing their conclusions on the compensation of state employees meant that they left a large proportion of the workforce unrepresented.

In 2016, the alliance Kampanja Paga Minima Diċenti lobbied for a more realistic minimum wage. They organised several awareness events. However, despite the fact that the number of people falling below the poverty lines keeps increasing, the alliance seems to have lost steam.

Caritas Malta has been lobbying for the creation of a living wage for several years. It has carried out serious research into what constitutes a living wage. Sadly, their voice seems to be lost in the wilderness.

Movements in other countries, such as the Living Wage Foundation in the UK, are highly active in lobbying for support both from employers and the government in securing a decent living wage to workers.

Although there is unanimous agreement that education and skills are crucial to securing a better income for a family, there will always be people who fall behind. Pope Francis often reminds us that each person is responsible to care for and assist those less fortunate.

The living wage is a big leap in reducing inequality and lifting families out of poverty. In setting the living wage, a balance needs to be struck between the responsibilities of the individual, the employer and the state.

Claudio Farrugia, Member, Catholic Voices Network","Prompted by these poor results, the government hastily announced that it had commissioned a report on the basic living income.
The concept of the living wage has had its fair share of debate in the local scene.
It has carried out serious research into what constitutes a living wage.

Maria Mexi

When the platform economy launched a decade ago, proponents claimed it would revolutionise the world of work. Optimistic expectations proved febrile, however, as positive stories have not taken off. On the contrary, the companies at its heart face severe criticism over inadequate employment protections (unfair work), freeriding on conventional businesses (unfair competition) and inadequate consumerprotection. A big reset is necessary, as the balance has tipped too far in the platforms’ direction.

People choose such work because they value more freedom and autonomy, digital platforms say. Yet there is strong evidencethat freedom and autonomy do not always reach their apogee there. Excessive surveillance through algorithmic controls, combined with reduced bargaining power, effectively undermines the freedom the firms tout and their workers desire.

This power imbalance is also manifest in the arbitrary way platforms act to build profit on data generated by workers for free. The companies need to manifest a compelling vision of data justice, providing fair compensation and workers’ control of the terms of their engagement with data.

Fundamental imbalances

Core to these fundamental imbalances are freeriding mindsets, embedded deep within the platform economy. Throughout the years, in markets across the globe, platforms have been benefiting from freeriding on the security provided by conventional employment.

The pandemic has further exposed this dark side. During the early lockdowns, digital platforms successfully externalised responsibilities on to governments for financial support and on to platform workers for their own protection. Some have even increased surveillance of workers during the pandemic—with the potential this will become ‘normalised’ in its aftermath.

Indispensable reading!"" Polly Toynbee Columnist for The Guardian Thank you very much for your interest! Now please check your email to confirm your subscription.

As certain platform-type practices degrade the norms that define decent employment and responsible business conduct, we need to look at where an economy dominated by an ever-growing class of digital freeriders—and an underclass of insecure ‘freelances’—will take us. We need public debate about the limits of platform markets, reasoning together about the right ways of embedding the platform economy in the digital age, distilling what principles governing work we want to protect rather than let perish.

Such an agenda of decent digiwork would engender a robust, democratic dialogue about the moral foundations of the platform economy—with the primary goal a more equitable and engaged society, which rebalances power in digital workplaces.

Mutual interdependence

Securing decent work is above all a call for political action and social activism, recognising our shared responsibilities and mutual interdependence. As we report in a recent International Labour Organization research brief on social-dialogue outcomes reached globally during the early phase of the pandemic, there has been only a vague focus on platform workers and other groups particularly vulnerable to the impacts of the Covid-19 crisis—such as women, migrants and informal workers.

Yet vulnerability has no borders; nor has solidarity. As platform workers’ precarity has grown during the pandemic, we can no longer afford indifference to the many pariahs of the digital economy. Nor can we consume platform services without regard to effect. The evidence calls for new types of vigilance, where institutions and citizens alike have a role to play.

Mobilisation on the part of social partners—which have valuable, sector-specific knowledge—is also vital to level the playing-field, by bringing pressure for more fine-tuned regulation or by pushing digital platforms to come to thenegotiation table. This in turn makes it critical that we enable platform workers to have a voice at work.

Governments and international agencies also need to put in place effective frameworks of due diligence on labour issues, covering the platform economy, and support a formal role for labour and civil societyin these frameworks. In the case of globalised crowdwork platforms, such arrangements can lead to rebalancing power asymmetries in their cross-border operations. All these issues will soon be put on the table more intensely, as telecommuting and virtual service delivery are triggering an acceleration of the globalisation of services—in which crowdwork platforms play an important role.

Pressing platforms to adopt voluntary codes of good conduct is also important for addressing imbalances. In the long run this could bring together existing initiatives in a broader and coherent global framework, which could be actively endorsed by organisations such as the ILO and the European Union. While voluntary codes are no ‘silver bullet’ for fixing problems, they can have a more immediate impact than ‘hard’ law, which tends to move more slowly.

Transparency and justice

The time has come also to embed transparency and justice in labour markets and societies increasingly defined by data. Workers’ demands for data compensation are likely to become one of the most confrontational issues with platforms in the years to come. New trade union strategies will be needed to push forward a data-as-labour agenda, which could enable ‘data labourers’ to organise and collectively bargain with platforms. All this requires, on one hand, global trade union co-operation and, on the other, country-specific action.

Today, as the platform economy evolves, governments worldwide struggle to put in place far-reaching solutions, with international and multilateral co-ordination weak. Considering the cross-border aspects and heterogeneity of platform work and markets, a global observatory dedicated to the platform economy could strengthen synergies and add policy coherence.

Such an observatory could be entrusted with monitoring and providing country-level support on such issues as working conditions, algorithmic management and control, or cross-border social-security co-ordination. It could be administered by an existing international institution with a strong normative labour-standards agenda, such as the ILO.

One of the most worrying tendencies of our time is the diffusion of the undesirable mindsets and attitudes that govern most platform-type work and markets—by their very DNA less equitable and inclusive—into other spheres of life, devaluing the solidarity on which democratic citizenship depends. There is no bigger challenge today than the need to offset the risk of a platform economy gradually becoming a ‘platform society’. We can still reverse this but it will take a lot of work—individual and collective.

An agenda of decent digiwork is as much about identifying the agents of transformation as it is about articulating new ideas. It is, above all else, about people and their aspirations for a future of work which takes a big turn for the better.

As most would know, long-term fundamentals have a strong correlation with market price movements, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. In this article, we decided to focus on Kronos Worldwide's ROE.

ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.

Check out our latest analysis for Kronos Worldwide

How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?

Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Kronos Worldwide is:

7.9% = US$63m ÷ US$802m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2020).

The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.08 in profit.

Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?

We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.

A Side By Side comparison of Kronos Worldwide's Earnings Growth And 7.9% ROE

On the face of it, Kronos Worldwide's ROE is not much to talk about. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 10%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. However, we we're pleasantly surprised to see that Kronos Worldwide grew its net income at a significant rate of 26% in the last five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.

Story continues

We then compared Kronos Worldwide's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 7.3% in the same period.

Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Kronos Worldwide's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.

Is Kronos Worldwide Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?

Kronos Worldwide has a three-year median payout ratio of 49% (where it is retaining 51% of its income) which is not too low or not too high. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the high growth we discussed above, it looks like Kronos Worldwide is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.

Besides, Kronos Worldwide has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 101% over the next three years. However, Kronos Worldwide's future ROE is expected to rise to 12% despite the expected increase in the company's payout ratio. We infer that there could be other factors that could be driving the anticipated growth in the company's ROE.

Conclusion

In total, it does look like Kronos Worldwide has some positive aspects to its business. Despite its low rate of return, the fact that the company reinvests a very high portion of its profits into its business, no doubt contributed to its high earnings growth. While we won't completely dismiss the company, what we would do, is try to ascertain how risky the business is to make a more informed decision around the company.

An at-home wine and cheese tasting experience launched by a Greater Manchester former bar owner has seen 500% growth during the pandemic.

Carl Peters is owner of Decent Drop, and just before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, he was about to sign a deal to open a new bar in Altrincham.

But he paused that deal, and instead went about setting up his new business, which involved ""bringing some version of a bar experience to people's homes"".

Within four months, Carl said he has seen ""unprecedented growth"" - with orders increasing 500% on average month-on-month. He's also had celebrity customers including BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker.

He said: “As for many others, the pandemic was a real spanner in the works for my original business plans, but I then realised it was an opportunity to start something new. I wanted to ensure that the good folks of Great Britain continued to consume great drinks and have a great social experience, despite the restrictions.

“We’ve already seen an amazing response and our Zoom calls have been busy with customers really enjoying the tastings. I then realised that there was another angle to the tastings – private and office parties. Every bar I’ve ever worked in, or owned, has always had a great ‘after work’ crowd and I realised that with office life looking a little different, people may be missing out on the social aspect of their work environment.

“Decent Drop has already proven the perfect way to get a work team together for a virtual social and we have now witnessed a big appetite for our online tastings from folks who work together and are kind of missing each other, sometimes more than they would like to admit.""

Available across the UK, Decent Drop offers a curated menu of six wines, paired with six cheeses sent to customers who are then invited to join an interactive Zoom tasting session or host their own wine and cheese night with their friends and family.

Mr Peters said he intends to build on this continued growth and is now gearing up for a season of virtual office Christmas parties.

He said the 'private tasting' option is proving to be the ideal platform for client engagement, particularly in the legal and financial services sectors.

""The experience serves as a way of keeping in touch with clients in an informal way and as a replacement for the typical social and business development events that people would usually be attending at this time of year,"" Mr Peters said.

He added: “The Christmas parties are filling up our diary for the coming months and although we want nothing more than for the bar industry to be back on its feet, we recognise that the restrictions are making large parties difficult to arrange.

“What’s more, because we offer the public tastings each week, our vouchers are a great Christmas gift for team members who can then choose to purchase a tasting kit for a time to suit them.

“Our main aim with Decent Drop is to bring a unique experience to those who may not have tried this kind of thing before. We wanted to ensure an offering that was both fun and informative and could serve as a kind of ‘night out’ from your living room.”","Sign up to FREE email alerts from BusinessLive North West Invalid Email Something went wrong, please try again later.

Ane Aranguiz

After copious debate, on October 28th the European Commission finally launched the draft directive on minimum wages. Much has been said about this initiative, including on the conundrum of EU-level competence, the threshold to assess the adequacy of minimum wages and the need to protect the growing mass of precarious workers highlighted by the coronavirus crisis. Less attention has been paid to whether (and how) to combine minimum wages with other social-protection measures, to ensure adequate income protection for all and tackle poverty and social exclusion effectively.

Herwig Verschueren

Research shows that steps towards income regulation in Europe should take a broad scope—including minimum wages, yes, but also increasing the take-home pay of low-wage earners and social-security benefits and providing a minimum-income protection for jobless households. An approach combining these different strands is needed for an effective framework providing coherent and comprehensive social protection, which guarantees that ‘everyone lacking sufficient resources has the right to adequate minimum income benefits ensuring a life in dignity at all stages of life’—as principle 14 of the European Pillar of Social Rights requires.

Anne van Lancker

The Covid-19 pandemic has ‘punched a hole’ in already weakened social-protection safety-nets, as recently acknowledged by the Council of the EU, which invited the commission to ‘initiate an update of the Union framework to effectively support and complement the policies of Member States on national minimum income protection’. In an expert study, we presented arguments in favour of a framework directive on minimum income which would complement the commission proposal on minimum wages and the council recommendation on access to social protection by establishing an adequate minimum income in general.

There are compelling reasons—normative, political and functional—for the EU to develop a legally-binding instrument. Among others, a minimum-income directive would contribute to the social cohesion and upward convergence which the commissioner for jobs and social right, Nicholas Schmit, is hoping to achieve with the initiative on minimum wages. It would, moreover, give a boost to the legitimacy of the EU by guaranteeing the citizen’s right to an adequate standard of living.

Legal basis

But that the union has reasons to act does not necessarily mean it can, in terms of its competences. A logical legal basis for an instrument on minimum income would be the EU competences in combating social exclusion under article 153(1)(j) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The EU is however limited to actions of co-operation on this basis, precluding a binding instrument.

Cutting-edge thinking straight to your inbox ""Social Europe publishes thought-provoking articles on the big political and economic issues of our time analysed from a European viewpoint. Indispensable reading!"" Polly Toynbee Columnist for The Guardian Thank you very much for your interest! Now please check your email to confirm your subscription.

Some have argued that article 153(1)(c), on social security and social protection for workers, could serve as the legal basis. But its personal scope, applying only to workers, is too narrow for a minimum-income directive to live up to the right enshrined in principle 14 of the EPSR.

Instead, a combination of article 153(1)(h), on the integration of those excluded from the labour market, and article 175, on social cohesion, could accommodate a robust instrument spanning the social and the cohesion objectives of the union and covering all persons at all stages of life as proclaimed by the EPSR. Since the objectives of these two provisions are complementary, a legal instrument would seek a single goal—to improve the living standards of the EU population. A dual approach is possible as long as the instrument has a shared objective and the procedures for the use of the two competences are compatible (Titanium dioxide case).

An instrument on these bases would require an ordinary legislative procedure (the Council of the EU and the European Parliament co-legislating) and be adopted by qualified-majority voting, instead of unanimity. This would increase the chances of a directive being agreed, because of the lower threshold and given the parliament has supported minimum-income protection in the past.

‘Core standards’

An instrument on minimum income would also have to comply with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. All member states have some sort of minimum-income scheme in place (though most are inadequate) and previous soft-law measures have been insufficient to ensure a minimum income guaranteeing a life of dignity.

A directive in the form of a framework would disavow a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach and recognise that any initiative on minimum income at the European level would have to be country-specific. The content of the instrument should thus be limited to establishing ‘core standards’ (based on the at-risk-of-poverty threshold and contextualised with reference budgets) for member states, to develop minimum-income schemes which can effectively improve the living standards of the population as well as secure procedural and transparency requirements.

To ensure its feasibility and prospective enforcement, a framework directive on minimum income should include a link to EU funding, which could finance (part of) the costs of implementation, particularly for the ‘poorer’ member states. It could mimic the proposal on minimum wages and include important links to, for example, the European Social Fund Plus or the new Recovery and Resilience Facility. This could reduce the financial costs and potential deadweight effects of a minimum-income scheme with such a broad coverage.

The directive should establish a monitoring system to supervise member states’ performance. Again as with the proposed directive on minimum wages, this could be included in the European Semester. Not only would this minimise the administrative burden for member states, but it would ensure that minimum income and minimum wages were aligned.

Previous research has shown that low minimum wages act as a glass ceiling for benefits such a minimum income. Equally, there should be a clear positive hierarchy between the level of minimum wages and of minimum income, so integration to the labour market for those who can work is encouraged. As such, it is essential to conceive the efforts towards an EU framework directive on minimum income in relation to the broader picture of decent incomes for all.","The European Commission proposal on minimum wages does not exhaust the need to ensure minimum incomes for all.

As most would know, long-term fundamentals have a strong correlation with market price movements, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Specifically, we decided to study Atmos Energy's ROE in this article.

Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.

Check out our latest analysis for Atmos Energy

How Is ROE Calculated?

ROE can be calculated by using the formula:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Atmos Energy is:

8.9% = US$601m ÷ US$6.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2020).

The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.09 in profit.

What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?

Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.

A Side By Side comparison of Atmos Energy's Earnings Growth And 8.9% ROE

At first glance, Atmos Energy's ROE doesn't look very promising. Yet, a closer study shows that the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 8.9%. Having said that, Atmos Energy has shown a modest net income growth of 13% over the past five years. Given the slightly low ROE, it is likely that there could be some other aspects that are driving this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.

Story continues

As a next step, we compared Atmos Energy's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 7.4%.

Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Atmos Energy is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.

Is Atmos Energy Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?

Atmos Energy has a three-year median payout ratio of 48%, which implies that it retains the remaining 52% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.

Besides, Atmos Energy has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 51% of its profits over the next three years. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 9.0%.

Conclusion

On the whole, we do feel that Atmos Energy has some positive attributes. Despite its low rate of return, the fact that the company reinvests a very high portion of its profits into its business, no doubt contributed to its high earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.
