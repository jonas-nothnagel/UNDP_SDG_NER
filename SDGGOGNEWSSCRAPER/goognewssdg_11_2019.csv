The companies are working on this transition with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a UK-registered charity whose mission is to accelerate the shift to a circular economy. The companies that made the pledge are behind many household consumer brands and include: Amcor, Ecover, Evian, L’Oréal, Mars, Marks & Spencer, PepsiCo, The Coca-Cola Company, Unilever, Walmart, and Werner & Mertz. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates that the 11 companies making the pledge are responsible for six million tonnes of plastic packaging every year.

The companies announced their pledge at the launch of the WEF Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE). The platform is open to companies, organizations, and governments to create innovative partnerships for decoupling economic growth from resource use. Paul Polman, CEO, Unilever, called on the consumer goods industry to abandon the linear “take-make-dispose” model of consumption and turn to a truly circular model that emits no waste.

The CEO of Unilever called on the consumer goods industry to abandon the linear “take-make-dispose” model of consumption and turn to a truly circular model that emits no waste.

In the lead-up to Davos, Coca-Cola announced its goal of collecting and recycling “the equivalent” of every bottle or can that it sells by 2030. The company has launched its own plan, ‘World Without Waste,’ which focuses on the life cycle of materials used in its packaging. In an op-ed first published on Medium.com, James Quincey, CEO and President, highlighted the company’s efforts towards this goal, including: the introduction of ‘PlantBottle’ in 2009, a container made from up to 30% plant-based materials; cooperation with the plastics industry to promote recycling activities in Mexico; and its sponsorship of coastal clean-up exercises through the NGO Ocean Conservancy.

McDonald’s announced that all its consumer packaging around the world will come from renewable, recycled or certified sources, preferably sources that have a Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification. In 2017, just 50% of the company’s consumer packaging came from such sources.

The global packaging company Amcor was the first to take the recycling pledge. Ron Delia, CEO, highlighted this as a key step in differentiating the company as a global leader in the packaging industry.

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation is leading a three-year initiative, the ‘New Plastics Economy,’ which seeks a shift towards the sustainable use of plastics. The Foundation also partners with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and others to promote the circular economy. On 5 December 2017, the organizations organized a seminar in Nairobi, Kenya, on the role of the circular economy in the transition towards a pollution-free planet, together with the EU, WEF, Chatham House, and the Institute for Development Studies (IDS). The event discussed global action on sustainable consumption and production (SCP), and highlighted examples of actions and policies for enhancing resource efficiency, discouraging unsustainable consumption patterns, and redirecting investment for a clean and circular economy.

2,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-launches-initiatives-to-unleash-big-data-for-sustainable-development/,"Tue, 09 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Launches Initiatives to Unleash Big Data for Sustainable Development,"1 December 2017: The UN has launched several initiatives to strengthen countries’ use of big data for sustainable development, including a 12-point plan on privacy and governance issues. The UN System Staff College (UNSSC) with the Data-Pop Alliance launched a platform offering online courses on big data in November 2017, and will conduct face-to-face trainings in 2018. The UN Statistics Division with the GIS software company Esri have set up a data hub enabling countries to use mapping software to monitor progress on the SDGs.

The Data-Pop Alliance is a coalition of research and development actors created by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, MIT Media Lab, and the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) to promote the use of big data for sustainable development through research, capacity building, and community engagement. UNSSC and the Data-Pop Alliance are seeking to promote data literacy within the UN and other development practitioners. Their learning platform, the ‘Big Data & Sustainable Development Open Learning Hub,’ offers a series of eight consecutive modules over 11 months. The online modules became available in November 2017 and will run until mid-September 2018. The first module covered issues of governance, transparency and politics related to the use of big data, and subsequent modules will address: climate change; citizen-generated and mobile phone data; gender equity; public health; emergency response; data collection, gaps and opportunities; and data storytelling and visualization. The program can be accessed by anyone who creates a profile on the learning hub.

UNSSC and the Data-Pop Alliance are also offering in-person training on ‘Leveraging Big Data for Sustainable Development.’ The training is conducted over three to four days, and is offered in French and English at various locations around the world. A French-language programme will take place in Dakar, Senegal, from 6-8 March 2018, and an English-language programme in Bangkok, Thailand, from 27-29 March 2018. The training programme is meant to strengthen the skills of UN staff and development practitioners in selecting, creating, using and interpreting data in support of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Hewlett Foundation is supporting fellowships to cover the costs of the course to professionals from public sector institutions, civil society and academia.

On 30 November 2017, the Fifth High Level Forum on UN Global Geospatial Information Management endorsed the concept of a “federated system” of open SDG Data Hubs. The federated system facilitates the role of national statistical offices (NSOs) in managing statistical and geospatial data through an open data platform with software for GIS and data analytics, as well as through the use of web-based tools for communication and user engagement. It seeks to strengthen national and global statistical systems in managing and sharing data and good practices in implementing the SDGs, improving data interoperability, and enhancing relationships between national and global data. The concept has been implemented through initial research conducted by the UN Statistics Division (UNStats) and Esri, which have set up a data hub enabling countries to use mapping software to collect, analyze and share data for monitoring progress on the SDGs.

Also on big data, Emmanuel Letouzé and David Sangokoya of the Data-Pop Alliance have proposed a 12-point plan addressing privacy issues in big data. In a paper titled, ‘How to Use Big Data,’ developed in cooperation with the Vodafone Institute for Society and Communications, the authors recommend that collected data be encrypted and stored in distributed data repositories, where it can only be accessed for legitimate purposes. They call for directing big data projects and resources toward solving shared problems, and for communicating results of projects through data visualizations.

3,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/undp-releases-guidance-on-mechanisms-for-sdg-implementation/,"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNDP Releases Guidance on Mechanisms for SDG Implementation,"18 December 2017: The UN Development Programme (UNDP) released a guidance note on integration and coordination mechanisms for implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The note provides information on how countries have adapted or established institutional and coordination frameworks to implement the Goals, and highlights efforts to promote horizontal and vertical coherence.

The document titled, ‘Institutional and Coordination Mechanisms: Guidance Note on Facilitating Integration and Coherence for SDG Implementation,’ finds that many countries are adapting and expanding institutional frameworks established during the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) era, such as national councils for sustainable development (NCSDs), for SDG implementation. The note recommends that such institutions should be positioned within the office of the president or prime minister to ensure effective coordination, and should include some form of decentralization, whether by ensuring representation of local focal points in the NCSD or through establishing sub-national bodies. An annex to the note shares country experiences from Germany, Indonesia, and Nigeria.

On new mechanisms and structures, the guidance argues that the scope and ambition of the SDGs requires systems that facilitate cross-sectoral action and shared accountability that traverses ministries, agencies, levels of government and stakeholders. The note shares how countries have created inter-ministerial commissions to oversee SDG implementation, established high-level inter-ministerial committees to bring together sectoral working groups, and established inter-sectoral thematic working groups, or requested ministries to identify their SDG-related responsibilities. Country experiences from Botswana, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ghana, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Sierra Leone illustrate how countries have created new institutional frameworks to implement the SDGs.

The note identifies the functions of an inter-ministerial commission for sustainable development. They include: operating as an advisory body on the SDGs; developing or coordinating implementation strategies on the SDGs; engaging with key stakeholders; developing a national monitoring framework and national indicators; reviewing the SDGs and targets; recommending financing measures for SDG implementation; and preparing for regional and global dialogues on SDG implementation.

The guidance also discusses allocation of responsibility among various levels of government, emphasizing that sub-national and local governments are often responsible for implementation. The note recommends governments promote vertical coherence and integration across government levels by creating explicit institutional links between sustainable development strategies and federal and sub-national processes. The note further recommends, inter alia: maintaining two-way communication; including partners from outside government with local expertise; and matching devolved responsibilities with funds and revenue-raising powers.

Additional sections of the guidance note address, inter alia: promoting an integrated cross-sectoral approach, drawing from national institutions to implement climate interventions; addressing challenges related to SDG monitoring and reporting; and engaging stakeholders. The note underscores the role of parliaments in SDG implementation through their legislative, oversight, and budgetary functions. The document elaborates on opportunities for parliaments to ensure no one is left behind, promote gender equality, support the rights of persons with disabilities, and engage youth populations.

The publication concludes with recommendations on questions countries should consider when adapting or establishing institutional frameworks for SDG implementation. These questions focus on: designation of a key institution to oversee SDG implementation; high-level support for the institution; the institution’s mandate to oversee and coordinate SDG implementation; a sustainable development road map or strategy with clear roles and targets; mechanisms to foster horizontal and vertical coordination; stakeholder engagement; access to decision-making and inclusion of marginalized groups; and mechanisms for arbitration of conflicting views. Finally, the note proposes key structural factors that countries should consider when setting up an institutional mechanism for SDG implementation.

UNDP intends for the note to be a living document that will be updated based on feedback and lessons learned from ongoing SDG implementation.

The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has assessed the impacts of air pollution on infants, noting the serious and widespread nature of the problem in South Asia and parts of East Asia and the Pacific. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) warns that antibiotics in the environment are causing the evolution of bacteria into “ferocious superbugs” that pose a major health risk.

A UNICEF report titled, ‘Danger in the Air,’ argues that air pollution ranks with violence, lack of nutrition and lack of stimulation in terms of its impacts on infant health. The authors call for action to reduce air pollution, reduce children’s exposure to air pollution and improve child health overall. To reduce air pollution, they suggest investing in clean energy, improving access to public transport, increasing green spaces in urban areas and preventing the open burning of harmful chemicals. To limit children’s exposure to air pollution, they recommend the use of child-sized air filtration masks, traveling during lower air pollution times of day, and planning for pollution sources to be located away from schools, clinics and hospitals. In addition, the authors call for improved monitoring of air pollution to better understand the scale and nature of the problem.

A UNEP report titled, ‘Frontiers 2017: Issues of Emerging Concern,’ reviews emerging issues of environmental concern, and with regard to health, identifies antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as “one of the biggest global public health concerns” of the 21st century. The publication describes how antibiotic use has greatly increased in human health care, animal husbandry and aquaculture, as well as how these drugs enter the environment and contribute to the evolution of bacteria into strains that resist treatment. The report recommends tackling the release of antimicrobial drugs, contaminants and resistant bacteria into the environment, and ensuring proper use and disposal of antibiotic pharmaceuticals. UNEP Executive Director Erik Solheim, speaking at the report launch during the third session of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-3) in December 2017, warned that the careless use of antibiotics is leading to the rise of “ferocious superbugs.”

The ‘Frontiers 2017’ report also discusses nanomaterials, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), sand and dust storms, off-grid electricity, and tackling the environmental drivers and impacts of migration.

Leaders made commitments and announcements related to climate change, oceans, the digital divide, sanitation, and gender equality, among others.

WEF 48 convened in Davos, Switzerland, from 23-26 January 2018, and included participation from over 340 public figures, including more than 70 heads of state and government and 45 heads of international organizations. The Forum convened under the theme, ‘Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World,’ with the aim of rededicating “leaders from all walks of life” to improve the state of the world through co-design, co-creation, and collaboration.

WEF featured over 400 sessions that contributed to the meeting’s six agendas: the global agenda related to its 14 System Initiatives and efforts to advance major multilateral processes, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); the geopolitical agenda; the economic agenda, which focused on delivering sustainable and inclusive economic development; the regional and national agenda; the industry and business agenda, in preparation for scientific, technological and policy transformations and the Fourth Industrial Revolution; and the future agenda, which focused on sharing ideas, innovations, and discoveries to reshape global systems.

WEF focused on driving positive change through 14 System Initiatives meant to shape the future of: consumption; the digital economy; economic progress; education gender and work; energy; natural resource security; financial systems; food security and agriculture; health care; information and entertainment; trade and investment; infrastructure and development; and mobility shaping the future of production.

For the first time, WEF featured an all-female panel of seven co-chairs. Norway’s Prime Minister Erna Solberg called for action on gender equality and corruption and illegal financial flows. Chetna Sinha, Founder and Chair of the Mann Deshi Foundation, urged financial access for everyone and announced a Rupee 100 million alternative investment fund to encourage more women entrepreneurs. On human rights and related to gender, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein underscored the role of the private sector in ending discrimination and ensuring equal opportunities for lesbian, gay, bi, trans and intersex (LGBTI) people in the workplace and beyond.

Leaders also highlighted challenges posed by climate change. In his speech, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi described climate change as one of the three greatest threats to “the survival of human civilization.” He called for “resources to help developing countries adopt appropriate technology” to reduce carbon emissions. France’s President, Emmanuel Macron, announced that France would close all its coal-fired power stations by 2021 and make climate action one of five pillars in an economic reform plan. Liu He, an official of the Government of China, identified pollution reduction as one of three critical challenges for his country. Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also discussed climate action, while Thomas Buberl, head of global insurance company AXA, said the corporation will stop insuring coal projects and plans to divest from coal.

On oceans, the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Ocean, Peter Thomson, and Isabella Lövin, Sweden’s Deputy Prime Minister, launched the ‘Friends of Ocean Action’ partnership with US$4.5 million in funding from the Benioff Ocean Initiative. The global partnership to save the oceans will bring together 40 ocean leaders and activists to leverage their collective networks and accelerate action towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goal on Oceans (SDG 14).

On tackling pollution and waste, leaders from Alphabet, The Coca-Cola Company, Royal Philips, Unilever and others will partner with the governments of China, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Rwanda and international organizations to form the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE). PACE aims to go beyond the 9% of waste that is currently cycled back into the economy by tackling plastics pollution and electronic waste. Chile is partnering with TriCiclos and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to implement a national plan to move towards a circular economy, making it the second country in the world to implement such a plan.

The UN Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development announced its intention to connect the world’s 3.8 billion people without internet access by 2025. The Commission set seven targets that focus on expanding broadband infrastructure, internet access and use in support of achieving the SDGs. Targets to “connect the other half” include: ensuring that 60% of the world’s youth and adult population achieve a minimum level of proficiency in sustainable digital skills; reducing by 50% the number of unconnected micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises; and ensuring the affordability of entry-level broadband services in developing countries, at less than 2% of monthly gross national income per capita (GNI). The WEF addressed a number of other related topics during its sessions, including on big data and artificial intelligence.

Organizations announced many other technology-related initiatives. They included: the WEF initiative, the IT industry Skills Initiative, aiming to reach one million IT workers by 2021; Peru plans to launch an ‘Internet for All’ programme in 2018; the Craig Newmark Foundation in collaboration with WEF will collaborate to bring together internet platform giants with multi-stakeholder leaders, as part of efforts to tackle fake news; the Government of Canada and WEF launched a ‘Known Traveller digital Identity’ prototype to test emerging technologies, with the aim of facilitating more secure and seamless air travel; and WEF launched the Global Centre for Cybersecurity, a multi-stakeholder platform that aims to create a safe operating environment for new technologies like the artificial intelligence, the internet of things, drones and autonomous vehicles.

On sanitation, the Toilet Board Coalition (TBC) highlighted the opportunity of the ‘Sanitation Economy,’ the future marketplace of tackling the global sanitation crisis through innovative toilet design, smart digital technologies, and the circular economy. During a WEF roundtable discussion, CEOs expressed support for a new Action Agenda for the Sanitation Economy. Unilever CEO Paul Polman said the TBC’s work on the Sanitation Economy “highlights the immense business opportunities of providing universal access to safe sanitation,” stressing that SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) should be a key part of companies’ growth strategies.

In addition, the WEF’s Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution added new network centers in India, Japan and the United Arab Emirates and several countries and companies joined as partners. Denmark became the first European country to partner with WEF and will collaborate with WEF on green growth, trade and education, gender, and work.

On poverty and inequality, Oxfam’s Executive Director, Winnie Byanyima said that a future without global extreme poverty “is possible if we redesign our economy to truly reward hard work, rather than wealth.”

Additional announcements made at WEF addressed, inter alia, issues related to genomics, decent work, rule of law, education, and food security. On education, Canada will double its commitment to the Global Partnership for Education Fund, providing an extra CAD$180 million between 2018 and 2020. The Earth Bio-Genome Project and the Earth Bank of Codes will sequence the DNA of all life on earth, with the aim of averting extinction and tackling habitat loss and bio-piracy. On poverty eradication, the WEF initiative, the Closing the Skills Gap, aims to deliver new skills to 10 million workers by 2020; WEF launched the ‘UpLink’ initiative to connect start-ups with investors, universities, governments and others; and Common Goal launched a program that aims to break the cycle of poverty by encouraging footballers to pledge one percent of their salaries to charities that use football as a tool for social change. Finally, on food security, the WEF initiative, Meat: The Future, will identify ways to transform the future of meat and protein production to deliver safe, affordable and sustainable protein. On rule of law, Thomson Reuters, Europol and WEF are partnering to tackle human trafficking and money laundering, including by promoting more effective information-sharing and improving compliance.

Many publications addressed topics related to the WEF 48 theme. The Business and Sustainable Development Commission’s Blended Finance Taskforce released a consultation paper titled, ‘Better Finance, Better World,’ to develop actionable recommendations on the 2030 agenda. The annual ‘Inclusive Development Index’ (IDI) assesses the economic performance of 103 countries on 11 dimensions of economic progress that go beyond gross domestic product (GDP). The report examines living standards and how nations “future-proof” their economies. The ‘Global Risks Report’ finds that environmental risks are among the most dangerous facing the world. The publication, ‘Harnessing the Fourth Industrial Revolution for Life on Land’ highlights how human activity has placed increasing stress on the earth’s natural systems. ‘Innovation with a Purpose: The role of technology innovation in accelerating food systems transformation’ identifies emerging technologies that can drive the sustainability, inclusivity, efficiency, and health impacts of food systems to achieve the SDGs. The report, ‘Towards a Reskilling Revolution’ underscores the importance of life-long learning. Other WEF reports address recycling, the global gender gap, the impact of migration on cities, and data on migration, among other topics.

Lajcak plans to provide more detail on priorities for the resumed 72nd session in January 2018.

Addressing reporters on 20 December 2017, Lajcak said the remainder of the 72nd session will have a focus on migration, with intergovernmental negotiations beginning in February 2018 on the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. In parallel to the negotiations, Lajcak plans to hold at least two multi-stakeholder meetings to ensure a “whole-of-society” approach and ownership for the process. When asked about the impact of the US’ withdrawal from the preparatory process, he said it “will not endanger the process as such.”

The second priority Lajcak highlighted for 2018 is the high-level event on sustaining peace, to be convened in April 2018. He recalled that the event is mandated by the 2016 resolutions on sustaining peace adopted by the UNGA and Security Council. A number of events are planned for the lead-up to the April meeting, comprising a “road map” launched by Lajcak in November.

Lajcak hopes to use the April event to discuss the UN’s “ability or lack of it” to prevent conflicts.

Lajcak said he hopes to use the event to have a political discussion about the UN’s “ability or lack of it” to prevent conflicts and address existing ones. The discussion should elicit the experiences of leaders from different countries and regions regarding the UN’s performance, reviewing both good and bad practices and debating the UN’s abilities in conflict prevention. His aim, he noted, is for the UN to gain respect in conflict prevention and sustaining peace, “the same way the United Nations is a leader when it comes to the development agenda or the climate change agenda.”

On the SDGs, Lajcak said he will contribute to their implementation by holding three events: the launch of the International Decade of Water for Sustainable Development, on 22 March; an event on youth education, employment, and prevention of radicalization, in May; and a high-level event on financing for development (FfD), in June, to address the “substantial financial gap” for implementing the SDGs. He stressed that with the current budget and pace, “we will not deliver on the SDGs by 2030,” and noted the need for financial resources from the private sector.

The remainder of the 72nd session also will focus on several reform processes currently underway. These include: restructuring the UN’s peace and security architecture, on which the UN Secretary-General has been asked to provide a detailed report; reforms to the UN development system, on which Lajcak said the Secretary-General’s second report will be discussed in both the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and the UNGA; and management reform. Components of the UN Secretary-General’s proposed management reform were approved by the UNGA just before concluding the main part of its 72nd session, on 24 December.

Lajcak also recalled that he has appointed co-facilitators for intergovernmental consultations on the review of the 2013 reforms to ECOSOC (Iceland and Qatar), and for the alignment of the 2030 Agenda and the UNGA’s work (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Belgium), among other sets of co-facilitators he has appointed. In all of these appointments, he said, “there is always one man and one woman. So we have maintained gender balance… in these processes.” [Press Conference Transcript] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on Sustaining Peace Roadmap] [Sustaining Peace Roadmap] [Second Report of Secretary-General on UNDS Reforms] [UNGA President’s Comments at Closing Plenary of Main Part of 72nd UNGA] [All SDG Knowledge Hub Coverage of Migration Process] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on UNGA Adoption of Parts of Management Reform] [SDG Knowledge Hub Story on Second Report of UN Secretary-General on UN Development System Reforms]","20 December 2017: The UN General Assembly’s (UNGA) main priorities for the next several months relate to migration, sustaining peace, SDG implementation, and reform processes, according to a statement by President Miroslav Lajcak during a press conference at the end of 2017.
Lajcak plans to provide more detail on priorities for the resumed 72nd session in January 2018.
When asked about the impact of the US’ withdrawal from the preparatory process, he said it “will not endanger the process as such.”The second priority Lajcak highlighted for 2018 is the high-level event on sustaining peace, to be convened in April 2018.
He recalled that the event is mandated by the 2016 resolutions on sustaining peace adopted by the UNGA and Security Council.
Lajcak hopes to use the April event to discuss the UN’s “ability or lack of it” to prevent conflicts."

To address this issue, the UN SDG Action Campaign is encouraging people to engage in SDG implementation and monitoring, while the IAP, a global network of science agencies, has published a guide to the SDGs for its members.

Market research conducted jointly by PepsiCo, Paragon Partnerships, and the UN SDG Action Campaign found that just 5.9% of 10,000 people interviewed in the Philippines were aware of the SDGs, with this percentage falling among lower-income respondents. The survey also found that poverty, hunger and ill health were the issues of most concern to respondents, corresponding to SDGs 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The majority of respondents (68.2%) believed that the situation with regard to these concerns had not changed in the past year, while about a quarter (28%) felt the situation had improved.

Commenting on the results of the Philippines survey, Dilek Ozler of Paragon Partnerships expressed hope that more country governments will choose to measure progress and promote SDG implementation. Paragon Partnerships is a network of government, research agencies, NGOs, companies and client organizations that seeks to use data to generate insights for policy making and programme development towards SDG implementation.

The UN SDG Action Campaign is an initiative of the UN Secretary-General administered by the UN Development Programme (UNDP). The campaign supports countries and the UN system to promote public engagement in SDG implementation. Among its activities are the MYWorld 2030 platform for data sharing and citizen engagement and the ‘World We Want’ partnership with civil society for hosting SDG-focused consultations.

Separately, the IAP, a global network of science, engineering and medicine academies, conducted a survey of its members, which likewise found limited awareness of the SDGs. The IAP has published a 20-page guide to “demystify” the structures and processes by which the SDGs are to be implemented, and to encourage scientists to apply their knowledge to the challenge of implementation. The guide titled, ‘Supporting the Sustainable Development Goals: A Guide for Merit-Based Academies,’ includes a database of peer-reviewed publications on the SDGs that academies have produced since 2014. The activities are part of a three-year IAP project that began in 2016, and seeks to promote the global science community’s contribution to SDG achievement.

He also provided details on a system-wide strategy for gender equality.

The briefing for UN Member States took place on 16 January 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. Opening the briefing, the Secretary-General noted that since he took office in January 2017, several global challenges have intensified: conflicts have deepened and new dangers have emerged; global anxieties about nuclear weapons are at their highest since the Cold War; climate change is moving faster than governments are moving to take action; inequalities are growing; horrific violations of human rights are happening; and nationalism, racism and xenophobia are on the rise.

Guterres highlighted 12 areas of concern where priority action is needed, alongside the empowerment of women everywhere, which he said is a cross-cutting imperative. The 12 areas are:

Promoting a real “new deal” for an equitable globalization, whose benefits are shared with everyone: the Secretary-General urged Member States to respect their financial commitments and to set in place stronger mechanisms that address fiscal evasion and illicit financial flows (IFFs);

Noting that in 2016, for the first time in the last three years, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions increased and the past five years have been the warmest in history, the Secretary-General called for stepping up climate action and announced that he will hold a climate summit in 2019 to increase momentum;

Taking advantage of global mobility through the adoption of the first Global Compact on Migration;

Taking advantage of advances in technology, while protecting societies from its risks: Guterres noted that the UN will serve as a platform for Member States to come together with the private sector, the scientific community and academia to discuss on how to use the potential and address the risks;

Achieving the peaceful de-nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula;

Deescalating tensions in the Middle East;

Strengthening the UN’s partnership with the African Union (AU);

Pushing back the dangerous tide of nationalism in Europe, and revitalizing mediation initiatives – including the Normandy Format and Trilateral Contact Group on Eastern Ukraine, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group on Nagorno-Karabakh, the Geneva International Discussions related to Georgia, and the “5+2” process on Transnistria;

Maintaining a strong focus on counter-terrorism: Guterres announced the convening in June 2017 of a Summit of Heads of Counter-Terrorism Agencies to advance multilateral cooperation;

Strengthening UN peace operations: the Secretary-General noted that a detailed plan of action for that purpose is being prepared by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, and said that, in February 2018, he will present his report on peacebuilding and sustaining peace;

Reversing the large-scale exodus of Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslims, for which the full implementation of the Rakhine Advisory Commission recommendations is vital; and

Overcoming the “false contradiction” between human rights and national sovereignty: Guterres mentioned that the UN stands ready to support states in building their capacities to uphold the rule of law, promote respect for human rights, and eliminate all forms of discrimination.

The Secretary-General noted that his report on peacebuilding and sustaining peace to be presented in February will contain “very strong” proposals on strengthening the Peacebuilding Fund. He observed that the AU needs strong support and clear mandates from the UN, and announced that the UN and the AU will sign a framework of agreement on development, aligning the 2030 Agenda and Africa 2063, during the AU Summit taking place at the end of January 2018.

On gender equality, Guterres said his approach rests on three pillars. The first pillar is empowering women and girls. To that end, he noted the September 2017 launch of his roadmap for achieving gender parity at all UN levels, and announced that in 2018 the UN reached full parity in the 44-member UN Senior Management Group. He added that he also mandated an internal task force to review the UN’s spending on gender equality.

The second pillar of his gender equality approach, Guterres said, is preventing sexual exploitation and abuse against women. With this aim, he appointed the UN’s first-ever Victims’ Rights Advocate, who will work closely with Member States and across the UN system. He noted that 82 Member States are part of a Voluntary Compact to prevent these crimes and respond swiftly to allegations.

The third pillar on which Secretary-General’s gender equality approach rests is preventing and addressing sexual harassment. He reiterated his personal commitment to eliminating sexual harassment at the UN, adding that his zero-tolerance approach was recently reaffirmed in a joint letter with staff unions to all UN personnel. He reported that he has set up a task force, led by Jan Beagle of the Department of Management, to review UN policies and capacities to investigate, to ensure accountability, and to look at the support and protection offered to those affected. Guterres said his team is currently working on more detailed measures to simplify the procedures for reporting harassment and raise awareness of the issue throughout the UN.

The Secretary-General added that 2018 will be “a decisive year for reform,” and noted that the repositioning of the UN development system will facilitate better support for Member States in achieving the SDGs.

Countries welcomed a more in-depth definition of “sustaining peace.”

In the ensuing discussion, many countries, including Cuba, Iran and Singapore, stressed the need for the UN to defend and promote multilateralism. Brazil and Cuba noted that reform of the UN peace and security pillar will not be complete without reform of the UN Security Council. Singapore expressed hope that the Secretary-General will act as advocate for an open and fair world trade system. China called for attention to the root causes of the refugee crisis. Guatemala and El Salvador welcomed a more in-depth definition of the “sustaining peace” concept, with El Salvador adding that the concept should include human rights and be addressed under the peace and security pillar.

The report ranks 16 of the world’s largest publicly listed auto companies on readiness for a low carbon transition.

The companies included in the report titled, ‘Driving Disruption: Which automotive companies will seize the opportunities in a low-carbon economy?’, have a total market capitalization of US$790 billion and represent over 75% of the global passenger vehicle market. According to CDP’s ranking, BMW, Daimler and Toyota are the best performing car companies on climate-related metrics.

The authors explain that the car industry is “facing a double hit of disruption from EVs [electric vehicles] and autonomous and shared driving,” with over a fifth of profits likely to shift to technology companies like Uber and Google by 2030. Over 30% of new car sales are projected to be zero emissions and plug-in hybrid by 2030, representing a potential US$1 trillion market. By 2022, EVs could become as affordable as petrol and diesel cars, making it easier for car makers to profit from a low-carbon economy. Accelerating the deployment of such vehicles is critical for reducing carbon emissions meeting the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.

CDP CEO Paul Simpson said technology and software disrupters have forced the car industry to innovate quickly to ensure their survival in the low-carbon transition. Traditional car companies are increasingly investing (over US$11 billion since 2015) in autonomous and shared vehicle companies, and setting aggressive electric and autonomous vehicle targets. For example, General Motors is working towards an ‘All Electric-future.’ However, nearly 50% of car makers risk penalties by missing their emissions targets, and in the EU, some companies will need to increase their share of EV sales by 20% in order to meet the EU’s 2021 targets.

For traditional car engines, complying with emissions regulations will increase to over US$2,200 per vehicle by 2025.

The report details a number of risks and opportunities for the car industry. For example, governance and remuneration structures must be aligned with the low carbon transition, and the cost to comply with emissions regulations for traditional car engines is expected to increase threefold by 2025 to over US$2,200 per vehicle. In addition, China is critical, says CDP, as it accounts for 29% of global passenger vehicle sales, and has set aggressive targets for new energy vehicles such as EVs beginning in 2019.

CDP leverages investor and buyer power to motivate companies to disclose and manage environmental impacts, and drive companies and governments to reduce their emissions, safeguard water resources and protect forests. CDP has reported on the oil and gas, steel, cement, automotive, electric utilities, chemicals and mining industries in recent years.

Around the world, one in three people still lacks access to a toilet, and hundreds of thousands of children die annually from diarrheal diseases caused by poor water and sanitation. There is an abundance of heart wrenching stories to share.

To address this challenge, in 2015, the global community adopted a Sustainable Development Goal dedicated to clean water and sanitation (SDG 6). Target 6.2 under this Goal calls for, “by 2030, achieving access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and ending open defecation.” This article discusses the untapped opportunity for the private sector to help achieve SDG target 6.2. Not only can business be a part of the solution that provides clean water and sanitation for all, but it can make a profit at the same time.

So, where do we begin? From the outset, overcoming this global issue is daunting. Where do we look for the solution, when the issue includes complex cultural nuances, societal taboos, and the general ‘yuck’ factor?

To start, the global business community and savvy entrepreneurs can take a closer look at the bottom of our toilets. Yes, it may sound unpalatable, but there is method in the madness.

The Sanitation Economy presents vast potential for global economic growth, and has the ability to transform future cities, communities, and businesses.

In its latest report, the Toilet Board Coalition (TBC) introduces the ‘Sanitation Economy‘ – a market that presents vast potential for global economic growth, and has the ability to transform future cities, communities, and businesses. This new economy monetizes toilet provision, products and services, biological resources, health data and information, to provide benefits across business and society.

This research shows that the market could be worth US$62 billion in India alone, by conservative estimates; it could turn trillions of liters of human waste into valuable biological resources each year; and it could hold a vast reservoir of information about human health.

It is rare today to find white spaces in the economy open for business and innovation, and that address such an urgent global challenge as outlined in SDG 6.

The Sanitation Economy is made up of three distinct sub-economies. They include: the Toilet Economy, which encompasses toilet product and service innovation that provides toilets fit for purpose for all environments and incomes; the Circular Sanitation Economy, which means toilet resources (commonly known as human waste) feed into a circular economic system that replaces traditional waste management; and finally, the Smart Sanitation Economy, which involves digitized sanitation systems that optimize data for operating efficiencies, maintenance, plus consumer use and health information insights.

The Toilet Economy

Providing basic access to a toilet and the sanitation systems that safely manage human waste is a serious issue. Access to “sanitation for all” made the least progress during the era of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that spanned from 2000 to 2015. As a result, the world is now watching, and acting, to ensure progress over the next 15 years under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its SDGs.

The Government of India is leading the way with its ‘Swachh Bharat Mission – Clean India Campaign’, which aims to provide universal access to all Indians in just five years (2014-2019), become open defecation-free, and build more than 100 million toilets. The campaign is making swift progress in providing access to toilets and awareness is high among citizens. China is now following in its footsteps.

It is not just national governments rising up. Citizen movements are also encouraging behavior change. In November 2016, the Global Citizen Festival was held in Mumbai, India, to put a spotlight on the need for sanitation for all. About 100,000 citizens gathered to listen to an impressive mix of celebrities, musical artists, and sanitation experts – including Coldplay, JAY-Z, and famous Bollywood stars about the importance of sanitation. In 2017, Bollywood launched ‘Toilet: A Love Story,’ a film about a woman who turns down a marriage proposal until her husband-to-be agrees to buy her a toilet. Such cultural activities help educate people about the importance of sanitation and drive behavior change alongside the creation of toilets.

The Circular Sanitation Economy

The past decade has seen business embrace sustainable development, where private sector practices address growing constraints on resources and new responsibilities for the customers and communities they serve. Leading corporations have found new market opportunities by looking at where their unique value propositions can also address unmet needs, and market failures that underpin the SDGs, where no one is left behind. The circular economy – the mining of waste and available resources to save costs and generate new revenue – is trendy among global businesses.

Sanitation can play an important role in a circular economy and corporate sustainability strategies, and if viewed through a circular economy lens, become an important pool of valuable resources. If what goes into our toilets has value, those interested in extracting that value will invest in ensuring that the resource is properly managed.

And there is no shortage of this resource. Approximately 7.6 billion people globally create excreta every day, to the tune of 3.8 trillion liters of resources – an amount that is growing with our population growth. These resources, when captured and mined, present very interesting biological resource use cases.

For instance, entrepreneurs and businesses are starting to monetize these resources and are creating valuable products such as nutrient-rich organic fertilizers, electricity, bio-fuel, water, and proteins. All of these products were previously, and in many cases, are still, flushed down the toilet. From manufacturing operations to municipalities, there is growing demand for these new, renewable resources and organic or biological products. They help fill food, fiber, agriculture, animal feed, consumer goods and healthcare needs.

The Smart Sanitation Economy

The future of industry is being shaped by what the World Economic Forum is calling the fourth industrial revolution – a digital economy. This is characterized by a fusion of technologies that blur the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres.

Sanitation and toilets have a place here, too. There is a key opportunity now to apply new technologies and digitization to sanitation to create new business opportunities as future sanitation systems are developed. While the Smart Sanitation Economy is the least developed area of the Sanitation Economy to date, we believe that it could be a game changer for how we view our sanitation and toilets into the future. It can provide valuable data and insights on health, and for sanitation system operating efficiencies.

A Call to Action – Making ‘Your Business’ Business

The Sanitation Economy is the business response to a global crisis and resulting market and societal failures. With collaboration and investment on all fronts, there is an opportunity to turn the world’s toilet-related resources and data into valuable, life-saving resources and critical information.

This is our call to action to the global business community – because sanitation is every business’s business. It’s time to step up and be counted.","The Sanitation Economy presents vast potential for global economic growth, and has the ability to transform future cities, communities, and businesses.

Hawai’i will implement the SDGs through the Aloha+ Challenge.

The Hawai’i State Senate aims to focus on a local platform to implement the SDGs during the 2018 Legislative Session. The 2018 Senate Legislative Program outlines Hawai’i’s goals for each of the 17 SDGs. For example, on SDG 1 (no poverty), the Program states that Hawai’i will ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and vulnerable, have “equal rights to economic resources by implementing and enacting appropriate measures and social protection systems.” On SDG 14 (life below water), Hawai’i will continue its commitment to strengthen its “resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters” in alignment with the Paris Agreement on climate change. On SDG 15 (life on land), Hawai’i aims to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of its “’āina and natural resources by integrating ecosystem and biodiversity values into local and state planning.”

The Senate will implement the SDGs through the Aloha+ Challenge, a local sustainability framework that aims to improve the quality of life for future generations. The Aloha+ Challenge focuses on achieving sustainability goals in clean energy, local food production, natural resource management, solid waste reduction, smart and sustainable communities, and green workforce and education. The Aloha+ Challenge Dashboard tracks Hawai’i’s progress in these areas. On natural resource management, the Dashboard focuses on increased freshwater capacity, watershed area, marine managed areas, invasive species control and native species management and notes whether each area is being measured or is near its target. For example, on watershed area, Hawai’i is near the 2030 target of 253,000 areas of native watershed under high-level protection. The state has increased is protection of priority watersheds from 10% (90,000 acres) to 15% (132,000 acres) since 2011, and has plans for tripling the areas protected. For each of these areas, the Dashboard provides information on how users can learn more about the issue and contribute to making a difference.

On local food production and consumption, the Dashboard describes current challenges Hawai’i faces in developing a sustainable local food system and outlines the state’s goal of doubling local food production by 2030 by building on Hawai’i’s history of agricultural innovation and abundance. Users can track progress by dairy, protein, vegetables, fruit and starches.

J. Kalani English, Hawaiian Senate Majority Leader, said the 17 SDGs will “continue to build a more resilient state and improve the quality of life for future generations.” In the introduction to the legislative program, he stresses that Hawai’i is recognized as a “global leader in addressing sustainability and climate change challenges, building on a history of systems-thinking and traditional knowledge.” [Hawai’i Senate Press Release] [Hawai’i 2018 Senate Legislative Program] [Aloha+ Challenge]","17 January 2018: The Hawai’i State Senate announced its intention to enact the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into state law to achieve the sustainability of Hawai’i’s people, communities, natural resources and economic prosperity.

The report stresses that a change in mindset and perspective is necessary to achieve sustainable development for all. It proposes a nexus approach to overcome barriers between sectors and disciplines, and ensure sustainable natural resource management.

The report titled, ‘From Isolation to Integration: Five Years of Advancing a Nexus Approach to Environmental Resource Management,’ introduces the nexus approach to resource management, which examines the interdependencies of environmental resources between parts of a cycle and across different scales. The report argues that considering these relationships can increase resource efficiency while minimizing ecological degradation and environmental risks. Conversely, the report cautions that failure to consider inter-connectedness can result in adverse impacts.

As an illustration, the report shares how a project in China mitigated soil erosion but contributed to food and water scarcity. In this context, the project achieved progress on SDG 15 (life on land) but hindered progress on SDG 2 (zero hunger) and SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation). The report argues that understanding these interlinkages can help develop strategies for achieving multiple SDGs. It provides an example of a wastewater treatment project in Mexico City that aims to address progress on SDG 2, SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 6 and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

The report identifies knowledge and capacity gaps in moving from isolation to integration. These gaps include the need for more rigorous research and examples to develop policy recommendations and development of independent, reliable and current data to identify linkages and analyze the effects of management strategies. The report further suggests development of guidelines for decision-makers to implement inter-ministerial and cross-ministerial collaboration and implementation. The report elaborates on ways to address each of these gaps based on UNU-FLORES’ experience.

The report’s recommendations center on research, data, tools, capacity development, networking and advocacy. Each of these focuses on ways to implement a more holistic approach to resource management. The report also provides information on UNU-FLORES’ research projects that elaborate the connections between water, soil and waste planning, management and trade-offs.

The draft compact is made up of: a Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF); a programme of action for applying the CRRF; and a section on follow-up arrangements.

The CRRF was negotiated in 2016 as part of the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, adopted by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) at a high-level meeting in September 2016. Early experiences in applying the CRRF inform the compact draft, which was developed through a two-year consultation process with States and other stakeholders, including five thematic discussions and a Dialogue on Protection Challenges.

In September 2017, Grandi reported that the CRRF had been applied in 11 countries: Costa Rica; Djibouti; El Salvador; Ethiopia; Guatemala; Honduras; Mexico; Panama; Somalia; Uganda; and Tanzania. Some of these countries have also adopted legislative and policy instruments that expand the access of migrants and refugees to education and jobs and facilitate their social and economic inclusion.

According to the introduction of the zero draft, the global compact on refugees aims to ease pressures on host countries, increase refugee self-reliance, expand access to third-country solutions, and support conditions for safe return. The “perennial gap” in the existing system for refugee protection, which the compact aims to address, is the need for more predictable and equitable sharing of burdens and responsibilities among States and other stakeholders.

The introduction also notes that the compact’s success hinges on four areas for progress: sustained international financial and other forms of support to refugees and host communities; strengthened national refugee response capacity; improved socio-economic conditions for refugees and host communities, notably women and girls; and enhanced efforts to resolve protracted situations, resulting in increased prospects for durable solutions.

The programme of action is made up of two sections, with the first covering principal modalities for burden- and responsibility-sharing. The modalities discussed are: national arrangements and global platform; solidarity conferences; additional funding and efficient use of resources; regional organizations; a multi-stakeholder approach; and data and evidence. The programme of action also addresses support for the application of the CRRF.

On follow-up arrangements, the compact draft notes that UNHCR will develop a set of key indicators to monitor and evaluate progress and outcomes of the global compact, which will be “aligned with … the relevant goals of the sustainable development agenda.” In addition, Member States could include refuges in their progress reporting on the SDGs, the draft suggests. A first opportunity to assess progress of the compact’s application could be a ministerial-level meeting to be convened by UNHCR in 2021, coinciding with the 70th anniversary of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 60th anniversary of the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.

UNHCR also set out a road map of formal consultations on the draft, beginning on 13-14 February 2018, in Geneva, Switzerland. Following each session in Geneva, an informal briefing will take place in New York. The first briefing will convene on 16 February.

The report assesses LDCs’ economic trends and progress towards selected SDG targets and indicators.

Only five LDCs reached the SDG 8.1 ambition of sustaining at least 7% GDP growth per annum in 2017.

The 2018 report titled, ‘Selected Sustainable Development Trends in the Least Developed Countries,’ was presented to UNCTAD Member States at a meeting of its governing body in Geneva, Switzerland, on 5 February 2018. The assessment finds that LDCs economic growth averaged 5% in 2017, and should reach 5.4% in 2018, which is below SDG target 8.1 on sustaining at least 7% GDP growth per annum in the LDCs. According to the report, in 2017, only five LDCs achieved this target: Bangladesh (7.1% GDP growth), Djibouti (7.0% GDP growth), Ethiopia (8.5% GDP growth), Myanmar (7.2% GDP growth) and Nepal (7.5% GDP growth).

The report shows that aid to LDCs remains far below the target of 0.15-0.20% of donor countries’ official development assistance (ODA)/gross national income (GNI), a level that was agreed in 1981 and reaffirmed in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development in 2015. It notes that in 2016, only a handful of donor countries appear to have met these commitments: Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and the UK provided over 0.20% of their own GNI to LDCs, while the Netherlands met the 0.15% threshold.

The report also shows that aid tends to be skewed towards a relatively small pool of LDCs, with the top ten recipients accounting for roughly half of total disbursements to the group. The top recipients are often the countries most affected by humanitarian emergencies and conflict, the authors find.

The assessment indicates that levels of external indebtedness have been surging across LDCs, and in 2016, remittances accounted for as much as 31% of GDP in Nepal, 29% in Haiti, 26% in Liberia, 22% in the Gambia, 21% in the Comoros, 15% in Lesotho, and they exceeded 10% of GDP in Senegal, Yemen and Tuvalu. It also finds that many LDCs fall short of the inclusive and sustainable industrialization envisaged in SDG target 9.2 (Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry’s share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in LDCs).

Comprehensive and updated economic and social statistical data on the LDCs can be accessed in UNCTAD’s ‘Statistical Tables on the Least Developed Countries – 2017.’ [Publication: Selected Sustainable Development Trends in The Least Developed Countries] [UNCTAD Press Release on Report] [UN Press Release on Report] [UNCTAD’s Statistical Tables on the Least Developed Countries 2017]","8 February 2018: A report from the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) suggests that the least developed countries (LDCs) will not reach the SDGs unless key action is taken, including speeding up wholesale restructuring of their economies.

The consultations address the six themes of the Forum: climate; people; development; urban issues; ecosystems; and financing; as well as the Forum’s three crosscutting topics of sharing through stakeholder involvement; capacity building; and water governance for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Regional reports are being produced, and a Regional Process Commission of the Forum has responsibility for integrating input from the regions into the Forum’s deliberations.

In Europe, a ‘kick-off meeting’ of water professionals and agency representatives took place in The Hague, Netherlands, in May 2017. The meeting launched a process that created a structure and invited case studies for the European regional report.

In Africa, four sub-regional reports were prepared as input to the regional report to the Forum. In January 2018, the African Ministerial Council on Water (AMCOW) organized a regional preparatory meeting of ministers in Entebbe, Uganda, to validate the regional report, which addresses issues of water security, ecosystems and climate change. Osward Chanda, Africa Development Bank (AfDB), stated at the meeting that Africa’s water sector requires US$14 billion a year to adequately address these issues through sound technical studies and investments in infrastructure and water management, of which the AfDB currently is providing US$3 billion.

The Americas used an online survey to invite contributions on the six themes and the three crosscutting topics.

The Mediterranean region organized its Third Mediterranean Water Forum in Cairo, Egypt, from 22-24 January 2018, with outcomes meant to feed into the regional Mediterranean report.

Other preparatory events in the lead-up to WWF-8 have included an interfaith event in January 2018 in Brasilia, and a meeting of local and regional authorities in February 2018 on the sidelines of the ninth session of the World Urban Forum in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The Kuala Lumpur meeting discussed arrangements for the Fifth International Conference of Local and Regional Authorities for Water, which will take place as part of WWF-8 on the theme of ‘Water to Sustain A New Urban Future.’ The Brasilia meeting, from 11-12 January, deliberated on the theme of ‘Waters for Peace’ at the Second International Seminar on Water and Transdisciplinarity. Spiritual leader Sri Prem Baba of the ‘Awaken Love’ movement presided at the event. Christian, Buddhist, Muslim and Indigenous representatives, as well as representatives of UN Environment and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), attended the seminar. The event sought to create a peaceful global alliance for the conservation and conscious use of water resources.

The Regional Process Commission is one of several WWF-8 Commissions.

The hotel industry and Japanese companies are among the business entities taking action recently.

Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030 (P4G) is advancing inclusive, sustainable economic growth through a partnership approach across governments, business and civil society. P4g has invited concept notes to join its Partnership Fund, which will be accepted through 30 March 2018. The P4G initiative aims to catalyze inclusive, sustainable economic growth through partnerships and solutions in support of the SDGs and the Paris Agreement. P4G supports partnerships through funding, facilitation and recognition. P4G partners include the governments of Chile, Denmark, Ethiopia, Kenya, the Republic of Korea, Mexico and Viet Nam, the C40 network of 91 major cities, the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) and the World Resources Institute (WRI).

Also working in alignment with the SDGs and the Paris Agreement, the International Tourism Partnership (ITP) established four ‘ITP Goals,’ addressing climate change, water, youth employment and human rights. The goals “embrace science-based targets” on carbon, and encourage the hotel industry to reduce carbon emissions at scale. According to the UN, the global hotel industry accounts for approximately one percent of global emissions, and this amount is predicted to increase as demand grows. ITP encourages the use of its Hotel Footprinting Tool for hotels to identify their carbon emissions and identify areas of improvement, including through energy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy.

On water, the ITP goals focus on addressing water scarcity and improving water-use efficiency. On youth employment, the ITP goals aim to double the industry’s impact on youth unemployment through employability programmes. On human rights, the ITP goals seek to raise awareness of human rights risks, address risks in the labor supply chain and hotel construction, and include human rights in corporate governance.

In Japan, companies have set targets in line with the SDGs and are working to advance sustainability across a number of the Global Goals. Companies that have set SDG targets include:

Ajinomoto, which works on infant nutrition in developing countries;

Fujitsu, which advances environmental technologies;

Lixil, which will increase the number of developing countries in which it manufactures portable toilets;

Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal, which is using slag byproducts from steel manufacturing to create a product that can increase the ocean’s iron content, supporting the proliferation of seaweed and advancing ocean conservation;

The Guidelines were prepared under the auspices of the World Water Data Initiative of the High Level Panel on Water, as part of global efforts to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal on clean water and sanitation (SDG 6) and other SDG targets that rely on the development and management of water resources. They were launched by Australia’s ambassador to Italy, Greg French.

The publication comprises 12 chapters that discuss, inter alia, how to: identify different types of water data and their uses; prioritize water management objectives; strengthen water data institutions; establish sustainable water data monitoring systems; adopt water data standards; and implement effective water data information systems.

Lack access to safe sanitation services results in the “entirely preventable deaths” of nearly 1,000 children per day.

Making the case for water reform globally, the Guidelines highlight the growing risk posed by deteriorating water security, due to a combination of factors that include rapid population growth and industrialization, over-extraction, widespread pollution and climate change. The publication notes that more than 1.8 billion people globally source some of their drinking water from contaminated sources, while 2.4 billion people lack access to safe sanitation services, “resulting in the entirely preventable deaths of nearly 1,000 children daily.”

In the closing chapter, the publication offers practical guidance for planning and implementing the “water data reform journey,” by discussing how to: take stock of current policy settings; prepare the case for reform; position for effective implementation; and champion the reforms.

The High Level Panel on Water was established in 2016 by the UN Secretary-General and President of the World Bank Group. Comprising 11 sitting Heads of State and Government and one Special Adviser, the Panel aims to provide the leadership required to champion a comprehensive, inclusive and collaborative way of developing and managing water resources, and improving water- and sanitation-related services.

20,https://www.edie.net/library/Five-steps-to-take-the-lead-on-the-Sustainable-Development-Goals/6807,"Fri, 02 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",edie.net,SDG roundtable: Five ways to move from ambition to action,"Sustainability and corporate responsibility managers from a range of businesses across the country recently gathered in London for an exclusive roundtable hosted by edie and UL EHS Sustainability, which explored the steps required to take the lead on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

In September 2015, delegates from 193 nations came together to introduce the 17 SDGs. Replacing the Millennium Development Goals, the global framework set a bold overarching agenda to end extreme poverty, fight inequality and justice, and combat climate change by 2030.

But, almost two-and-a-half years later, corporate progress on the SDGs has been mixed at best. On the one hand, awareness of the Goals has grown significantly, with more than 10,000 companies around the world having pledged to support the SDGs in some way. But myriad reports now warn that most companies have failed to move beyond initial planning stages to build upon an increased business awareness.

So, how can business leaders move from ambition to action on the SDGs? How can they drive engagement with their across their organisation? Should a company be looking to completely overhaul its approach to sustainable development in favour of achieving the SDGs, or is it a case of reporting on current approaches through the lens of the Goals? And when it comes to delivery, should a business be able cherry-pick the SDGs it wants to focus on, or ensure all 17 Goals are being worked towards?

Those were some of the key questions that edie sought to answer during the SDG roundtable last week. The event, sponsored by sustainability consultancy UL EHS Sustainability, brought together 16 industry experts to explore how and why businesses should take the lead on the SDGs.

Here are the five top tips that came out of the SDG roundtable:

1) Prioritise the most relevant Goals…

Setting global goals can be crucial for galvanising action. But, with the SDG agenda centred on 17 goals and 169 indicators, it can be difficult for businesses to know where to start. This was the general consensus among the roundtable participants, who stressed that, to benefit from the opportunities and risks presented by the SDGs, an organisation must first define where its priorities lie.

Former Pret A Manger head of sustainable business John Isherwood emphasised that businesses must remain pragmatic in a world of stretched raw materials. A targeted approach on the specific issues that have a material impact on company’s business operations will help to focus efforts, Isherwood said, and will therefore be more likely to succeed.

“For now, businesses should focus on the things they can make the most impact on,” he said. “Most businesses have limited resources to work on this, so they need to make sure that they are working on the areas they can contribute the most to.

“Having gone through that process, [an organisation] can choose four or five areas to prioritise – but at least then, the employees are aware that another 12 Goals exist.”

It is all well and good companies prioritising the Goals that are most relevant to their business, but understanding and reflecting stakeholder engagement could be just as vital for any business aiming to build public trust. Indeed, failure to do so could alienate a company from its customers.

Last month’s PwC report on SDG progress found that the sustainability priorities of citizens and businesses are often misaligned. While businesses tend to focus on the SDGs centred around economic growth (Goal 8) and climate action (Goal 13), the public’s focus is on broader social issues such as zero hunger (Goal 2), health and wellbeing (Goal 3) and no poverty (Goal 1).

Participants at the SDG roundtable agreed that there is a general reluctance among the business community to focus on sustainability areas they regard as on the periphery of the corporate agenda. This could pose a major issue for those businesses wanting to strengthen their brand and reputation with consumers, PwC’s research warned.

2) Get the board on-board with the Goals

Several roundtable participants noted that a major sticking point for sustainability professionals when it comes to driving internal engagement on the SDGs is gaining the support of boardroom executives, who can often erroneously interpret the process as a box-ticking exercise which offers little business value.

That is despite extensive research showing that investments into the SDG agenda could create competitive advantage. It has been reported that as much as $12trn and 380 million jobs could be generated by 2030 if the SDGs are placed at the heart of global economic strategies. All the while, innovative finance solutions are springing up to promote the agenda, with the World Bank issuing its first ever set of green bonds that directly link financial returns to performance on the Goals.

With this in mind, UL EHS Sustainability's business development director Chris Saunby said sustainability professionals must not hold back on stressing the financial gains of SDG alignment. Saunby said that firms which embrace the SDGs can generate new sales, customers and value propositions, and also establish cost savings, better talent acquisitions and a more motivated workforce.

“Do we avoid selling the bottom-line implications of following the SDGs as a commercial benefit?” Saunby asked. “We are very good at selling the altruistic reasons for doing this, but there is huge commercial gain; whether it be through investment, recruitment or the purchase power of somebody choosing to spend their money on Patagonia as opposed to another brand, for instance.

“We sometimes pull back from wanting to advocate something like this for financial reasons. But we might actually be missing the opportunity for boards to buy into it.”

Saunby’s thoughts were echoed by Coca-Cola European Partners’ (CCEP) vice president of sustainability Joe Franses, who claimed there is great scope for innovative companies to open up untapped markets related to the SDG agenda.

“We need to be looking at the business opportunities,” Franses said. “Numerous opportunities exist for innovative businesses that can tap into markets and create new goods and services that will fulfil and meet some of these needs.

“That is definitely where the most exciting piece comes in. I am not sure there are that many businesses that have managed to get their head around that yet. We are still in this conversation about how we are supporting the goals and tracking, but actually this is the exciting bit.

3) Master the art of SDG storytelling to drive staff engagement

The roundtable was in agreement that a strong appetite to address the SDGs within some companies is being hindered by a lack of engagement and understanding by mid-management and the wider workforce. This is seen as a major barrier within the corporate sphere and was highlighted as such by those present at last month’s roundtable conversation.

Jez Cutler, head of environment and sustainability at construction firm Travis Perkins, has used the SDG framework for several years to map his company’s CSR activities. But broader engagement with the agenda within Travis Perkins has been limited, Cutler admitted. In a materiality-mapping exercise with Travis Perkins’ stakeholders, Cutler discovered that around one-third had never heard of the Goals. He has found that an effective tool to overcome this internal inertia is through simplified communication.

“What we’ve done is use the SDGs as a starting point and moved on from them because few people want to talk about them within the organisation,” Cutler said. “It's about going back to language that everyone is comfortable using and familiar with, even though we are in a position to talk about the SDGs should we need to. It's a secure position without actually using it.”

Having the ability to translate SDG action into a compelling and relevant story can increase engagement with an increasingly environmentally-aware consumer base.

The art of storytelling presents a perfect opportunity to increase this consumer engagement, according to speaker and broadcaster Simon Cohen, who reflected on the extraordinary impact of the narration in the recent Blue Planet series on the plastics waste agenda.

Cohen said: “If you look at Blue Planet, one of the reasons why that programme resonated so much is because of the awesome storytelling and communication it offered. It’s absolutely necessary that within the private sector that the SDG framework is being used globally as the public-facing communications.”

4) Measure and track SDG progress to inform decision-making

While most firms include the SDGs in their corporate reporting, in many cases this merely amounts to lip service which fails to convert stakeholder aspiration into business action. This trend was illustrated in a recent UN Global Compact study which found that, two years on from adoption, more than a third of 9,000 businesses participating in the SDGs still hadn’t set any measurable targets against achieving them, while only 55% were monitoring progress.

The roundtable participants agreed that regular monitoring of SDGs can help to inform business decision-making and build corporate accountability. Some of the members commented on the importance of using credible in-house or third-party standards to report on progress toward their sustainability targets and the SDGs. Chemicals giant BASF, for instance, measures the environmental impact of its 16,000 products through its own ‘value-to-society’ assessment.

“It is important to show what it means and measure impact otherwise it is just a nice communication story,” BASF director of applied sustainability Talke Schaffrannek said. “If you just say that your company is taking action, it doesn't really help. You need to explain by how much and actually measure it… you need to show that progress has been made to show stakeholders that you are moving in the right direction.

“Then, it becomes much more tangible when we are able to discuss the products with the product managers… then, they understand about how to differentiate the products around whether they are more sustainable or harmful. It becomes more tangible and more personal around the table.”

5) Collaborate and share best-practice to optimise SDG action

Cross-sector collaboration is an area of opportunity that corporates are seemingly failing to capitalise on. Research shows that 70% of sustainability professionals are seeking to collaborate, but less than half have been offered any opportunities to do so. Meanwhile, the number of companies “actively involved” in collaborations linked to the SDGs has fallen to a third, down 7% from last year.

But the roundtable contributors recognised that companies cannot address the SDGs on the own. The room agreed that partnerships between different types of organisations from the private sector, governments, multilateral organisations and civil society offers the best chance of seizing the opportunities that the SDGs present.

Organisations such as Forum for the Future and PwC are partnering with companies across the world to ensure that the combined activities on sustainability issues add up to more than the sum of their parts. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), meanwhile, is working with members to incorporate the SDGs into its ‘A Better Retailing Climate’ initiative, which highlights the progress and ambition of UK retailers in acting in a sustainable and responsible manner.

One of these members is department store chain Debenhams, whose director of corporate responsibility Caroline Haycock noted that coalitions and collaborations will become key enabling mechanisms to progress the SDG framework as the agenda advances.

“What will the SDG framework look like in five or 10 years’ time?,"" she asked. ""Who would have dreamt of even having this conversation about the SDGs five years ago? It’s that constant evolvement that is important to be aware of. This is about businesses taking one step at a time… this is why we need to come together to learn and share best practice around the SDGs, because often we realise that we are all in pretty much the same place facing similar challenges""

Following a national consultation on the topic, the Ministry of Climate Change will launch a technical study on a possible carbon pricing instrument.

The national consultation took place in Islamabad, Pakistan, organized by Pakistan’s Ministry of Climate Change and the Collaborative Instruments for Ambitious Climate Action (CI-ACA) project, which the UNFCCC Secretariat runs through its five Regional Collaboration Centres. Approximately 60 public- and private-sector representatives agreed that carbon pricing is worth exploring as a way to reduce emissions and increase green investment. However, they cautioned that any carbon-pricing scenario must be compatible with Pakistan’s economic development objectives, poverty reduction, and increased access to sustainable energy, among other goals.

Participants agreed that Pakistan could draw on the experiences of other countries in developing and implementing carbon pricing instruments, such as a tax on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or an emissions cap-and-trade system. They emphasized the importance of transparency, clear institutional arrangements, awareness-raising, capacity building, and robust monitoring, and reporting and verification systems.

Approximately 42 national and 25 subnational jurisdictions are pricing carbon. The EU Emissions Trading System, currently the largest carbon market, covers about 1.75 billion tonnes of emissions. China has launched a process to create a national carbon emissions trading system, which will eventually cover about 3.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions within the country’s electrical power sector alone.

Danish energy giant Ørsted's chief executive has highlighted the severe threats of climate change and the unique opportunities of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the company's latest sustainability report, which outlined the company's transition away from fossil fuels.

Ørsted, formerly DONG Energy, released its first sustainability report since the name change, earlier this week. The report outlines that over the past decade, the Danish company had reduced its coal use by 82% - with a 100% reduction targeted for 2023 – while sourcing 64% of heat and power generation from renewables – with a target to source more than 95% in place for 2023.

As part of his speech to accompany the report, Ørsted’s chief executive Henrik Poulsen noted the need to transition to clean energy sources, a claim backed by the 23 offshore windfarms currently owned by the company.

""The world is in the middle of a global climate crisis. It is not a distant threat,” Poulsen said. “The planet is already feeling the grave impact of climate change. And truth be told, we are still not doing enough to secure the planet for generations to come. We need to transform the global energy systems from black to green energy at a high pace.

“Ørsted’s vision is a world that runs entirely on green energy. It is deeply rooted in what we do and who we are as a company. We want to be a company that provides real, tangible solutions to one of the world’s most difficult and urgent problems.”

The company has a 2023 goal to reduce carbon emissions by 96% against a 2006 baseline and use 100% certified sustainable biomass for CHP plants by 2020. The latest report notes that Ørsted has reduced emissions by 67% since 2006, and currently sources 72% certified biomass.

For emissions, Ørsted noted that its science-based reduction target is not only in line with the Paris Agreement, but is actually 27 years ahead of the reduction trajectory for the sector.

The goals are all aligned to the United Nation’s SDGs, with an emphasis on goal 7 (clean and affordable energy) and goal 13 (climate action).

“At Ørsted, we are committed to running our business in a way that creates progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals,” Poulsen added. “The 17 goals express a global agreement of society’s greatest challenges towards 2030. We especially focus on goal no. 7 on clean and affordable energy and goal no. 13 on climate action.”

Last year, Ørsted completely divested its upstream oil and gas business, as part of the pledge to phase-out coal from its heat and power generation by 2023. The company is also relaying this transition onto customers.

The firm announced that it will offer UK businesses the chance to purchase renewable electricity at a subsidised rate, by absorbing cost premiums to ensure that green energy prices are no higher than traditional ""brown energy"" sources.

Hornsea One

Ørsted’s sustainability report was published on the same week that the company began construction on the world's biggest wind farm; the Hornsea One project off the Yorkshire coast. By 2020, the 1.2GW project is expected to deliver enough electricity to power more than one million homes.

The project will also be followed by the bigger Hornsea Two wind farm. The 1.3GW wind farm was granted a final investment decision last September.

Consisting of 11 Heads of State and Government and one Special Adviser, the Panel focused on accelerating progress on the Sustainable Development Goal on clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), as well as on the other SDGs that rely on the development and management of water resources, especially SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy); SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities); SDG 3 (good health and well-being); SDG 15 (life on land); SDG 2 (zero hunger); SDG 1 (no poverty); and SDG 13 (climate action).

In April 2016, the UN Secretary-General and the World Bank President convened the HLPW to champion a comprehensive and collaborative way of developing and managing water resources, as well as improving water and sanitation-related services. The Panel presented its outcome package, titled ‘Making Every Drop Count – An Agenda for Water Action,’ to the UN Secretary-General on 14 March 2018, at the UN Headquarters in New York, US. The package consists of an open letter to fellow leaders, an outcome document, short summaries of key initiatives undertaken by the Panel, and a galvanizing video.

Through the package, the HLPW advocates for evidence-based policies and innovative approaches at the global, national and local levels to make water management and water and sanitation services attractive for investment and more disaster-resilient. It also calls for policies that will allow for, at least, a doubling of water infrastructure investment in the next five years.

The outcome package calls for policies that will allow for, at least, a doubling of water infrastructure investment in the next five years.

The outcome document presents a summary of the Panel’s findings and recommendations. The text notes that action on SDG 6 is urgent, explaining that gaps in access to water supply and sanitation, growing populations, more water-intensive patterns of growth, increasing rainfall variability, and pollution are combining to make water one of the greatest risks to economic progress, poverty eradication, and sustainable development. The document underscores that if the world continues on its current path, it may face a 40% shortfall in water availability by 2030, with consequences that will be disproportionately felt by the poorest and most vulnerable. Within this scenario: approximately 700 million people are at risk of being displaced by intense water scarcity by 2030; more than two billion people are compelled to drink unsafe water; and more than 4.5 billion people do not have safely managed sanitation services.

The Panel stresses the need to invest in data for water management and to strengthen water governance mechanisms. It further calls for: an integrated approach to water management; investing more efficiently in disaster risk reduction and in water-related infrastructure; building sustainable cities and human settlements; and strengthening global and international water cooperation. The HLPW also recommends encouraging innovation, promoting partnerships, and increasing finance and institutional support for water issues. Other recommendations include ensuring universal access to safe water and sanitation, and nurturing environmental water.

The Open Letter highlights that the International Decade for Action, “Water for Sustainable Development,” will commence on 22 March 2018, and the Heads of State and Government on the Panel ask readers to join with them in “committing to valuing water and taking action to address our water challenge within this decade.” [Publication: Making Every Drop Count – An Agenda for Water Action][HLPW Website][Open Letter to Global Leaders] [ UN Secretary-General Receives HLPW Outcome (Press release)] [HLPW video inspires the world to take action (Video) ]","14 March 2018: The High Level Panel on Water (HLPW) released its outcome package, concluding its mandate with a call for a fundamental shift in the way the world manages water.

28,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/wmo-checklist-helps-enhance-early-warning-systems/,"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,WMO Checklist Helps Enhance Early Warning Systems,"23 March 2018: Early warning, a critical component of disaster risk reduction (DRR), can prevent loss of life and reduce the economic impacts of hazardous events, including disasters, according to a multi-hazard early warning systems checklist developed by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in partnership with the UN Office for DRR (UNISDR), UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and others.

Over the last thirty years, the number of lives lost from severe weather events has decreased largely because of increased accuracy of weather forecasting and warnings, and improved coordination with disaster management authorities.

Issued on World Meteorological Day on 23 March 2018, the report titled, ‘Multi-hazard Early Warning Systems: A Checklist,’ focuses on the need for community engagement and education, disaster preparedness and effective dissemination of warnings, all required for effective early warning. It incorporates the benefits of multi-hazard early warning systems, disaster risk information and enhanced risk assessments.

Early warning is reflected in the SDGs, particularly those related to food security, healthy lives, resilient cities, environmental management and climate change adaptation.

The checklist provides a list of actions that national governments, community organizations and partners can refer to when developing or evaluating early warning systems based on four main elements: disaster risk knowledge; detection, monitoring, analysis and forecasting of hazards and possible consequences; warning dissemination and communication; and preparedness and response capabilities. The document will be updated based on the development of technologies, advances in multi-hazard early warning systems and feedback from the users.

Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for DRR Mami Mizutori urged countries to incorporate the checklist into national and local DRR strategies, which are scheduled to be in place by 2020 in accordance with target (e) of the Sendai Framework for DRR (substantially increase the number of countries with national and local DRR strategies by 2020). She said that a multi-hazard approach to early warnings is critical for building disaster resilience. WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said WMO is working to establish a global standardized multi-hazard alert system in collaboration with National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS).

Early warning is an important component of a number of international agreements. The Sendai Framework for DRR recognizes the benefits of multi-hazard early warning systems. The SDGs address early warning, particularly those related to food security (SDG 2), healthy lives (SDG 3), resilient cities (SDG 11) and climate change adaptation (SDG 13). The Paris Agreement on climate change also mentions early warning systems as a focus area to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience, reduce vulnerability, and minimize loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change.

An outcome of the first Multi-hazard Early Warning Conference that took place in May 2017 in Cancún, Mexico, the checklist updates the original document, ‘Developing Early Warning Systems: A Checklist,’ which emanated from the Third International Conference on Early Warning in March 2006.

As energy is a ‘nexus issue’ that spans the breadth of the SDGs, our attention was also drawn to knowledge products that directly link energy to decent jobs (SDG 8), infrastructure (SDG 9) and climate action (SDG 13).

The Global Preparatory Meeting for Review of SDG 7 took place from 21-23 February, in Bangkok, Thailand, organized by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), and the Thai Ministry of Energy. The meeting highlighted progress on energy access in the Asia-Pacific region, but also remaining challenges. In her opening remarks, ESCAP Executive Secretary Shamshad Akhtar noted that the region remains “the most energy intensive” in the world. The SDG Knowledge Hub summary of the meeting is here.

As an input to the assessment of SDG 7, a series of 27 policy briefs was developed by the Ad Hoc Informal Multi-stakeholder Technical Group of Advisors on SDG 7. Each brief features key messages and statistics on progress so far, as well as priority actions to accelerate movement towards the Goal. The briefs are categorized into four sections: 1) advancing SDG 7 implementation; 2) interlinkages between SDG 7 and other Goals; 3) regional perspectives; and 4) “toward a sustainable and equitable energy future.”

Under the first heading, the papers look at trends in achieving universal access to electricity and clean cooking fuels, increasing the share of renewables in the global energy mix, financing SDG 7 and more. The brief on electricity access notes the difference between having a source of electricity and having universal access, cautioning that the former does not guarantee the latter. The brief on cooking fuels highlights that 40% of households (3 billion people) still prepare meals using “traditional” stoves, which poses a risk to both human health and the environment. It notes that upwards of 4.3 million deaths each year are attributable to household air pollution, and lists priority actions for policy, planning, finance and monitoring, such that clean cooking fuels can be realized for all. The brief on increasing the share renewables notes that 80% of total final energy consumption derives from fossil fuels, but that 60% could of electricity be generated by renewables by 2030. The finance brief highlights the importance of policy measures on both the demand-side (i.e. de-risking investment, carbon pricing) and supply-side (financial system reform). It also outlines the potential for financial technology (“fintech”) solutions to facilitate the development of small-scale, distributed energy systems.

A brief linking energy, climate and transport calls for prioritizing alternative forms of mobility, such as walking, cycling and public transit.

Ten policy briefs highlight linkages between SDG 7 and other Goals. The brief linking energy to poverty and inequality highlights that “energy is a precondition for economic development,” meaning that achieving SDG 7 is not only a goal in itself, but also a means of achieving others. The water-energy-food nexus brief notes that policy coherence is key to managing tradeoffs and synergies, given increasing needs across all three areas. Connecting energy to health, Policy Brief #10 recalls the above statistic on clean cooking fuels, also describing how energy enables health services (i.e. through vaccine refrigeration and equipment sterilization) and offering examples of how SDG 7 contributes to targets under SDG 3. The briefs linking energy to climate and transport call for prioritizing reduced emissions and alternative forms of mobility, such as walking, cycling and public transit.

The ‘Regional Perspective’ category dedicates papers to energy trends in Africa, the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Arab region, as well as a brief covering Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS). The fourth category unpacks long-term and systemic issues, such as energy pathways to 2050 and the linkages between indicators, data and energy. The papers were developed in conjunction with stakeholders from the UN system, bilateral governments, multilateral actors and civil society.

During the meeting, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) released a report titled, ‘Renewable Energy Market Analysis: Southeast Asia.’ The report describes macroeconomic and social trends, analyzes the current energy landscape and recent investment and deployment trends, and outlines the benefits of decentralized renewable energy. It finds that, although 65 million people in the region currently lack reliable electricity access, there remains potential to tap significant renewable energy resources whilst adding jobs in the energy sector. The report makes a case for diversifying energy production through renewables, noting that there were over 611,000 renewable energy jobs in the region as of 2016. The report also highlights socio-economic, health and environmental benefits from decentralized renewable energy, offering a goal-level mapping to the SDGs starting on page 131.

As previewed in last week’s SDG Knowledge Weekly, the Regional Forum on Sustainable Development for the UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) Region convened from 1-2 March in Geneva, Switzerland. The Forum discussed Goal 7 among the other SDGs to be reviewed at the HLPF. Case studies of national experiences in implementing the Goals in ECE countries were provided by governments and other stakeholders for discussion at the meeting. They examine how energy systems are being made more efficient, what initiatives have enabled increased investment, and the policies and measures that have been implemented to “accelerate the transition to sustainable energy.” A session on ‘transforming energy in support of the 2030 Agenda’ explored the reconciliation of countries’ emissions targets under the Paris Agreement on climate change with their short-term reliance on fossil fuels.

Additional knowledge products were released outside of the meetings. A separate report by IRENA finds that, despite the EU’s current reliance on fossil fuels, member countries “could cost effectively double the share of renewable energy by 2030.” The finding, one of many from ‘Renewable Energy Prospects for the European Union,’ comes as part of a broader, bottom-up REmap analysis that assesses and aggregates countries’ and regions’ renewable energy potential. REmap’s aim is to build a roadmap that looks not only on technologies for electricity, but also for heating, cooling and transportation

A joint report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) and Facebook looks at options for bridging the “digital divide,” noting that nearly 4 billion people lack internet access. Titled ‘Powering Last-Mile Connectivity,’ the paper frames the issues partly as one of a need for better infrastructure to increase efficiency. The paper cites that mobile network operators spend up to US$3.8 billion on fuel alone to power infrastructure, and that for consumers, charging mobile phones is both costly and time-consuming if charging points are far away, as is often the case in rural areas. The findings highlight the importance of the interlinkages across the SDGs, particularly the interface between SDG 7 and SDG 9,

The Center for Global Development released a policy paper titled, ‘What Can We Learn about Energy Access and Demand from Mobile-Phone Surveys? Nine Findings from Twelve African Countries.’ While not explicitly covering SDG 7, the paper offers insight as to both survey techniques and challenges facing universal access to energy services (SDG target 7.1).

At the city level, new analyses by CDP find that 102 cities worldwide now source at least 70% of their electricity from renewable energy sources. Detailed coverage of the CDP report, and related energy news from the BP, Coal India, and the Government of Ireland, is available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

The Forum outlined its commitment to eliminate gender gaps in the workplace in the ‘Call to Action of Chile.’

The UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the Government of Chile organized the Forum in partnership with the International Labour Organization (ILO) and UN Women. The event, which convened in Santiago, Chile, from 27-28 February 2018, focused on the theme ‘The Future of Work and the 2030 Agenda.’ Over 500 representatives from 39 countries, including more than 50 employers’ organizations and trade unions, attended the event.

The Forum addressed gender gaps in the workplace within the context of SDG 5 (gender equality) and SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth). SDG 5 includes target 5.1, to end all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere, and target 5.5, to ensure women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making. SDG target 8.5 aims to, by 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities and equal pay for work of equal value.

Participants shared progress and challenges related to achieving these SDG targets. The Gambia’s Vice President and Minister of Women’s Affairs, Fatoumata Jallow-Tambajang, reported that empowering women and enabling equal opportunities in the workforce is “a key pillar of our National Development Plan.” Jallow-Tambajang emphasized that businesses, from micro-credit and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to large companies, are taking steps to reduce inequalities, boost productivity and improve the Gambia’s economies.

Achieving equality in the labor force will require addressing women’s disproportionate burden of unpaid care work.

Richard Barathe, UNDP, observed that women’s equality in the labor force could contribute US$28 trillion to the global economy by 2025. But, he noted, this will require efforts to address women’s disproportionate burden of unpaid care work, encourage women’s entry into the workforce and close the gender pay gap.

In the Call to Action of Chile, governments, the private sector and union members commit to “work every day” to promote equality and inclusion and to change working conditions to achieve greater equality between women and men. The signatories call on stakeholders to find innovative ways to apply lessons learned and to share the Forum’s messages on gender equity in their workplace and with other companies.

The Forum also discussed UNDP’s ‘Gender Equality Seal’ programme, which certifies companies that have eliminated pay gaps, increased the number of women in decision-making roles and made progress in ending sexual harassment in the workplace. UNDP supports partners in 17 countries around the world to meet gender equality targets.

The Forum’s website features a catalogue of solutions to accelerate gender equality. Solutions are organized around solutions to: eliminate the gender pay gap; promote labor inclusion in non-traditional sectors; build transformative partnerships; eradicate sexual harassment; promote women in business; foster women in leadership; and promote work-life balance.

On promoting labor inclusion in non-traditional sectors, UNDP describes a project that promoted the integration of women and girls in workplaces in Haryana, India, including a training program for women in the stainless steel sector. As a result, jobs opened in a sector that has not traditionally been an option for women in India. UNDP stresses that programmes focused on women “need not use a welfare approach” but can instead use a gender and development lens to focus on sustainable impact.

Uganda’s NDC aims to: reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 22% by 2030 relative to a business-as-usual scenario; reduce urban and rural vulnerabilities; and increase climate resilience, particularly in agriculture and livestock, forestry, infrastructure, water, energy and health.

Following Uganda’s first official communication to the NDC Partnership and its emphasis on implementation, the NDC Partnership Support Unit conducted a mission to Uganda in August 2017 to follow up on discussions that took place during a ‘Strategic Dialogue on Achieving Uganda’s Climate Goals’ in June 2017. The Support Unit, in consultation with Uganda’s NDC Partnership Focal Points, developed a proposal for support, based on the Strategic Dialogue’s results. The proposal identified 11 support requests and called for two technical advisers to support Uganda’s National Planning Authority and Climate Change Department in implementing the country’s NDC.

By December 2017, the NDC Partnership had consolidated and shared responses, identifying support from six Implementing Partners: the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), National Adaptation Plan (NAP) Global Network, the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the World Bank and the World Resources Institute (WRI). This led to the design and implementation of Africa’s first NDC Partnership Plan, which held its inaugural workshop from 30 January-1 February 2018, in Entebbe, Uganda.

The NDC Partnership Support Unit is working with the Government of Uganda and Implementing Partners to facilitate the Plan’s implementation by mid-2018.

During the event, Implementing Partners discussed how their programmes and projects are able to align with support requests that have been formulated through the NDC Partnership. In addition, the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the African Development Bank (AfDB) provided expertise and insights, and discussions addressed accessing GCF funds and how Uganda can capitalize on the AfDB’s current initiatives. The NDC Partnership Support Unit is now working with the Government of Uganda and Implementing Partners to finalize the Plan and facilitate its implementation by mid-2018.

In October 2016, Uganda joined the NDC Partnership, which aims to enhance international cooperation to support implementation of NDCs under the Paris Agreement by facilitating the transfer of financial and technical resources to countries that need them.

These were among the key areas identified for building consensus among Member States, following the first round of intergovernmental negotiations on the compact.

The second round of negotiations convened from 12-15 March 2018, in New York, US. The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration is being prepared for adoption at an intergovernmental conference convening from 10-11 December 2018, in Morocco. Negotiations on the text are taking place in six rounds between February and July 2018, in New York, led by co-facilitators Jürg Lauber, Permanent Representative of Switzerland, and Juan José Gómez Camacho, Permanent Representative of Mexico. The first session of negotiations took place on 20, 22 and 23 February 2018.

During governments’ debate on the differentiation between irregular and regular migration, Comoros for the African Group said the focus should be on the individual well being of migrants, and thus the differences between irregular and regular migration should be discussed with a view to addressing specific vulnerabilities. The African Group, supported by many (mostly origin) countries including Tuvalu, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Eritrea, Cuba, Jamaica, Nepal, Costa Rica, Venezuela, and Brazil for a group of countries including Argentina, Canada, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, Guatemala and Peru, added that all migrants, irregular or regular, have the right to human rights and international assistance. These countries expressed support for expanding the pathways to legalizing migration, with many noting that all migrants should be able to participate fully in the economic and social lives in their countries of destination.

Austria for a group of 27 countries (including Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, the UK, Sweden and Spain), expressed a position largely supported by many (mostly destination) countries, including Australia, Japan, China, the Republic of Korea, Guyana, Equatorial Guinea, New Zealand, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Azerbaijan, South Africa and Belarus, anchored in a clear distinction between regular and irregular migration. She explained that irregular migration undermines public trust in migration, puts irregular migrants at risk of exploitation, and is a negative phenomenon. She noted that the compact needs to be based on national sovereignty, and to clearly state that deciding migrants’ status is “the full sovereign right of states.” She added that while human rights and basic services, such as health and legal assistance services, need to be ensured to all migrants, some rights should be applied only to regular migrants, such as the right to equally participate in the economy.

Australia added that he does not support commitments to expanding pathways for the legalization of migration, nor a series of services and/or rights such as family reintegration or participation in the economy. Turkey cautioned against any language that might appear as encouraging irregular migration, adding that all economic objectives in the compact need to apply only to regular migrants. The African Group replied that the International Labor Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work does not differentiate between the statuses of migrants with regards to the right to work in destination countries.

Hungary said the document is unbalanced, resulting in a “pro-migration document.” He emphasized that “migration is bad and needs to be stopped,” and the efforts of the international community should not aim only to manage migration. The role of the UN, he noted, should be to protect the sovereignty and security of its Member States, to which migration is posing a great risk. He stressed that the violation of a state’s border is a serious crime that should be punished in a very strict way. Hungary continued that the right to migration is not a fundamental human right, and that multiculturalism is not a value of its own and it is not more valuable than a homogenous society. He said Hungary has been a Christian country and wants to preserve that. He concluded that until his country’s position is fully reflected in the compact, Hungary will constantly object to it.

Switzerland, supported by Canada, said sovereignty does not only entail deciding who enters a country’s territory, but also protecting all persons on that territory, the question being what rights apply to each situation. He said access to basic education, basic health and basic law enforcement are important in order to guarantee human rights. Bulgaria, Luxembourg and Jamaica, for the Group of Friends of Children and the SDGs, emphasized that the human rights of all children need to be protected irrespective of their migratory status, and said children pose no security risks.

During the debate on the differentiation between migrants and refugees, all delegates agreed that the compact on migrants and the compact on refugees should: complement each other; avoid overlaps and contradictions; and, while recognizing mixed flows of people, avoid creation of a new legal category. The issue of how to address the situation of vulnerable migrants who are displaced by climate change or natural disasters, cannot go back to their countries, and yet do not qualify for refugee status (under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees) ignited a heated debate. Some countries, including China, Australia and Austria for the group of 27 European countries, said international protection should only apply to refugees, not to migrants or to people displaced by climate change and natural disasters, to whom countries could be invited to provide support or national protection, but not international protection.

Others, including Lichtenstein, Switzerland, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, the African Group and Tuvalu, said the principle of non-refoulement (not forcing refugees or asylum seekers to return to a country in which they are liable to be subjected to persecution) is stipulated not only by international law on refugees but also by human rights law. Therefore, it should be applied also to vulnerable migrants, in addition to refugees. Lebanon and others strongly opposed extending the principle to migrants.

El Salvador, supported by Switzerland, stressed the need to establish a minimum standard of protection, explaining that there are issues not captured in the 1951 Refugee Convention or its protocols because the context was different then, and now climate-induced displacement requires response. India and Japan proposed that vulnerable migrants be addressed under the refugee compact. The African Group noted that mixed movements of people should be addressed in both compacts, because different measures are necessary at different stages of the mixed movements, with some measures for migrants and some for refugees.

During the debate on implementation, follow-up and review, Japan and other countries opposed the creation of new mechanisms. Other countries, including the African Group, Indonesia, Bahamas, Brazil, India, El Salvador, the Philippines and Jamaica, supported the creation of the new proposed capacity building mechanism. Some countries, including Australia and Austria for the group of 27 European countries, stressed that contributions to any mechanisms should be voluntary. Several countries, including Turkey, China, South Africa, Switzerland and the African Group, called for all states to embrace the principle of shared responsibility and for donors to make financial contributions in support of developing and the least development countries (LDCs), with the African Group, Cuba and China asking for respecting and increasing the current official development assistance (ODA) commitments. Russia opposed the principle of shared responsibility, stating that the countries that originated the migration crisis should be the ones “shouldering the burden.”

Some countries, including Norway and Mexico, expressed support for a “strong organizational base” for the review of the compact. Norway, supported by Argentina and Guatemala, added that reviews might be necessary more often than every four years, maybe every two years. Australia, supported by Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Austria, the Philippines and Switzerland, stressed that the follow-up and review and the implementation of the compact should be state-led, supported by the private sector and civil society. Russia opposed the involvement of civil society. While Bangladesh and others called for a strong follow-up and review based on clear targets and indicators, others like Australia, Lichtenstein, India, Indonesia and Thailand favored a “light touch.” China strongly opposed the idea of indicators.

After the two days dedicated to these key areas for consensus building, delegates conducted a reading of the “zero draft plus,” which contained only minor technical changes compared to the zero draft. A new draft incorporating the substantive changes requested will be released before the next negotiation session, convening from 3-6 April 2018.

The conclusions respond to the session’s priority theme, ‘Challenges and opportunities in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of rural women and girls.’

CSW 62 convened from 12-23 March 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US, with a focus on ‘Empowering Rural Women and Girls.’ CSW 62 considered the review theme, ‘participation in and access of women to the media, and information and communications technologies and their impact on and use as an instrument for the advancement and empowerment of women.’ Over 4,400 representatives from 170 Member States and more than 600 civil society organizations participated in CSW 62.

On information and communications technology (ICT), representatives of 12 countries shared national progress on advancing gender equality and women’s empowerment through ICT. Belgium highlighted women’s underrepresentation in media, stressing that women “practically disappear” from media as they age, and shared tools developed to address this challenge, including awareness-raising campaigns. Denmark called for governments and enterprises to be more proactive in promoting science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields. Saudi Arabia described initiatives to bridge the digital divide between men and women and urban and rural areas. New Zealand expressed concern about “digital harm,” including cyberbullying.

On land tenure, the Commission held a panel on ‘The role of rural women’s land rights and land tenure security in reaching the SDGs.’ Panelists underscored the importance of extending gender equality to land rights and ownership, saying that unless women have equal access to land, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will “become an impossible vision.” Out of 161 countries surveyed, 37 countries have specific laws that grant men and women equal rights to own, use and control land. Panelists urged advancing women’s land rights as a way to catalyze progress on women’s empowerment, including through better implementation of land laws, collecting data on gender-based rights and tenure security, and leveraging the SDG’s land indicators.

The CSW recognized synergies between the work of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), including complementarities in the themes of CSW 62 and the 2018 HLPF with respect to gender equality and women’s empowerment. The Commission considered a note by the Secretariat, titled ‘Input to the work of the Economic and Social Council and the High-Level Political Forum on sustainable development (E/CN.6/2018/11),’ that summarizes the Commission’s potential contributions to the HLPF. CSW’s Agreed Conclusions will be transmitted to ECOSOC and the HLPF for inclusion in their work.

The CSW Agreed Conclusions recommend specific measures to end poverty and enhance women and girls’ food security and nutrition, access to education, health care, including sexual and reproductive health and rights, decent work, land and productive assets, and rural infrastructure and technology, such as safe drinking water and sanitation facilities and clean stoves. The Conclusions call for ending all forms of violence and harmful practices that impact women and girls.

Women and girls have clearly stated what they want: the rights to own property, the need for quality infrastructure, and the rights to make decisions about their own bodies and lives.

UN Women’ s Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka described the Agreed Conclusions as a “vital step forward” for ensuring equality for women and girls in rural areas. She emphasized that women and girls have clearly stated what they want: “from the rights to own property, to the need for quality infrastructure, to the rights to make decisions about their own bodies and lives.” CSW 62 Chair Geraldine Byrne Nason (Ireland) stressed that the Agreed Conclusions affirm the Commission’s commitment to leave no one behind, and provide real outcomes to address the lives of rural women and girls.

In the Conclusions, CSW emphasizes the mutually reinforcing relationship among the empowerment and women and girls, the realization of their human rights and gender equality and the full, effective and accelerated implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. To ensure their full implementation, the Commission’s recommendations focus on: strengthening normative and legal frameworks and eliminating laws and policies that discriminate against rural women and girls; implementing economic and social policies for the empowerment of rural women and girls, including by building the resilience of rural women and girls to climate change and environmental degradation such as deforestation, desertification and loss of agricultural biodiversity and systematically measuring and incorporating the value of unpaid work performed by rural women and girls in calculations of gross domestic products (GDP) and formulation of economic and social policies; and strengthening the collective voice, leadership and decision-making of rural women and girls.

The CSW also held sessions on: data collection approaches for measuring progress on gender equality and women’s empowerment; gender-based cyberviolence; cooperation between global and regional mechanisms dealing with violence and discrimination against women; and other topics.

Numerous events took place on the sidelines of CSW 62. Estonia hosted an event on ‘Ending violence against women—opportunities and challenges of ICT.’ Speaking at the event, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed highlighted how ICT innovations can expand economic pathways and improve service delivery and access. However, she observed, the digital gender divide is widening, and more and better data is necessary to understand “the scope of violence against women and girls facilitated by technology.”

The Women’s Empowerment Principles Forum discussed opportunities for business to empower women in the workplace, marketplace and community. Speakers also shared good practices in implementing the Principles, to which almost 2,000 CEOs globally have committed. Participants highlighted the role of gender equality in achieving all of the SDGs, but underscored that gender inequalities remain pervasive in every dimension of sustainable development. In remarks at this event, Mohammed called for action in four areas: placing gender equality at the center of implementation; closing the financing gap, including by identifying innovative sources of funding; improving monitoring through disaggregated data on gender and strengthened national statistical systems; and strengthening accountability for gender commitments at all levels.

The Festival focused on how to put the SDGs into action through discussion on five key issues: innovation; citizen engagement; communication; mobilization; and multi-stakeholder engagement.

More than 1,500 participants from over 150 countries attended the second edition of the Global Festival, which took place in Bonn, Germany, from 21-23 March 2018. The UN SDG Action Campaign, an initiative of the UN Secretary-General that is administered by the UN Development Programme (UNDP), organized the event with support from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and the German Federal Foreign Office.

In opening remarks, the director of the SDG Action Campaign, Mitchell Toomey, described the unique character of the event, which is driven by and reliant on participants’ actions. He stressed that the Festival “is a perfect example that solutions can come from everywhere” and underscored the importance of building strong networks for action in achieving the SDGs.

The UN SDG Action Campaign, Digital Promise Global and Occulus launched the MY World 360° project, which invites youth to share their perspectives and advance positive action towards the SDGs through digital skills and “360° media.” MY World 360° will launch national pilot programs in Germany and India, with selected schools receiving 360° video production equipment from Oculus and targeted local media support and mentorship. Youth from around the world can contribute submissions.

Also at the Festival, Canon Europe launched the 2018 Young People Programme, aiming to harness the power of positive storytelling to drive change. The Programme uses the SDGs as a framework for young people to share global issues that affect their futures.

The UN SDG Action Campaign announced eight winners and 48 finalists of the first UN SDG Action Awards. The awards ceremony honored initiatives in the following categories: communicator; connector; include; innovator; mobilizer; storyteller; and visualizer. Winning initiatives are mobilizing Belgians to implement the SDGs in their daily lives, fighting corruption in Nigeria and promoting human rights education in Sri Lanka, among other actions. The ‘Unreasonable Goals’ initiative won the connector category for its work to bring together highly scalable entrepreneurial solutions with cutting-edge technologies, and match them with world class mentors to help in scaling up their efforts to achieve the SDGs. SDG Youth Morocco won the mobilizer award for educating and empowering Moroccans to achieve the 2030 Agenda through multi-stakeholder partnerships. Global Goals for Local Impact/Open Institute Kenya received the visualizer award for collecting citizen generated data from every household in Lanet Umoja, Kenya on all aspects related to the SDGs and working with community leaders to identify development gaps that need to be addressed to achieve the SDGs.

In addition to the Festival’s thematic session, the event featured the ‘SDG studio,’ a live stage with TED-style talks, interviews and discussions, interactive spaces, film screenings and a virtual reality zone. Participants had the opportunity to play ‘Go Goals!’, an SDG board game developed by the UN Regional Information Centre (UNRIC).

35,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/policy-briefs/getting-to-2030-tracking-sdg-indicators-for-evidence-of-implementation-progress/,"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Policy Brief: Getting to 2030: Tracking SDG Indicators for Evidence of Implementation Progress,"During the first two years of SDG implementation, it has been hard not to ask “Are we there yet?” or at least, “Are we getting there?” with the hope that evidence of global progress could be detected. Indeed, our review of the most-read stories on the SDG Knowledge Hub in 2017 revealed that readers are eager for assessments and measurements of SDG implementation.

The SDG framework, as adopted in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in September 2015, includes 17 headline Goals and 169 targets to be implemented by 2030. A key component for this agenda is the use of a set of indicators in order to measure global progress on the Goals and targets. While the Goals and targets were adopted in 2015, the indicators for the SDG framework were adopted in 2017, following the selection of over 200 indicators in a process overseen by the UN Statistical Commission.

But even with the valuable tool that the global indicator framework provides, monitoring progress on the 2030 Agenda, which is to be implemented universally and in a way that ensures that no one is left behind, remains a daunting task. For several indicators, for example, assessment methods still must be defined. In addition, all countries must determine the indicators for which they currently track data, and where they need to concentrate resources on developing new data sets.

As international organizations, governments and practitioners around the world focus their work plans and strategies on the 2030 Agenda, data are being collected, reported on and organized in visualizations that can begin to tell the story of where we stand vis-à-vis our 2030 ambitions. This policy brief introduces the monitoring tools that international organizations, national governments and local-level stakeholders are developing to assess SDG implementation. As our readers’ preferences indicate, the data-driven approach is viewed as an essential component for keeping us accountable and on track to achieve the SDGs by 2030, and identifying the available data to conduct this tracking is an important step in this process.

Global Assessments

The centerpiece for global assessments is the annual report that the UN Secretary-General is mandated to produce. In 2017, the most-read SDG Knowledge Hub news story was a summary of this global assessment – the UN Secretary-General’s ‘Progress Report towards the SDGs.’ This report was released in June, prior to the meeting of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF 2017), and provided a global overview of the situation with regard to the Goals. The report was released shortly after the indicator set was recommended for adoption and used existing data compiled by the UN. As indicator development and data collection improve over the coming years, this annual report will be well placed to provide the official, overall assessment of progress.

In addition to this annual document, the UN Statistics Division released an ‘SDGs Report’ during the Ministerial segments of the HLPF in 2016 and 2017, reviewing progress towards the 17 Goals and based on the latest available data (first SDGs Report and second SDGs Report). The data from the 2017 SDGs Report were presented as inputs during the HLPF’s discussions on specific indicators.

Apart from these two reports from the UN Secretariat, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and Bertelsmann Stiftung have used internationally comparable data to produce the SDG Index and the SDG Dashboards, which were released in 2016 and 2017. They plan to release a related overview of implementation in 2018. This contribution to the assessment of progress has ranked countries according to their performance on the SDGs, in an effort to spur a conversation about leadership on specific Goals and where greater effort is most needed.

The custodians of individual indicators are also providing global assessment data for the specific indicator(s) they have been tasked with overseeing, and many of these organizations have created portals for the SDG-relevant data they maintain. Earlier this month, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) launched an online platform for reporting on the status and trends of the world’s forest resources, for example. The UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) has created an online tool that will capture data on achieving the targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. The World Bank’s dashboards present data from the World Development Indicators (WDI) that help to monitor the SDGs, and provide visualizations that permit comparisons among countries.

Efforts to bring together information on all of the indicators for a single Goal are also underway. In preparation for the July 2018 HLPF’s assessment of SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), UN-Water has coordinated the development of the ‘SDG 6 Synthesis Report 2018 on Water and Sanitation.’ This report is being prepared by the custodian agencies for the SDG 6 indicators, and will include baseline data and updates on data availability for each of the SDG 6 indicators. The preparation of this report was discussed at the 27th and 28th meetings of UN-Water.

Civil society organizations have also set up data portals. For example, the Global Reporting Initiative runs the Target 12.6 Live Tracker, which shows progress on sustainability reporting around the world.

In the midst of this growing number of portals and reports on specific indicators, targets and Goals, the SDG-Tracker project, which was launched in March 2018, brings together the data from many of the portals noted above, in addition to other sources. This project extracts the data from sources including the UN, World Bank, World Health Organization and FAO, and is updated as its sources release new data.

National Indicator Tracking

National governments are the keepers of official statistics for their country, and seek to ensure that indicator methodologies and data collection processes will result in robust, reliable datasets. The custodian agencies for the SDG indicators rely on the official statistics of each country to develop their data sets. A number of countries have developed monitoring and reporting mechanisms to report on their relevant official statistics, and identify indicators for which they do not currently collect data.

For example, the US recently updated the platform that it launched in 2017. This platform reports data for 82 indicators, with measures being improved for an additional 84 indicators, and data being explored for another 80 indicators. This site was built as an open source tool, and the US reports that it is collaborating with the UK and Ghana on national reporting platforms. Australia has just released the ‘SDG Baseline for Australia,’ as it prepares its first Voluntary National Review for the 2018 HLPF.

At the end of 2017, the European Union released a report titled, ‘Sustainable Development in the European Union: Monitoring report on progress towards the SDGs in an EU context,’ which is based on a set of 100 indicators developed by the EU for this process. In mid-2017, the Government of Sri Lanka launched a report and website for reporting on the status of its SDG indicators at the national level. The publication identified 46 SDG indicators for which data is already available, and 29 indicators for which data could be compiled.

In January, DESA hosted a meeting on national platforms, where officials from national statistical systems and experts discussed how standardized national-level repositories could make global assessments more consistent.

Community Indicator Systems

Data collection at the local level is particularly important for this global agenda that seeks to “leave no one behind.” In many ways, local communities are the best placed to identify what should be counted and what is not currently being counted. The process of collecting this data can also prove to be an important project in itself, with local participation serving to educate and engage the community in the stories that the data can tell.

Community indicator systems offer a way for actors to track well-being at the local level. These efforts can also support the global assessment efforts by helping to make differentiated data available, to achieve the 2030 Agenda’s objective of leaving no one behind. During a recent webinar on localizing the SDGs in the North American context, sub-national efforts in British Columbia, Hawai’i, Winnipeg and Baltimore were revealed to all involve the use of community-level dashboards as one way to engage actors in sustainable development implementation.

Data Processing on the Road to 2030

As with SDG implementation itself, each of these levels of assessment feeds into and draws from the others. Global assessments offer an overall snapshot of where the international community is collectively moving. National governments can see how their contributions fit into the global picture, and consider where they can demonstrate leadership, or are falling short, compared to their peers. Local indicator systems can be tailored to specific challenges and opportunities in specific communities, drawing on and contributing to national level data.

Each iteration of this implied conversation contributes to the continuous learning that is required to implement the 2030 Agenda, as interlinkages among the targets are leveraged and success and failures are identified, and then incorporated into further action. And these data sources and lessons learned do not yet consider what big data sources might be able to add to this conversation.

For our part, we will continue to report on the new platforms and monitoring and evaluation projects that are being developed, as we help our readers answer whether we are “there” yet on the road towards 2030.","This policy brief introduces the monitoring tools that international organizations, national governments and local-level stakeholders are developing to assess SDG implementation.

The theme of this year’s World Water Day is ‘Nature for Water.’ According to the 2018 edition of the UN World Water Development Report (WWRD 2018) launched this week, if we want to address our planet’s current water challenges, we need to look to natural solutions. Sustainable water management cannot be achieved through business-as-usual. We must increase the use of so-called, nature-based solutions (WWRD 2018).

The global water cycle is facing many challenges. The overall water demand is increasing mainly because the global population is growing, economies are emerging, and consumption patterns are changing. Climate change is intensifying the water cycle, which means that dry areas are becoming drier and wet regions are becoming wetter. The majority of rivers in Africa, Asia, and Latin America have become more polluted, presumably due to population and economic growth as well as the lack of wastewater management systems. Over 5 billion people could be affected by water shortages by 2050. Simply put, our planet and societies are facing several severe water management challenges, and affordable and effective sustainable solutions are urgently needed.

Learning from Nature

The good news is – we don’t have to come up with brilliant new solutions. The natural world surrounding us offers a multitude of so-called nature-based solutions to conserve and rehabilitate water ecosystems, across all sectors, and particularly regarding sustainable agriculture and sustainable cities. Nature-based solutions (NBS) – actions that are inspired and supported by nature, and use, or mimic, natural processes to manage resources – provide multiple services to address these challenges and offer further benefits.

Constructed Wetlands are an example of an untapped low-tech, cost-effective NBS for pollution control, securing water supply, and improving agricultural resource management.

Constructed Wetlands are an example of an untapped low-tech, cost-effective NBS for pollution control, securing water supply, and improving agricultural resource management. They are engineered systems using the natural functions of soil, plants, and microorganisms to retain water and improve water quality. Moreover, they recycle nutrients (e.g. nitrogen and phosphorous), provide habitats and contribute to recreation, education, research, and landscape enhancement (under appropriate circumstances).

A study from the United Nations University (UNU-FLORES) shows that with the strategic introduction to an ecosystem at the collection and treatment point of wastewater, a community of 500 can irrigate about a hectare of agricultural land and fertilize five to seven hectares. Harvested plants from constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment can provide 12% of a village’s cooking fuel needs.

A constructed wetland has been installed along with a resettlement project in the City of Bayawan in the Philippines. Before, families living in informal areas directly discharged their wastewater into the sea. The City Health Office recorded a high number of cases arising from waterborne diseases (e.g. diarrhea). The settlement was relocated at the city outskirts and a new wastewater management system was built. The system consists of sewer pipes with small diameters and a combination of different types of constructed wetlands. Thanks to the new system, in total, people residing in 676 homes now benefit from safe sanitation and wastewater treatment. Moreover, coastal waters are protected from pollution and treated wastewater is reused in a horticulture and vegetable farming project.

More Knowledge Sharing is Needed

Though there are many such projects worldwide, there is a lack of information at all levels and the knowledge base on constructed wetlands needs to be improved. The Dresden-based institute of the UNU-FLORES is currently developing the Constructed Wetlands Knowledge Platform entailing an interactive map and a comprehensive database to assess the amount of wastewater treated globally by constructed wetlands and to support scientists, practitioners, decision-makers, and civil society in their efforts to establish this technology.

Nature-based solutions such as constructed wetlands can provide multiple benefits to local communities and the environment. Successful projects have been implemented around the world. Still, there is a lack of information on these nature-based solutions, such as constructed wetlands, addressing local water challenges. More projects, such as the one by UNU-FLORES, are needed to improve the knowledge base and its accessibility – so that more nature-based solutions can be implemented to enhance water availability, improve water quality, and reduce risks associated with water-related disasters and climate change.

Of particular relevance to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, the theme of the Day was ‘Forests and Sustainable Cities,’ to increase awareness of the contributions of forests to sustainable cities, from cooling the environment and saving energy to providing health benefits and drinking water, and building resilience against floods and storms.

A special event was organized at UN Headquarters in New York, US by the Secretariat of the UN Forum on Forests (UNFF), with participation from representatives of Member States, and international, regional and non-governmental organizations. The event featured an opening session chaired by UNFF 13 Chair Amb. Muhammad Shahrul Ikram Yaakob (Malaysia); a panel discussion on safeguarding forests for sustainable cities and communities; and a general discussion on forests, sustainable cities and the 2030 Agenda.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) celebrated the Day at a special ceremony at FAO headquarters in Rome, Italy attended by city administrators from Lima, Peru; Ljubljana, Slovenia; Philadelphia, US; and Mantova, Italy. The event featured the screening of the 2018 International Day of Forests video spot on forests and sustainable cities, and the launch of a FAO publication titled, ‘Forests and Sustainable Cities – Inspiring Stories from around the World.’ The publication highlights different ways in which cities around the globe have used forests and trees to improve the living conditions of their citizens, which may serve as inspiration for others. In 2012, Beijing, China initiated the largest afforestation programme in its history, which resulted in forests now covering more than 25% of the city plain. Karura forest in the central north of Nairobi, Kenya, once a crime-ridden area, has been saved from property development following a public campaign led by environmental activist Wangari Maathai, and has become a source of opportunities and recreation for local people and tourists. In Lima, a municipality afforestation project resulted in a park with trails and family recreation spaces while reducing the threat of natural disasters, including earthquakes and landslides.

Forests and trees in a city perform a huge range of functions, supporting – climate action; clean air; food, energy and water security; improved well-being; and social cohesion.

The latest issue of the FAO forestry publication ‘Unasylva’ is also devoted to urban forestry in celebration of the Day. Looking at urban and peri-urban forestry, including its benefits, pitfalls, governance and challenges, the issue shows that forests and trees in a city perform a huge range of functions, such as regulating climate, storing carbon, removing air pollutants, reducing the risk of flooding, assisting in food, energy and water security, improving the physical and mental health of citizens, and increasing social cohesion.

A special event was also held at the Palais des Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, organized by the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Housing and Land Management Unit, the UNECE/FAO Forestry and Timber Section and the FAO Liaison Office in Geneva. The event showcased unique ways in which forests have gone “vertical,” with speakers presenting innovative ideas on urban farming, wood construction and architecture.

On the occasion, the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO) circulated a new infographic illustrating the benefits that tropical forests provide cities. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) showcased the battle for reversing deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, made possible following the vision provided by the Government of Brazil and GEF support to create a network of protected areas and nature reserves. The Amazon Region Protected Areas programme, initiated in 2002, has exceeded all its targets and has recently been joined by two other key GEF-financed programmes. One will maintain tens of millions of hectares of forest land in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru; the other is an integrated project aiming to promote sustainable agriculture, which will reduce pressure on the dry forests adjoining the Amazon. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP or UN Environment) signed a memorandum of understanding with Ethiopian Airlines, focusing on greening the airlines operations. The memorandum outlines several action areas to promote sustainability, most notably the development of the ‘Plant one tree for every passenger flown’ project, in collaboration with the ongoing REDD+ programme in Ethiopia. The objective of the project is to plant nine million trees in the name of Ethiopian Airlines in different regions of Ethiopia.

Other recent developments of relevance included: two publications on REDD+ in Ethiopia and in Kenya; and the approval of a new US$33 million project, partly funded by GEF, to improve sustainable rural livelihoods and forest protection in Zambia. The publications examine, from a REDD+ point of view, the contribution of forests to national income in Ethiopia, and ways to improve efficiency in forestry operations and forest product processing in Kenya.

The water accounting reports are meant to support implementation of national development plans as well as the Sustainable Development Goal on clean water and sanitation (SDG 6).

Water accounting seeks to capture the value of water resources to the economy. The Botswana water accounts describe water use in the years 2015-2016. The Centre for Applied Research, Botswana, is drawing attention to the policy implications of the results, including the need to improve water-use efficiency, invest in non-conventional water resources, apply the knowledge gained in implementing Botswana’s Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) and development plans, and ensure stakeholder participation.

In a journal article titled, ‘Economic Accounting of Water: The Botswana Experience,’ published in ‘Physics and Chemistry of the Earth, Parts A/B/C,’ the authors highlight that, while public attention focuses mostly on water service providers, self-providers such as mines and the agricultural sector account for more than half of total water abstracted from the environment. They call for greater attention to the role of self-providers in IWRM implementation.

The Wealth Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services (WAVES) partnership, led by the World Bank, provided initial training and support for producing water accounts in Botswana. WAVES, which promotes the mainstreaming of natural resources in national economy accounts and development planning, has been working with countries since 2013 to develop approaches to ecosystem accounting based on the System of Environmental and Economic Accounts (SEEA). It has pilot sites in India, Peru, and the Philippines. The UN Statistical Commission recognizes SEEA as the international standard for environmental-economic accounting. Subsystems of SEEA focus on specific sectors, including energy, water, fisheries, agriculture, and land and ecosystems.

Monitoring of SDG 6.5 on IWRM and SDG 6.6 on protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems requires information on use of water resources and abstractions from the environment.

The 3rd Pacific Regional NDC Dialogue fleshed out the elements of the Regional Pacific NDC Hub, and provided an opportunity for Pacific island States to discuss NDC-related experiences and needs.

The NDC dialogue and consultations on the NDC Hub took place in Suva, Fiji, from 12-14 March 2018. During the meeting, countries exchanged experiences in NDC implementation, including implementing energy projects, reviewing and revising legislation to create a more enabling environment for NDC implementation, and establishing green energy funds. Participants elaborated on links between the NDCs and their national development plans, national energy plans and strategies, and SDG implementation.

Participants urged mainstreaming NDC implementation into national sectoral and budget processes, and identified challenges and barriers related to, inter alia, financing, capacity, and skills and data gaps. Many countries stated their desire to: enhance their NDCs by adding sectors such as transport, forestry and agriculture; strengthen the adaptation element in their NDCs; and communicate their ambitions through the Talanoa Dialogue. They also discussed opportunities for enhancing the gender responsiveness of NDCs and using NDC implementation to advance gender equality.

On identifying opportunities to translate NDCs into actionable projects, particularly in the energy sector, and linkages with sectoral planning, countries highlighted establishing energy committees, and developing projects in solar energy, biomass and hydropower. Participants underscored linkages between the NDCs and sectoral energy planning documents. Many emphasized that they are using existing sectoral energy strategies as NDC implementation plans.

On finance, participants stressed the need to develop financing strategies to support NDC implementation, including the development of investment plans, public-private partnerships (PPPs) and the creation of enabling environments for private sector investment.

Participants agreed on the details of the Regional Pacific NDC Hub in terms of services provided, as well as the funding mechanism, structure and governance, and finalized the draft design document based on national priorities and needs. They agreed that the Hub should provide assistance on enhancement, review and inclusion of adaptation, and guidance on synergies between mitigation and resilience.

The Regional Pacific NDC Hub is an arm of the NDC Partnership, which aims to enhance cooperation and countries’ access to the necessary technical knowledge and financial support for NDC implementation.

On new ideas for services to be provided by the Hub, they proposed, inter alia, NDC roadmaps beyond 2030, knowledge management platforms, support for national reporting, expansion of NDCs to new sectors, desegregating sectoral targets, and knowledge sharing with other regions.

On delivery mechanisms, participants suggested, inter alia, online NDC training, and strengthening national and regional knowledge management. They also supported reviving and improving the Regional Technical Support Mechanism by increasing the pool of experts including women, ensuring the use of local counterparts to retain local expertise, and providing unconditional funding and technical assistance.

On governance and steering of the Hub, participants agreed, inter alia, to build on existing structures and link to the Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific and Pacific Resilience Partnership (PRP).

Participants also agreed on the next steps for the Hub, including: discussing the link to the PRP at the PRP Task Force meeting in April 2018; establishing terms of reference (ToR) for the Hub’s management team; and tabling the dialogue’s outcomes at other regional meetings to get further regional buy-in on the positioning and nature of the Hub.

The event was co-organized by the UN Development Programme (UNDP), UNFCCC Secretariat, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), NDC Partnership, the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), the Pacific Community and the Government of Fiji.

Bruce Rittmann of Arizona State University, US, and Mark van Loosdrecht of Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands, were named 2018 Stockholm Water Prize laureates for their work in pioneering biotechnology-based processes for the treatment of water and wastewater. In their announcement, the SIWI committee noted that the two scientists had revolutionized the treatment of water for safe drinking and had refined the purification of polluted water for release or reuse, all while minimizing the energy footprint of water treatment technologies. The treatment processes they developed apply microbiological engineering to extract nutrients and other chemicals from wastewater. The Stockholm Water Prize will be presented to the winners at an award ceremony on 29 August in Stockholm, Sweden, during World Water Week.

On 21 March, the World Water Council and the Government of Morocco announced the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as winner of the King Hasan II Great World Water Prize, for its work on promotion and policy guidance for water security. The prize is awarded at the World Water Forum once every three years to recognize excellence in cooperation and sound management in the development and use of water resources. At the award ceremony during the Eighth World Water Forum in Brasilia, Brazil, OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría recalled that he had singled out water use as one of his top three priorities for the OECD 12 years ago. He called on governments to properly value water and factor it into decisions on agriculture and land use, urban development, energy, and adaptation to climate change.

Ministers from OECD countries adopted the Principles on Water Governance at the OECD Ministerial Council Meeting in June 2015, noting that water crises most often relate to crises of governance rather than to lack of water or technical knowledge. The OECD Council Recommendation on Water was adopted as a policy instrument in 2016. On the day the award was presented, the OECD also launched a report, ‘Implementing the OECD Principles on Water Governance.’ The report takes stock of the use and dissemination of the OECD Water Governance Principles, provides a water governance indicator framework, and describes evolving practices drawn from various countries and contexts.

Prior to these events, on 28 February, the World Water Council (WWC) and the Japan Water Forum announced the winner of the 5th Kyoto World Water Grand Prize. The 2018 winner is the Charité Chrétienne pour Personnes en Détresse (Christian Charity for People in Distress, or CCPD) from Togo. The Kyoto World Water Grand Prize is for grassroots organizations in developing countries that have shown outstanding performance in solving water issues.

The agreement creates one of the world’s largest trading blocks, and aims to dramatically increase intra-African trade by removing tariff and non-tariff barriers on goods and services.

African leaders from 44 countries signed the AfCFTA during the 10th Extraordinary Session of the African Union (AU) Summit. Leaders had agreed to hold the Extraordinary Session at the 30th Ordinary Session of the AU. At the AfCFTA signing ceremony, AU Chairperson Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda, said the AfCFTA represents the “culmination of a vision set forth nearly 40 years ago” in the Lagos Plan of Action, in which African leaders called for a continent-wide market.

According to the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), the agreement has the potential to increase intra-African trade by 52.3%. The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has estimated that eliminating intra-African tariffs could generate US$3.6 billion in welfare gains for Africa through cheaper goods and an increase in production.

The agreement is anticipated to benefit Africa’s small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which make up 80% of the region’s business, as well as women, who account for 70% of informal cross-border traders, and youth through employment opportunities. Apart from these advances towards the 2030 Agenda’s vision of leaving no one behind, the AfCFTA is an important step towards “achieving the SDGs and delivering on the African agenda of peace and prosperity,” said UN Secretary-General António Guterres. He said the entire UN system will support Africa as it moves towards the entry into force of the Free Trade Area, including through the Joint AU-UN Agreement for the implementation of Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda.

UNECA Executive Secretary Vera Songwe welcomed the agreement as “a giant strike forward in continental integration, in the pan-African vision and in the development of our continent.” Songwe also underscored the importance of maintaining momentum on the agreement through effective implementation. To track implementation, the UNECA launched the AfCFTA Country Business Index, a tool that aims to monitor progress on the AfCFTA through surveys of business opinions on the agreement’s impact on trade. The AfCFTA Country Business Index tool will rank countries in four areas: AfCFTA implementation; ease of trade; trade for development, the SDGs and Agenda 2063; and AfCFTA impact.

AfCFTA will enter into force once the required number of countries – 22 out of the AU’s 55 member States – have ratified the agreement. As for signatories, to date, Algeria, Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Cote d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Morocco, Mozambique, Niger, Rwanda, Saharawi Republic, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, the Seychelles, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Swaziland, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Western Sahara, and Zimbabwe have signed the AfCFTA.

A group of major retailers, including Ikea, Debenhams and Sainsbury's, have signed up to a series of commitments to collaboratively tackle pressing societal issues by using the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a framework.

More than 25 UK retailers have committed to the Better Retail Better World pledge, which aims to boost corporate alignment to SDGs covering decent work and economic growth, reduced inequalities, sustainable communities, responsible consumption and production and climate action.

As part of the collaborative group, retails such as Boots, John Lewis, Kingfisher and Marks & Spencer have all agreed to share knowledge and best practice in addressing the goals. Launched by the British Retail Consortium (BRC), the initiative will provide public updates on corporate progress against the SDGs.

Speaking at the launch of the initiative in Westminster this morning, BRC’s chairman Richard Pennycook said: “The penny has dropped, we realise we can do much more collectively than we can by competing on this particular ground…we’re launching something where the sector has held hands and said, ‘we can do this better together’.

“This is part of a growing movement for change. It is time for the retail industry to show what it can do for the common good. We are taking collective action to build a better, more prosperous and sustainable world, and demonstrating how we are making a positive contribution to society, in terms of the supply chain, food packaging, and waste.”

Race to restore

The UK retail sector employs around 3.2 million people and the BRC will work with retailers to address human rights issues, with tangible progress to be demonstrated by 2022. Signatories have pledged to reduce waste sent to landfill, measure all operational water use and progress responsible sourcing practices. Companies will also collaborate to eliminate links to deforestation by 2030 and reduce emissions and increase uptake of renewable energy.

Other retailers signing up to the Better Retail Better World pledge include Aldi, Baukjen Group, C&J Clarks, The Co-op, DFS, Dixons Carphone, Fenwicks, Greggs, The House of Bruar, House of Fraser, Lidl, Morrisons, Musgrave Group, Next, Ocado, Signet (Ernest Jones, H. Samuel), WHSmith and Wilko.

Commenting on the launch, WWF’s chief executive Tanya Steele said: “We are delighted to support the Better Retail Better World industry goals which provide BRC members with some of the best information and guidance to engage with the Sustainable Development Goals.

“The goals are what the SDGs are all about: bringing business, civil society and government together to bring about change in the world. Retail businesses working with consumers are key to the success of the SDGs and key in the race to restore nature.”

A collaborative commitment to the SDGs is welcome. The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)’s Reporting Matters initiative notes that 79% of Council members currently mention the SDGs in reports, but only 6% have highlighted tangible action against a target. Mentioning the SDGs is itself at danger of becoming a new tick-box activity, according to the WBCSD.

Speaking exclusively to edie, the BRC’s head of environment and project lead, Alice Ellison, explained that the members would focus on five goals where retailers could make the most impact, by shaping new commitments around the targets listed under relevant goals.

“We’ve used the SDGs as a framework to shape what retail should be doing rather than using the SDGs to highlight what we’ve been doing,” Ellison said. “We’re at the beginning of the journey and we want as many retailers on board, so we might stick with the same targets, or they might evolve over time.

“Our members have signed a commitment and although businesses will do their own thing on the SDGs, we realise that a collaborative approach is where you can make a real difference. There’s still a lack of government direction, and because there are so many targets in the goals, it can be difficult to focus. Most of the members have already mapped their actions.”

The state of retail

Britain's retail sector is in a state of tremendous change. The perfect storm of cost pressures, rising inflation and slowing wage growth has led to fluctuations in consumer confidence, while a series of unexpected political events – topped by Brexit – has instilled a feeling of uncertainty across the high street.

edie's 17-page sector summary report, produced with input from the BRC, seeks to answer this key question by building on the key findings from our own industry survey to outline five drivers, challenges and opportunities facing sustainability professionals across the retail sector.

46,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-paul-apostle-of-christ,"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,"SDG Reviews ‘Paul, Apostle of Christ’","Jim Caviezel co-stars as St. Luke the Evangelist in Affirm Films’ drama about the last days of St. Paul and the struggles of the Roman Christian community in the days of Nero.

“I expected more,” muses Mauritius, the Roman prefect of the Mamertine Prison, critically eying the frail, bald-headed, bewhiskered prisoner standing unsteadily before him.

Perhaps Mauritius is looking for some sign of the charisma and commanding presence that would mark a powerful leader of an infamous cult blamed for burning half the city — or possibly something to warrant the rumors of the prisoner’s supernatural powers and otherworldly character.

Either way, Mauritius wouldn’t have been the first to be less than impressed by the unimposing figure cut by Paul of Tarsus. (Per 2 Corinthians 10:10, Paul seems to have had a rap for being less powerful in person than his mighty letters would suggest.)

The year is A.D. 67, about a dozen years into the notorious reign of Nero, widely deemed responsible for the Great Fire of Rome and said to have scapegoated Rome’s Christian community, not just for the fire, but for hatred of humanity.

For this they were tortured and executed in heinous ways, including being nailed to crosses and set ablaze at night. (The depiction of the persecution is drawn from the Roman historian Tacitus; an opening title tacitly supports the late folk etymology of Nero’s human pyrotechnics giving rise to the term “Roman candle.”)

Paul, Apostle of Christ offers a compelling account the last days of St. Paul — played with gravel-voiced authority by James Faulkner (Game of Thrones; X-Men: First Class) — in a dungeon in the Mamertine Prison, facing execution for treason. It’s not the unmade epic about the life of Paul of Tarsus many would like to see, but what it is is worthwhile in its own right.

Writer-director Andrew Hyatt (Full of Grace) interweaves Paul’s story with two secondary story strands, one concerning Rome’s underground Christian community and the other involving the prefect Mauritius (Olivier Martinez) and his family.

Tying the story strands together is Paul’s old traveling companion, Luke the physician (Jim Caviezel). St. Luke slips quietly into Rome to visit Paul in prison and to bring from him some word of encouragement and guidance to the Roman Christians and the larger Christian world, in the process becoming entangled with Mauritius and his family.

The most dramatically and thematically interesting material emerges from the agonized deliberations of the Roman Christians under the de facto leadership of the missionary couple Priscilla and Aquila (Joanne Whalley and John Lynch), who are companions and fellow workers of Paul (mentioned as such several times in the New Testament).

Conflicting impulses divide the community: Should they remain in Rome, as light in the darkness? Should they seek a warmer welcome elsewhere? Or should they join other Romans opposed to Nero and oppose his tyranny by fighting fire with fire?

Even Priscilla and Aquila are split on whether to stay or go; there are no clear answers here. As for the question of fighting, when speaking to the community Luke strenuously repudiates this as contrary to the way and teaching of Christ — but when he talks to Paul about the horrors inflicted on the believers, he finds his conviction wavering. Though decisively rejected, the prospect and the plausibility of violence in the name of Christ is treated with a level of complexity welcome in such a film.

All of this means trouble at work for Mauritius; there’s also trouble at home. His wife, Irenica (Antonia Campbell-Hughes), is anxious about their daughter’s dangerous illness and worried that her husband may have incurred the wrath of the gods through lack of devotion — or deference toward his sectarian prisoner.

The prospect of a brutal but thoughtful pagan official with a seriously ill family member in a film like this raises the distinct possibility of a miraculous cure and a dramatic conversion. In Paul, Apostle of Christ, these possibilities are actually floated onscreen, which again suggests that the filmmakers may be thinking at least somewhat outside the box.

The conversations between Luke and Paul, which eventually lead to the sequel to Luke’s Gospel, the Acts of the Apostles, form the central arc. Paul recounts vignettes from his life to flashbacks of his early religious training and murderous opposition to what he sees as the heresy of Jesus' followers to his shattering Damascus Road encounter with Jesus Christ and his healing encounter with Ananias.

Luke and Paul have a comfortable relationship easing at times into good-natured banter, though it’s clear that Luke regards the “Old Man” with a species of awe, since everything Luke knows of Jesus has been mediated through Paul’s life and preaching.

If anything troubles Paul, it’s the weight of trauma he still carries from his early crimes as a persecutor of the Church. The stoning of Stephen (André Agius), the killing of a Christian child and other enormities weigh on him, heightened by visions in which he sees his victims standing silently as if bearing mute witness against him. The wordless resolution of this theme is perhaps the film’s most memorable and effective stroke.

Hyatt uses impressionistic slow motion for these visionary sequences, blended with flashback memories, breaking up what is otherwise a largely conversational film shot mostly in dimly lit interiors penetrated by atmospheric beams of light. (The most striking lighting effect involves a pagan offering made to a Roman deity — perhaps Asclepius, the god of medicine — represented as a vast disc-shaped visage like Rome’s famous Bocca della Verità, with bright beams blazing from its eyeholes like laser vision, ready to smite unworthy worshippers.)

At times the nonlinear storytelling leads to some ambiguity regarding the timeline. Some viewers might be confused by a reference in a closing scene to Paul’s two years under house arrest (with which the Book of Acts concludes). The reference is to Paul’s first Roman arrest before the Great Fire, a much less serious affair. (What’s especially tricky is that Paul’s surroundings in this scene are consistent with a house arrest, but the lodgings are not his own and two years don’t pass in the last minutes of the film.)

One oddity is the absence, even in dialogue, of other apostles, notably Peter, whose martyrdom in Rome is generally thought to have coincided closely with Paul’s. Presumably Peter would have been imprisoned like Paul or else with the underground Christian community, yet there’s no mention of him.

Hyatt is Catholic, so the silence about Peter in Rome — or even Linus and Clement, among his first successors as bishops of Rome — seems an odd missed opportunity. (On a subtle note, all the Roman Christian men have beards, which suggests that they’re probably mostly Jewish Christians with an occasional Greek like Luke. I would have liked to see a few clean-shaven Latin faces.)

Shot on a budget and a tight schedule in Malta (where Gladiator and Troy, and more recently Risen, were shot), Paul, Apostle of Christ is remarkably authentic-looking. The screenplay is intelligent and thoughtful, with only occasional missteps, ranging from an occasional poorly chosen phrase (like Luke’s “thoughts and prayers”) to a late moment in which a character who has suffered a trauma more dangerous than Paul’s floggings is up and about far too quickly.

Paul, Apostle of Christ is dedicated to all who have been persecuted for their faith. This potentially raises a sticky point.

Jesus warned Christians to expect persecution, and from his own crucifixion until today the Church has never been without opposition. Today, in fact, Christians around the world are being persecuted as never before. Yet at times the memory or idea of persecution has outstripped the reality.

After the legalization of Christianity by Constantine, Christians often looked back on the early centuries of the Church as a period of constant, ferocious persecution by one Roman emperor after another. In reality, with notable exceptions (including the persecutions of Nero and especially Diocletian), persecution was generally sporadic, haphazard and not state-sponsored. (Some skeptical historians have even questioned the Neronian persecution, though its historicity is accepted by most scholars.)

In our day, global persecution notwithstanding, American Christians are generally far less aggrieved than many of us are inclined to think. It’s easy to imagine many comfortable viewers watching Paul, Apostle of Christ as if it were not only a story of our heritage, and one that resonates with the experiences of suffering souls around the world, but a mirror of our own experience.

On the other hand, the film’s clear repudiation of violence in the name of Christ, its repudiation of efforts to seize the reins of power by any means necessary, and its theme of seeing enemies as human beings are especially welcome today. Sometimes in the effort to resist evil one risks becoming what one opposes, or worse. Paul, Apostle of Christ suggests that it’s always better to suffer evil than to be brought to its level in resisting it.

47,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-a-wrinkle-in-time,"Fri, 09 Mar 2018 08:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘A Wrinkle in Time’,"Disney’s reimagining of Madeleine L’Engle’s faith-inflected sci‑fi fantasy classic wants to inspire young viewers, but it’s afraid to ask anything of them — and even more afraid of the book’s religious themes.

“If it’s bad art,” Madeleine L’Engle once wrote, “it’s bad religion, no matter how pious the subject.”

Ava DuVernay’s adaptation of L’Engle’s A Wrinkle in Time is not religious in the same way as the beloved, faith-inflected sci-fi fantasy novel about three children — 13-year-old Meg Murray, her 5-year-old brother Charles Wallace and their 14-year-old friend Calvin — embarking on an interstellar quest for the Murrays’ long-absent father with the aid of three mysterious celestial beings.

Still, the movie has a religious dimension of a sort. Like Disney’s last PG-rated sci-fi fantasy, Brad Bird’s Tomorrowland, A Wrinkle in Time can be seen as a kind of secular faith-based film, no less insistent and heavy-handed about its gospel of inclusion, respect and self-esteem than, say, last year’s The Shack with its own gospel of therapeutic faith. Whatever you think of the message, such ham-fisted art undermines it.

Here is a sentence I did not expect to write: The film’s portrayal of the otherworldly Mrs. Ws — Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which — makes the depiction of the Holy Trinity in The Shack profound and numinous by comparison.

The Shack had Octavia Spencer as God the Father (or Papa); A Wrinkle in Time has Oprah Winfrey as the formidable Mrs. Which. Mrs. Whatsit and Mrs. Who are played by Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling, respectively.

Apparently if there’s a trio of unearthly, ageless personages assuming human form in order to guide members of our species on a journey of discovery, they will probably be played by a diverse trio of actors with an African-American woman presiding in some way. (A kind of Della Reese Principle?)

I can roll with that, and if I can roll with a movie imagining God choosing to appear to someone looking like Spencer (and I kind of can), I’m certainly willing to accept Oprah as — well, whatever kind of higher being this Mrs. Which is supposed to be. (The book explicitly identifies the Mrs. Ws as angels, but the movie never says what they are.)

The problem isn’t exactly Oprah, Witherspoon or Kaling, though it isn’t exactly not them, either. The problem is that, for all the colorfully extravagant costume design and glittery makeup, their characters are at best whimsical but not really odd or and never mysterious or compelling. They barely rise to the level of kooky shtick, and engender no sense of higher wisdom or even emotional connection.

I had problems with The Shack, but at least when Spencer told Sam Worthington that he had no idea how much she loved him, I accepted that coming from her.

Not only does Witherspoon’s Mrs. Whatsit never tell Meg (Storm Reid) that she loves her (a line that in the book turns out to have crucial plot significance), I wouldn’t believe her if she did, since nothing we see of her manifests the slightest comprehension either of love or of Meg.

I loved DuVernay’s Selma, and I care about diversity and representation in cinema. L’Engle’s book has been important to me since childhood, not least because of the religious themes, though I’ve never been a purist for adaptations. A daringly reimagined adaptation can honor the original far more than a dully literal version.

This version shifts L’Engle’s story, with its rural mid-20th century setting and white characters, to a diverse, contemporary L.A.-area setting (early scenes were shot in a middle-class Compton neighborhood). Meg is now the only child of an interracial couple (Chris Pine and Gugu Mbatha-Raw) and her almost mystically gifted younger brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe, of Filipino descent) is now adopted.

On occasion it seems the story hasn’t been rethought enough. In the book, when Calvin (Levi Miller) shows up near the Murrays’ remote house at night, Charles Wallace demands to know why he’s there. When the same line is uttered on an urban sidewalk in broad daylight, it makes no sense in that quotidian setting. Why shouldn’t Calvin be there?

The whole movie suffers from that loss of atmosphere. It’s not just that the atmosphere is different; there’s just so little atmosphere of any kind.

“Wild nights are my glory,” says Mrs. Whatsit in a line straight from the book, but it’s only raining; the book’s howling winds and perilous storm don’t make it to Compton.

Some things about the book are relatively unfilmable. The climactic manifestation of evil, for instance, works on the printed page, but it would probably look ridiculous and anticlimactic onscreen.

Yet a fateful scene in which Charles falls under a malign influence that Meg and Calvin barely escape is creepy and dreadful in ways that could translate powerfully to film. Here it’s staged on a crowded beach, and it’s over before you know it.

There is exactly one exception: one of the book’s most unsettling effects, as the children arrive on the dark planet of Camazotz, they encounter an eerie suburban neighborhood in which children bounce balls in perfect union and rhythm, and respond to their mother’s calls to dinner at exactly the same time.

This one faithfully reproduced sequence has not been rethought or updated; the neighborhood and the mothers’ wide-skirted house dresses would be at home in a literal period adaptation.

Yet even here something important is missing: the maternal anxiety of the woman whose boy is dangerously, unrhythmically out of step. One of L’Engle’s themes is how society punishes misfits and oddballs, especially those with misunderstood gifts who haven’t yet learned to be comfortable in their own skins.

L’Engle’s Meg is an awkward misfit: angry, resentful and self-pitying; gifted, though not on her younger brother’s level. (Mr. and Mrs. Murray, both brilliant scientists, are also oddballs; only the twins Sandy and Dennys, dropped in the film, are normal.)

Yet the filmmakers, burdened by the cultural import of a $100-million sci-fi fantasy starring an African-American girl, can’t bear for Meg to have real faults or to be anything less than a positive model for girls and children of color.

So, instead of being a misfit, Meg is bullied by a clique of mean girls who leave her a note on the anniversary of her father’s disappearance suggesting that she should disappear too. Meg lashes out violently at one of them, but she’s only standing up for her little brother. It’s theoretically bad behavior, but the audience expects it — and it seems to impress Calvin.

The principal, a wholly sympathetic authority figure with nothing of the book’s prickly Mr. Jenkins but the name, tells Meg that she shuts people out and then wonders why they don’t like her, but we don’t see this behavior.

Meg is constantly affirmed and reassured; except for Mrs. Whatsit, everyone keeps telling how talented and capable she is, if she would only accept it. Yet the film sells short Meg’s gifts by fearing the story’s intellectual underpinnings, where Meg’s gifts shine.

One of the book’s most memorable bits — a scene that expanded my mind when I read it as a boy, and still shapes my thinking today — involves an explanation of space-time and the idea of a tesseract: a folding (or wrinkling) of space-time via a fifth dimension to travel instantly between vastly distant locations. (“The shortest distance between two points is not a straight line.”)

A version of this scene was shot for the film, with Meg herself presenting the principle in class (complete with a plastic model of an ant taking the place of the imaginary ant in the book’s in-text illustrations). A scene like this could have showcased the side of Meg the filmmakers want viewers to see: brainy and academically capable.

Alas, it seems this was too cerebral or something, and was cut. Now the idea of a tesseract is given a rushed explanation in a scene with Mr. and Mrs. Murray, and the key visual is only glimpsed in a computer animation in the background. How can filmmakers inspire young viewers if they’re afraid to ask anything of them?

The finished film tries to highlight Meg’s gifts in a ridiculous invented action scene evocative of a young-adult apocalyptic survival movie. “It’s a physics thing,” she says modestly, but the stunt they’ve just tried is the sort of thing that only works in video games and movies that are too much like video games.

The need to present an affirmative image extends to Meg’s parents. I appreciate the warmly rendered early scenes with the Murrays all together before Mr. Murray’s disappearance. Yet for all her father’s apologies to Meg for having left her and the family, the film doesn’t dare to touch on Meg’s deep disappointment on being reunited with her father and discovering that he isn’t the all-powerful figure capable of setting all to rights that she’d built him up to be in her mind.

Kaling’s Mrs. Who still speaks in quotations, although her frequent biblical references have all been excised, and there are fewer classical and historical references and more Outkast and Lin-Manuel Miranda. She doesn’t come across as someone who has trouble verbalizing; she just says quotes for no reason.

The dropping of the Biblical references is not incidental. When Mrs. Who quotes 1 John — “The light shineth in the darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not” — that has thematic significance: The darkness, the Dark Thing, is strong, but light is stronger; this is not a dualistic, Manichaean story.

The movie’s tagline — “The only thing faster than light is the darkness” — seems to reverse this: Darkness has a natural advantage. The line doesn’t appear in the book, and I doubt L’Engle would approve. (That the movie conflates the darkness — the Dark Thing — with It, which is merely a local manifestation of darkness on Camazotz, is just one more disconnect.) Compared to this, Disney’s Narnia films retained far more of the Christian milieu of Lewis’ stories.

The aversion to religion is nowhere more evident than in the rousing enumeration of the Earth’s great fighters against the darkness. In the book, Jesus is given the first place, though there are others: artists and scientists (Leonardo, Shakespeare, Bach, Curie, Einstein) as well as Christian and non-Christian religious figures (Buddha and St. Francis as well as Gandhi).

The report notes a limited participation of local and regional governments and their partners in the global SDG thematic reviews at the UN High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), which could be attributed to a lack of awareness of the relevance of the HLPF and/or to a lack of resources to engage.

The report titled, ‘Local and Regional Governments in the Follow-up and Review of Global Sustainability Agendas,’ is published by Cities Alliance and adelphi, and co-authored by the African Centre for Cities (ACC), the German Development Institute, and the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. It was launched on 12 February 2018, during the ninth session of the World Urban Forum (WUF 9) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

The report notes that while the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement and the New Urban Agenda acknowledge the central role of national governments in follow-up and review, sustainable urban development is not yet the global priority that it should be. It also indicates that involvement of local and regional governments in UN processes related to sustainable development is made through the same modalities as those aimed at NGOs. However, it adds, unlike other major groups or constituencies, local and regional governments do not usually represent the interests of a particular group or electoral constituency, but advocate for the interests of all citizens in their jurisdiction.

On data and accountability, the report notes that existing initiatives to increase urban data availability and quality are highly fragmented and geographically uneven, which leads to a lack of consistent data “on how (and how much)” the local level is contributing to meeting national and international targets. It adds that multiple reports and other inputs feed into the follow-up and review of each agenda, which “raises questions regarding the best strategies for streamlining, compiling, structuring and including local and urban perspectives and data.” The authors recommend to support and scale up efforts to harmonize the indicators and methodologies used to collect data on the activities of local and regional governments and their partners. They also highlight the need to embed data collection efforts and reports in processes of collective evaluation and opportunities for peer learning, using fora such as regional follow-up and review processes supported by the UN regional commissions.

On implementation capacities, the report calls on national governments to understand how national legal, institutional and financial frameworks influence action by local and regional governments. It recommends institutionalizing engagement of local and regional governments and relevant local actors as key players in national processes to revise national sustainability strategies, urban policies and climate change policies.

On partnerships, the report points to the importance of multi-stakeholder partnerships to foster inclusiveness, mobilize and share knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources. It proposes launching an urban data partnership under the umbrella of existing initiatives, such as the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD), to identify data gaps at the local and regional levels and ways to address them. It also recommends evaluation of activities of partnerships and other initiatives that self-register in existing global registries and platforms.

On strengthening synergies in follow-up and review across the three agendas, the report proposes to: address synergies across all three agendas in the quadrennial New Urban Agenda implementation report; emphasize local synergies and interlinkages across the SDGs and the other global agendas during the HLPF thematic reviews, including identifying specific ways in which the agendas reinforce or undermine each other; and encourage national governments to explicitly address urban sustainability issues and synergies between the three agendas in all relevant national reports and inputs for global follow-up and review processes.

Its outcomes will serve as a contribution to the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum (HLPF).

The Eighth Regional 3R Forum convened from 9-12 April 2018, in Indore, India. Its outcomes include: a dialogue among Asian mayors and city authorities on how the 3Rs and resource efficiency can make their cities sustainable; a declaration by cities; the launch of a report on the state of 3Rs in the region; and awards recognizing Indian recipients for their contributions to the 3Rs in their country.

The Eighth Forum’s theme, ‘Achieving Clean Water, Clean Land and Clean Air through 3R and Resource Efficiency – A 21st Century Vision for Asia – Pacific Communities,’ focused on how the 3Rs, resource efficiency, and promoting the principles of a circular economy can contribute to achieving the targets of SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15 (life on land). For example, a plenary session devoted to water noted how street cleaning, improved waste management infrastructure and practices, no open defecation, and basic sanitation services can reduce water pollution and water scarcity, improve the provision of clean drinking water, and reduce vector- and water-borne diseases, as well as improve resilience to natural disasters.

A plenary session on air examined how cleaner streets and the prevention of open trash burning reduces asthma and other respiratory illnesses. Participants also discussed ways to switch from the common practice in Asia of burning agricultural wastes such as rice straw, which reduces air quality, to recycling the wastes to produce bio-ethanol for use as fuel and chemical inputs.

Other plenary sessions addressed: how 3R principles and strategies can contribute to protecting coastal and marine ecosystems from land-based activities, particularly marine litter; how to “green” small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and get them involved in the circular economy; 3Rs technologies appropriate for addressing special waste issues, such as plastics, e-waste and medical wastes; and financing 3R infrastructure and programs. A parallel event examined strategies for addressing marine litter in the South Asia region.

During the Forum, a parallel Asian Mayors’ Policy Dialogue convened on the theme, ‘Achieving Clean Water, Clean Land and Clean Air through 3Rs and Resource Efficiency,’ co-chaired by the mayor and commissioner of the host city of Indore, respectively, Malini Laxman Singh Gaur and Manish Singh. The Dialogue discussed the contribution of the 3Rs to achieving the 2030 Agenda and the New Urban Agenda (NUA). Guar and Singh discussed Indore’s efforts to meet the seven targets of SDG 11 before the 2030 deadline, including efforts on housing, transport, participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning, municipal waste management, green and clean public spaces, and disaster and climate resilience. Special sessions of the Mayors’ Policy Dialogue addressed waste challenges specific to Asian cities such as plastics, chemical wastes, e-waste and medical wastes.

The Mayors’ Policy Dialogue concluded with the signing of the ‘Indore 3R Declaration on Achieving Clean Water, Clean Land and Clean Air in Cities’ by mayors and city authorities of 37 Asian cities. The declaration calls for collective efforts on 3R and resource efficiency and the signatory cities pledge to, inter alia:

Accelerate holistic waste management;

Implement local-level actions to make cities clean, safe, smart, resilient, resource efficient, inclusive and sustainable;

Partner with civil society organizations (CSOs), including integration of the informal recycling sector with the formal waste management chain;

Work towards a complete ban on the use of plastics in eco-sensitive or eco-fragile areas, including in tourist areas close to oceans, rivers, lakes, wetlands and other water bodies;

Work for wastewater treatment and reuse; and

Focus on effective management of special waste streams such as micro-plastics, chemical wastes, e-waste and medical waste.

Two more cities signed the Declaration before the close of the Forum, and it remains open to signature by other Asian cities through 2030.

The Forum also launched a report titled, ‘State of the 3Rs in Asia and the Pacific.’ Mandated by the sixth Forum in 2015, the report is envisioned as a regular assessment of Forum member State progress towards achieving the commitments in the Ha Noi 3R Declaration (2013-2023) adopted at the fourth meeting held in 2013 in Ha Noi, Viet Nam. The 2018 report makes a series of recommendations, including: highlighting 3Rs as part of the global sustainability agenda, particularly SDG 12; continued prioritization of resource productivity, waste prevention and reduction activities; ensuring comparable and credible data across countries in Asia and the Pacific; and giving greater attention to e-waste, marine litter and coastal plastic waste, micro-plastics, food waste and food loss issues in the region.

The Eighth Regional 3R Forum was organized by the UN Centre for Regional Development (UNCRD), Japan’s Ministry of the Environment (MOEJ), and India’s Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). It was attended by delegates from 45 countries, including government representatives of 28 Forum participating countries.

Created by the East Asia Environment Ministers Meeting in 2008 based on a proposal by Japan, the Forum is intended as a framework for high-level policy dialogue on the 3Rs among central and local governments, international organizations, aid agencies, research bodies, NGOs and the private sector. As of the Fifth Forum held in Surabaya, Indonesia, the platform was extended to include participation by Pacific nations, particularly the Pacific small island developing States (P-SIDS).

The set of 27 Policy Briefs on SDG 7 and interlinkages with other SDGs includes a new Global Agenda for Accelerated SDG 7 Action. The Global Agenda is intended to serve as roadmap towards achieving universal energy access by 2030 and maximizing its positive impact on other SDGs.

The launch event took place on 18 April 2018, at the UN Headquarters in New York, US. The multi-stakeholder SDG 7 Technical Advisory Group was convened by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) to support the review of SDG 7 at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) in July 2018. The Advisory Group is comprised of representatives of 50 organizations, including 21 from the UN system, as well governments, other international organizations and stakeholders.

The proposed Global Agenda for Accelerated SDG 7 Action aims to catalyze time-bound and measurable actions, grouped into four interlinked categories:

Advancing SDG 7 implementation through: prioritizing clean-cooking solutions; closing the electricity access gap; accelerating the pace of transition towards renewable energy; scaling up investments in energy efficiency across all sectors of the economy; doubling global financing for SDG 7; scaling up capacity-building and education; enhancing innovation; and investing in data collection systems and data analysis.

through strengthening cooperation at the regional level and prioritizing ending energy poverty in the most vulnerable countries. Accelerating the transformation towards a sustainable and inclusive future by: promoting transformative investments; transforming human behavior from energy-intensive lifestyles to more sustainable patterns; strengthening decision-making through improvements in energy data collection, indicators and monitoring; and harnessing the power of all stakeholders to drive change.

Marcel Alers, UN Development Programme (UNDP), introduced the policy brief on financing SDG 7. He noted that there is a big financing gap for universal access to clean fuels, with current annual investment at US$240 million, versus annual funding needs of US$4.4 billion to 2030. He cautioned that investment is not spread equally, with developed and middle-income countries being able to access finance while many developing countries are currently left out. He emphasized that annual global financing for SDG 7 needs to double, from the current level of US$500 billion to US$1 to 1.2 trillion per year by 2030. He stressed that private finance is central to meeting SDG 7.

Noting that around 90% of the population is at risk of heart and lung disease due to air pollution exposure caused by inefficient use of energy, Maria Neira, the World Health Organization (WHO), presented the policy brief on energy and health. She announced that on 2 May WHO will launch new statistics on air pollution. She also underscored that all SDG 7 targets are critical enablers for universal health coverage and will advance progress towards achievement of SDG 3 (health).

Presenting the brief on energy and education (SDG 4), Rakshya Rajyashwori Thapa, UN International Children’s Fund (UNICEF), said 300 million children are affected by the lack of energy in schools, 60% of which are girls. She noted that youth literacy levels are lower in countries with electrification rates below 80%, adding that efforts to electrify schools have lagged behind. She explained that the publication recommends, inter alia, adopting policies that incentivize and prioritize investment in energy access in the education sector, and catalyzing support through stakeholder engagement, public advocacy and outreach to influence decision makers.

Noting that more than 1 billion people lack access to electricity and more than 3 billion lack access to clean cooking, with women bearing the greatest burden of this energy poverty, Sheila Oparaocha, Executive Director, ENERGIA, presented the document on energy and gender (SDG 5). She said the publication recommends, inter alia: establishing gender responsive global and national energy sector policies; promoting and investing more in clean cooking technologies; and reducing barriers in the energy industry for women, while also increasing their representation in national and global energy bodies.

Rabia Ferroukhi, International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), spoke about the role of SDG 7 in achieving SDG 8 (decent jobs and economic growth). She noted that renewable energy deployment has led to growing employment, and predicted that this trend will accelerate. She explained that the policy brief on energy and jobs recommends, inter alia: designing active labor market policies to respond to evolving market needs; coordinating education and training policies with the needs of the renewable energy sector; ensuring that jobs are decent; and undertaking measures to minimize disruptions in the energy transition through social protection measures and retraining efforts.

Sheila Watson, FIA Foundation, presented the policy brief on energy and transport (related to SDG 11). She explained that transport is the single largest energy user in many developed countries, while transport energy demand has been rising faster than in any other sector. She noted that energy consumption in the transport sector will continue to grow predominantly in developing countries. To respond to these trends, she said the publication recommends, inter alia:

implementing fuel economy policies to improve the efficiency of light and heavy duty vehicles and promoting electric and zero emission vehicles;

improving the efficiency of trucks, including fuel economy standards, and ‘green freight’ initiatives, including consolidated logistics;

phasing out fossil-fuel subsidies;

investing in safe walking and cycling infrastructure;

addressing emissions from international aviation and maritime transport; and

accelerating research in efficient batteries and energy storage systems.

Fekitamoeloa Katoa ‘Utoikamanu, High Representative, UN Office of the High Representative of Least Developed Countries (UN-OHRLLS), said we must ensure that the most vulnerable will not be left behind. She identified two areas of action as essential: capacity building for countries on policy and project design for SDG 7; and facilitating access to finance for the most vulnerable countries. She added that political leadership and national strategies are essential for the achievement of SDG 7.

In the ensuing discussion, Denmark suggested reflecting this approach to SDG 7 in the HLPF Ministerial Declaration, and to highlighting at next year’s HLPF under the UN General Assembly (UNGA) that SDG 7 is essential to achieving all the other SDGs. Supported by Pakistan, she emphasized the need to focus on SDG 7 also as part of the Climate Summit to take place in September 2019 in New York, US. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) underscored the need for a conversation about rebalancing budgets to support sustainable energy. Other stakeholders focused on the need for rights-based approaches to partnerships that involve indigenous communities and to ensure inclusive benefits for them.

In 2016, the average UN staff member produced 554 kilograms of waste.

The campaign promotes the “three Rs” approach to waste management: reduce, reuse, recycle. It suggests behaviors that UN staff can adopt to affect the amount of waste produced and support the SDGs. The website provides logos and posters that can be adapted for each location, as well as fact sheets and a guidance manual for staff with responsibility for facilities and environmental management.

In another initiative involving UN staff, the UN Food Gardens (UNFG) have been established at UN Headquarters in New York, US, upon a voluntary staff initiative. The Gardens promote environmental responsibility, food security, small-scale urban agriculture and community building, while also showcasing how to grow food in an urban landscape.

UNFG is engaged in various partnerships and initiatives to achieve these aims. It exchanges its produce for coffee grounds from the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Cafeteria, to use as compost, and in the last half of 2017 the efforts brought composting capacities to 400 kg. With UN-Habitat, UNFG hosted ‘Feed Your City,’ which showcased small-scale urban agriculture initiatives in the Americas. The project aims to motivate policy actions related to SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being, SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 15 (life on land), as well as to the New Urban Agenda (NUA). The project has reached around 30,000 people.

UNFG also hosts an annual youth event, which focuses on urban agriculture, resilience, community engagement and food security, and aims to ensure that the voices of youth are heard in implementation of the SDGs. In northern summer 2018, UNFG will launch a partnership with the International Fund for Agriculture and Development (IFAD) to showcase equipment used by small-scale farmers in the field, highlighting the importance of technological innovation to promote food security. UNFG also partners with the NYC GreenThumb Programme, Brooklyn Grange, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP), among others.

56,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/hotel-study-makes-business-case-for-achieving-sdg-12-3/,"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Hotel Study Makes Business Case for Achieving SDG 12.3,"5 April 2018: A “first-of-its-kind” cost-benefit analysis of food waste in the hospitality industry found that participating hotels were able to reduce food waste by approximately 21% in just one year, saving US$7 for every dollar invested. Titled, ‘The Business Case for Reducing Food Loss and Waste: Hotels,’ the findings have been welcomed by industry and sustainability actors for their potential contribution towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 12.3, which seeks to halve food waste by 2030.

The report was co-authored by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and sustainability organization WRAP, with support from Walmart Foundation and the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Netherlands. Dave Lewis, Group Chief Executive of Tesco and Chair of Champions 12.3, which commissioned the study, emphasized the need to take action right across the food chain in order to achieve SDG 12.3. It is estimated that one-third of all food produced in the world is never eaten, with food loss and waste accounting for around US$940 billion in economic losses and eight percent of global greenhouse gas emissions annually. At the same time, some 800 million people do not have enough food to eat.

Based on a sample of 42 hotel firms in 15 countries, the study found that the majority were able to achieve a 7:1 return on investment from buying less food and thereby reducing purchase costs, increasing revenue from new menu items developed from leftovers or foods previously considered “scraps,” and lower waste management costs. According to the study report, nearly 90 percent of sites were able to keep their total investment below $20,000, which was less than one percent of sales on average, with more than two-thirds recouping their investment costs within one year.

Yolanda Kakabadse, Board Member of the World Wildlife Fund US, stated that reducing food waste within the hospitality sector provides a unique opportunity not only to influence an industry, but to raise awareness with travelers globally. Marcus Gover, Chief Executive of WRAP, called for a “momentum for change in all hotels,” noting the study had clearly demonstrated that with simple measures, hotels can save money, protect the environment and still satisfy the needs of their customers.

The report outlines five actions for hotel owners and managers: measure the amount of food being wasted to know where to prioritize efforts; engage staff; re-think the buffet; reduce overproduction; and re-purpose excess food. It further proposes that by working together, businesses may also be able to share new best practices to make an even greater impact.

The report follows a 2017 study titled, ‘The Business Case for Reducing Food Loss and Waste,’ and is the first in a series of papers examining the business case for specific industry sectors. Analyses of the catering and restaurant industries are expected to be released in 2018.

57,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/delegates-debate-scope-of-migration-compact/,"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Delegates Debate Scope of Migration Compact,"6 April 2018: Delegates debated the root causes of migration that the Global Compact on Migration should address, whether the text should include new commitments, as well as whether to emphasize the non-legally binding nature of the document. Many supported a strong focus on children and the gender dimension of migration, with Australia calling to also add reference to people with disabilities. This third round of intergovernmental negotiations on the Compact convened from 3-6 April 2018, in New York, US.

The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration is being prepared for adoption at an intergovernmental conference to convene from 10-11 December 2018, in Morocco. Negotiations on the text are taking place in six rounds between February and July 2018, in New York, led by co-facilitators Jürg Lauber, Permanent Representative of Switzerland, and Juan José Gómez Camacho, Permanent Representative of Mexico.

While Jamaica noted that all migration brings positive development outcomes, Austria, for a group of 27 European States, and China said that, when mentioning the positive role of migration in development, the text needs to read “regular” migration.

Many countries, including Austria, for a group of 27 European States, Norway and Australia, welcomed the stronger language of the revised draft on human rights and the protection of vulnerable migrants. Russia said the strong language on human rights is not justified.

Brazil, for the community of Portuguese speaking countries, Austria for a group of 27 European States, Norway, and Mexico welcomed strengthening the gender dimension of migration in the text.

Comoros, for the African Group, and Ethiopia stressed that the root causes of migration such as poverty and development would require the implementation of projects in countries of origin, thus call for a new, separate objective and actionable area on international cooperation on financial support for countries of origin to implement projects that address the root causes of migration, as well as for a special fund and a capacity building mechanism. Austria, for a group of 27 European States, expressed concern that the language on root causes of migration – such as corruption, access to justice, respect of human rights, good governance, rule of law, and strong civil society – has been reduced. South Africa noted that conflict as root cause would be better placed in the Global Compact on Refugees, while in the Global Compact on Migration, the root cause should be underdevelopment and addressed through, inter alia: infrastructure development; market access; investment in agriculture; technology transfer; investment in education and training; and respecting official development assistance (ODA) commitments.

Chile, for a group of countries including Mexico, Nepal, Philippines, Uruguay, Brazil, and Bangladesh, said paragraph 39 of the revised draft, which recognizes “the discretion of all States to determine their national legislation and policies with regards to the implementation of the actions envisaged in this Global Compact” is problematic as it leaves it to the discretion of the Member States to implement the actionable commitments and weakens an already nonbinding document. China insisted on changing the term “actionable commitments” in “policy options and best practices,” explaining that the Compact should not create new commitments for Member States. Brazil stressed that the sovereignty of the State is not absolute, but it is limited by international law. Thus, States are sovereign to decide who are irregular and regular migrants, within the parameters of international law. Japan called for flexibility in implementation and follow-up. Austria, for a group of 27 European States, and Australia warned against using prescriptive language in the text, suggesting “should” or “could” instead of “must” or “commit.”

Several countries, including the African Group, Chile, for a group of countries including Mexico, Nepal, Philippines, Uruguay, Brazil, and Bangladesh, Tuvalu, and the Holy See welcomed the inclusion of reference to migrants affected by the slow onset of climate displacement in the document. Nauru, for the Pacific Small Island Developing States (P-SIDS), said the Compact should include calls for the international community to plan for the management and support of climate-related migration. Ethiopia said climate change and natural disasters should be approached as root causes and addressed under each objective and actionable area. Canada called for adding language on climate migration in the Guiding Principles section. China said climate change causes refugees and not migrants, thus it should be addressed in the Global Compact for Refugees. Russia requested the deletion of references to the Paris Agreement on climate change and to the UN Convention to Combat Diversification (UNCCD).

The African Group and the Holy See called for the abolishment of migration detention camps and detention of migrants. Pakistan noted that the draft focuses too much on drivers of migration in countries of origin and too little on creating opportunities in destination countries. Austria, for a group of 27 European States, and Australia called for emphasizing the duty of nations to accept the return of their nationals, consistent with human rights law.

Jamaica, for the Group of Friends of Children and the SDGs, called for measures to support family reintegration and for legal pathways for low-skilled families to migrate with their children. The need to protect migrant children was also emphasized by Chile, for a group of countries including Mexico, Nepal, Philippines, Uruguay, and Bangladesh, Brazil, for the community of Portuguese speaking countries, Guatemala, Turkey, Venezuela, Norway, Mexico, Panama and the Republic of Moldova.

On implementation and follow-up and review, Austria for a group of 27 European States, expressed hope to receive a proposal on the capacity building mechanism, information on the financial implications of the proposals in the text, as well as clarifications of who are the actors involved in each of the proposals (States regions, the UN, stakeholders).

Several countries, including China and Russia, requested clear emphasis in the text on the non-legally binding nature of the Compact. Bangladesh and Uganda stressed that references that the document is not legally binding makes the text weak.

The next round of negotiations will take place from 14-18 May 2018 in New York, US.

58,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/parties-provide-inputs-to-talanoa-dialogue/,"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Parties Provide Inputs to Talanoa Dialogue,"2 April 2018: Since January 2018, the Talanoa Dialogue Platform has been receiving submissions from UNFCCC Parties and non-Party stakeholders on the three questions of the Dialogue: Where are we? Where do we want to go? How do we get there? This summary provides a brief overview of some of the submissions received from Parties regarding the three questions.

Inputs that were submitted before 2 April will be included in the report to be presented at the UN Climate Change Conference convening in Bonn, Germany, from 30 April to 10 May. Those received after 2 April will be included in the report to the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC.

Party submissions thus far include those from Australia, China, Ethiopia, the EU, Fiji, Indonesia, Norway, Palestine, Saint Lucia for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and Saudi Arabia for the Arab Group. Input has also been provided by Switzerland, Costa Rica, Finland, New Zealand and Sweden, supported by Monaco.

Where are we?

On the first question (Where are we?), many of the submissions concede that current emission trajectories and policies are at odds with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. The CARICOM submission reiterates support for the global average temperature rise to remain below 1.5°C, given that climate change impacts are already being experienced in the region with lower warming levels. It laments that Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are not yet on a pathway to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. The submission states that CARICOM countries’ economic and physical survival is already being threatened, and their adaptive capacity challenged or potentially exceeded. It warns that the observed temperature change in the region is greater than the global average stated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), sea level has risen by around 20 centimeters over the past 100 years, and heat waves are already impacting ecosystems. [Report of CARICOM Workshop on IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C and Talanoa Dialogue] [Caribbean Marine Climate Change Report Card 2017] [US Global Change Research Program’s Climate Science Special Report: Executive Summary]

China’s submission underscores that efforts to address climate change are inadequate, and notes “huge gaps” in pre-2020 mitigation ambition and action. It indicates that: developing countries are still facing financial difficulties and barriers in delivering climate actions; greenhouse gases (GHGs) are still rapidly accumulating in the atmosphere; and good practices and opportunities regarding mitigation, adaptation and international cooperation have been identified through through the Technical Examination Process on mitigation (TEP-M) and adaptation (TEP-A).

Fiji’s submission discusses, inter alia: political will and effective policymaking, including the Fijian Government’s introduction of innovative green fiscal measures to stimulate investments and economic growth in a range of sectors; successful mitigation initiatives, including solar home systems, a renewable energy revolving fund and solar islands; and Fiji’s progress on adaptation in the housing, transport, agriculture, energy, health and education sectors.

The Arab Group’s submission laments inadequate funding flows to developing countries, including for the transition to more climate-friendly technologies. It states that a carbon market with carbon pricing should not be considered as a source of funding or as a catalyst for action, and describes the adverse impacts of response measures in many developing countries, particularly those that are heavily dependent on a single sector or commodity.

The EU’s submission confirms that the EU is set to surpass its goal of a 20% reduction in emissions by 2020, and that the EU 2030 climate and energy framework will lead to a 40% reduction in emissions by 2030; noting that the reduction target has been translated into a legislative framework that will ensure objectives are met. It also describes, inter alia, the EU’s share of global emissions, its specific mitigation efforts, and governance and an ongoing review of energy and climate policies in the EU.

Where do we want to go?

On the second question (Where do we want to go?), the CARICOM submission reaffirms that 1.5°C mitigation pathways are the only way forward, and highlights that regional efforts are underway to provide detailed assessments of the impacts of 1.5°C warming. It states that CARICOM expects scientific evidence presented through the Talanoa Dialogue to highlight the need for more ambitious, updated NDCs by 2020 to enable vulnerable communities, such as those in small island developing States (SIDS), to survive.

China’s submission calls for climate targets to be aligned with the SDGs, and for global climate goals to be equitable, taking into account the principle of common but differential responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC).

The EU stresses the need for considering synergies between enhanced climate action and support, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.

The Arab Group’s submission supports a regime that acknowledges differing circumstances between developed and developing countries. It notes that the level of developing country actions directly relates to the level of developed country support, and highlights the need for adequate, predictable and sustainable means of implementation for developing countries to implement their NDCs and build resilience.

Underscoring the aim of collectively meeting the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement, particularly the temperature and long-term mitigation goals, the EU’s submission states that the EU’s NDC and its domestic mitigation targets are consistent with reducing emissions by 80-95% by 2050. It notes that the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15) will provide clarity on the scale of the challenge to meeting the temperature goal, and on how this compares to the 2°C goal. The submission also discusses the need for creating enabling environments for transitioning to low emission development pathways, and progress made by various EU countries on such transition.

How do we get there?

On the third question (How do we get there?), submissions discuss various actions required to achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. China’s submission underscores the need to, inter alia, encourage technology innovation and enabling policies to promote an “energy revolution,” and accelerate structural changes in the economy to decouple emissions and economic growth. It calls for stimulating climate-friendly lifestyles, and providing developing countries with adequate financial, technological and capacity building resources for mitigation and adaptation actions.

In its submission, Fiji calls attention to the need for: adequate, predictable and sustainable finance for mitigation efforts; innovative climate finance; development of institutional capacity; access to technology; overcoming economies of scale; and enhancing national carbon sequestration. It also explains that Fiji will adopt “no regrets” adaptation measures, which include: better management of natural resources, particularly of coastal habitats, land and water; disease vector control; and improved spatial planning.

The Arab Group’s submission recommends, inter alia: ensuring that equity and CBDR are implemented across the Paris Agreement Work Program (PAWP); considering the impacts of the implementation of response measures and removing barriers that may hinder technology development and transfer; establishing a clear process for monitoring progress and reporting of financial support; and ensuring that the provision of funding achieves a balance between adaptation and mitigation.

The EU’s submission highlights the EU’s ongoing work on a proposed strategy for meeting the long-term Paris goals to be presented by the first quarter of 2019, noting that all its member States will develop national low-carbon mid-century strategies. The submission stresses the need for considering synergies between enhanced climate action and support, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA). It describes, among others, the EU policy framework for domestic action and preparing for enhanced action, and sectoral opportunities and policies to enable the transition. The submission outlines the EU’s assistance to other countries in transitioning towards low-carbon and climate-resilient pathways; and, stressing the need for a just transition, calls for mitigation action by and with non-Party actors.

Where do we want to go? How do we get there? This article provides a brief overview of some of the submissions received before the 2 April deadline from non-Party stakeholders.

Inputs submitted before 2 April will be included in the report to be presented at the UN Climate Change Conference convening in Bonn, Germany, from 30 April to 10 May. The online portal will remain open for submissions throughout the year. Those received after 2 April will be included in the report to the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC.

Where are we?

On the first question (Where are we?), most submissions demonstrate that current emission trajectories and policies are not in line with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change, highlighting that impacts of climate change are already being felt, while also emphasizing positive actions that are already being taken by various actors but which need to be scaled up. A submission from UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) underlines that current national climate plans – Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) – would almost deplete the carbon dioxide budget for a 2°C scenario by 2030, and far exceed the 1.5°C budget. It underscores that more ambitious NDCs will be necessary by 2020, building on the existing extensive knowledge about cost-effective policies and measures that can be taken. Analysis from the World Resources Institute (WRI) of a range of studies shows that, even if fully implemented, current NDCs would lead to between 2.7-3.7ºC of warming.

The Climate Action Tracker (CAT) submission takes the assessment a step further, applying an equity lens to the NDCs of 32 Parties, representing 80% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, assessing whether each NDC represents a fair contribution or not. The CAT findings show that not only are global efforts insufficient to achieve the Paris Agreement goals, but furthermore, the majority of NDCs assessed were found to be inconsistent with the CAT criteria of a fair contribution. According to the submission, only seven governments of the 32 reviewed have implemented 1.5ºC or 2ºC targets, four of which, it claims, are not backed up by sufficient policy action. The CAT submission also shows that currently implemented policies are expected to result in a further growth of global GHG emissions by about 9-13% between 2020-2030.

A submission from the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) considers the finance aspects of the current state of play, noting that while climate-related funding is increasing, it is not growing quickly enough to keep the world on a 2ºC pathway.

Many of the inputs also make note of the climate change impacts being felt already. ActionAid International’s submission, on behalf of the Climate, Land, Ambition, and Rights Alliance (CLARA), highlights the “irremediable impacts” the world is already seeing due to the current overall “lock-in” of 1ºC of warming, including the loss of human development potential, negative impacts on livelihoods, and damage to ecosystem integrity caused by climate change and inappropriate land-use purposes and practices.

Actions being taken by private actors also form the basis of several submissions. The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) submission provides an overview of positive change and commitments undertaken by investors, including: globally, the share of low-carbon supply-side energy investments grew by six percentage points to 43% from 2014-2016; over 50 investors have signed a statement of support for the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD); and investors holding US$28 trillion in assets under management have signed on to Climate Action 100+, a collaborative five-year global initiative committing investor signatories to engage actively with the world’s top emitting companies. A submission from the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) notes that over 350 companies have committed to setting science-based targets, which are absolute GHG emissions reductions in line with the level of decarbonization required to keep the global average temperature increase well below 2°C. However, while these actions demonstrate a positive direction, the IIGCC submission underscores that the existing action could and should be scaled up, noting the need for governments to set the right enabling policy frameworks, including clear, long-term legislative programmes it highlights as “critical to the ability of investors to assess and manage climate-related risks and to invest in opportunities that support a low carbon, more energy efficient and climate-resilient world.”

Where do we want to go?

On the second question (Where do we want to go?), many of the submissions highlight the emissions reductions and mitigation actions needed to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, as well as the adaptation and resilience actions required to ensure a safe future. In line with the official mandate of the Talanoa Dialogue, many submissions refer specifically to the long-term goal reflected in Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement, outlining the need to phase-out net GHG emissions in the second half of the century at the latest, achieve peak emissions in all sectors – energy generation, road transport, buildings, industry, forestry and land use, and commercial agriculture – by 2020, and consider the overall carbon budget as guidance for enhancing NDCs in 2020, with UNEP calling this the “last opportunity to close the 2030 emissions gap.”

Noting that the world’s major economies subsidize investment in fossil fuel exploration and extraction amounting to US$18-70 billion per year, the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) submission outlines the need to curtail fossil fuel supply as an essential part of achieving net-zero emissions by the second half of the century, outlining a vision for a managed decline in fossil fuel use. The submission highlights the potential for such a transition to result in social and economic benefits, including through the reinvestment of added tax revenues from fossil fuel production, particularly if these are redirected towards meeting the SDGs. The WRI submission also highlights the need to ensure a vision in which the SDGs and climate action are mutually reinforcing, noting that climate impacts have the potential for detrimental effects on the achievement of the SDGs, whereas well-designed climate policy measures for mitigation and adaptation can advance core development objectives, including health (SDG 3), decent employment (SDG 8), energy access (SDG 7), transport accessibility (SDGs 9, 11), sustainable agriculture (SDG 2), and landscape protection and biodiversity (SDGs 14, 15).

How do we get there?

Having identified the significant gap between current actions and policies and that which is necessary to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, the submissions relating to the third question (How do we get there?), identify policies, plans and sectoral actions that need to be put in place to achieve the long-term goals. Underscoring the need to enhance ambition, the submissions also highlight opportunities for broader achievement of social and economic benefits, and interlinkages with the SDGs.

Setting long-term, low-GHG emission development pathways is identified as a key tool in response to the third question. The submission by the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI) underscores that “developing national and local long-term pathways is critical for the low-carbon transition,” highlighting the importance of creating broad stakeholder ownership of a long-term vision, as well as informing short-term policy decisions in light of deep decarbonization goals.

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) submission highlights the economic growth and new employment opportunities that can be created through a transition to a clean energy future, noting that the millions of new jobs that will be created in activities related to deployment and maintenance of renewables and energy efficiency measures would “more than offset” job losses in fossil fuel sectors. Specific policy measures suggested within the submission include: ensuring the quick implementation of renewable energy targets in current NDCs; considering options for strengthening renewable energy targets in NDCs; and broadening the scope of renewable energy components in NDCs.

Many submissions note the importance of decarbonizing the transport sector. Noting that the aviation sector currently accounts for 4.9% of the warming impact on earth, and that international shipping is responsible for 2.6% of global emissions, Climate Action Network (CAN), with the International Coalition for Sustainable Aviation (ICSA), and Clean Shipping Coalition (CSC), respectively, call for decarbonization pathways for these sectors to be developed, detailing the measures that can be taken to make these achievable, and highlighting the sensitivity of these sectors to climate change impacts. The Partnership on Sustainable Low Carbon Transport (SLoCaT) submission, on behalf of the Paris Process on Mobility and Climate (PPMC) and the SLoCaT membership, identifies 20 “quick win actions” for the transport sector as well as a “global macro roadmap” to achieve a net-zero emissions transport sector by 2060-2080.

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) submission also recommends action to be urgently enhanced, highlighting the mutually reinforcing nature of well-designed economic and climate policies, which it claims could add 1% to average economic output in G20 countries by 2021, rising to almost 5% by 2050 if the economic benefits of avoiding climate change impacts, such as coastal flooding or storm damage, are factored in. Specifically, the OECD submission makes several recommendations, for example to integrate climate imperatives into structural reform and broader national development strategies, including sustainable infrastructure, “reflecting the role of the physical environment as a fundamental pillar for strong, sustainable, balanced growth.”

Many submissions also note the importance of non-state actors in advancing climate action, including cities, civil society, and corporations committed to 100% renewable energy, among others.

The NAP Expo aimed to discuss country experiences, best practices, lessons learned, gaps and needs, and information on support provided and received in relation to the process to formulate and implement NAPs. It also offered a platform for countries to interact with the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and others providing support for NAPs, as a means to improve access to financing for NAPs.

The event convened amidst alarm bells sounded by UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who called for “a race to the top – with political will, innovation, financing and partnership” to counter “the most systemic threat to humankind” that is climate change. [Opening Remarks at Press Encounter on Climate Change by UN Secretary General António Guterres] [UNFCCC Press Release]

Since the Paris Agreement on climate change, NAPs have become the “implementation arm for adaptation” under NDCs.

The urgent need for adaptation action in light of the “relentless pace of climate change” is reflected in recent updates from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The WMO confirmed the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season to be among the most destructive on record, with damage costs exceeding US$250 billion in the US alone, and March 2018 to be the third warmest on record. [WMO Press Release on 2017 Atlantic Hurricane Season] [WMO Press Release on March 2018]

The main topics of NAP Expo 2018 were: systematic observations, monitoring and evaluation, and learning from experience from past climate shocks; assessing vulnerability and risk; designing implementation strategies while taking into account vertical and horizontal integration, and different pathways over time; and financial support for the formulation and implementation of NAPs.

Areas of adaptation addressed at the Expo included: climate information services (CIS), climate data and scenarios; monitoring and evaluation; linkages among adaptation, the SDGs and disaster risk reduction (DRR); consideration of gender in NAPs; lessons learned from the national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs); long-term adaptation planning and transformation; adaptation in the agriculture sector; water crises and other climate shocks; adaptation in human settlements; and applying traditional and indigenous knowledge. Emerging topics such as big data and artificial intelligence were also discussed.

NAP Expo 2018 was the fifth consecutive NAP Expo, organized by the UNFCCC Least Developed Countries (LDCs) Expert Group (LEG) in collaboration with various organizations.

The NAP process was established under the Cancun Adaptation Framework (CAF) in 2010. Since the Paris Agreement on climate change, NAPs have become the “implementation arm for adaptation” under Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The process is supported by the LEG and though initiatives such as the NAP Global Support Programme (NAP-GSP) and the Integrating Agriculture in NAPs Programme (NAP-Ag). NAP-GSP is a joint programme by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) to assist developing countries to advance NAPs. NAP-Ag, carried out jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and UNDP, focuses on climate adaptation measures for the agricultural sector.

The agreement was announced at the conclusion of the fourth meeting of the GEF-7 replenishment.

The meeting took place in Stockholm, Sweden, on 25 April 2018. The GEF-7 replenishment will formally conclude during the GEF Assembly, which will convene from 27-28 June 2018, in Da Nang, Viet Nam.

The talks for GEF-7 included a review of the ‘Sixth Overall Performance Study of the GEF’ (OPS6), which notes that the GEF occupies a unique space in the global environmental financing architecture because of its broad focus and role as a financial mechanism for environmental conventions. Participants also considered programming directions during GEF-7 (FY19-FY22), and recommended updates to the STAR allocation methodology, including measures to address the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable GEF-recipient countries, among others.

The talks for GEF-7 were called for in October 2016, at the 51st meeting of the GEF Council, which requested the Trustee, in cooperation with the Secretariat, to initiate the discussions. Subsequently, meetings took place in Paris, France (28-30 March 2017), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (3-5 October 2017), Brasília, Brazil (23-25 January 2018) and Stockholm, Sweden (25 April 2018). Participants in the negotiations included: existing and potential Contributing Participants; representatives from non-donor recipient countries representing Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean; NGO/CSO representatives from a donor country-based NGO/CSO and a recipient country; representatives of the private sector; and representatives of GEF Agencies and the conventions for which the GEF serves as a financial mechanism.

The GEF serves as a financial mechanism for the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), Minamata Convention on Mercury, and the Montreal Protocol. The GEF also funds activities in the areas of sustainable forest management, international waters, and ozone layer depletion.

Previously, the GEF Trust Fund was replenished by US$2.75 billion (GEF-1), US$3 billion (GEF-2), US$3.13 billion (GEF-3), US$3.13 billion (GEF-4), US$4.34 billion (GEF-5) and US$4.43 billion (GEF-6).

63,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/shell-sky-scenario-outlines-pathway-to-well-below-2c/,"Tue, 03 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Shell Sky Scenario Outlines Pathway to Well Below 2°C,"27 March 2018: Shell has issued a report titled, ‘Sky: Meeting the Goals of the Paris Agreement.’ The report introduces a scenario that aims to hold the global average temperature increase to well below 2°C through a combination of “mutually reinforcing drivers being rapidly accelerated by society, markets and governments.”

The scenario recognizes that extending current efforts, such as efficiency mandates, carbon taxes or renewable energy support, is insufficient. It argues that concurrent climate policy actions, and the deployment of disruptive new technologies in government policy environments to incentivize investment and innovation will be required.

In 2013, Shell published its New Lens Scenarios focused on mountains and oceans, which, for the first time, featured scenarios with energy-system modeling to 2100, enabling the viewing of long-term transitions in their entirety. These scenarios showed that the application of CO2-targeted policy frameworks would lead to net-zero emissions in the energy system by the end of the century. However, because this falls short of the goal set by the Paris Agreement on climate change, the Sky Scenario looks at a possible decarbonization pathway of achieving net-zero emissions from energy use by 2070.

Under the Sky scenario, oil consumption would rise through 2025 before beginning to decline, drop in the 2030s and fall below current levels after 2040.

The scenario begins with the current structure of economic sectors and government policies, and assumes “very aggressive, but plausible,” ratcheting up of policy commitments through the first two global stocktakes (GSTs) under the Paris Agreement. It notes that, following the GSTs, greater uncertainties regarding policy implementation and technology development exist, which is why the scenario aims to be both ambitious and realistic by adopting an approach grounded in the energy system’s current reality combined with the long-term temperature goal.

In the Sky scenario, oil consumption would rise through 2025 before beginning to decline, drop in the 2030s and fall below current levels after 2040. Liquid hydrocarbon fuel consumption would decrease by 50% between 2020 and 2050, and fall by 90% by 2070. The scenario also includes sector transformations in transport, buildings, industry, electricity and energy.

The Sky Scenario is based on the following assumptions from now to 2070:

a change in consumer mindset where people preferentially choose low-carbon, high-efficiency options to meet their energy service needs;

a step-change in energy efficiency;

carbon-pricing mechanisms adopted during the 2020s, leading to a CO2 cost embedded in consumer goods and services;

the electrification rate of final energy more than triples, with global electricity generation nearly five times the current level;

new energy sources grow by a multiple of fifty, with primary energy from renewables surpassing fossil fuels in the 2050s;

10,000 large carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities are built, compared to fewer than 50 in operation in 2020; and

net-zero deforestation is achieved, and an area the size of Brazil is reforested offering the possibility of limiting warming to 1.5°C.

Shell has also published quantitative data sets for the Sky Scenario for public use.

64,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-a-quiet-place,"Fri, 06 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘A Quiet Place’,"Real-life husband and wife Emily Blunt and director John Krasinski star in a smart monster movie centered on a winning premise — and an even more winning family.

Early in A Quiet Place, the four unnamed members of an unnamed family clasp hands around the supper table and close their eyes for a silent family grace before meals. Such an unremarkable daily gesture of domestic togetherness and piety might be likelier to crop up, ironically, in a post-apocalyptic horror movie than in any other Hollywood genre.

There is something about living from hour to hour for weeks and years in constant peril of vicious predatory monsters roaming the earth that makes one alive to the gift of a meal with loved ones. There is something, too, about the humdrum ritual of giving thanks for daily bread that weaves together yesterday, today and tomorrow with threads of hope and trust, keeping alive the ordinary and at least momentarily banishing the monsters.

It’s not just the grace before meals. Mom and Dad — per the end credits, Evelyn and Lee Abbott, played by real-life husband and wife Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, who also directs — have an easy emotional intimacy and awareness of one another that would be moving and enviable in any screen couple. Their slow dance to Neil Young’s Harvest Moon — sharing earbuds because the blind monsters track their prey by sound, so any significant noise is potentially deadly — is the most tender screen dance in ages.

Evelyn and Lee are archetypal parents, nurturing and self-sacrificing. Evelyn, carrying their fourth child for much of the movie, home schools Marcus (Noah Jupe, about 12) in math and English, along with doing the cooking and cleaning, though she can handle the family’s lone shotgun as well as Lee.

Bearded Lee tinkers with the elaborate surveillance system with which he has tricked out their remote farmhouse compound and takes Marcus on father-son hunting-gathering expeditions, training him to assume, if necessary, Lee’s role as chief provider and protector.

There isn’t much concern about traditional gender roles in their relationship, and the considerable masculinity on display is anything but toxic. A couple of years ago, in a pair of essays on problems around the negativity of religious representation in Hollywood movies, I noted that positive depictions of Catholic faith and identity in major Hollywood films in recent years tend to be almost exclusively in a particular sort of horror film. Perhaps a good husband and father, like a good priest, is nowhere likelier than in a horror movie of another sort.

On the other hand, their eldest, Regan (Millicent Simmonds, about 14), resents that Marcus is always the one to accompany Lee on his trips — and Marcus would be happy to let his older sister go in his place. But Lee wants Regan to stay home and help Evelyn in his absence.

This is perhaps only partly because Marcus is the oldest boy. It may also be because Regan is hard of hearing, and Lee’s attempts to jerry-rig a cochlear implant that will help her have not yet been successful. Regan fears, too, that there is another reason: She worries that her father blames her, as she blames herself, for a tragedy that is like a wound that won’t heal.

Centrally, A Quiet Place offers an empathic portrayal of disability, namely deafness — the one disability that would seem most dangerous given the premise, but which turns out to hold a key to survival. For one thing, the family members were already fluent in American Sign Language when the monsters arrived. (Simmonds, excellent in Todd Haynes’ Wonderstruck last year, is really deaf, and she coached her fellow cast members in ASL.)

Silence is an effective device in a filmmaker’s arsenal, but few films rely on it quite so extensively — or on the shattering power of even a quiet noise at the wrong moment. A Quiet Place contains almost no spoken dialogue, though characters occasionally permit themselves bare whispers and, on the rarest of occasions, even shouts.

An especially sharp touch in the film’s sound design is the pitching of key moments to Regan’s auditory point of view, depriving the viewer of the sonic cues she doesn’t have. Almost as unsettling are moments in which we hear what the sharp-eared monsters hear.

The Abbotts are survivors, even by necessity survivalists, and they have built a life for themselves that excludes all but the quietest sounds. (The family go barefoot as much as possible, and the creak-free floorboards have been painted so that even Regan can navigate soundlessly. In one scene, Regan and Marcus play Monopoly, rolling the dice onto cloth and using soft objects as makeshift pieces.)

Still, accidents happen, and the movie builds up the defenses around the Abbotts in the first half so we can watch them crack and crumble in the second half. Sooner or later, of course, there will be a childbirth scene, and babies cry. (Notably, there is no ambivalence about Evelyn’s pregnancy; even in this post-apocalyptic landscape, life is an absolute good.)

Perhaps the film’s most dreadfully effective moment involves an utterly mundane household danger — one that would make viewers squirm and wince in any movie but is especially terrible in a movie in which the one thing one must never do is scream.

Monsters and even fear can potentially be kept at bay. More insidious are grief and guilt.

Regan isn’t the only one who blames herself for the family’s great sorrow, and both Evelyn and Lee live with the parental imperative to protect their children at all costs, which, of course, isn’t entirely possible. “Who are we if we can’t protect them?” an anguished Evelyn asks in what should be a moment of joy.

One of the film’s key assets is its minimalism. The story begins on Day 89, with no invasion sequence and little back story. In the time-honored tradition of Jaws and Aliens, the monsters are kept offscreen for as long as possible.

The filmmakers occasionally succumb to the temptation to do more, to the film’s detriment. Marco Beltrami’s creepy score is at its best when it goes subtle and unnerving; too often it seems like a score for a louder horror movie.

Some of the information conveyed via news clippings and Lee’s whiteboard is overkill; the movie tries to make a mystery of something that should have been obvious. (I had barely described the film’s premise to my 11-year-old when he proposed what is meant to come as a third-act revelation.)

What finally sells the film are the performances — all of them.

Blunt, so steely in another smartly made high-concept alien-invasion movie, Edge of Tomorrow, makes Evelyn’s maternal devotion no less formidable than her earlier character’s military edge. Krasinski, best known from The Office, wears the survivalist family-man role so naturally I can scarcely imagine another current actor improving on the performance. (A friend recently commented that it is hard to imagine many young male actors today persuasively playing competent fathers; Krasinski is clearly one who can.)

Both children are excellent, but it’s Simmonds, in perhaps the pivotal role, who especially shines in a performance evoking all the overwhelming emotional complexity of adolescence, whether or not there are predatory monsters about. Even though A Quiet Place is a terrific film just the way it is, I can’t help wishing there were more families like this in other kinds of movies.

A while ago, asked to name a film set in the Middle Ages with a persuasively medieval spirit, I settled on Eric Rohmer’s charming 1978 oddity Perceval le Gallois. Based on a 12th-century French Arthurian poem, it’s a musical of sorts, with sung narration from onstage minstrels playing medieval tunes, and ending with a startling eight-minute musical Passion play.

I have never seen anything like Rohmer’s Perceval. That includes Bruno Dumont’s Jeannette: The Childhood of Joan of Arc — improbably enough, another French musical about an innocent young medieval hero, adapted from poetic writings and prominently contemplating the crucifixion of Jesus in song.

Yet Jeannette too offers a medieval vision that is astonishing in its challenge to modern sensibilities, even if the literary source in this case is from around the turn of the 20th century — the writings of the French Catholic poet Charles Péguy — and the eclectic music, blending electronica, Baroque themes and guitar-shredding hard rock with other textures, is jarringly anachronistic.

Jeannette’s medieval vision is expressed, above all, not by the saint herself, nor in the relatively brief visitation of silent heavenly figures whose message Joan interprets for us, but in the ecstatic mystical discourse of a young nun played by a pair of stone-faced twins (stay with me) who also appear as St. Catherine of Alexandria and St. Margaret, alongside St. Michael. You probably already know whether or not this movie is for you, don’t you?

There is nothing in the opening minutes to foreshadow all this weirdness. The film opens with an extended shot of a stream in the French countryside (a title informs us that it is summer 1425) in which 9-year-old Jeanette (Lise Leplat Prudhomme) appears, artlessly singing a capella, offering prayers to her patron saint John and the Holy Trinity, as a pious young peasant girl might do.

Her song quickly takes an unsettling turn, though, as the words of the Lord’s Prayer are subverted into an elegy:

Our Father who art in heaven

Your name is so far from being hallowed

And your reign from coming …

Jeanette is deeply troubled by the state of the world, by suffering and especially war, and by the damnation of souls. In a conflicted, Christological expression of the mystery of evil, she laments that the world has seen 14 centuries of Christianity since God sent his beloved Son to suffer and die, not to mention the saints, and yet “what reigns on the face of the earth is perdition.” Over and over Jeanette returns to the haunting refrain, “And there is nothing; there is never anything.”

Jeannette is a dialogue, and a mutual cross-examination, not only among the main characters of the drama, and above all between man and God, but also between the poet Péguy and the filmmaker Dumont, and even between Péguy the Socialist unbeliever of 1897 and Péguy the believing Catholic of 1910. It is also, of course, a dialogue between both artists and Joan herself (a dialogue some might consider one-sided, though Péguy might have demurred, at least in 1910).

Both as a believer and an unbeliever Péguy was an idiosyncratic, contradictory figure. Deeply nationalistic, ardently Socialist, he became an anticlerical unbeliever in high school, yet he always loved the Middle Ages and was fascinated by Joan of Arc all his life.

In 1897 Péguy completed an immense dramatic trilogy, called simply Jeanne d’Arc, surveying the life of the Maid of Orleans. By 1908 he had experienced a recovery of faith, and in 1910 — a decade before her canonization — he published The Mystery of the Charity of Joan of Arc, reworking material from the first of the earlier work’s three parts, which dealt with her childhood in the village of Domrémy.

Where the earlier work presented Joan in secular, nationalist terms, as an icon of an earthly, Socialist kingdom, the later one is awash with religious concerns. (Mystery of the Charity became the first of another trilogy of “mystery” poems, “mystery” here evoking medieval mystery plays as well as invoking the mysteries of Christ’s life and the theological virtues.)

Péguy’s conversion is reflected in the shifting depiction of Madame Gervaise, a Franciscan nun whom I understand the 1897 work depicted critically for fleeing the world’s problems to work out her private salvation, but who in Péguy’s later imagination becomes a voice of divine wisdom. (The screenplay draws on both texts, the 1897 and the 1910.)

Before Madame Gervaise, though, Jeannette is cross-examined by a young friend named Hauviette (Lucile Gauthier), who voices common sense and conventional piety. Unlike the neighbors, who know Jeannette to be devout and charitable and suppose her to be happy, Hauviette “sees things as they are” and knows that everything makes Jeannette unhappy.

Hauviette’s counsel is reasonable: Why carry the weight of the world on your shoulders? Do your best and hope for the best; trust God and don’t ask him to justify himself, since we can’t anyway.

But Jeannette can’t be satisfied with this. What do individual acts of charity accomplish, since suffering never diminishes? What did Jesus accomplish? Could he have died in vain?

The response to Joan’s anxieties is a breathtaking 18-minute sequence at once sublime and at least bordering on ridiculous. There is a sense of revelation in the dramatic arrival of Madame Gervaise that is enhanced by the unexplained casting of twins (Aline and Elise Charles), giving the nun’s soteriological and sacramental mystical theology an almost literally ecstatic quality. (Ek-stasis is Greek for “standing outside oneself.”)

The same twins appear later, more colorfully attired yet silent, as Sts. Margaret and Catherine, but it feels as if the voices of Margaret and Catherine have already been heard in Madame Gervaise.

What the nun offers is, on the one hand, an even more uncompromising restatement of the problem of evil, countered by a poetic vision of time from the perspective of eternity.

On the one hand, the earth is full of suffering and profaning of holy things — and all of us, even the best among us, are complicit cowards and liars who allow sinners to damn themselves. All love and friendship are false and we are all alone (though in spite of our inability to love we somehow love anyway).

On the other hand, the creation of the world and the redemptive sacrifice of Christ are not vanished, past realities, but pervade all of time and space: every parish and village, especially in the even-present offering of the Paschal mystery, yet also embracing the non-Christian world, which is in some way Christian, too. Redemption — true, eternal happiness — are present realities; though non-Christians and even Christians may not understand it, we do not wait for happiness, but possess it now.

Human suffering has a role in God’s plan — though the suffering of the damned is different, and Madame Gervaise warns against Jeannette’s blasphemous notion of saving the damned from hell, even to the point of imagining suffering perdition on their behalf.

The gravity with which the sisters intone Péguy’s poetry, with its chant-like reliance on simplicity and repetition, gives this sequence a semi-liturgical feel. There is also, of course, an undeniable element of humor in the dissonant musical styles — from the eclecticist Gautier Serre, credited as Igorrr — veering from a capella to classical guitar to thrash metal, with Jeanette and the twins (briefly doffing their wimples) solemnly flailing their long tresses like medieval headbangers.

Yet it never dissolves into camp or burlesque. A provocateur who has invoked the names of both Jesus and Satan in the titles of past films, Dumont is at least interested in religious ideas, and he’s definitely interested in the gray area between the outrageous and the absurd.

While he wants to have fun with the material, Dumont doesn’t appear to wish to deconstruct or debunk it. Whatever Dumont or his cast make of Péguy’s text, or however much or little they even understand it, the dancing sequences become a kind of prayer. At one point the twins and Jeannette begin miming invisible walls, gesturing toward the unseen.

Wisely, Dumont lays a naturalistic foundation in the opening scenes, starting with the stream (evoking perhaps Jeannette’s stream of consciousness), which helps to hold the later craziness together. The crucial sequence, in a sandy plain amid loudly bleating sheep, is full of huge blue skies; with her matching blue dress, Jeannette is already closer to heaven than Hauviette in her earth tones.

All the singing was recorded live, a crucial element of truthfulness that in turn restrains the choreography to rather simple, unpolished moves (lots of jumping up and down and running in circles), to winningly authentic effect.

Ultimately, of course, Jeannette cannot accept Madame Gervaise’s Franciscan counsel of abandonment to divine Providence and nonviolent acceptance of suffering and evil. Energized by a sign from God and the appearance of her heavenly visitors, she will set out to “kill war.” (Following suit, Péguy was an early World War I volunteer and an early casualty in 1914.)

The film’s second half finds Joan or Jeanne (Jeanne Voisin), now about 15, wrestling with her inaction since receiving her call, obstacles she has faced and concerns about lying to her parents. Finally, there is the emotional upheaval of leaving home to go to war, escorted by her unassuming young uncle (a hilariously low-key Nicolas Leclaire, who raps all his songs and dabs through his improvised dance moves).

It seems the first half relies more on Péguy’s 1910 Mystery of the Charity and the second half more on the 1897 Jeanne d’Arc. (Jeanne’s uncle isn’t a character in the 1910 work, so his scenes must come from the earlier work.) At times it feels overly repetitive, though it remains agreeable and often moving.

Certainly there’s nothing in the second half to rival the Madame Gervaise sequence. Does that highlight undercut the later material or elevate it? I may need another viewing to decide.

Caveat Spectator: Complex religious and philosophical themes. Might be fine for unusually thoughtful and patient kids.","That includes Bruno Dumont’s Jeannette: The Childhood of Joan of Arc — improbably enough, another French musical about an innocent young medieval hero, adapted from poetic writings and prominently contemplating the crucifixion of Jesus in song.
Where the earlier work presented Joan in secular, nationalist terms, as an icon of an earthly, Socialist kingdom, the later one is awash with religious concerns.
(Mystery of the Charity became the first of another trilogy of “mystery” poems, “mystery” here evoking medieval mystery plays as well as invoking the mysteries of Christ’s life and the theological virtues.)
Before Madame Gervaise, though, Jeannette is cross-examined by a young friend named Hauviette (Lucile Gauthier), who voices common sense and conventional piety.
Ultimately, of course, Jeannette cannot accept Madame Gervaise’s Franciscan counsel of abandonment to divine Providence and nonviolent acceptance of suffering and evil."

The report, published by Global Water Intelligence (GWI), and sent via e-mail to businessam comes at a time when the funding model for water infrastructure is evolving to incorporate more private and commercial finance sources, in the face of ageing infrastructure, population growth and climate change.

Entitled Financing Water to 2030, the report argues that in order to achieve these targets whilst reducing utility dependence on grant finance, tariffs around the world will need to increase substantially, rising at a compound annual growth rate of 5.9 percent and taking the global average combined tariff from $2.08 /m^3 to $4.38 /m^3 in 2030.

In Southern Asia, where average combined water and wastewater tariffs are just $0.14/m^3 compared to a global average of $2.08 /m^3, this means that tariffs would need to rise by 15.2 percent annually in order to meet the investment required by 2030 for SDG6.

Christopher Gasson, publisher at GWI and co-author of the report commented, “we are at an inflection point in the way water is financed. For the past two decades, there hasn’t been much change in the way utility assets are paid for. Going forward, there will be. We will see the utility sector steadily building its financial independence and the corollary of

all this is that tariffs will have to rise.”

The report states that meeting SDG 6, utilities will need to mitigate the effects of ageing infrastructure, industrial pollution, growing urban populations, and the more extreme flooding and droughts brought by climate change, and will need to access more finance sources to meet these challenges.

GWI forecasts that the amount of global private finance used to fund water infrastructure will increase from $3 billion during 2013 / 2017 to $35 billion a year in the next 12 years, providing 7.7 percent of global infrastructure investment needs by 2030.

Within the same time frame, funding for water infrastructure by central government grants and international transfers is expected to fall from 31 percent to 18 percent of annual investment needs, according to the report.

GWI notes that the key driver of this trend is governments moving away from financing water projects on their own balance sheets and through grants to utilities, and towards providing more loans and encouraging public-private partnerships.

In the USA for instance, the Trump administration’s $1.5 trillion infrastructure investment plan brings with it only $200 million of federal finance. Financing Water to 2030 explains that the rest is expected to come from the private sector.

In Saudi Arabia meanwhile, the government is contemplating the largest water privatisation programme since the UK government sold off its water assets in 1989. The report detailing how the governments of countries such as Japan, Brazil, Peru, Indonesia, and Vietnam have recently announced major plans and new legislation for bringing private finance into their water infrastructure, examines how the trend towards mobilising more private finance for water infrastructure is also being driven by development, finance institutions (DFIs), pointing to the “blended finance” strategies at major DFIs like the World Bank.

This increasingly involves developing structured financial products designed to attract commercial finance for more credit-worthy clients, while directing more concessionary resources to places and projects for which they are critical.

Though blended finance has been growing as a concept for several years, the US government’s denial of a capital increase for the World Bank has given the strategy added impetus and visibility.

GWI also found that utility consolidation and government reforms aimed at improving the bankability of projects will be crucial in order to attract the infrastructure finance that utilities need to achieve the SDG on water and sanitation. The report examines several political developments as part of this trend.

In Japan, recent legal reforms to support and incentivise the consolidation of its 2,800 small-scale water and wastewater utilities have been introduced. The USA has also seen growing discussions on utility consolidation with many of the country’s small utilities struggling to maintain their infrastructure. The report explains that the elimination of $509 million in grants for small rural utilities by the federal government will likely make the discussion even more relevant.

GWI will next host The Global Water Summit 2018 in Paris on 15-16th April 2018. The summit’s 2018 agenda will feature a pre-conference workshop on the privatisation of Saudi Arabia’s water sector, along with expert-led sessions and roundtables on PPP opportunities in emerging markets and utility bankability, and sessions on blended finance run in partnership with the World Bank.","Water tariffs globally will need to increase 5.9 percent each year in order to generate the $449 billion of annual investment required to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) on water and sanitation between 2018 and 2030 and maintain existing infrastructures, a new market report has found.

He said the initiative has a strong basis in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and that spending resources on weapons drains resources from sustainable development efforts.

Gueterres introduced the agenda in remarks at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, on 24 May 2018. It is also presented in a publication titled, ‘Securing Our Common Future,’ released on the same day.

Recalling that the UN was created with the goal of “eliminating war as an instrument of foreign policy,” Guterres noted that arms control continues to be “in the news everyday.” The Agenda will focus on three priorities: reducing and eliminating weapons of mass destruction, “to save humanity”; reducing and mitigating the impact of conventional weapons, “to save lives”; and addressing new battlefield technologies, “for future generations.”

Guterres explained that disarmament of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons can prevent and end violence, support sustainable development and support the UN’s values and principles. Observing that 15,000 nuclear weapons are stockpiled around the world, he said the world is “one mechanical, electronic or human error away from a catastrophe that could eradicate entire cities from the map,” and appealed to States with nuclear weapons to take action to avoid catastrophe. He called for the US and the Russian Federation to: resolve the dispute over the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty; to extend the New START Treaty on strategic offensive arms, which is scheduled to expire in three years; and to take new steps towards reducing nuclear stockpiles.

On small arms, the UN Secretary-General announced a new initiative to combat the illicit circulation and trade in small arms. He said he will dedicate resources within the Peacebuilding Fund to support government action on illicit small arms and light weapons.

On new technologies, Guterres urged the use of big data and analytics and artificial intelligence, among other new technological tools, to help combat and mitigate climate change, protect the environment and create conditions for development and growth for all. However, governments must improve oversight, transparency and accountability to ensure that science and technology is used for peaceful purposes, he said.

Guterres called for bringing back the “historical relationship between disarmament and development.”

The UN Secretary-General also highlighted linkages between the disarmament agenda and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, underscoring that “excessive spending on weapons drains resources for sustainable development” and is incompatible with creating inclusive, stable societies, strong institutions, effective democracy and governance and a culture of respect for human rights. The disarmament agenda underscores a “vast potential” to operationally link implementation of disarmament objectives with many SDGs, the report notes, arguing that such action can help to bring back the historical relationship between disarmament and development.

‘Securing Our Common Future’ explains that disarmament can support progress on SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), which includes targets on disarmament and arms regulations. In addition, it identifies connections between disarmament and SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 14 (life below water), SDG 15 (life on land) and SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

On SDG 3, for example, the report cites armed violence as a leading cause of premature death, and argues that disarmament and arms control can reduce the impact of conflict on human health. Gender-responsive disarmament and arms control can reduce violence against women and girls, in line with SDG 5. Disarmament and arms control can support SDG 14 and SDG 15 by reducing the impact of weapons on the environment; previous testing and use of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons have contaminated the environment.

Linkages between the ‘Securing Our Common Future’ agenda and the SDGs are highlighted throughout the document, with specific recommendations for how States can address disarmament and the SDGs.

The plan, known as the ‘Hoja de Ruta,’ identifies five priority areas for implementing the country’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement on climate change, and links each area to available partner and programme resources from across the NDC Partnership.

The priorities are: revising the country’s NDC; prioritizing mitigation and adaptation efforts; developing roadmaps for prioritized actions and signing memoranda of understanding (MoU) with partners; establishing a monitoring, reporting and evaluation system; and strengthening inter-institutional coordination for climate action.

To deliver on these priorities, the plan identifies 21 activities, to be implemented over the next three years, including: a comprehensive review of the country’s NDC; development of a national climate change investment plan; data collection and monitoring; capacity building; and increased public awareness. Annual review of the plan will seek to ensure inclusion of emerging priorities and reflection of progress.

Honduras is also developing national legislation, which will help align its climate and sustainable development agendas, and access financing and support. The country has created institutional enablers for coordinated climate action, including the Presidential Office for Climate Change, climate change units within government institutions, and a multi-stakeholder national commission on climate change.

Honduras is developing national legislation, which will help align its climate and sustainable development agendas, and access financing and support.

To highlight country experiences in developing Partnership Plans, the NDC Partnership hosted a side event on 8 May 2018 on the sidelines of the UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany, which convened from 30 April to 10 May. The side event titled, ‘Partnership Plan for NDC Implementation: Connecting the Dots,’ offered six member countries (Honduras, Jordan, Kenya, Mongolia, the Netherlands and Uganda) the opportunity to share their perspectives on and lessons learnt from Partnership Plans and NDC implementation. The event addressed such issues as gender in climate change action, working with global development partners, challenges faced when dealing with multiple government agencies, and the value and challenges of the Partnership Plan as a tool to implement and enhance ambition of NDCs.

Mongolia highlighted his country’s efforts to automate the Partnership Plan through an online portal, which will have an interactive interface to enable government representatives and development partners to update and share information on projects, initiatives and sustainable development priorities.

The Netherlands emphasized that the country engagement process contributes to improving donor coordination, transparency, and encouraged a multi-stakeholder approach.

Launched at the UN Climate Change Conference in Marrakesh, Morocco, in November 2016, and hosted by the UNFCCC and the World Resources Institute (WRI), the NDC Partnership is a coalition of countries and institutions committed to advancing climate and development action. Partnership Plans are part of the NDC Partnership’s in-country engagement work, matching needs of countries with resources from other Partnership members through a government-led process that is flexible, supports transparency, enhances coordination among in-country and global actors, and mobilizes support for NDC implementation.

69,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/sdg-12-experts-highlight-need-to-focus-on-food-waste-plastic-clogged-ocean/,"Thu, 10 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"SDG 12 Experts Focus on Food Waste, Plastic-clogged Ocean","4 May 2018: Experts in sustainable consumption and production (SCP) have taken stock of progress toward SDG 12 and brainstormed levers for faster change, in the lead up to the July 2018 session of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The two-day expert group meeting, convened by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), featured in-depth discussions on climate action, ocean action, plastic pollution in the ocean, food loss and waste, and sustainable transport as they relate to SCP.

SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) is one of the six Goals for which governments will conduct an in-depth review at the HLPF’s 2018 session. During the expert group meeting, participants recalled that SDG 12 is the “least well resourced” SDG, according to a report of the UN Secretary-General.

On SDG 12 stocktaking and HLPF preparations, Shantanu Mukherjee, DESA, said the market is “not getting it right” on the true costs of consumption and production. He highlighted the extensively interlinked nature of the SDGs and targets, and called for using empirical information to decide which interlinkages to prioritize for action, but said these choices must be context-specific.

Charles Arden-Clarke, Head of Secretariat of the 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production patterns (10YFP) at the UN Environment Programme, reported on the formation of the ‘One Planet Network,’ a multi-stakeholder network that will serve as an implementation mechanism for SDG 12. Cecilia Lopez Y Royo Di Taurisano, 10YFP Secretariat, said most activity has taken place in the area of SCP readiness, with less activity in SCP implementation. She reported a notable increase in the number of SCP policies and instruments, but said approximately half of these are voluntary, and only 11% are financial instruments.

Participants discussed the need to make an economic case for SCP at the global level, and considered whether the private sector will respond to potential efficiency gains as an incentive to improve SCP, or only regulation. One suggested the need for better branding of SCP. On SCP’s interlinkages with other issues, a government representative highlighted her country’s toolbox to allow national focal points to bring SCP to the table of negotiations in other areas.

The idea that SCP is highly interlinked with other Goals continued to emerge in the session on climate action. Annika Lindblom, Finland’s Ministry of the Environment and Secretary General of the National Commission on Sustainable Development, said SCP “directs attention to the interface of climate and poverty.” She said Finland has combined the 2030 Agenda and Paris Agreement on climate change in order to address material usage and energy usage together. The framework is called ‘Carbon Neutral and Resource-wise Finland,’ and includes a medium-term climate policy plan to 2030 and action plans on procurement, product innovation and support for investments.

Hannah Janetshek, German Development Institute, said that while SDG 12 can have “strong co-benefits across the entire agenda,” it could also increase competition for resources, especially as policies seek to expand access to services in order to leave no one behind.

Mathilde Bouyé, World Resource Institute (WRI), said targets from SDGs 11 and 12 are poorly reflected in the NDCs, specifically 11.6, 11.c, 12.3 and 12.c. Jocelyn Blériot, Ellen MacArthur Foundation, added that so far, the focus of a low-carbon economy has been on energy, with less emphasis on raw material extraction and production. He called for an approach beyond ‘Recycling 2.0.’ With three billion new consumers coming soon, he said we must think differently, such as shifting from selling goods to selling services.

Suggesting that “most people don’t care about the impact of what they buy,” moderator David O’Connor, WRI, suggested that businesses should force people to opt out of positive behaviors rather than require them to opt in. Blériot suggested that regulations are needed in addition to business-led action, and said a number of governments are creating circular economy road maps, including Finland and France, in which businesses must consider what will happen to a product at the end of its first useful life.

In the course of the meeting, participants identified tradeoffs between SDG-related issues that have implications for SCP. These include:

Energy efficiency can be improved by certain thermostats, but recycling could be a challenge given the rare pollutants they contain. Similar challenges were noted with disposal of solar panels.

Lego plans to begin producing blocks out of sugarcane instead of plastic, but harvesting the needed sugarcane could increase land competition.

Plastics are part of the packaging innovations that have reduced food waste.

The interests of marginalized groups could come into conflict with the creation of marine protected areas.

Given these and other trade-offs, Gerald Singh, University of British Colombia, called for choosing priorities to prepare for “sub-aspirational” SDG scenarios. Bouyé said some countries are creating incentives and compensations for vulnerable populations who may be affected by SCP implementation. For example, El Salvador and France are among those including a climate solidarity package in their NDCs.

Wilberforce Kisamba-Mugerwa, Chair of Uganda’s National Planning Authority, reported that the HLPF is not sufficient for creating awareness of SCP, and urged involving sub-national leaders.

Edda Fernández Luiselli, Mexico’s Ministry of Environmental and Natural Resources, said that in the Latin American and Caribbean region, sustainability must be promoted as a tool for competitiveness, not an environmental issue. She said that in LAC, the SDG implementors must be small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which represent 80% of GDP.

Alexandra Hiniker, NYC Mayor’s Office for International Affairs, reported on efforts to link the existing ‘OneNYC’ plan with the SDGs, noting that after Hurricane Sandy, the City realized that prevention and protection must be equitable. She gave examples of New York’s waste management policies, such as ‘zero waste by 2030’, which includes bringing recycling to public housing and making public schools zero waste. She announced that New York City will present the first-ever ‘Voluntary Local Review’ at the 2018 session of the HLPF, and said it will map city-level efforts against the SDGs to enable discussions and exchanges with other cities and countries about best practices and filling gaps.

During the sessions on SCP and ocean action and plastic pollution in the ocean, Arthur Andambi, Permanent Mission of Kenya, said Kenya banned plastic bags in 2017. He announced that Kenya will host a blue economy conference from 26-28 November 2018, and noted that Kenya has proposed to host, along with Portugal, a second UN Ocean Conference in 2020.

Sian Sutherland, Co-Founder, A Plastic Planet, said the use of plastic for food and drink packaging represents a momentary use with consequences that last forever, and recommended that governments take action on this. Another participant noted that plastics play a key role in packaging innovations that reduce food waste.

Participants developed ideas for bringing together communities of practice around targets that are closely linked. Arden-Clarke suggested creating a working group on value chains, which could cover both food and plastics. He noted that the upcoming session of the Trade for Sustainable Development Forum will meet on the theme of sustainable value chains for SDG 12, and suggested that a working group on value chains could take advantage both of this event and the subsequent blue economy conference in Kenya.

Several presentations informed participants of the current status of plastic pollution in the ocean and efforts to address it. Speakers noted that plastic production is expected to double or triple within ten years, while the volume of additives in plastic and products’ complexity make recycling a limited solution. Participants observed that many consumers know about the problem, with one suggesting addressing the dynamic between consumer and retailer in order to “beat the speed of regulation.”

Recent actions taken to reduce plastic, as reported by the experts, include:

In the Maldives, schools have eliminated single-use plastics as of April 2018;

In the Netherlands, an affordable grocery store opened a plastic-free aisle;

The UK recently announced the Clean Oceans Alliance to reduce plastic waste in Commonwealth states;

In Switzerland, major supermarkets placed a five-cent fee for plastic bags, reducing demand by 80%.

Additional ideas were brainstormed, including:

Use extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies with regard to plastic packaging, as well as industrial fishing and the loss of gear;

Work with mineral water bottling companies to shift to other types of bottles, and hold a conference with the five largest bottled water companies in the world to secure commitments on going plastic-free;

Create legislation covering supermarkets’ responsibility, especially as some have said, “we would love to be legislated into” reducing plastic; and

Use blockchain technology to track ships, fishing nets and other aspects of fishing supply chains and manufacturing.

One participant said demand is only part of the solution, and legislation is required when producers and packagers are not ready to come to the table. A government representative said that despite regulations and laws, the petroleum industry can perpetuate a bad situation in a country through lobbying and investments.

On food loss and waste, experts including James Lomax, UN Environment, and Harry de Gorter, Cornell University, US, explained that in food and agriculture, unlike other areas of SCP, efficiency is not the problem. Calories are produced very cheaply already, which leads to consumption of the wrong food – non-diverse, high-calorie, and corn-based – in turn creating an obesity crisis. Moreover, when food is wasted, the water, energy and wildlife habitat used in creating the food are also wasted. However, decreasing production and consumption will increase prices. Redistribution of surplus is not the solution, Lomax stressed, and will only entrench the system of waste.

Participants stressed the need for consumer campaigns and public outreach, such as conducting food waste audits in schools. They also noted the importance of measurement and monitoring, such as through the food waste index led by UNEP and partners, and through initiatives to separate food waste from the waste stream.

On whether there is a business case to be made for reducing food waste, one participant said the westernization of diets is driving the crisis, and it is difficult to make a business case to address that. However, Richard Swannell, Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), said businesses can experience a favorable rate of return on reducing food loss and waste in under two years, and companies that measure how much is wasted through the entire process of producing the food in the first place realize the need to reduce waste.

Regarding SDG 12’s status as the least funded SDG, participants suggesting linking food waste to other issues, highlighting that it is difficult to mobilize funding for what is perceived as a first-world problem. They also called for more measurement of gains from reducing food loss and waste, which will lead governments to invest.

The note was prepared in order to advance discussions at the 48th session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 48), convening during the UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany.

The document (FCCC/SBSTA/2018/INF.2) provides information on cooperative activities, initiatives and programmes since the SBSTA 46. On the relationship with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the document explains that the 2030 Agenda recognizes the UNFCCC as the primary forum for negotiating the global response to climate change, and that the UNFCCC Secretariat can help countries achieve the SDGs. It describes UNFCCC activities towards SDG implementation, focusing mainly on SDG 13 (climate action), as well as engagement with activities and relevant agencies for achieving SDGs 2 (zero hunger), 4 (quality education), 5 (gender equality), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and 15 (life on land).

The document showcases the UNFCCC’s collaborations on achieving the SDGs with UNEP, FAO and ILO, among others.

On mitigation-related cooperative activities, the note highlights implementation of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and the role of the NDC Partnership, which supports developing countries in implementing their NDCs and achieving the SDGs. It showcases the UNFCCC’s collaborations on achieving the SDGs with, inter alia: the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) to support climate and SDG-aligned finance and investment action in the context of sustainable development; the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) to enhance countries’ capacities to integrate adaptation, mitigation and the SDGs into activities in the agriculture, forestry and other land-use sectors; and the International Labour Organization (ILO) on a just transition of the workforce and the creation of decent work.

On technology, the note outlines cooperation related to, inter alia, the technology facilitation mechanism to support implementation of the SDGs. It highlights the Secretariat’s participation in the UN Interagency Task Team on Science, Technology and Innovation for the SDGs and in the high-level seminar on science, technology and innovation for the SDGs, organized by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.

The note also describes cooperative activities related to climate finance, capacity building, adaptation and action for climate empowerment (ACE). It underscores the UNFCCC’s participation in a review forum for the Global Action Programme on Education for Sustainable Development, which discussed the role of teachers and teacher training, as well as implementation of education for sustainable development in achieving SDG target 4.7 (ensuring all learners acquire knowledge and skills to promote sustainable development).

Additionally, the note provides an overview of activities under the Nairobi work programme on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change (NWP) that help achieve the SDGs. On SDG target 2.4, on ensuring sustainable food production systems and implementing resilient agricultural practices, the document highlights the UNFCCC’s role in identifying knowledge gaps around agriculture and fisheries that hinder implementation and scaling up of adaptation.

On SDG target 5.5, on ensuring women’s participation and equal opportunities for leadership, the document references knowledge resources on gender-sensitive approaches and tools for adaptation. On SDG target 11.3, on enhancing inclusive and sustainable urbanization, the note highlights a synthesis report on adaptation in human settlements, prepared under the NWP, which shares key findings, good practices and lessons learned on adaptation in human settlements. Regarding SDG target 11.B, on increasing the number of cities and human settlements adopting and implementing mitigation and adaptation policies and plans, the document outlines the Secretariat’s efforts to catalyze climate resilience action in human settlements through an adaptation knowledge portal.

The document also describes NWP activities related to: SDG target 6.A, on expanding international cooperation and capacity-building support in water- and sanitation-related activities and programmes; SDG target 9.A, on facilitating sustainable and resilient infrastructure development in developing countries; and SDG 13. The note also highlights the potential of the local communities and indigenous peoples platform to help advance the SDGs, particularly SDG target 13.B, on promoting mechanisms for building capacity for climate change-related planning and management for local and marginalized communities.

According to the report, management accountants play an important role in making the business case for pursuing appropriate SDGs, monitoring and evaluating their impact, and ensuring alignment of sustainability initiatives with corporate activities. Moreover, they can: encourage businesses to meet SDG requirements through improved innovation capabilities; emphasize the importance of ethical behavior throughout the value chain; provide decision makers with information about sustainability factors, which can be integrated into business planning and reporting; focus more on best practice in governance and stewardship; help form strategic partnerships; and help businesses base their corporate reports on the six “capitals” of integrated reporting: human, social and relationship, intellectual, natural, manufacturing and financial.

The report recommends that accountants and their employers should focus on those SDGs most relevant to their industry, sector and business type. It includes tools and methods to help businesses manage reputational risk, respond to globalization, digitization and the impacts of policy changes and meet investor demand for greater reporting transparency. The guide suggests that management accountants’ skill sets (expertise in governance, risk management and control, business analysis and decision support), organizational role and ethical commitment place the profession at the forefront of SDG planning and implementation.

The guide also provides steps that employees can take to determine: whether their employers are aligning with and contributing to the SDGs; how business and organizations are making a difference with respect to each of the SDGs; and how to build the SDGs into organizational culture and thinking. Regarding the latter, the report proposes: building the SDGs into organizational strategies and business; engaging supply chain partners and company ecosystems with the SDGs; reporting on the SDGs as part of integrated reporting; and building the “learn and relearn” feedback loop into planning and strategy development.

UN officials also stressed the Territories’ particular vulnerability to climate change.

The meeting convened from 9-11 May 2018, in St. George’s, Grenada, organized by the UN Special Committee on Decolonization. Participants discussed ways to advance gains made in the Territories under the Special Committee’s purview, with many encouraging dialogue with their respective administering Powers, namely France, New Zealand, UK and US.

Currently, 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories (NSGTs) remain to be decolonized. They are: (Africa) Western Sahara; (Atlantic and Caribbean) Anguilla, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands (BVI), Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Montserrat, Saint Helena, Turks and Caicos Islands, and US Virgin Islands; (Europe) Gibraltar; and (Pacific) American Samoa, French Polynesia, Guam, New Caledonia, Pitcairn and Tokelau.

Committee Chair Walton Alfonso Webson recalled that following the adoption of the SDGs, the Committee had stressed the importance of fostering economic and social sustainable development of the Territories. He said that conclusions from the last seminar acknowledged that climate change had exposed many of the Territories to even greater environmental and economic vulnerability. He called for efforts to continue strengthening administrative capacity, good governance and economic sustainability.

In a message to the seminar, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said “decolonization is still incomplete,” and cannot be advanced until Non-Self-Governing Territories can address a range of economic, social and environmental challenges. He emphasized that implementing the SDGs is important for Territories facing the challenges of climate change, access to health care, economic diversification, marine resource conservation and scarcity of drinking water.

During discussions, speakers highlighted: realization of the SDGs in the Territories is related to the extent to which the UN system provides the political space for their engagement; that achieving the Goals will increase possibilities for further advancement of self-government; the need for a mechanism to enable SDG implementation; and that the Special Committee should undertake discussions on the future development agenda in parallel with its decolonization efforts.

A number of speakers emphasized that the Territories cannot realize the SDGs if their economic dependency continues. One speaker said that in Puerto Rico, following Hurricanes Irma and Maria, it had taken three weeks for the response to get under way. Countries with full sovereignty are able to receive aid and take decisions on economic development policies more quickly. Cuba said it had not been permitted to provide aid to Puerto Rico following the hurricanes. Others cited “deliberate foot-dragging” by administering Powers, inhibiting Territories from taking action to ensure an effective response to climate-related events.

Also to improve Territories’ ability to achieve the SDGs, speakers called for increased communication between the UN Special Committee and administering Powers. They discussed how the Committee can help ensure that Territories serve as owners and drivers of the SDGs, and pointed to the importance of capacity building.

An elected official from a local council in Western Sahara highlighted a project on agriculture that will create jobs and efforts to promote tourism. Morocco noted its investments in the Western Sahara in such areas as public infrastructure and services, and said the Territory’s level of human development has surpassed Morocco’s national average. A representative from French Polynesia noted the development of SDG indicators within the framework of the Pacific Island Forum (PIF).

On the UN’s role in helping Territories achieve the SDGs, representatives of UN agencies drew attention to: the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) strategy for technical cooperation with the six UK Caribbean Territories, which will be in place until 2022; the UN Population Fund’s (UNFPA) technical support for a sexual and reproductive health policy for Anguilla, and its provision of emergency sexual and reproductive health kits to the Turks and Caicos Islands following Hurricane Irma; and UN Women’s efforts in BVI and Anguilla on gender-related issues.

The VLR, to be presented during the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), will be modeled after the Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs).

New York will be the first city in the world to report directly to the UN on the status of its implementation of the SDGs.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Commissioner of the Mayor’s Office for International Affairs Penny Abeywardena made the announcement on 1 May 2018. According to the press release on the announcement, New York will be the first city in the world to report directly to the UN on the status of its implementation of the SDGs, and its VLR will highlight the City’s achievements in sustainability since 2015. The VLR will be presented during the HLPF’s “sessions dedicated to local government engagement.”

The VLR, produced by the Global Vision | Urban Action programme of the Mayor’s Office for International Affairs in close collaboration with relevant NYC agencies, compiles and presents existing New York City’s data and programs, the press release notes. An article by Alexandra Hiniker, NYC Mayor’s Office for International Affairs, indicates that the VLR will look at the City’s progress on a set of key SDGs, and will both reflect on successes and identify areas where New York can learn from others to address remaining challenges.

New York’s Global Vision | Urban Action programme shares innovations in sustainability with cities and countries around the world, “using the lens of the SDGs.” Established in December 2015 by the New York City Mayor’s Office for International Affairs, the programme seeks to, inter alia: engage with experts and representatives from New York City and the international community interested in achieving the SDGs; organize public events, expert meetings, and site visits to allow participants to see the SDGs in action and learn from each other about successes and challenges they face; and research links between New York City’s sustainable development work, the Mayor’s commitment to equity, and the SDGs. Hiniker reports that since the establishment of the programme, the City has hosted tours, panel discussions and other events to discuss how NYC is localizing the SDGs.

Global Vision | Urban Action also identifies links between the SDGs and the 2015 ‘One New York: The Plan for a Strong and Just City’ (OneNYC), the City’s roadmap on economic growth, sustainability, and resiliency. OneNYC commits to lift 800,000 New Yorkers out of poverty or near poverty by 2025, to expand access to nutritious and affordable food, and to fight against climate change and strengthen resilience, among other goals. As outlined in the document, ‘OneNYC 2018: Progress Report,’ which assesses New York City’s progress on the plan, New York’s accomplishments so far include: a “record job and wage growth” and a “record low unemployment,” with gains in all five boroughs; and the lowest poverty level since the Great Recession. The report also notes that New York is the first major city or state in the US to commit to divesting pension funds from fossil fuels, and the first city to align with the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The OneNYC plan is available on the OneNYC website, along with its progress reports each year. The website also includes a list of indicators and initiatives related to the plan, and links to the NYC Open Data platform.

The HLPF will convene from 9-18 July 2018, in New York, US, on the theme, ‘Transformation Towards Sustainable and Resilient Societies.’ It will conduct in-depth reviews of SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 12 (responsible consumption and production), 15 (life on land) and 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

74,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/eu-issues-waste-management-rules-for-circular-economy/,"Tue, 29 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,EU Issues Waste Management Rules for Circular Economy,"22 May 2018: The EU has issued a set of waste management directives as part of a broader Circular Economy Action Plan adopted in December 2015. The new rules aim to prevent waste and increase recycling.



The legislation approved by EU Member States aims to strengthen the European waste hierarchy, which prioritizes actions to take at products’ end of life. The hierarchy first seeks to prevent waste, then aims to prepare for, in order of preference, materials’ reuse, recycling, recovery or disposal.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development highlights a need for improved waste management, including through SDGs 6, 11 and 12, as well as paragraph 34 of the declaration. SDG target 12.5 specially calls on Member States to “substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse.” The new EU rules set recycling targets for municipal and packaging waste, starting in 2025 and increasing the percentage of waste to be recycled, in five-year increments. The EU targets on packaging waste are material-specific (plastic, wood, glass, aluminum, etc.), with an overarching goal of recycling 65% of packaging waste by 2025, increasing to 70% by 2030.

The rules demand separation of materials, which has implications for municipal governments and existing waste collection infrastructure. By separating materials prior to collection, the EU aims to increase the quality and purity of collected waste streams, enabling the materials to be reused or fed into new production processes, thereby increasing circularity within the EU economy. To this end, the rules feature a longer-term goal on landfilling to be met by 2035. Recognizing that landfills pollute soils, groundwater and air, the directive restricts municipal waste sent to landfills to no more than ten percent of the total amount generated. The realization of these targets also will enable EU Member States to contribute directly to SDG target 11.6, which identifies municipal and other waste management systems as means of reducing cities’ adverse environmental impacts.

SDG achievement requires not just coordination across government mechanisms, but also the whole of society. The waste management legislation builds on previous efforts to engage non-state actors in the private sector, by using economic instruments and other incentives to drive extended producer responsibility (EPR). Under EPR schemes, the producer of a product or material is also responsible for it at the end of its life – as seen in phone and clothing take-back programmes. Without landfilling as an option due to the above target, waste producers and collectors will need to improve the reuse and recycling of materials, and incorporate “design for the environment” principles that increase a product’s recyclability or reuse at the end of its life.

Doing so may imply products’ being designed for simplicity or modularity, such that their components can be reused or their materials recycled with minimal effort. In both the electronics and textile industries, products are becoming increasingly complicated, using a wider range of elements and materials that ultimately hinders their ability to be reused or recycled at the end of their life as a product.

Through the passage of new rules aiming to achieve a circular economy, the EU and others can directly contribute to a broad swath of SDGs linked to material consumption and waste production. The European Commission’s press release also notes that the legislation aims to halt both food waste and marine litter, in close alignment with SDG targets 12.3 on food waste and 14.1 on marine pollution.

The report titled, ‘The Inefficiency of Inequality,’ was issued ahead of the 37th session of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC).

In the report’s foreword, ECLAC Executive Secretary Alicia Bárcena writes that a “culture of privilege” inhibits progress, pointing to “colonial vestiges” in the region that normalize social hierarchies and unequal access to development benefits, political participation and production assets. Bárcena warns that equality, productivity and democracy cannot be substituted for each other.

According to the report, LAC is the world’s most unequal region. Tax evasion equals 6.7% of its GDP in terms of income tax and value-added tax alone. In addition, access to education, high teenage motherhood rates, and discrimination based on ethnicity and race continue to perpetuate inequalities. “Territorial inequalities” between different socioeconomic levels also exist regarding life expectancy, infant mortality, illiteracy and access to drinking water. These disparities are exacerbated by: the extraction of natural resources; low infrastructure investment; gaps in access to sanitation, electricity and the internet; and climate change impacts.

The ECLAC study contends that inequality negatively affects productivity, fiscal policy, environmental sustainability and the spread of the knowledge society. By contrast, it emphasizes, pro-equality policies produce positive effects in terms of social well being, and help to create an economic system with benefits for learning, innovation, productivity and environmental protection. The authors call for transitioning towards a development pattern that enables a “virtuous circle” of growth, equality and sustainability. The report recommends revitalizing investment and immersing the region in the “fourth industrial revolution,” focusing on decarbonization, and decoupling growth from environmental impact.

The report details three pillars of decarbonization, namely digitalization, sustainable cities and renewable energies. On digital industry, it suggests that the region prioritize broadband infrastructure, the information technology industry, and business capabilities for the digital transformation of business models, products and services. It also calls for developing a regional digital market.

On urban sustainability, the report outlines proposals for decarbonizing universal public services and appropriating technological change in urban areas, including developing national urban policies and coordinating them with industrial and technological policies at different levels of government. On increasing the penetration of renewable energies in electric power generation, the report recommends: harmonizing regulations throughout the region; substituting imports in production chains; internalizing social costs, phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, pricing carbon and rewarding investment in renewables; reflecting the systemic risk of high-carbon paths; and regulating or standardizing bank financing for renewable energy projects.

The report also underscores the need to enhance transparency and trust in institutions, and strengthen international cooperation and multilateral institutions to make progress towards sustainable development. The 37th session of ECLAC is convening in Havana, Cuba, from 7-11 May 2018.

The 2018 report also looks at how the SDGs and Paris Agreement on climate change, respectively, are driving business strategy.

To generate the report, Ethical Corporation surveyed over 1,500 business professionals in a range of roles and sectors around the world, with 70% coming from Europe and North America. The survey identified how companies and business leaders are seeking to transform operations and outputs in order to deliver on the SDGs and Paris Agreement.

Among the findings, over two-thirds of corporate-brand respondents indicated that their company is integrating the SDGs into business strategy, which the authors note represents a significant and consistent increase in the two years since the Goals’ adoption in 2015. Of the remaining third of respondents, half indicated that they do not intend to do this in the future. Regionally, businesses in Europe and Asia-Pacific feature higher rates of integration than those in North America.

On the stage of SDG integration, 82% of respondents noted that they are currently in the mapping stage or integrating the Goals into business strategy. Only 12% claimed that the SDGs have been integrated across departments with clear goals set.

Despite this incomplete integration, the report finds that over half of respondents’ companies are using the SDGs as a framework to report on and communicate sustainability impacts. Thus, the authors underscore a risk of “SDG washing,” with companies using the SDGs as a communication tool “without much actual adaption to strategy or measurement of their impact towards the Goals.”

Indeed, 56% of respondents’ companies are not measuring their contributions to the SDGs. These findings are consistent with recent reports by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and KPMG.

On the primary SDG with which companies are engaging, the reports finds SDG 13 on climate action to be the clear leader across Asia-Pacific, Europe and North America, with roughly two-thirds of companies in each region identifying SDG 13 as that which they engage in the most. The report also finds promising scope for climate action by US cities, states and corporations alike, highlighting the #WeAreStillIn movement as an important convergence of like-minded actors in response to the US announcement of its intention to withdraw the country from the Agreement. While respondents primarily see governments as being the most influential actors in ensuring that the Paris Agreement is met, over one-third felt that companies will be most influential. The report indicates that the vacuum of climate leadership from the US federal government has increased expectations and placed an onus on business leaders to carry climate objectives forward, as 68% of respondents report expecting their respective companies to “take a lead in helping meet the Paris Agreement.”

Similarly to previous years, responses show that there is still much progress to be made. In particular, businesses are struggling to measure the return on investment (ROI) of sustainability activities. However, 75% of respondents stated that “their CEO is convinced of the value of sustainability,” a slight increase from previous years.

The report reflects on Africa’s performance on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and makes recommendations for integrated implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union’s Agenda 2063.

The report titled, ‘Integrating and Tracking Performance on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Agenda 2063: From Theory to Practice,’ urges countries to consider the interlinkages among the two agendas’ goals, targets and indicators to ensure horizontal and vertical integration of initiatives into national development plans. In the report, horizontal coherence refers to coherence between a national development plan and a country’s international development commitments and initiatives. Vertical coherence relates to synergies among goals, targets and indicators, such as between the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063. According to the report, levels of convergence between the two frameworks include 90% convergence at the Goal level, and 69% at the target level.

To support integration, the report presents the UNECA’s integrated planning and reporting toolkit, which aims to facilitate integration of multiple development frameworks into national development plans and to track implementation progress. The toolkit is intended for use by line ministries and others responsible for development planning at regional, national and sub-national levels, as well as for civil society and the private sector to track progress.

Users can apply the toolkit to evaluate the extent to which their national development plans and sectoral plans align with external frameworks. The software asks the user to identify the national goal, target or indicator that best matches the corresponding variable of the 2030 Agenda or Agenda 2063. If the goal, target and indicator is an exact match, the alignment is classified as “full.” If the national variable is a proxy, the alignment is considered to be “partial.” Variables can also be defined as having “no alignment.”

The software also facilitates performance tracking on all indicators of a country’s integrated national development plan.

Per the paper, almost all the 43 VNRs outline the importance of communication and public awareness regarding the SDGs, and approximately 20 of them refer directly to communication strategies or campaigns targeting the general public.

Two independent consultants on behalf of the P4R secretariat produced the non-paper titled, ‘Comparative Analysis of 43 VNRs Submitted to the HLPF 2017.’ It assesses VNRs from the following countries: Afghanistan, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Botswana, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Luxemburg, Malaysia, Maldives, Monaco, Nepal, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, Portugal, Qatar, Slovenia, Sweden, Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo, Uruguay, and Zimbabwe.

The paper finds that VNR reports vary in many aspects, such as length, structure, and thematic coverage, and that references to national follow-up and review “come in many different shapes and sizes.” For instance, it notes that some VNRs use the term “follow-up” to describe implementation, while others use it as a heading to explain their next steps, and some interpret “review” as “reporting,” although both terms are used interchangeably, with an emphasis on monitoring progress. The paper outlines challenges related to the SDG process, including on: monitoring, evaluation and statistical capacity; general data availability and difficulty of compiling and using disaggregated data; alignment of national strategies and plans, and of institutions; and financing and resource mobilization.

The authors find that the main institutional mechanisms steering the overall SDG process are assigning the responsibility to a specific ministry, or to a cross-sectoral (and sometimes multi-stakeholder) committee or council. Per the report, 23 countries have assigned the lead for SDG implementation to a specific ministry or to the offices of the Presidency or the Prime Minister, and a smaller number of countries are building on pre-existing sustainable-development related councils, commissions or committees to coordinate SDG planning and review. The authors also note that 16 countries have “recently” established lead councils, commissions or committees to steer and coordinate implementation of the 2030 Agenda, and that the 2017 VNRs indicate “an increasing recognition” of sub-national level actors and institutions as key to successful SDG implementation, compared to 2016.

According to the paper, all 43 VNRs describe efforts to ensure participation of non-state actors (civil society, private sector and academia) in the SDG process, with some devoting entire chapters or annexes to individual stakeholder groups, describing their roles, the mechanisms of their involvement and/or their contributions to the implementation of specific SDGs. The two main approaches used for non-state actor involvement are representation in institutionalized committees, and participation in special consultations, the paper notes, but both are not mutually exclusive. It adds that while some countries engage in special projects or partnerships with the private sector, countries have established private-sector or academic advisory committees in very few cases.

On statistics and data, the 2017 VNRs show considerable variation, according to the P4R paper, with countries providing different levels and structures of disaggregated data, from “mere numerical presentation” to charts, graphs and verbal explanations, and with statistical annexes ranging from one to more than 100 pages. The paper also outlines few references to the use of non-official data, with 14 countries mentioning big or other “alternative” data. Six VNRs mention data contributed by civil-society and other stakeholders.

P4R is a transnational multi-stakeholder network composed of government representatives and stakeholders from civil society, the private sector and academia. Initiated “on behalf” of the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, and the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, P4R facilitates dialogue and peer learning on SDG challenges, provides space to explore best practices and lessons learned, and shares expertise on new and emerging issues related to national monitoring and review processes.

The non-paper was prepared in advance of a P4R meeting that took place from 11-12 April 2018, in Tbilisi, Georgia. It adds to a series of reports consolidating and analyzing VNRs, such as the report ‘Progressing National SDG Implementation: An Independent Assessment of the VNR Reports Submitted to the HLPF in 2017’ published by the Canadian Council for International Co-operation (CCIC), in collaboration with other civil society organizations. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) has also issued synthesis reports of the 2016 and 2017 VNRs, as well as a compendium that synthesizes institutional arrangements adopted by the 64 countries that presented their VNRs during the 2016 and 2017 sessions of the HLPF.

Around 100 participants representing member States, the Council of Regional Organisations in the Pacific (CROP), and UN and multilateral partners took part in FEMM, which was organized on the theme of ‘Building Economic Resilience of Pacific Island Countries Through Sustainable Financing Flows’ in Koror, Palau, from 25-27 April.

The Cook Islands, Fiji, New Zealand, Palau and Samoa developed the proposal for a financing facility for resilient infrastructure. Tuvalu initiated the proposal for a climate insurance facility, which is now supported by a taskforce of SIS members and development partners.

Ministers reported on progress on regional work around the SDGs, and the development of regional statistics capacity for SDG reporting.

Other topics of discussion at the meeting were the role of the private sector in national and regional approaches to adaptation to climate change, and the role of regional superannuation and provident funds in financing regional infrastructure. Ministers also reported on progress on regional work around the SDGs, and the development of regional statistics capacity for SDG reporting.

In an article published in the lead-up to the meeting, Meg Taylor, Secretary-General of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS), highlighted the existing gap in direct investment for building resilience, citing research that every dollar spent for this purpose will save seven dollars that would otherwise need to be spent on response and recovery.

She stated that the proposed Pacific Resilience Facility will seek to strengthen the financial resilience of Pacific island countries; provide financing options for resilient development; strengthen strategic partnerships with donors and development partners; and build the capacity of national disaster risk budgeting and financing. Taylor also noted that the Climate Insurance Facility will insure against slow-onset and extreme weather events that are currently not covered by existing instruments. She referred to relevant international policy frameworks for this work, mentioning: the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change; the 2015 Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR); and the 2016 Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific, which covers action on climate change, disaster risk management (DRM) and low-carbon development.

Launched during the Bonn Climate Change Conference, which is meeting from 30 April to 10 May, the report recalls that the 23rd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 23) to the UNFCCC resulted in, inter alia: almost US$1 billion in financial commitments to address climate change; the launch of the Talanoa Dialogue, which aims to inform and inspire Parties as they increase their commitments; the first-ever Gender Action Plan; a platform for indigenous peoples and local communities aimed at the exchange of knowledge, technologies and practices; and an agreement on agriculture.

The report discusses goals for the year ahead, including: increasing the number of ratifications of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol so it can enter into force; concluding the political phase of the Talanoa Dialogue in the lead up to and during COP 24 in Katowice, Poland; and adopting the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP) by the end of 2018 at COP 24.

The report acknowledges links between the Paris Agreement on climate change, the SDGs and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), whereby action in one area benefits the others, and, in the words of UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, pursuing the three together “increase[s] impact and efficiency” and helps transform peoples’ lives and ensure a healthy planet.

The report highlights the Law and Climate Change Toolkit, piloted in 2017 to help countries review national laws and undertake reforms to meet obligations under the Paris Agreement.

On increasing the ability of countries to report on emissions, UN Climate Change 2017 activities included: training programmes for review experts on greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories and on biennial reports (BRs) and national communications (NCs); a handbook for measurement, reporting and verification (MRV); and regional training sessions and expos to help national experts prepare and finance national adaptation plans (NAPs), and align them with the SDGs.

The report highlights that, in 2017, the Adaptation Committee shared good practice on accessing the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and provided advice to Parties through the adaptation finance bulletin. In addition, the Secretariat launched the following: the Adaptation Knowledge Portal, which includes information and knowledge resources on enhancing climate resilience; NAP Central, a hub of information on creating and implementing NAPs; and ‘The Adaptation Exchange’ Facebook page, which disseminates knowledge, engages stakeholders and provides learning opportunities. At COP 23, the Executive Committee (ExCom) of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM) launched the Fiji Clearing House for Risk Transfer to help Parties develop and implement risk management and connect with risk transfer experts.

The report also provides an overview of climate financing, including: the GCF, with 76 projects and programmes, amounting to US$3.7 billion in direct funding and US$8.9 billion in co-financing; the Global Environment Facility (GEF), with US$4.2 billion in direct funding and US$38.2 billion through co-financing for over 1,000 mitigation projects, and over US$8 billion mobilized for adaptation; and the Adaptation Fund, which, as of March 2018, had committed US$476 million for adaptation and resilience activities in 74 countries. The Secretariat and the regional collaboration centres (RCCs) initiated the Green Investment Catalyst Roundtable to mobilize private sector finance for implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

On technology, the report notes that the Technology Executive Committee (TEC) launched three publications, and organized two major events, namely an innovation and climate change event, and a thematic dialogue on industrial energy efficiency and material substitution. The publications include: ‘South-South Cooperation and Triangular Cooperation on Technologies for Adaptation in the Water and Agriculture Sectors’; ‘Technological Innovation for the Paris Agreement,’ which highlights ways in which innovation can accelerate NDC and NAP implementation; and ‘Industrial Energy and Material Efficiency,’ which recommends policies for scaling up use of energy-efficient technologies in the industrial sector.

On building new partnerships, the publication reports that the Secretariat used COP 23 to pilot an initiative to establish links with a range of stakeholders on innovative ways to support implementation of the Paris Agreement, the Kyoto Protocol and the Convention. During Climate Week in New York in September 2017, the Marrakech Partnership launched the Climate Action Leadership Network. At COP 23, the inaugural Yearbook of Global Climate Action was launched, showcasing the results of the Marrakech Partnership.

On developing effective climate legislation, the report notes, the Secretariat, together with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) and the Commonwealth Secretariat’s Office of Civil and Criminal Justice Reform, piloted the Law and Climate Change Toolkit to help countries review national laws and undertake reforms to meet obligations under the Paris Agreement.

Also, the report highlights an Asia-Pacific Climate Action Agenda developed under the Nairobi Framework Partnership (NFP) to promote enhanced pre-2020 ambition and the employment of carbon pricing instruments and policies, and improve access to finance.

84,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-pope-francis-a-man-of-his-word,"Mon, 14 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Pope Francis: A Man of His Word’,"Veteran filmmaker Wim Wenders’ documentary sets out to connect the dots from one of the Church’s most beloved saints to the current pope.

Pope Francis: A Man of His Word opens with a God’s-eye view on a city that is neither Rome nor Buenos Aires. It is Assisi, where a visionary named Francis challenged all of Christendom with his radical reappropriation of the Gospel: his joyful celebration of the evangelical counsels, his enthusiastic embrace of poverty and of the poor and outcast, his celebration of the natural world, and his peacemaking efforts between Christians and Muslims, including his famed visit to the Sultan al-Kamil.

Wim Wenders, whose eclectic career has embraced arthouse dramas, documentaries, music videos and concert films, approaches the subject of his latest nonfiction film from an unusual perspective: the significance of an unprecedented papal name.

St. Francis of Assisi has long been among the most beloved of Catholic saints, even among those who don’t share his faith, and his most consequential 21st-century namesake remains popular among both Catholics and non-Catholics. Wenders sets out to connect the dots between the medieval Italian friar and the 21st-century Argentinian Pope, making the case that behind their widespread appeal is a message the world needs to hear.

A movie is only as good as its villain, and Wenders’ opening voice-over invokes nothing less than the problem of suffering and evil: natural disasters; terrorism and weapons of mass destruction; threats to the environment and extinction of species. Against this backdrop the “radical answers” of these two men named Francis stand out with fresh urgency.

Neither the life nor the papacy of the former Jorge Bergoglio is Wenders’ subject. Instead, Pope Francis focuses on characteristic themes of his preaching and teaching — particularly those most accessible to viewers of any faith or of none — as well as the engaging personality and common touch with which he advocates them.

These include Francis’ advocacy for the poor, immigrants and refugees; the perils of consumerism and the problem of unjust distribution of wealth; stewardship of the environment and an integral ecology; the horror of war and international arms trade; and the importance of understanding and peaceful coexistence among the world’s religions.

Francis himself brings these themes to viewers, looking and speaking straight into the camera in excerpts of interviews shot for the film in various Vatican City locations, including the Vatican Gardens. Intercut with these interview clips are images from globe-hopping pastoral visits to the Americas, Africa, the Philippines and elsewhere, with the Pope interacting with children, prisoners, hospital volunteers, refugees and disaster victims. The flow of images is subtly enhanced by an unobtrusive string-based score (mostly bowed instruments with an occasional guitar).

As a final touch, Wenders highlights the Franciscan foundations of the Pope’s concerns with evocative footage shot to look like clips from some lost silent-era St. Francis movie that I now wish really existed. (Wenders cross-fades into the first of these clips, shot on a hand-cranked camera from the 1920s, from one of Giotto’s frescoes in the Upper Church of Assisi’s Basilica of St. Francis which the silent footage matches perfectly.)

Focusing on Franciscan answers to global problems means, on the one hand, that Pope Francis is wholly positive in tone. Whatever tensions exist between Francis’ message and his personal failings, or whatever stumbles, gaffes or controversy have marked his papacy, are beyond the scope of Wenders’ interest.

As Pope Francis talks about the horrific crime of child sexual abuse and the necessity of holding accountable guilty priests and complicit bishops, viewers may think of the still-unfolding crisis in Chile, regarding which the Pope has acknowledged “grave errors” on his part, but the film leaves viewers to wrestle with such tensions on their own.

On the other hand, Wenders’ approach truncates Francis’ thought in various ways.

For one thing, there’s little sense of the theological vision underpinning his preaching. Little is said about Jesus — a reference to Jesus crucified in a discussion of theodicy is a notable exception — and nothing at all about Satan or hell, topics particularly notable in the Pope’s preaching.

Ideological selectivity is a factor. The controversial line “If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord … who am I to judge him?” is included, but not Francis’ critical views on gender theory. The environmental and economic concerns of Laudato Si (Care for Our Common Home) are emphasized, but there’s no mention of Francis’ indictment of abortion as part of the “throwaway culture.”

And while viewers will learn that Francis is against “proselytizing,” they won’t hear his positive exhortations regarding evangelization.

The full scope of Francis’ thought has something to challenge almost everyone. The film rightly highlights themes and ideas that are stumbling blocks to some on the right — Donald Trump boosters may bristle at the Pope’s criticism of “building walls,” and Wenders himself adds a dig at “alternative facts” — but the members of U2 (who recently endorsed the move to legalize abortion in their native Ireland) could nod their heads pretty much through the whole film.

Maybe not the whole film. Rare exceptions include dismissive remarks about feminism and men’s movements as “isolated” and opposed to sexual complementarity and reciprosity. Even when Francis goes on to talk benignly about the importance of women in leadership roles, his language may sound a bit jarring to more progressive American and European ears.

Not incidentally, the film paints a similarly selective and even misleading portrait of St. Francis, along the usual lines noted by G.K. Chesterton on the first page of his excellent little sketch Saint Francis of Assisi, as a proto-archetype of “all that is most liberal and sympathetic in the modern mood; the love of nature; the love of animals; the sense of social compassion; the sense of the spiritual dangers of prosperity and even of propriety … a sort of morning star of the Renaissance.”

Such hitches and omissions notwithstanding, there’s no avoiding the power of Pope Francis’ genuineness, his expansive Christian humanism and his rapport with people of all walks of life. His celebrated turns of picturesque speech are in evidence: “spiritual Alzheimer’s disease”; “living with the accelerator down”; “globalization of indifference.”

More than once we see tears on people’s faces — and, while one might suspend judgment at the sight of a politician brushing away a tear as the Pope addresses a joint session of Congress, tears on an inmate’s tattooed face as Francis embraces and preaches to prisoners or washes and kisses their (also tattooed) feet on Holy Thursday are another matter.

The mystery of suffering and evil looms above all in a 2014 papal visit to the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem and a 2015 multireligious gathering at Lower Manhattan’s 9/11 Memorial.

Similarly, in pastoral visits to a volunteer-run hospital in the Central African Republic, a typhoon-devastated Philippines and a refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesvos, Francis’ active solidarity with those who suffer evokes, however dimly, the Crucified Jesus to whom he pointed when asked about the problem of evil.

Some of the most memorable images emerge from these somber visits: Francis praying silently at Auschwitz or standing in a light rain wearing a translucent yellow plastic raincoat, clasping the hands of an elderly Filipino woman (also in yellow plastic) as she reverently kisses his hands.

There are also lighter moments, such as a droll Q&A with schoolchildren and a gentle papal exhortation to parents to play and waste time with their children.

The film ends with Francis citing a prayer he says he prays daily (ascribing it, following a popular misconception, to St. Thomas More) that includes a petition for a sense of humor. The last shot, of Francis grinning broadly into the camera, lingers long after the credits roll.

If Pope Francis: A Man of His Word isn’t the documentary final word on the 266th pope, in a way it’s something better: It’s a winsome, challenging call to take the Gospel more seriously and to work to make the world around us a little bit better.

85,https://nationvalleynews.com/2018/05/17/sdg-ambulance-numbers-slashed-paramedics-begin-strike/,"Thu, 17 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Nation Valley News,SDG ambulance numbers slashed as paramedics begin strike,"CORNWALL & SDG — Many fewer ambulances are on the road now that the paramedics serving Cornwall and the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry have begun legal strike action.

The paramedics are among 230 Cornwall city workers that went on strike this morning. The city, mandated provider to SDG of ambulance and a number of other services, failed to negotiate an agreement with involved union locals of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE).

As a result of the impasse, fewer ambulances and paramedics will be maintaining emergency service coverage in both Cornwall and the surrounding United Counties.

The city concedes that only three ambulances will respond to urgent and emergent calls during the day, down from the regular complement of nine. The nighttime roster drops from the usual six to just two union-staffed ambulances for the whole of SDG and the city. The cuts are imposed as per a previously negotiated “essential services agreement,” mandated by the province, that partly limits paramedics’ right to strike.

Echoing a warning issued by the United Counties, the city says that residents should only call 911 for medical in the event of “severe emergencies such as shortness of breath, chest pain, major traumatic injury or unconsciousness.” It advises taking a personal vehicle or taxi to the hospital, calling Telehealth Ontario toll-free at 1-866-797-0000, visiting a pharmacy, clinic, or doctor as alternatives to calling an ambulance.

“We have reached out to our partners, including area hospitals, fire services, police and taxi companies to ask for their assistance in responding to non-emergency calls during the strike,” said Bill Lister, Chief of Cornwall SDG Paramedic Services. “We hope this will allow us to focus on emergency calls only.”

During the strike action, no routine ambulance transfers will take place. But in the event of a “major emergency,” striking paramedics will still be called onto the job, the city assures.

“It certainly didn’t need to come to this,” said Amanda Palieps, president of paramedic local CUPE 5734, “but the City walked away from us on Tuesday afternoon and we didn’t see them or hear from them at all on Wednesday. We needed to be talking to hammer out a deal. It takes dialogue to bargain. Their absence tells us they were not serious about avoiding a strike.”

Main issues in the dispute include concessions sought by the City, and wages remain outstanding as well, according to the union.

Inside workers, represented by CUPE local 3251, have a strike deadline of May 23. Should they join their co-workers on the picket line next week, an additional 150 workers will be off the job.

“The city made what they called a ‘final offer’ on Tuesday,” said Alison Denis, CUPE National Representative. “Whatever they choose to call it, it contained all the same problems that yielded a 93 percent strike vote two months ago. Our members gave us a resounding direction with that strike vote. We’re very willing to try and find a resolution that works for both parties. But that would require the City to be here, actually bargaining. That is how this strike will get resolved.”

The paramedics have been without a contract since 2016.

Members of CUPE Local 1792, who work at long-term care home Glen Stor Dun Lodge, have also reached an impasse in their negotiations, but as they do not have the right to strike, their issues will be resolved by interest arbitration, according to the union.

He was speaking at the end of last week as 32 staff members of the SDG Centre for Africa visited Ntarama Genocide Site in Bugesera District to understand the history of Genocide against the Tutsi and how it was executed.

Ntarama has particular history of genocide since thousands were killed here as they sought refuge at the former church.

“The Genocide against the Tutsi was the worst attack on human rights, the aspect which SDGs must consider if the world is to achieve sustainable development,” he said.

“Many people read about Genocide against the Tutsi in books and other channels and it becomes difficult for them to understand. They should come and visit such memorial sites to understand first-hand,” he said.

Begashaw said that visiting memorials, remembering and supporting Genocide survivors are necessary steps to honour the innocent souls that were killed.

For Rwanda to fully recover from such situation, true love and unity must prevail, he said.

“What has been achieved in Rwanda is very impressive since many countries under similar conditions take much longer time to recover. We, however, have more things to do to ensure a better future,” he said adding SDGs promotes well-being and human rights for people.

He said that tolerance helps to manage aftermath of hard times like genocide.

“SDGs are about building people and helping them to understand what happened, fighting genocide among many other human crises. We have no room for this and should not leave behind human rights. With hardwork, we will getter a better future,” he added.

The below article by ITU Deputy Secretary-General Malcolm Johnson addresses the unique and valuable role of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) – the UN agency for information and communication technologies – in advancing SDG 11 by building smart, sustainable cities.

More than 50% of the world’s population lives in urban areas. By 2050, it will be nearly 70%. This raises huge challenges for municipalities and city planners. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) offer the solution to many of these challenges. At the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the UN specialized agency for ICTs, we are working to develop the tremendous potential ICTs have to help build smarter, more sustainable cities.

Indeed, many cities across the world are already utilizing Big Data analytics gathered from smart sensors and connected devices to manage traffic, reduce energy usage – and improve a wide range of urban operations and services.

If we want to reach the targets set out by the UN SDG 11, we need to work together to develop the tools that will help cities become truly smart and sustainable.

To succeed, international organizations, national governments, municipalities and local partners from civil society, academia and the private sector need to join forces.

Taking Action

Thankfully, there are encouraging signs of such collaboration.

ITU and the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) launched ‘United for Smart Sustainable Cities’ (U4SSC) in 2016. U4SSC is now supported by 16 UN bodies, and over 50 cities have now joined ITU’s pilot project.

U4SSC has facilitated the development of internationally recognized key performance indicators (KPIs) which allow cities to set goals and measure progress on becoming smarter and more sustainable. The indicators, developed by international experts in ITU and UN bodies, fall under five overarching categories: the use of ICTs; physical infrastructure; equity and social inclusion; quality of life; and environmental sustainability.

Recently, many cities including Dubai, Singapore, Montevideo, Maldonado, Moscow, Valencia, Pully and Rimini have asked ITU for assistance in the implementation of the U4SSC KPIs. In the past few months ITU has published case studies on the efforts of Dubai and Singapore to apply smart city innovations, providing a valuable reference point to other cities pursuing greater efficiency and sustainability.

The creation of smart cities requires a trusted infrastructure capable of supporting an enormous volume of ICT-based applications and services, which in turn requires coordinated adherence to common standards that ensure openness and interoperability. ITU develops international standards to enable the coordinated development of Internet of Things technologies and their application in smart cities. They also outlined how smart grids can help to build more controllable and efficient energy systems. Work on standards for smart 5G systems, which will help improve the feasibility of smart processes in large urban areas, is underway.

More Efficient Cities, By and For People

Standards can be powerful agents of change. Their application allows cities to reduce energy costs and emissions through more efficient buildings, electricity grids, street lights, transportation systems, and energy and water networks at a time when cities already account for 70% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

But smart, sustainable cities are about more than just reduced energy costs and emissions – they also aim for the realization of a better quality of urban life for all. New intelligent solutions, underpinned by smart sensors, can improve the safety and well-being of inhabitants.

Here are just a few examples. In Singapore, sensors and cameras build on an existing digital system to enable the government to send signals to drivers to improve traffic flow. In Kolkata, a social enterprise is using geographic information systems to map unplanned settlements, providing addresses and vital services for the inhabitants. In Quito, a mobile platform for women to report sexual harassment on the municipal public transport system is improving the way the city is policed. Digital technologies are also used to enhance citizen engagement and participation.

A Radical Shift for Resilient and Sustainable Societies

The transformation towards resilient and sustainable societies requires the redesign of our cities as well as a radical shift in our patterns of production, consumption, and waste.

Digital technologies give us an opportunity to develop more intelligent and inclusive urban systems where waste, costs, and ecological impacts are minimized, and where urban operations and processes, increasingly cognizant of the multiple stakeholders involved, can enhance quality of life for all. These technologies give us an opportunity to drive success not just on SDG 11, but on several other SDGs, demonstrating the significant impact that ICTs can have on the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

But the transition towards smart, sustainable cities requires collective intention and increased collaboration between citizens, businesses, and governments. Together, we can design more efficient, ecological and people-centered cities, which drive, rather than hinder, individual well-being and sustainable development.","The 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), meeting from 9-18 July 2018, in New York, US, will review in depth SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 15 (life on land).
The below article by ITU Deputy Secretary-General Malcolm Johnson addresses the unique and valuable role of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) – the UN agency for information and communication technologies – in advancing SDG 11 by building smart, sustainable cities.

The 2017 annual report is the fourth annual progress report on the implementation of UN-Habitat’s six-year strategic plan (2014-2019). The publication focuses on: ongoing processes related to strengthening UN-Habitat; specific challenges related to urbanization and human settlements and UN-Habitat’s response strategy; and UN-Habitat’s coordination role of monitoring and assessing implementation of SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and the NUA.

Among the examples of the organization’s work in 2017, the report discusses UN-Habitat’s contribution to conflict resolution through addressing the humanitarian-development-peace nexus in Iraq, helping to reintegrate Yazidis, who have been victims of ethnic and religious violence. In alignment with SDG 11, other SDGs with urban dimensions and the NUA, UN-Habitat: provided emergency relief supplies such as water; constructed sanitation and health facilities; provided emergency shelter; and built capacities of local and national authorities in urban planning and management.

In an effort to promote the central role of housing in ensuring the sustainable development of cities and human settlements, UN-Habitat helped develop a Global Housing Strategy to assist countries in adopting strategies, policies and legislation for sustainable urbanization that ensures citizen engagement. For example, in Mexico, UN-Habitat helped provide housing by introducing a mechanism for measuring city prosperity, enabling the city of Zapopan to adopt a strategy that ensured the centrality of housing and individuals to all urban planning initiatives.

UN-Habitat coordinates monitoring and assessment of implementation of SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and the New Urban Agenda.

To advance the SDGs by reaching out to low-income populations, UN-Habitat partnered with Infonavit, a Latin American mortgage lender, to ensure access to affordable mortgage financing. The report also highlights UN-Habitat and Infonavit’s collaboration on establishing an SDG Certification Programme for Housing, which will assess the compatibility of real estate development projects with relevant SDGs, particularly SDG 11, and provide real estate developers with greater incentives to develop projects that comply with the SDGs.

The report also discusses UN-Habitat’s City Prosperity Index (CPI), which offers tools for cities to formulate policies. The Index has been adapted to respond to SDG and NUA monitoring and reporting, and helps harmonize methodologies with agreed standards and indicators. The report explains that, inter alia: over 400 cities are implementing the CPI; 52 national statistical offices are using UN-Habitat’s tools and guidelines producing urban data and indicators that support SDG monitoring and reporting; 181 national and local authorities and partners have implemented sustainable urbanization plans and strategies; and 374 urban observatories are using UN-Habitat tools, methods and data in monitoring urban trends at national and local levels.

The report notes that mainstreaming UN-Habitat’s four cross-cutting issues (youth, gender, climate change and human rights) requires that every project contribute to the NUA and the SDGs.

According to the report, UN-Habitat’s financial performance on urban land legislation and governance reflects the importance of land in sustainable urbanization, risk reduction and rehabilitation. In addition to urban land issues, the Bank met or exceeded its implementation targets on research and capacity building, and development of methodologies to monitor implementation of the urban dimensions of the SDGs.

At the city level, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) released its second annual report ranking the 100 largest (by population) metropolitan areas in the US by their progress on the SDGs. These cities are home to 66% of the country’s inhabitants, and in total, US urban areas hold over 85% of the domestic population. But they are also responsible for 80% of the country’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Jeffrey Sachs, SDSN Director, notes in the forward to the report that, despite federal politics being at a gridlock, progress can still be made at the local and state level. Titled, ‘Leave No US City Behind,’ the 2018 Cities SDG Index draws on a set of 44 indicators identified by SDSN.

The report finds that data constraints limit the breadth of the analysis, flagging maternal mortality as an example, where data on the issue were only available for seven of the top 100 metropolitan areas. The report also finds that even the best performing metropolitan area (San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, California) is only about two-thirds of the way to SDG achievement. Progress is particularly needed on SDG 10 (reduced inequality), as well as Goals 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero hunger), 3 (good health and well-being), 5 (gender equality), 7 (affordable and clean energy) and 13 (climate action). The authors note that, in addition to record rates of inequality, gun violence, substance addiction and student debt, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are “at unacceptable levels.” Not a single metropolitan area performs better than “poor” on SDG 13. An interview with SDSN’s Jessica Espey, who supported the analysis, is available on Fast Company.

The World Resources Institute (WRI) also takes on the issue of cities and climate change, in a blog outlining how national governments can help cities ramp up action. Like SDSN, the WRI authors flag limited urban data availability. The post highlights that one of the first steps to measuring cities’ GHGs is the establishment of an “emissions inventory” as part of a broader city climate action plan. However, the requisite financial and technical resources to set up and monitor such a plan are often too onerous for cities. The authors call on national governments to provide data to local officials and offer guidance on how to do so in a manner that is actionable at the city level. They cite examples from Denmark, Brazil and the US.

An example of such collaboration can be found in Winnipeg, Canada, where the ‘Peg’ community indicator system (CIS) was relaunched by the International Institute for Sustainable Development and United Way of Winnipeg, with its indicators of community well-being now linked with relevant SDGs. The CIS enables residents to assess the health of their community using data collected by a wide variety of stakeholders. Interlinked categories include basic needs (income, safety), economy (youth unemployment, educational attainment), and natural environment (air quality, water use), among others.

The Peg indicator platform helps users to identify – in many cases down to the neighborhood level – areas of progress as well as shortcomings.

Trends that can be identified in the data for 2017 are analyzed in a report titled, ‘Our City: A Peg Report on Sustainability.’ This fourth annual edition was released on 15 June 2018, and uses the Peg platform to demonstrate how Winnipeg measures up against the SDGs and targets. The report categorizes 66 indicators into environmental, social and economic pillars, then maps them to both the SDGs and the primary issue category to which they correspond (i.e. basic needs, natural environment). It notes whether there is a trend of improvement or worsening, delving into the measurements to identify specifically – in many cases down to the neighborhood level – where progress has been made and shortcomings can be improved.

International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Deputy Secretary-General Malcom Johnson writes in a guest article on the SDG Knowledge Hub that many cities are already using big data analytics to tackle development challenges and make progress towards SDG 11. He describes ITU’s role in building more sustainable cities, also outlining a partnership between ITU and the UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) called ‘United for Smart Sustainable Cities’ (U4SSC). Using key performance indicators (KPIs) developed by U4SSC (on physical infrastructure, equity and social inclusion, quality of life, and environmental sustainability), ITU helps cities use new technologies to shift towards resiliency and sustainability, including through the development of infrastructure that leverages new appliances’ ICT-based applications and services. A guest article by U4SSC Vice-Chair Paolo Gemma also outlines how ITU supports smart, sustainable cities.

Also addressing cities’ progress against international agreements, UN Habitat’s ‘Annual Progress Report 2017,’ released in May, outlines implementation of the New Urban Agenda and demonstrates how these efforts contribute to SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

On resiliency in the built environment, an article on the World Bank’s Sustainable Cities blog summarizes lessons from Japan. The piece reviews the efficacy of Japanese building regulations, noting that efforts to improve construction practices were spurred by the combination of unregulated urbanization and previous seismic activity, which led to heavy tolls following natural disasters. The post links to a report by the World Bank and Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) that focuses on building safety in Japan. The report looks at Japan’s approach, including the legal and institutional framework for building regulations, the enhancement of building standards, and ensuring quality in planning, design and construction. Separately on buildings’ sustainability, a blog by David Thorpe on The Fifth Estate describes a challenge issued by the World Green Building Council last week – for the building sector to eliminate carbon emissions from building use by 2030, as part of the Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment.

Continuing on infrastructure and linking to the community level, the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3IE) has published an issue brief addressing the question, “does community-driven development build social cohesion or infrastructure?” The findings show a heavy skew towards the latter. 3IE notes that, although community-driven development (CDD) programs lead to improved facilities for education, health, water and sanitation, they “have no impact on social cohesion or governance.” Further, women are half as likely as men to be aware of CDD meetings, let alone attend or speak at them. Oxfam’s Duncan Green writes that this gender imbalance may push needs assessments towards building infrastructure, rather than devoting resources to health or education themselves. A lively discussion on the 3IE paper and CDD programs more broadly may be found in the comments section of Duncan’s blog.

The LAB will develop and implement urban sustainability projects in cities in the areas of education, health, infrastructure, mobility, energy and Internet of Things (IoT), among others, and will support the acceleration of new projects.

During the launch of the Smart City LAB, more than 25 smart urban solutions were presented. Speaking at the event, UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Executive Secretary Olga Algayerova highlighted the UNECE’s efforts to enhance engagement with the private sector in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. She said that smart cities should be part of broader local economic development efforts, and help boost public sector-driven innovative economic development in a flexible manner to incentivize the private sector to test various solutions.

USC aims to address urban issues in the UNECE region, and supports local-level implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs.

According to UN estimates, technologies and approaches for smart sustainable cities are already helping communities overcome the challenges of urban development and advance the SDGs, particularly SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). The first USC LAB demonstrates how such a platform can facilitate sustainable urban development. The LAB concept is expected to be replicated with a view to establishing a global network to enhance the development of future cities.

It finds that conflict, climate change and inequality are major factors in growing hunger and displacement, and are hindering progress towards the SDGs. The report highlights positive progress on the proportion of people living below the poverty line, under-five mortality and access to electricity.

Francesca Perucci, UN Statistics Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), speaking at the launch of the report on 20 June 2018, in New York, US, stressed the importance of timely data collection and analysis to monitor progress. She said this will require “political leadership, adequate resources and commitment to further expand on tools available.”

The publication titled, ‘The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2018,’ finds that “more people are leading better lives” than they were a decade ago. Since 2000, the proportion of people living with families on less than US$1.90 per day has falled from 26.9% to 9.2%, and the unemployment rate has decreased. Maternal mortality has declined by 37%, and the under-five child mortality rate has decreased by 47%. The proportion of population with access to electricity in the least developed countries (LDCs) has more than doubled.

Child marriage continues to decline around the world, in line with progress towards SDG target 5.2. In Southern Asia, for example, the report states that a girl’s risk of marriage during childhood has decreased by more than 40% since 2000. On SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), the report states that over 100 countries now have sustainable consumption and production (SCP) policies and initiatives.

Despite this progress, the report finds significant challenges remaining on the world’s progress towards the SDGs. The report underscores particular challenges for the world’s most marginalized and disadvantaged groups. Among other examples, gender inequality continues to hold women back and deprive them of basic opportunities and rights, while youth are three times more likely to be unemployed than adults.

The report also reflects on interlinkages among the SDGs. To address challenges related to climate change, conflict, inequality, persistent pockets of poverty and hunger, environmental degradation and urbanization, the authors suggest establishing robust water and sanitation infrastructure, ensuring access to clean and affordable energy, protecting ecosystems, building ecologically friendly and safe cities and adopting sustainable consumption and production patterns.

The report elaborates on how a transition towards sustainable and resilient societies depends on responsible management of finite resources. It underscores access to basic services as a stepping stone to sustainable development. The report further emphasizes how a resilient society can then deflect the threat of conflict by investing in good governance, reducing inequality and improving living conditions.

Individual SDG highlights include:

On SDG 2 (zero hunger), the number of hungry people in the world has risen from 777 million in 2015 to 815 million in 2016, mostly as a result of conflicts and disasters and droughts linked to climate change. In 18 countries, the report finds that conflict is a main driver of food insecurity.

On SDG 4 (quality education), more than half of children and adolescents are not meeting minimum proficiency in reading and mathematics, with disparities persisting along gender, urban-rural and other divides.

On SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), in 2015, 2.3 billion people lacked a basic level of sanitation, and 892 million people practiced open defecation.

On SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 91% of the global urban population breathes air that does not meet the World Health Organization’s (WHO) air quality guidelines for particulate matter.

On SDG 14 (life below water), global trends suggest declining marine fish stocks and deterioration of coastal waters, due to pollution and eutrophication.

On SDG 15 (life on land), the report finds that the world’s forest areas continue to shrink.

On SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), more than 570 different flows involving trafficking in persons were found between 2012 and 2014.

On SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals), official development assistance (ODA) for capacity building and national planning has been stable since 2010.

The report recommends improving the collection and dissemination of reliable, accessible, disaggregated and timely data, and urges better evidence-based policymaking to support progress on the SDGs. The report further calls for: increased political commitment and investment and technology and innovation.

The publication aims to increase awareness of tourism’s role in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and of the need to integrate sustainability into tourism policies, business practices and tourist behavior. Describing tourism as a driver of sustainable development, the report explains that tourism benefits economic growth, quality of life, environmental protection, diverse cultural heritage and world peace.

An output of the International Year of Tourism 2017 (IY2017), the publication is structured around IY2017’s five pillars: sustainable economic growth; social inclusiveness, employment and poverty reduction; resource efficiency, environmental protection and climate change; cultural values, diversity and heritage; and mutual understanding, peace and security.

The first volume demonstrates the ways in which tourism can contribute to these areas, identifies each pillar’s links with the SDGs, highlights action areas, and makes recommendations for governments, businesses and individuals. A cross-cutting section addresses governance, policy frameworks and instruments for sustainable tourism. The second volume includes descriptions of 23 case studies, and highlights tourism’s contribution to the SDGs.

The report elaborates on tourism’s opportunities for development, including: prospects for women and youth, developing countries, rural areas and indigenous communities; its potential to help conserve resources and cultural assets; and its capacity to inspire interaction and understanding. It explains that tourism can act as a catalyst for environmental and cultural protection, and strengthen peace and reconciliation. The report also identifies challenges, such as: tourism’s sensitivity to market influences; poor working conditions; emissions and pollution; potential adverse effects on biodiversity, heritage and communities; and lack of comprehensive data on tourism’s impacts on sustainability.

Tourism can act as catalyst for environmental and cultural protection, and strengthen peace and reconciliation.

The report recommends that, inter alia: governments establish and enforce inclusive and integrated policy frameworks for sustainable tourism development; businesses demonstrate their commitment to sustainability in core business models and value chains with enhanced action; and individuals and civil society advocate for and adopt consciously sustainable practices and behaviors.

Tourism Links with the SDGs

The report highlights three SDG targets, in particular, that mention sustainable tourism, namely: SDG target 8.9 on devising and implementing sustainable tourism policies that create jobs and promote local culture and products; SDG target 12.b on developing and implementing tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism; and SDG target 14.7 on increasing the economic benefits to small island developing States (SIDS) and the least developed countries (LDCs) from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism.

The report also spells out tourism’s links to each of the 17 SDGs:

SDG 1 (no poverty): tourism can be linked to national poverty reduction strategies and entrepreneurship through low skills requirements and local recruitment;

SDG 2 (zero hunger): tourism can spur sustainable agriculture by promoting production, supplies to hotels, and sales of local products to tourists;

SDG 3 (good health and well-being): tax income generated from tourism and visitors fees collected in protected areas can be reinvested in health care and services;

SDG 4 (quality education): capacity and skills need to be built to ensure the tourism sector can prosper and provide job opportunities for youth, women and those with special needs;

SDG 5 (gender equality): tourism can empower women, particularly through the provision of direct jobs and income generation in tourism and hospitality-related enterprises;

SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation): tourism investment requirement for providing utilities can play a critical role in achieving water access and security, hygiene and sanitation;

SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy): tourism can help reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs), mitigate climate change and contribute to energy access by promoting clean energy investments;

SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth): decent work opportunities in tourism, particularly for youth and women, and policies that favor better diversification through tourism value chains can enhance tourism’s positive socioeconomic impacts;

SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure): tourism can influence public policies aimed at upgrading and retrofitting infrastructure to make it more sustainable, innovative and efficient;

SDG 10 (reduced inequalities): sustainable tourism can engage local populations and all stakeholders in tourism development, and contribute to urban renewal and rural development;

SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities): tourism can, inter alia, promote urban regeneration, and preserve cultural and natural heritage;

SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production): adopting sustainable consumption and production (SCP) models can help monitor sustainable development impacts for tourism, including for energy, water, waste, biodiversity and job creation;

SDG 13 (climate action): tourism stakeholders can play a critical leading role in fighting climate change by reducing their carbon footprints;

SDG 14 (life below water): tourism development can help preserve marine ecosystems and promote a blue economy and the sustainable use of marine resources;

SDG 15 (life on land): sustainable tourism can help conserve and preserve biodiversity, and generate revenue as an alternative livelihood for local communities;

SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions): tourism can help foster multicultural and interfaith tolerance and understanding, and peace in post-conflict societies; and

SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals): tourism can strengthen public-private partnerships (PPPs) and engage all stakeholders to work together to achieve the SDGs.

Tourism and SDG Links with IY2017 Five Pillars

Regarding sustainable economic growth (pillar 1), the report highlights links with, inter alia, SDG target 8.9, target 9.1 on infrastructure development in transborder contexts and target 17.3 on support for promoting investments.

On social inclusiveness, employment and poverty reduction (pillar 2), the report points to: SDG target 1.4 on ensuring rights to economic resources for the poor and vulnerable; SDG 3, which is linked to enabling individuals to benefit from tourism as a “life-enhancing” activity; SDG targets 4.3-4.5 on access to vocational education and skills training; targets related to SDGs 5 and 10 on social inclusiveness of sustainable tourism development; and SDG target 8.9.

Regarding resource efficiency, environmental protection and climate change (pillar 3), the report notes interlinkages with, inter alia, SDG target 8.4 on resource efficiency in consumption and production; SDG target 12.b; SDG target 12.1 on implementation of 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (10YFP), including the Sustainable Tourism Programme; SDG targets 12.3 and 12.6 on food waste and sustainability reporting by companies; and target 14.7.

On cultural values, diversity and heritage (pillar 4), the report describes links with SDG target 11.4 on strengthened efforts to protect and safeguard cultural and natural heritage; and aspects of SDGs 8 and 12 that mention culture in relation to tourism.

Regarding mutual understanding, peace and security (pillar 5), the report references SDG 17, which discusses issues relevant for sustainable tourism development, such as means of implementation (MOI), policy and institutional coherence, multi-stakeholder partnerships, data, monitoring and accountability.

The report recommends funding for sustainable tourism development towards SDG-related projects, such as: national tourism strategies to achieve sustainable development; strategic infrastructure projects; and scalable and innovative sustainable tourism projects.

The case studies contained in Volume II address, inter alia: green supply chains in Slovenia; a world heritage site in Egypt; women entrepreneurs in Mali; a responsible tourism initiative in Kerala, India; a coral island park in Tanzania; wildlife conservation in Kenya; climate change vulnerability in Mexico; enhancing the climate resilience of tourism-reliant communities in Samoa; hostels in the US; sustainable tourism governance in Bohol province, the Philippines; a sustainable tourism initiative in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE); and the Youth Career Initiative, which helps the hotel sector address SDG 8 by supporting disadvantaged youth, including human trafficking survivors, through skills and employability training.

The report was released on 6 June 2018 in Brussels, Belgium, during European Development Days (EDD).

93,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/netherlands-second-sdg-report-highlights-progress-on-goals-8-12-and-16/,"Tue, 05 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Netherlands' Second SDG Report Highlights Progress on Goals 8, 12 and 16","1 June 2018: The Netherlands has released its second SDG report, which finds the Netherlands ranks highly among European countries in several areas of progress towards the Global Goals. In other areas, the country lags behind its European peers.



In 2016, Statistics Netherlands (CBS) published its first report on “the state of affairs in the Netherlands,” based on the UN’s global SDG indicator framework, using statistics already available at CBS. For the second report, titled, ‘The Sustainable Development Goals: The Situation for the Netherlands,’ the government conducted an extensive consultation with over 30 ministries, knowledge institutes, policy analysis organizations and NGOs to produce data for a set of supplementary indicators. As a result, the report includes data on 35 SDG indicators that are measured with an alternative indicator. In addition to these alternative indicators, the report includes data on 98 official indicators, 34 more than in the 2016 report.

According to the report, the Netherlands shows positive progress on the majority of indicators for SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). In contrast, most indicators for SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities) suggest negative development in the country.

The report highlights several areas in which the Netherlands ranks highly among European countries. In particular, the Netherlands ranks highly on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, confidence among Dutch citizens in institutions, and good access to public transport. The report also identifies areas in which the Netherlands lags behind its European peers, including its proportion of renewable energy, which at 6% is among the smallest in Europe, and the number of women in managerial positions.

The report underscores the importance of the Netherlands’ national strategy in achieving the SDGs, observing that for many SDGs, the government still lacks national goals and aims. The report recommends continued monitoring of SDG progress, and ensuring improvement on areas in which additional progress is needed, such as the environment, energy, climate change and inequalities.

In 2017, the four countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Aruba, Curaçao, the Netherlands and St Maarten) reported jointly to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) with a Voluntary National Review (VNR). The government reported on strengths including GDP per capita, confidence in institutions, healthy life expectancy, participation in lifelong learning, and official development assistance (ODA). Areas for improvement included: social inclusion, such as people living below the poverty line and gender inequality; high fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per capita, along with a low share of renewable energy in the total energy supply relative to other European countries; and high environmental pressures placed on low-income countries and middle-income countries to meet the Netherlands’ food production needs. [Publication: The Sustainable Development Goals: The Situation for the Netherlands] [Statistics Netherlands Press Release] [2017 VNR report]","1 June 2018: The Netherlands has released its second SDG report, which finds the Netherlands ranks highly among European countries in several areas of progress towards the Global Goals.
As a result, the report includes data on 35 SDG indicators that are measured with an alternative indicator.
According to the report, the Netherlands shows positive progress on the majority of indicators for SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions).
The report highlights several areas in which the Netherlands ranks highly among European countries.

An even more drastic dust storm swept over India recently and left behind a trail of casualties.[2] Then in May, sand and salt storms transferred from the dry Aral Sea, known as the Aralkum Desert, covered some provinces and the capital city of Turkmenistan, Ashgabat. Cotton fields, orchards and pastures were covered with salt.[3] [4]

Such events alarm us about the magnitude and seriousness of this recurrent natural disaster. But why is it happening and what are the impacts of sand and dust storms?

Sand and dust storms (SDS) are often associated with just a few countries, such as China, Kuwait, and South Korea in Asia. But they affect 151 countries[5] directly and pose real threats to the lives, health, well-being and sustainable development of millions of people.

Sand and dust storms gained serious global attention just three years ago because of the growing impacts of air pollution on health, the emergence of new sand and dust storm source areas and increasing damage and losses in some areas. It was the first time the global community signaled a readiness to take concrete action.

Considering the havoc recent dust storms have caused, in India for example, the public must capitalize on this momentum to get policy-makers to take bold and coordinated action and to engage the public in all affected countries. The next opportunity might be a regrettable moment, with epic catastrophic losses.

Air pollution is typically associated with the burning of fossil fuels. It is viewed as a relatively new environmental threat. In fact, extreme air pollution from sand and dust storms has existed for millennia.

A massive sandstorm in Egypt 2,500 years ago buried the army of Persia’s King Cambyses.[6] An ancient Chinese word meaning “dust rain” appears in the Bamboo Annals that date back to 3,000 years ago.[7] Sirocco, haboob, yellow dust, white storms and the harmattan all refer to sand and dust storms. But one of its most notorious manifestations in modern history was the 1930s “dust bowl” in the United States, which drove farmers out of business.[8]

Sand and dust storms cause serious health conditions. Prolonged exposure to fine dust causes premature death.[9] It damages the air sacs in the lungs and causes or worsens the symptoms of bronchitis[10] and respiratory diseases, such as asthma. Reduced visibility during dust storms increases the chance of accidents[11].

Globally, 334 million people and 14% of children experience asthmatic symptoms.[12] Meningitis and valley fever outbreaks in Africa and the US are associated with dust storms.[13] [14] [15] Moreover, if dust is contaminated by chemical residues from agricultural land or mining sites or air pollutant matter, for example, it can cause even more serious health and environmental problems in the areas where it is deposited.[16] [17] [18] [19]

The economic costs, too, can be staggering. Sand and dust storms linked to activities in oil production and exploration costs Kuwait at least US$190 million every year. The city of Sydney in Australia is threatened by dust storms. The economic impact of one such dust storm on 23 September 2009 was estimated at US$219 million.[20]

The impacts of sand and dust storms are felt beyond the country of their origin, making them a transboundary – and thus political – issue. Dust affects many development sectors, from agriculture, transportation, solar energy and industry, to sanitation, water quality and the Earth’s system itself – its weather, nutrient cycle and biomass productivity.

Despite these wide-ranging and growing impacts, public attention to and policy action on sand and dust storms lag behind real needs. Experts warn that urgent action must be taken before it gets too expensive to contain these phenomena.

A recent Global Assessment of Sand and Dust Storms produced by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) shows that human activity and climate change may increase the intensity and occurrence of sand and dust storms.[21]

Dry areas are typically the source of major natural dust storms. However, other landscapes – agricultural lands, high latitudes, dry water beds and industrial sites – are now also source areas. Sites where dust is deposited in urban areas can become secondary sources of the re-suspension of deposited dust. These anthropogenic sources make up approximately 25% of the global dust emission. Emissions are mostly attributed to the removal of vegetation cover, overgrazing, and the drainage of surface water.

Governments are starting to act, but they need inspiration to work together.

Since 2015, the UN General Assembly has adopted three resolutions in a row to combat sand and dust storms. In 2016, the second session of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-2) resolved to tackle sand and dust storms. Then, in 2017, the 13th session of Conference of the Parties to the UNCCD adopted its first decision on sand and dust storms. The Conference invited governments to take action based on the activities proposed in the Convention’s Policy Advocacy Framework on sand and dust storms.

The Framework sets out precautionary measures to minimize the negative impacts of sand and dust storms in the three key areas of early warning, resilience and preparedness, and source mitigation. In addition, countries that are potential sources of sand and dust storms need to explore this threat when considering their voluntary national targets for achieving land degradation neutrality (LDN).

LDN is a Sustainable Development Goal target (15.3) measuring the health of the land. The UNCCD is the custodian of the LDN target. The inclusion of the LDN concept in the UNCCD 2018-2030 Strategic Framework as a key tool for implementing the Convention strengthens its achievement. LDN can provide an effective framework to address anthropogenic sources in affected areas.

Last December, the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on sand and dust storms that calls for policy coordination of global actors and a UN system-wide approach and action plan to address these challenges.

With this political will, we have a lot to build on.

Discussions among governments do more than deepen global commitment. They inspire a coordinated, coherent, harmonized and integrated policy approach and concrete action plans for global and regional actors. They can motivate broader engagement of stakeholders, particularly scientists, local authorities and communities and the private sector, in risk management planning and actions. And they can promote strengthened national coordination among policy-makers in different sectors to assure policy development, implementation and adequate resources.

We must deal with the root causes of sand and dust hazards by reducing emissions from sources caused by human activity. But dust does not respect political boundaries, so we must work together.

It will take cooperation and coordination in order to enhance resilience and preparedness among different actors and fields, especially if it is guided by disaster risk management principles. The focus of the UN-system wide approach should be to fill gaps and to build upon and strengthen current actions.

For instance, the WMO’s Sand and Dust Storms Early Warning Advisory and Assessment System aims to build capabilities for improved and reliable SDS forecasts of countries.[22] Initiatives under UNEP and the UNCCD’s regional and national action plans to establish vegetated strips to prevent desert expansion in China and Africa are delivering results.[23] These are basic building blocks for a global action plan to combat sand and dust storms.

Successful and collaborative actions on sand and dust storms contribute directly and indirectly to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For instance, they will help countries to achieve: SDG 3 on health and air quality; clean water as called for in SDG 6; SDG 11, which calls for making human settlements safe and sustainable; land degradation neutrality and biodiversity conservation targets under SDG 15 (life on land); climate action under SDG 13; sustainable agricultural production under SDG 2 (zero hunger); and economic growth as addressed in SDG 8.

Sand and dust storms pose serious health and economic costs. Rolling out an effective, comprehensive and people-centered sand and dust storm management strategy will save costs and enhance the resilience and preparedness of vulnerable communities and ecosystems.

The event took place from 5-6 June 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. The STI Forum featured ten substantive panel discussions and a series of 90-second innovation pitches selected from numerous submissions related to the SDGs under discussion.

The STI Forum is a component of the UN’s Technology Facilitation Mechanism (TFM) outlined in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The TFM also includes an Inter-Agency Task Team on STI for SDGs (IATT), a 10-Member Group, and an online platform.

Opening the meeting, UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) President Marie Chatardova stressed the need for technologies to address the vulnerabilities of those most left behind. Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti, Chef de Cabinet for the UN Secretary-General, said new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), biotechnology and robotics, will generate new solutions to SDG implementation.

Mahmoud Mohieldin, World Bank Group, said “STI roadmaps” serve as a practical building block for policy makers, the private sector, civil society and development partners to integrate STI into national development plans and budgets. He said the Bank will leverage public-private partnerships (PPPs) to: develop the foundation for sustainable, technology-led economies; expand the capacity of people and institutions to thrive in a society resilient in the face of disruption; and harness disruptive technology, data, and expertise to solve development challenges and manage risks.

Andrew Keen, author of ‘The Internet is Not the Answer’ and ‘How to Fix the Future,’ called for greater regulation of companies and data privacy, adding that the UN is the right place to begin this conversation. Miguel Ruíz Cabañas, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mexico, called for the UN to collect and analyze information and develop best practices and exchange of information so governments can utilize technological change and AI while minimizing risks.

Arun Sundararajan, New York University, US, noted that it is not pragmatic to try to regulate online platforms, which will increasingly mediate people’s relationships with markets, but we need to negotiate with them as with institutions. He emphasized that we need to start a democratization of these platforms and ask them to come up with a clear, simple set of principles and take a positive role in society.

Elliott Harris, UN Chief Economist, addressed the environmental costs of technology. For example, the electricity demand for cryptocurrency mining equals the electricity use of the Czech Republic.

Peter Major, UN Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD), said the CSTD focuses on the positive implications of big data to fight typhoid in Uganda and help farmers respond to food security and drought in India and other countries. He called for linking traditional knowledge with modern science, as well as examining ethical challenges and bridging the digital gap.

Sarah Al Amiri, Minister of State for Advanced Sciences, United Arab Emirates (UAE), observed that, in order to achieve the SDGs, we will need to capture the data from ongoing experiments. Beyond big data, we will need access to data from other complex projects, she said. Thomas Philbeck, World Economic Forum, stressed that “the way we talk about technology matters” and asked for caution when using language that might lock us into dangerous narratives, such as fear or technology or “worshipping” technology.

For the SDGs to succeed in Africa, technological innovation anchored in local capabilities will be essential.

Erika Kraemer-Mbula, University of Johannesburg, South Africa, stressed that for the SDGs to succeed, they need to succeed in Africa. She noted that Africa is estimated to double its population by 2050, and will have the world’s largest work force, comprised especially of youth. Microenterprises will thus be vital to employment, she said, and technological innovation anchored in local capabilities will be essential for sustainable development. She called for thinking beyond education to learning systems that blend different types of science.

Suresh Nair, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, India, gave an example reflecting the benefits of genetic engineering and biotechnology. To address the decrease in arable land as well as pressure to use less pesticides and the urgent need to increase food productivity, he highlighted “host-based resistance.” By using plants’ natural resistance, he said crop yield can increase, which lessens the pressure to convert forestland into farmland and prevents biodiversity loss. To that end, he recommended carrying out vigorous screening of crop germplasm to identify appropriate resistance against major pests and devise molecular tools to get a better understanding of insect pests.

During the Forum’s discussions, Egypt for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China) called for encouraging the development, transfer, and diffusion of technologies to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms. He called for making the TFM online platform operational as soon as possible.

Bangladesh for the least developed countries (LDCs) said internet access depends on a few major companies in the developed world, and LDCs lack the needed infrastructure to attract them. He stressed that access to information and communications technologies and the internet is essential to graduate from LDC status and not to relapse after graduation. He expressed hope that the Technology Bank for LDCs, inaugurated on 4 June 2018, will provide the LDCs with the support they need. Turkey noted that the Bank, which is hosted by Turkey, will strengthen the capacity of LDCs to scale up and deploy technology and innovation, and strengthen partnerships between governments, the private sector and other stakeholders.

Brazil called for addressing inequalities caused by the digital divide. Japan said that every country should develop an STI roadmap for each SDG to ensure no one is left behind.

96,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/vnr-2018-main-messages-available-for-45-countries/,"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,VNR 2018 Main Messages Available for 45 Countries,"18 June 2018: Of the 47 countries presenting their Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) at the 2018 UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) in July, 45 have made their report’s main messages available. Some of these countries presented their VNRs at previous HLPF sessions (Benin, Colombia, Egypt, Mexico, Switzerland, Togo and Uruguay), and are updating their progress on the SDGs.

The VNRs were called for by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to facilitate the sharing of national experiences, including successes, challenges and lessons learned, with a view to accelerating the implementation of the SDGs. The “main messages” provide a brief overview of more comprehensive review documents that are prepared by countries to report on SDG implementation efforts during the HLPF.

By 7 June 2018, main messages were available for 35 countries, including all of the Eastern European Group (EEG) countries that will present at the 2018 HLPF. Between 8 and 18 June, 10 additional countries’ messages became available: Benin, Mali, Republic of Congo and Senegal; Bahrain, UAE and Viet Nam; Colombia and Ecuador; and Andorra.

African Group

Benin has made available the opening statement of its VNR, which notes that the country has aligned its Government Programme of Action, its National Development Plan and other strategic documents with SDG priority targets. Per the statement, Benin developed a digital application (app) to help Ministries align their activities towards the SDGs, launched a process to cost the initiatives needed to reach its targets, and prepared a mapping of technical and financial partners and civil society organizations (CSOs) to identify priority targets that require a high level of coordination. Benin also announced the adoption of a country programme document for the Green Climate Fund to ensure coherence between major environmental and climate initiatives, and of a national policy on climate change.

On the SDGs to be reviewed during the HLPF, Benin notes its intention, by 2021, to reach 100% of households with access to safe drinking water (SDG 6 – clean water and sanitation), and achieve energy self-sufficiency with a “good level” of energy mix in which renewable energy plays an important role (SDG 7 – affordable and clean energy). It says it has adopted a law prohibiting the production, import, marketing and use of non-biodegradable plastic bags (SDG 12 –responsible consumption and production), as well as a policy on land degradation neutrality (SDG 15 – life on land), among other documents.

According to its summary, Mali relied on a steering committee composed of representatives of the ministerial departments, civil society, the private sector and parliament to prepare its VNRs, and held a national workshop in May with more than 120 participants to validate the review.

The country also organized trainings and SDG prioritization workshops at regional and national levels, established a parliamentary monitoring and evaluation committee for the SDGs, and proposed an institutional mechanism for the coordination of SDG implementation, under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister’s Office. This mechanism is composed of five thematic groups at the national level, and has a decentralized architecture at the sub-regional level, the summary says. On SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals), Mali notes that efforts to improve aid effectiveness are underway, with the drafting of a national development cooperation policy and a national aid management policy.

The Republic of Congo’s VNR summary reports that the country has prepared an SDG roadmap that comprises components on: ownership, contextualization, and integration of the SDGs into national development policies and plans; coordination and monitoring-evaluation mechanisms; and capacity building for SDG monitoring. With the help of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and sectoral ministries, it says, the Republic of Congo has carried out a rapid integrated assessment (RIA) to measure the degree of alignment between the SDGs and national development plans and sector strategies, and to identify interconnections between SDG targets and sectors where interventions are likely to have an impact on many Goals.

The country indicates that it has prioritized 14 SDGs, 74 targets, and 113 indicators that will be integrated into national development plans, including in its national development plan 2018-2022 that is currently being finalized. The prioritized SDGs are: SDG 2 on zero hunger, SDG 3 on good health and well-being, SDG 4 on quality education, SDG 5 on gender equality, SDG 7 on affordable and clean energy, SDG 8 on decent work and economic growth, SDG 9 on industry, innovation and infrastructure, SDG 10 on reduced inequalities, SDG 11 on sustainable cities and communities, SDG 12 on sustainable consumption and production, SDG 13 on climate action, SDG 15 on life on land, and SDG 16 on peace, justice and strong institutions.

Per its summary, the Republic of Congo established a steering committee in charge of following-up on the SDGs, and is preparing an action plan for SDG implementation that should provide information on related costs for their implementation. It notes mobilizing funding for the effective and efficient operationalization of the SDGs as one of the main challenges facing the country.

Senegal’s messages note that the process of alignment between the SDGs and the ‘Plan for an Emerging Senegal’ (PES)– a policy framework to get Senegal onto the road to development in 2035 –was launched in January 2016 by the government. Its priority actions cover nearly 77% of the SDG targets. It also reports that “inclusive” mechanisms, such as an SDG monitoring platform for CSOs, were established, but that participation of some stakeholders such as the private sector, parliamentarians and local elected representatives, should be further strengthened.

Asia-Pacific Group

Bahrain’s messages state that the Government Plan of Action (GPA) is aligned with 78% of the SDGs, and the country’s Constitution and public policies guarantee universal access to basic services, and gender equality. The country reports that basic education is free and compulsory, healthcare is free and universal, and two committees instituted by the Supreme Council for Women ensure equal opportunities and gender responsive budgeting. It also indicates that: women hold 55% of supervisory positions, with 53% and 33% participation in the public and private sectors respectively; public and civil society-led programs extend to migrant workers to safeguard their rights, provide health insurance and shelter, and combat human trafficking; five new sustainable cities are being developed; and remittances of migrant workers in Bahrain amounted to approximately US$2.5 billion in 2017.

In its messages, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) announces that the SDGs and sustainability will be a central focus of Expo 2020 Dubai, and its SDG National Committee serves as a platform for multi‐stakeholder engagement. The Committee is chaired by the Minister of State for International Cooperation, is vice-chaired by the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Authority, and comprises 17 federal government organizations, according to the VNR messages.

On progress related to SDG implementation, the UAE indicates that the SDG National Committee has: prioritized targets “to pursue on an annual basis;” determined criteria for incorporating SDG targets into the national development agenda; assessed the scope of SDG implementation “given resource capacities and constraints in a particular year;” and developed a comprehensive communication strategy to engage societal stakeholders on the SDGs. The UAE also notes that: a Private‐Sector Advisory Council reports to the vice‐chair of the SDG National Committee; it has a Minister of State for Youth Affairs; it launched the Emirates Youth Council; and seven emirate‐wide Local Youth Councils are involved in official deliberations concerning SDG implementation.

Viet Nam states that the 17 SDGs have been nationalized into 115 Vietnamese SDG targets and in its national action plan for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. It adds that sustainable development principles have been mainstreamed into its 2011-2020 Social and Economic Development Strategy and its 2016-2020 Social and Economic Development Plan. The country’s key messages note that the Viet Nam Business Council for Sustainable Development aims to enable the business community to share and spread good practices, and to play an “important role” in realizing the SDGs.

Per the messages, Viet Nam has a number of policies aimed at promoting social equality to ensure that no one is left behind, and the country has achieved a number of SDG-related results. For instance, its national multi-dimensional poverty decreased from 9.9% in 2015 to less than 7% in 2017; 93.4% of households in 2016 had access to safe water, and 99% of Vietnamese households had access to electricity during the same year.

Latin American and Caribbean Group (GRULAC)

Colombia’s executive summary notes that in addition to the SDG initiatives it reported on in its 2016 VNR, it has developed a national strategy (CONPES 3918) to implement the goals. The strategy, it says, includes, inter alia: a monitoring process with national indicators and quantifiable targets; institutional responsibilities; a plan for strengthening statistical capacities; and a communication strategy seeking to promote alliances with non-governmental actors.

The summary indicates that the website www.ods.gov.co comprises updated information on the country’s progress towards the goals, and that a mapping of resources from different public domestic sources and their allocation to each SDG has been prepared as a starting point for the development of a financing strategy. It also reports that a joint initiative is being developed with the private sector where companies can provide information that will enable them to make their SDG support more visible, and dialogues took place in different parts of the country to highlight SDG challenges and successful experiences.

According to its main messages, Ecuador has developed SDG “Flagship Interventions,” and has established mechanisms for the alignment, monitoring and evaluation of its planning with the 2030 Agenda. Among the SDGs to be examined in depth at the HLPF 2018, the VNR messages report that: guaranteeing universal access to water (SDG 6) is a priority for the Ecuadorian government and the “Safe Water and Sanitation for All” strategy is being implemented; and various programmes have contributed to maintain more than 16% of the national territory under conservation or environmental management (SDG 15). The messages also note that the VNR’s preparation was based on contributions from the government, private sector, academia, civil society and local governments.

Western European and Others Group (WEOG)

Andorra reports that each “action” submitted to the Council of Ministers for approval must be associated with the SDGs, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has aligned its annual master plan for international cooperation with the goals. Its VNR summary notes that the Andorran private and financial sectors have integrated the 2030 Agenda into their social responsibility strategies, and education for sustainable development is a key concept of the Andorran education system, which it says, also integrates in a transversal way, education for human rights and democratic citizenship. It stresses the need to strengthen the production of statistical data, adding that the government has approved it statistical plan 2018-2021.

On SDGs examined in the VNR, Andorra says that in addition to the six goals reviewed in depth at the 2018 HLPF, it has also included Goals 4 (quality education) and 13 (climate action), which are of particular importance for the country. On the VNR preparation, the Andorra’s summary states that an inter-ministerial team was set up to draft the report, national bodies representing civil society were asked to participate in the drafting process, and an emphasis was placed on the collection of statistical data. It also reports on the launch of a public consultation on the Internet and on an awareness and information campaign on the VNR.

Improving the health and well-being for a worldwide population expected to swell to 8.5 billion people by 2030 is integral to each of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Pfizer Inc. will talk about its support of the SDGs in the second of 3BL Media’s new webcast series, “Aligning Business With the Global Goals,” July 26 at 2 p.m. ET. Attendance is free and open to corporate responsibility and sustainability professionals.

“Pfizer wears the SDGs on its sleeves, proudly wrapping its corporate headquarters with the Global Goals just blocks from the United Nations in New York,” Dave Armon, CMO of 3BL Media and moderator for the series. “We look forward to hearing how Pfizer has embraced the SDGs across the business, forging partnerships that have distributed millions of medicines and vaccines doses and committing to the worldwide elimination of trachoma, the leading infectious cause of blindness.”

In September 2015, the UN officially introduced the SDGs to transform our world and “leave no one behind” by 2030. The goals were adopted by 193 nations, and the UN has called for broad-based support of the SDGs, including active involvement by the private sector.

Based in New York City, and reporting annual revenues of $52.5 billion, Pfizer uses the SDGs as a framework to communicate its work related to seven of the Global Goals – SDG 3, Good Health and Well-Being; SDG 5, Gender Equality; SDG 6, Clean Water and Sanitation; SDG 9, Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG 11, Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 12, Responsible Consumption and Production; and SDG 17, Partnership for the Goals.

Presenting on “Aligning Business with the SDGs: Good Health and Well-Being With Pfizer,” will be Chris Gray, senior director, global institutions and public reporting, in Pfizer's Corporate Responsibility group.

According to the 35 messages currently available online, most of these countries have put in place institutional arrangements to advance SDG implementation, and have outlined the importance of engaging multiple stakeholders.



VNR main messages provide a brief overview of more comprehensive document which is currently prepared by countries to report on SDG implementation efforts. On 7 June 2018, main messages were available for countries from all five UN regional groups, as follows: six from the African Group; eight from the Asia-Pacific Group; eight from the Eastern European Group (EEG); six from the Latin American and Caribbean Group (GRULAC); and six from the Western European and Others Group (WEOG). VNR main messages were also available for Palestine, a UN observer State.

Countries have taken various approaches to highlight their main messages: some mainly focus on the SDGs under review at the 2018 HLPF, while others take a broader approach by referring to the 17 SDGs as a whole. Two highlight that they are considering an 18th SDG, specific to the national context. Countries generally outline efforts to implement the SDGs at the national level, while a few report on implementation efforts at the sub-national level and on integrating the SDGs as part of their international development frameworks.

African Group

Cabo Verde’s messages note that equitable, universal and sustainable access to energy, and water and sanitation are among the greatest challenges for the country, and mention the municipal Strategic Sustainable Development Plans as an example of local multi-stakeholder SDG platform. Egypt says that ensuring sustainable water resource management is a high priority for the Government, and its national strategic plan ‘Vision 2030’ is in line with SDGs. Guinea announces that its government will organize a national symposium on Sustainable Development and Fragility in June 2018, and plans to produce a VNR report annually.

Niger’s messages indicate that: the country’s VNR focuses on the six SDGs under review at the HLPF, namely: SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 12 (responsible Consumption and Production), 15 (life on land) and 17 (partnerships for the Goals). Niger also reports that: its National Strategy for Sustainable Development and Inclusive Growth and its Economic and Social Development Plan 2017-2021 are consistent with the SDGs; and 43 SDG targets and 66 indicators are considered as a priority for the country.

Sudan says its VNR was supported by recommendations resulting from the National Dialogue Conference that took place in 2015-2016, its debt burden is unsustainable (SDG target 17.4), and the “continuing reluctance” to admit Sudan to the group of Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) is “unjustifiable.” Togo notes that access to electricity increased from 22.5% in 2008 to 35.6% in 2016, and rural electrification went from 3% in 2008 to 6.3% in 2016. It identifies securing land, decentralization, the digitalization of the economy, national statistics, and the financing of its economy as major SDG challenges.

Asia-Pacific Group

Messages from Lao People’s Democratic Republic say its VNR report focuses on all 17 SDGs, and it has adopted an additional Goal 18 on “Lives Safe from Unexploded Ordnance (UXO),” considering that it is “the most heavily bombed country” in terms of bombs dropped per capita. The messages also note that: Lao PDR was among the “earliest countries to localize the SDGs;” it has a National Steering Committee for SDGs implementation chaired by the Prime Minister that includes members from all concerned ministries and agencies; and nearly 60% of its Eighth National Social-Economic Development Plan indicators are linked to SDG indicators.

According to Lebanon’s messages, its National Committee to oversee the roll-out of the SDGs is chaired by the Prime Minister and includes representatives from all line ministries, civil society and private sector representative. The country also: established a parliamentary committee on the SDGs and a statistical task force; has organized three workshops related to SDGs; and held regional consultations with civil society, while temporarily hosting 1.5 million displaced from Syria. Qatar says it has aligned its National Development Strategy 2018-2022 with the SDGs, and reports that: 100% of its population benefits from safe drinking water services; solid waste generation fell from about 9.6 million tons in 2011 to 4.6 million tons in 2016; protected areas represent 29.8% of Qatar’s total area, which is “one of the highest rates in the world,” and the government intends to establish and operate a biodiversity database by the end of 2022.

Saudi Arabia’s messages note that its VNR highlights progress on the 17 SDGs, and key SDG priority areas include: continuing the alignment of state programs and strategies with global SDGs targets and indicators; strengthening the role of SDGs at the sub-national level; and enhancing monitoring and evaluation infrastructure on SDGs. Singapore reports that its Inter-Ministry Committee on SDGs has organized multi-stakeholder consultations to assess progress, and that it used international rankings and indices to get an independent perspective of its progress vis-à-vis other countries. Sri Lanka says increasing multi-stakeholder engagement for the 2030 Agenda has been a key objective of its VNR process, and mainstreaming the SDGs into institutional plans is its main strategy to achieve the Goals. It reports that: its National Budget 2018 focuses on a “Blue Green Economy;” 89.5% of its population has access to safe drinking water; and renewable sources account for 53% of total primary energy supply.

Eastern European Group (EEG)

All EEG countries that are volunteering to present their VNR at the 2018 HLPF have submitted their main messages. Albania reports that its parliament has unanimously approved a resolution confirming Albania’s commitment to the 2030 Agenda, and the country has prepared an SDG baseline report which indicates that 83% of the SDG targets are directly tied to specific components of its National Strategy for Development and Integration 2016-2020. Armenia says it has established a National SDG Innovation Lab, in addition to other structures such as the ‘SDG Nationalization Inter-agency Task Force,’ and data for indicators have been developed by the National Statistical Service to assess SDG progress.

Hungary stresses the importance of building the SDGs and targets on the principles of guaranteeing human rights, solidarity and global partnership. It reports that 75% of the global SDG indicators are available in the country, and that all line ministries and other stakeholders, including the Hungarian Central Statistical Office, the Office of the Ombudsman for Future Generations, youth and the business sector, contributed to its VNR.

Main messages from Latvia state that its VNR sets the baseline for all 17 SDGs, based on a mapping of the 169 SDG targets against its policies and plans, and the Cabinet of Ministers will decide on Latvia’s medium-term goals, indicators and targets within available funding limits. Lithuania reports that its VNR has been prepared by a group of experts that involved representatives of various ministries, NGOs and municipalities. It identifies, among other priorities, social inclusion and the promotion of eco-innovation and investment in new technologies. Poland says its VNR, prepared by ministries and other stakeholders through a “participatory approach,” includes a diagnosis, priorities, and key actions on SDGs.

Romania reports that it is in the process of reviewing its National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS) based on the 2030 Agenda and its 17 SDGs. A process of localizing the SDGs started in 2016, and has fed into both this VNR and its review of the NSDS. In its main messages, Slovakia expresses its commitment to implement the 2030 Agenda by integrating it into “all its public policies” at all levels, and outlines six national priorities that integrate the 17 SDGs: 1) education (SDGs 4, 8 and 10); transformation towards an environmentally sustainable and knowledge-based economy in the context of demographic change (SDGs 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12); sustainability of settlements, regions and the countryside in the context of climate change (SDGs 6, 7, 11, 13 and 15); social inclusion (SDGs 1, 2 and 10); rule of law, democracy and security (SDGs 5 and 16); and good health (SDGs 3 and 10).

Bahamas’ main messages report that youth unemployment rose to 30% in 2015, and that the government in collaboration with civil society and other stakeholders has created a pilot initiative for a traditionally marginalized region known as the “Over the Hill Community,” that focuses on social and economic empowerment, rejuvenation, smart and green technology and programmes on youth and the elderly. The Dominican Republic says work is underway to identify objectives and policy mixes that will boost synergies and accelerate progress on the 2030 Agenda through reducing multidimensional poverty, more competitiveness and decent jobs, promoting sustainable production and consumption, making populations resilient to climate change and other risks, and achieving a strong and inclusive institutional framework at the State level.

Jamaica’s document notes that it has a national coordination mechanism for the 2030 Agenda, and there is a 91% alignment between both its Vision 2030 Jamaica and the SDGs, but policy coherence and building capacity on policy integration need to be improved. It adds that it has a roadmap for SDGs implementation and 66 indicators to monitor the goals, and the Statistical Institute of Jamaica leads the process to establish a coordinated national statistical system.

Among its institutional arrangements for SDG implementation, Mexico’s messages outline its SDG Specialized Technical Committee for the SDGs, which coordinates the generating and monitoring of data. The messages also indicate that Mexico can follow up on 169 of the 232 global SDG indicators, and that it conducted an analysis of the contribution of federal budget programs to the SDG targets in 2017. At the sub-regional level, it reports that: by May 2018, 28 out of 32 Mexican states had SDG monitoring mechanisms in place; the federal government has developed a guide to incorporate the 2030 Agenda approach into state and municipal development plans; but capacity of sub-national governments need to be strengthened.

Paraguay says it has been working since 2016 to advance the alignment of the National Expenditure Budget with its national development plan ‘Paraguay 2030’ and the SDGs, and has created the Inter-institutional Coordination Commission for the implementation, follow-up and monitoring of the SDGs, which is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Related to the SDGs to be reviewed in depth at the HLPF, Uruguay reports that 95.2% of its population has access to safe water, and it is one of the most electrified countries in Latin America. It also indicates that work related to raising awareness on the SDGs was initiated in 2017.

Western European and Others Group (WEOG)

Australia stresses the value of a “fair go,” calling for action on fairness, justice and equality of opportunity, and adding that the government has adopted an approach to the SDGs that gives policy responsibilities and priorities to the “relevant” agencies and levels of decision. Its 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper, it says, highlights Australia’s responsibility to contribute to global efforts to reduce poverty, alleviate suffering and promote sustainable development.

Canada notes its commitment to implementing the 2030 Agenda and the 17 SDGs at home and abroad. It reports that: federal departments and agencies have been tasked to further examine how their policies and programs are contributing to the SDGs and their targets; Canada’s 2018 Federal Budget allocated new funds to establish an SDG Unit to track Canada’s progress on the SDGs; the government will mainstream a gender-responsive perspective in the implementation of the SDGs; and it will launch a process to develop a national strategy on the 2030 Agenda through collaboration with all levels of government, Indigenous peoples, and other stakeholders.

Exiting a period of “prolonged economic crisis,” Greece says the country has endorsed eight national priorities for adapting the SDGs to national needs and circumstances, in line with the recent adoption of the National Growth Strategy, and it plans to implement a “whole-of-government” approach coordinated by an Inter-Ministerial Coordination Network, steered by the General Secretariat of the Government. It also plans to develop a National Implementation Plan for the SDGs in 2019, by engaging “all stakeholders at all stages,” and to involve actively the Hellenic Parliament in the overall SDG follow-up and review process.

Ireland says its VNR addresses the 17 SDGs at the national and global levels, it has mapped existing policies and programmes against each of the 169 SDG sub-targets, and a national stakeholder forum will have its inaugural meeting in June 2018. It notes that its SDG National Implementation Plan 2018-2020 is a framework for SDG implementation, and announces that the government will publish a new White Paper on International Development in the second half of 2018 to further strengthen the alignment of Ireland’s aid programme with the SDGs.

Malta says the Sustainable Development Act adopted by the government in 2012 mandates the government to mainstream sustainable development in its policies, and the government plans to launch ‘Vision 2050,’ as a framework for the mainstreaming of sustainable development across all levels of government. On institutional arrangements, Spain indicates that a High Level Group on Inter-Ministerial Coordination, chaired by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, reports directly to the President of the Government on progress related to the 2030 Agenda’s implementation.

UN Observer State

Palestine reports that its Council of Ministers issued a decree establishing a national team headed by the Prime Minister’s Office and “composed of all relevant partners” to head SDG monitoring and implementation. It says its National Policy Agenda 2017-2022 includes 75 of the SDG targets, and it has adopted a set of principles to ensure the active participation of non-governmental actors in SDG implementation. Palestine proposes a 18th SDG on “Ending the occupation, and the consolidation of the independent State of Palestine on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital,” and states that “the continuation” of Israel’s occupation, and its “systematic and widespread violations of international law” is the biggest impediment for Palestine to achieve the SDGs.”

The HLPF will take place from 9-18 July 2018, in New York, US, and will consider the theme, ‘Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies.’ VNRs will be presented during the Forum’s ministerial segment, from 16-18 July.

UN agencies are also working to stop the spread of HIV, globally, by calling for an end to discrimination against LGBTI people so they can better access healthcare and social services. The UN measures are helping to meet SDG target 3.3, which commits to ending epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, hepatitis, neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and other communicable diseases by 2030.

On 11 May, the World Health Organization (WHO) reduced the classification of the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to low-risk status. The UN agency continues to work with the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and World Food Programme (WFP) to ensure that healthcare and food supplies are on standby in case of an uptick in transmission. WHO identified a slightly higher risk of Ebola transmission to the nearby Republic of Congo and Central African Republic (CAR) than other neighboring countries. The UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mark Lowcock, approved US$2 million for fighting the outbreak. [UN Press Release on Ebola]

The UN announced that more than 100 people have died in an outbreak of lassa fever in Nigeria that began in December 2016. It is the country’s largest epidemic of the disease ever. WHO announced that the number of new cases fell in April and May, meaning that the outbreak is no longer a national health emergency. [UN Press Release on Lassa Fever]

On 17 May, the UN marked the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia (IDAHOT) with a message urging an end to discrimination against LGBTI people. In conjunction with the Day, UNAIDS noted that men who have sex with men and transgender women are among the communities most affected by HIV. However, UN agencies report that more than 40% of countries criminalize same-sex relationships, effectively blocking gay and lesbian people from accessing healthcare and social services. UN Women, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and UNAIDS are working with the Global Network of People Living with HIV to end HIV-related discrimination and epidemics of AIDS by 2030. [UN Press Release on IDAHOT]

On 4 June, UN General Assembly President Miroslav Lajcak convened an interactive civil society hearing in New York, US as part of the preparatory process for the high-level meeting on fighting tuberculosis, which takes place on 26 September 2018. Lajcak had previously advised Marie Chatardová, President of the UN Economic and Social Council of the UN (ECOSOC), that negotiations towards an outcome document from the high-level meeting would begin in early June.

But, increasingly, he's trying to lead the way on global sustainability issues, too.

That's because he believes he has a personal role to play in improving the planet, the ""Black Panther"" star told CNBC Make It.

It all started with a phone call from the United Nations in 2006. Whitaker had just wrapped filming ""The Last King of Scotland"" and was helping a friend volunteer with child soldiers in Uganda when the international peace organization got in touch to find out more.

""The UN saw what I was doing and asked if I would come in and talk about what was going on,"" said Whitaker.

The project had not been on the UN's radar, he said, nor on the agenda of local government. So, he decided he had to do more himself.

The actor set about extending his charity work, and, in 2012, set up the Whitaker Peace and Development Initiative, a non-governmental organization designed to help communities torn apart by violence in Africa and North America. In 2015, in recognition of his work, Whitaker was named as an advocate for the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) — 17 targets aimed at tackling global challenges such as poverty and climate change by 2030.

""When the UN Secretary-General appointed me as SDG advocate, it was very clear for me that this agenda was different from previous ones,"" Whitaker told audiences at Temasek Ecosperity 2018, a sustainability conference in Singapore in June.

""It did not presume that governments and international organizations are going to do everything and substitute themselves for people and communities.""","You're used to seeing Oscar-winning actor Forest Whitaker take the lead on the big screen.

The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (UNESCO-IOC) is the custodian agency for the indicator.

The GOA-ON, a collaborative international network of 475 members from 80 nations, is committed to increasing global ocean acidification observation capacity in support of SDG target 14.3, which calls to “minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels.” SDG target indicator 14.3.1 focuses on “average marine acidity measured at an agreed suite of representative sampling stations. It is within the Sustainable Development Goal on life below water (SDG 14).

In the 14.3.1 indicator methodology, experts provide detailed guidance to scientists and countries on how to carry out measurements in line with best practices established by the ocean acidification community. The methodology outlines how to collect information that is transparent, traceable and globally comparable. According to the IOC, improved observation and research on ocean acidification is critical for supporting scientific and governmental efforts towards climate adaptation and mitigation.

The GOA-ON Executive Council also discussed efforts to increase global ocean acidification observing capacity, in line with the Council’s UN Ocean Conference Voluntary Commitment. As part of its commitment, the GOA-ON is working to build capacity in regions that have limited observation and limited ocean science capacity. The Council and its Secretariat are organizing capacity building workshops on ocean acidification monitoring and experimentation best practices and providing sensor kits to allow scientists to collect reliable data and contribute to the global ocean acidification monitoring effort.

The GOA-ON Secretariat includes the IOC of UNESCO, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington, US and the Ocean Acidification International Coordination Centre (OA-ICCC) in Monaco.

102,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/unga-adopts-resolution-on-un-development-system-reform/,"Thu, 14 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNGA Adopts Resolution on UN Development System Reform,"31 May 2018: The UN General Assembly (UNGA) has adopted a resolution on the repositioning of the UN development system, in order to align it with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. By this decision, the functions of the Resident Coordinators (RCs) of the UN system in each country are separated from those of the resident representative of the UN Development Programme (UNDP). UNGA President Miroslav Lajcak said that, while the resolution is not seen by everyone as “the perfect document,” it represents a legitimate outcome of a multilateral process.

The consultation process on the resolution was co-facilitated by Sabri Boukadoum, Permanent Representative of Algeria, and Ib Petersen, Permanent Representative of Denmark, and agreed on 7 May 2018 via silence procedure. The UNGA held a plenary meeting on 31 May 2018 to adopt the final draft text titled, ‘Repositioning of the United Nations development system in the context of the quadrennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system’ (A/72/L.52).

The agreed text, inter alia: requests the UN Secretary-General, in consultation with the UN development system entities, to present an implementation plan for the inception of the reinvigorated Resident Coordinator (RC) system, including on the operationalization of its funding arrangements, to the UNGA before the end of the 72nd session; and endorses the transformation of the Development Operations Coordination Office (DOCO) to assume managerial and oversight functions of the RC system under the leadership of an Assistant Secretary-General and under the ownership of the members of the ‘UN Sustainable Development Group,’ as a stand-alone coordination office within the Secretariat, reporting to the Chair of the Group (the Deputy-Secretary-General).

The funding arrangements for the new RC system are set out in a “hybrid solution” negotiated through the intergovernmental consultation process. UN Member States would provide the RC system with up to US$255 million annually, beginning in January 2019, through three sources: a 1% coordination levy on strictly earmarked, third-party, non-core contributions to UN development-related activities, to be paid at source; doubling the current UN Development Group (UNDG) cost-sharing arrangement among UN development system entities; and voluntary, predictable, multi-year contributions to a dedicated Trust Fund to support the inception period.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addressed the Assembly following the adoption of the text. He announced that he will move immediately to put in place a transition team, under the leadership of the Deputy Secretary-General, to implement Member States’ decisions. He noted that the reforms will enable the UN’s teams on the ground to better tailor their presence, skill sets and overall response to Member States’ priorities. In particular, the UN Development Assistance Frameworks (UNDAFs) will better reflect country priorities and country needs, and the RCs will be impartial and empowered, with “development as their DNA.”

The Secretary-General emphasized that his preference would have been to fund the RC system through the regular UN budget, in order to ensure predictability, sustainability and ownership from all Member States. However, he noted, the hybrid funding solution put forward by the co-facilitators “is the best possible alternative.” He appealed to Member States for their immediate support so that the reforms starts to be implemented on 1 January 2019. Guterres added that the resolution represents the foundations to place sustainable development at the heart of the UN, and to advance the SDGs with poverty as the first goal.

A representative of the UN Secretariat explained that, in order to implement the provisions of the resolution, requirements amounting to approximately US$255 million would be needed on an annual basis, with the major portion of the requirements necessitating extrabudgetary resources. She expressed hope that front-loaded voluntary contributions will be received in 2018 to expedite the inception of the reinvigorated RC system as of 1 January 2019. She further added that the UN Secretariat’s share of the UN Development Group (UNDG) cost-sharing arrangement pertaining to 2019 will be US$13-US$16 million.

In the ensuing discussion, India said the modalities for funding the proposals in the adopted text are “significantly different” than those contained in the Secretary-General’s initial funding proposals, ignoring the views and consensus of a large part of the UN membership on the need for predictable and sufficient resources for the proposed reforms. He added that the availability of resources remains unclear, and the proposed cost sharing for the RC system increases uncertainty. The US expressed the expectation that the reforms will reduce bureaucracy, improve performance, and increase flexibility for agencies to quickly respond to challenges.

The Group of 77 and China (G-77/China), supported by Ethiopia for the African Group, stressed that the resolution “explicitly states” that the UNDAF should be prepared and finalized in full consultation and agreement with national governments, through an open and inclusive dialogue between the host government and the UN development system, and in accordance with national development policies, tailored to priorities and the country needs. He cautioned that if the resolution is poorly implemented, the Group’s member states will bear the brunt of the costs, and this poses particular risks for the smallest and most vulnerable countries.

Bangladesh for the least developed countries (LDCs) said the LDCs prefer no reductions in the country presence of the UN development system. The proposal of 50% common premises by 2021 should not incur any additional financial burden for LDCs, he added. He requested the UN Secretariat to ensure that the annual report on system-wide support to the UN development system provides disaggregated data and information on LDCs in every chapter, and has a separate section on LDCs highlighting the progress and challenges in these countries.

The EU noted that the agencies of the UN development system will be “in the driver’s seat.” Canada, also for Australia and New Zealand (CANZ), said the RC function is moving from being dependent on the infrastructure of a US$5 billion organization to that of an office that currently has a staff of 30. In this context, careful handling and maintenance of relationships is paramount, particularly during the transition period. CANZ added that the upcoming funding dialogue should be seized as an opportunity to explore how different types of partnerships can support the work of the UN development system and ensure an expanded funding base that moves beyond a small group of traditional donors.

Maldives for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) called for the reform to address multi-country offices (MCOs), and highlighted the need for dependable funding for small island states to implement it. CANZ welcomed the MCOs review.

Lajcak said the actions to be undertaken in the reforms to the UN development system cannot be considered in a vacuum, but the momentum needs to be brought forward into: the ECOSOC review and alignment process; the discussions on UN management reform and the UN’s peace and security pillar; as well as in Member States’ daily work.

The “repositioning” process began with an ECOSOC dialogue series in 2014-2015 on positioning the UN development system for a post-2015 era, followed by the UNGA’s adoption, in December 2016, of the Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review (QCPR) 2017-2020. The UN Secretary-General then delivered two mandated reports outlining proposals for reforms to the UN development system, in June and December 2017. These proposals were discussed informally by Member States in a series of briefings led by Marc Pecsteen (Belgium), ECOSOC Vice-President, in January and February 2018. The ECOSOC Secretariat also published eight “explanatory notes” addressing questions raised by Member States during the briefings.

The first official discussion on the reform proposals took place during ECOSOC’s Operational Activities for Development Segment (OAS), in February and March 2018. Petersen and Boukadoum then guided Member States in a six-week consultation process to agree on the resolution.

The 2018 UNLEASH SDG Innovation Lab brought together 1,000 youth from 108 countries for an 8-day intense programme designed to accelerate innovative solutions to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Singapore is the second nation to host UNLEASH. The first event took place in 2017 in Denmark.

I was fortunate to contribute to UNLEASH 2018 in Singapore as one of the 18 innovation facilitators for SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. In total, we were 135 facilitators from all over the world working with 1,000 talents in 8 tracks linking into the SDGs.

In my track, we had 120 talents who generated 24 viable innovations for a sustainable future over the course of 5 days. Solutions ranged from e-waste management to circular product models and smart ways to influence sustainable consumer behavior.

Outside of UNLEASH, I work for Deloitte and I specialize in driving projects with either businesses or organisations (or both) with the ambition to advance solutions to the SDGs. As the lead innovation partner of UNLEASH, Deloitte sent a global team of 50 innovation facilitators to support and mentor the UNLEASH talents through the innovation process.

By guiding participants through the innovation process of problem framing (challenging to most), ideation, prototyping and testing, we sought to accelerate ideas solving some of the most complex development problems of our time. The international mix of people was designed to bring together great diversity of thought and expertise from all over the world and we were all encouraged to bring personal insights and ideas that could inspire others and be applied in new contexts.

Strong Jargon – and Strong Theory of Change

Admittedly, there is a lot of jargon in UNLEASH, e.g. a ‘global innovation lab’ for ‘innovative, and scalable solutions to the SDGs’ that brings together 1,000 ‘young global talents’ to ‘accelerate disruptive ideas by engaging top talents in problem-solving and co-creation’ etc.

I understand why some people might roll their eyes to this. Everything right now, it seems, is about being innovative and disrupting existing systems and sectors. Entrepreneurs and creative innovators are celebrated like the heroes of our time. I understand why some people may be skeptical about these terms as well as about UNLEASH.

However, what really resonated with me about UNLEASH was not the jargon, nor the competitive element of pitching and focus on fast innovations. What excited me the most was the solid theory of change behind the innovation process and the event itself.

What UNLEASH really did was not simply to bring some 200 solutions to the SDGs in a week, as impressive as that may sound. Innovation and new ideas are essential, but to me these innovative solutions were not the key output of UNLEASH. The key long-term output was and is that UNLEASH works to build the next generation of sustainable innovators, change makers and leaders.

A Positive Movement

UNLEASH represents a massive learning journey for most participants, facilitators and experts involved. By working together with others in what is probably the most diverse context and dynamic talent hub that most of us will ever encounter, by singing, sleeping and eating together, and by learning and following a well-tested innovation process, UNLEASH is an experiential education tool seeking to motivate, create hope and develop skills with talents, facilitators and experts.

In this way, UNLEASH engages and unites youth beyond solutions and towards a common goal to create change together. The key idea behind the theory of change is that every participant in UNLEASH brings back their learnings, reflections and innovation skills and becomes a positive change maker in their local community. This foundation enables talents to develop and accelerate new ideas and solutions, if not immediately after UNLEASH, then in the years to come together with others in their community.

I believe that creating hope and motivation is instrumental for achieving the SDGs. It is critical not only because the SDGs were conceived out of the hope that in cross-sector partnership we can create better solutions to the challenges described by the SDGs, but also because hope and optimism are prerequisites for creating positive action. Pessimism simply kills the urge to do anything (even small actions) about the complex challenges we face as humanity. The 1,000 talents who are part of UNLEASH each year as we move towards 2030 are part of a movement of positivism aiming to create change. Therefore, above all, UNLEASH to me is a hopeful and promising activity that helps to facilitate our efforts to reach the SDGs by 2030.

She is the fourth woman to be elected as UNGA President since the Assembly’s began in 1946.



Per the principle of geographical rotation, the president of UNGA 73 was to be elected from the Latin American and Caribbean Group (GRULAC). Mary Elizabeth Flores Flake, Permanent Representative of Honduras, was the only other candidate for the presidency. The election followed informal interactive dialogues with the candidates in May 2018. The two candidates had issued vision statements in February 2018, in line with a UNGA resolution adopted in 2017 on increasing the transparency and inclusivity of the election process (A/RES/71/323).

Elected by 128 votes out of 192 ballots cast, Espinosa Garcés took the floor to address the Assembly. She said strengthening multilateralism is not an option but an obligation. She also dedicated the election to all women in the world who participate in politics and face media and other attacks, and paid tribute to women and girls who are victims of violence and to girls and adolescents that demand access to quality education.

Espinosa Garcés reiterated her commitment to offer an “open door” presidency, and indicated that she will promote all actions within her reach so the UNGA can play an “essential role” in fulfilling the SDGs. She noted that UN bodies must run “like clockwork” to move the UN towards the objectives of its Charter, adding that she will promote reforms and processes necessary for the strengthening of the organization. She also remarked that, as the UN needs to respond to the main challenges of the world, it should be connected to its main beneficiaries, the citizens of the world.

António Guterres, UN Secretary-General, outlined Espinosa Garcés’ previous experience as Ecuador’s minister of foreign affairs, as well as its minister of national defense, coordinating minister for cultural and natural heritage, and permanent representative to the UN in both Geneva and New York. He added that she was Ecuador’s first woman to serve as permanent representative to the UN in New York. He welcomed the choice of a woman for the position of UNGA president, saying more than a decade has passed since a woman held the presidency.

Congratulating Espinosa Garcés on her appointment, Miroslav Lajcak, President of the 72nd UNGA, remarked that electing only four women in more than 70 years is not a result to be proud of, and thanked delegates for making this election “the most transparent and inclusive yet.”

Among the UN regional groups that took the floor, Mauritius for the African Group echoed Espinosa Garcés in saying that the election of the UNGA president is not a competition but rather a celebration of multilateralism. He noted that although all agree that “much remains to be done” to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development (FFD), and the Paris Agreement on climate change, this is not likely to happen unless additional resources are mobilized. He thanked Lacjak for the initiatives and events he organized, including the launch of the ‘International Decade for Action: Water for Sustainable Development 2018-2028,’ which he said gave an impetus for SDG implementation by increasing awareness of the Goals.

Venezuela for GRULAC welcomed the election of Espinosa Garcés as the first woman from the region to serve as UNGA president, and expressed optimism that her leadership will help strengthen the UNGA’s role in peace and stability, sustainable development, international cooperation and human rights.

P. Nadda on Monday said India will achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target in maternal mortality by 2022 while the government's Ayushman Bharat, popularly known as Modicare, is aimed at changing the face of the country.

""India has met the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target for maternal mortality ratio (MMR) of 139 per lakh (100,000) live births by achieving 130 by 2015. At this rate, we shall achieve SDG target of 70 by 2022, ahead of target timeline of 2030,"" Nadda said as he highlighted the achievements of his ministry in the last four years.

He said annual maternal deaths have fallen from 44,000 in 2012 to 32,000 in 2015, a reduction of 12,000, which is saving of 30 mothers per day. The country reduced its MMR by 37 points from 167 in 2011-2013 to 130 in 2014-16 due to strategic changes including focus on life cycle approach and multi-sectoral approach, he said.

Nadda said India's vision of universal health coverage is based on assured range of comprehensive primary care, linked to robust secondary and tertiary care being translated through Ayushman Bharat.

""Modicare is the world's largest healthcare programme. Its objective is not political. It is for changing the face of the country. Obamacare may be something else but Modicare is about the need to change the face of the country. We will solve all problems that will come our way,"" he said.

Ayushman Bharat programme has two components -- the PMRSSM promising medical cover of Rs 5 lakh per family per year for 10 crore poor and vulnerable families, which is about 50 crore individuals or 40 per cent of the country's population. The second component, Prime Minister Health and Wellness Centres (PMHWC), aims to convert 1.5 lakh primary health centres and sub-centres to Health and Wellness Centres.

""This will change the healthcare landscape in the country. We are moving as per the set timelines for implementing Ayushman Bharat. We shall be signing MoUs with 14 states on June 14. Under PMHWC, approval for transformation has been given to 19,000 this year.

""By second-third week of July, we will be ready with the IT platform. Identification of beneficiaries in rural areas is done 80 per cent. We want to provide a glitch-free system from the start. So, once the IT testing is done, the Prime Minister will launch the programme,"" he said.

Nadda further said that the government has given total flexibility to the states to choose their health system and how it suits them the best and further government is ready to provide the financial support also.

""Under free Drugs and Diagnostics Service Initiative medicine worth Rs 14,000 crore have been disbursed in last two and a half years. Under Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis program, more than 2.38 lakh patients have been benefited. Amrit outlets provide drugs for cancer and cardiovascular diseases at 60-90 per cent discount. These outlets have helped patients save Rs 346.59 crore so far,"" he said.

Further, the minister said work has begun on the new AIIMS at Mangalagiri (Andhra Pradesh), Nagpur, Kalyani (West Bengal), Gorakhpur (Uttar Pradesh), Bathinda (Punjab), Guwahati and Bilaspur (Himachal Pradesh).

107,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-won-t-you-be-my-neighbor,"Fri, 08 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Won’t You Be My Neighbor?’,"New film focuses on Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood but looks beyond the show to its role in Rogers’ life and the larger world.

Morgan Neville’s documentary Won’t You Be My Neighbor? briefly debunks a silly, subversive urban legend about the seemingly preternaturally gentle host of Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood: a lurid fantasy about his imaginary military past and the many people he supposedly killed in Vietnam; the tattoos allegedly hidden by that cardigan sweater, etc.

There’s no mention of another fanciful story that I believed, and wanted to believe, when I first encountered it possibly 15 to 25 years ago. Perhaps you’ve heard this one, too: The story goes that Mr. Rogers’ car was stolen from the Pittsburgh WQED parking lot where he worked — but a day or two later, it showed up again with a note from the thieves reading, “Sorry, we didn’t know it was yours.”

The first story offers confirmation of our more cynical tendencies; the second, of our more generous impulses. The nasty discovery that reality is so often more complicated, darker and less reassuring than surface appearances suggest is repeated so often that we may be tempted, some of us, to suspect that goodness, sincerity and gentleness can never be trusted.

Yet we also want to believe, some of us, that even car thieves are human beings who were children once, and that however far in life they may have strayed from the lessons of respect and honesty Mr. Rogers tried to teach them long ago, somewhere deep down they still know those lessons are true. Perhaps, even if they can live with that contradiction in their day-to-day crimes, the cognitive dissonance of stealing from Mr. Rogers might be a bridge too far for them.

The first story is ludicrously false. The second probably isn’t true — but it could be true, in principle.

“Love is at the root of everything,” says Fred McFeely Rogers in an archival clip in Won’t You Be My Neighbor? “All learning, all relationships.”

Then, just as you’re thinking (if you’re like me) about all kinds of relationships that are rooted in anything but love, and wondering how anyone can say anything so saccharine-sounding, he adds a clarifying zinger: “Love or the lack of it.”

There, in a way, is the substance of Rogers’ entire career and especially of his iconic television show, which debuted a half-century ago in 1968. For decades, he simply tried to supply the love that might be lacking in a child’s world — at home, at school, in their neighborhoods, and especially in the rest of their television viewing.

That’s a lot of lack. As gentle as Rogers and his show were, Neville (20 Feet from Stardom) reminds us that they weren’t too Pollyanna to tackle tough subjects like divorce, anger, death, assassination and war, all in ways children could understand.

Utilizing a straightforward blend of archival footage, interviews with Rogers’ family and colleagues, and metaphorical animated segments depicting Rogers as his puppet alter ego, Daniel Stripéd Tiger, the film focuses on Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood but looks beyond the show to its role in Rogers’ life and the larger world.

Neville touches on Rogers’ early Presbyterian seminary training and studies in child psychology as well as his discovery of television and the early television work in which he created puppets and characters and wrote music that would later go into Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood.

The film also explores the cultural context and impact of Rogers’ work, from his responses to Vietnam and the assassination of Robert Kennedy to backlash from critics decrying his focus on children’s feelings and his affirmation of their specialness and parodies like Eddie Murphy’s Mister Robinson’s Neighborhood sketches on Saturday Night Live.

Disturbing footage of a segregationist dumping bleach into a recently desegregated swimming pool with black and white children swimming together provides context for a segment from the show in which Mr. Rogers and the singing policeman Officer Clemmons — played by African-American performer François Clemmons — sit together in front of a wading pool soaking their bare feet together singing There Are Many Ways to Say I Love You.

The segment ends with Rogers pointedly drying Officer Clemmons’ feet with a towel in overt imitation of Christ washing and drying the disciples’ feet in John’s Last Supper account, a symbol of service that Christ exhorted his followers to do for one another.

Clemmons talks about his misgivings as an African-American about playing a police officer, but admits Rogers’ vision won him over. He also talks about Rogers’ concerns about Clemmons’ homosexuality and the danger to the show’s funding if Clemmons were outed (and debunks any notion that Rogers himself was gay).

His last memory of Rogers, from their last show together, is a warm one: He recalls Rogers looking at him while uttering his signature line about making “every day a special day by just your being you.” Asked if he were talking to Clemmons, Rogers replied, “Yes, I have been talking to you for years. But you heard me today.”

Rogers’ Christian faith, Won’t You Be My Neighbor? acknowledges, was implicit in his whole approach; his show wasn’t preachy, but he was always preaching.

Rogers’ show was countercultural in style as well as substance. Appalled by the abrasive tone and hyper pacing of much television fare, Rogers went as slow, quiet and reassuring as possible, which is simply who he was, but also what he believed children needed.

He believed that the images we take in become who we are, and he offered children the good stuff. He never worried about holding their attention, and he never had to. Every child watching felt that he was speaking to him or her, because he was. To use a term much derided nowadays, Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood offered a safe space for children in a world they were quickly learning could be scary and cruel.

Rogers believed that television had the power to unite a nation into a single neighborhood, and in that quest he was a steady but lonely voice in the wilderness. As popular as he was and as profound an effect as he had in many lives, he couldn’t outweigh the combined influence of most pop culture that wasn’t him.

For a few formative years of our lives, Mr. Rogers showed us the way. Why don’t we walk that way? Because of all the voices dominating the discussion ever since.

Yet, like those (probably) mythical car thieves, we know deep down that he was right. An unlikely TV star in his day, Mr. Rogers he has become an even unlikelier Internet icon of goodness and gentleness. Every time disaster or terrorism strike, people share memes of his famous quote about looking for the helpers. Paradoxically, the harsher and more polemical our public discourse has become, the more this beacon of generosity and empathy has been celebrated by nearly everyone.

Ultimately, this is not because of the style or substance of Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood, but something unquantifiable and unreproducible: Rogers’ manifest goodness. His hopes for a more united country may have been dashed, but in one respect he undoubtedly succeeded: He wanted to make goodness attractive, and he did.

Is Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood hagiographical? Is it necessarily a bad thing if it is? Hagiography is usually a bad thing in biography because most of us aren’t saints. (One remarkably hagiographic detail: Each morning, after swimming laps — there’s underwater footage of Rogers’ slight frame in the pool — he stepped on the scale, and, according to the man himself, every day he weighed in at 143 pounds: a number that, to him, signified the 1-4-3 letters of the words “I love you.”)

Rogers wasn’t a perfect man, even if one of his sons recalls that it could be difficult “having a second Christ for a father.” But when his widow, Joanne, recalls reassuring him toward the end of his life, as he contemplated the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats in Matthew 25 and wondered out loud if he were one of the sheep, that if anyone qualified as a sheep, he did, it’s hard to imagine any reasonable person disagreeing.

We can’t live in Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood, and our world will never greatly resemble it. But what’s stopping us, any of us, from trying to bring to our interactions with others a little more of what we admire in Mr. Rogers? Is the divisiveness and cruelty of our world a reason not to treat each other with kindness and love, or is it more important to do so?

Like Jesus, like Mr. Rogers, Won’t You Be My Neighbor? challenges each of us to try to be better neighbors.

Would you be mine?

Reasonably light, comfortable with well-placed cutout, good looking and well made Cons: The minimal padding might feel a bit too firm for some

The cutout isn't overly large compared to my previous saddle, the Selle Italia Diva Gel Flow (which Lara tested in 2015), but it is well positioned and I found it does a great job of relieving pressure – absolutely crucial to a saddle's comfort. The Allure tips the scales at a respectable 268g (claimed 260g), just a shade more than the Diva.

SDG says this female-specific saddle is designed for all riding disciplines, and I found it performs well both on and off road. It is relatively narrow, at 143mm, and is only available in this one width; this, combined with the cutaway side profile, allows unrestricted leg movement, aiding pedalling efficiency. I actually prefer this narrowness to the 152mm-wide Diva.

It is quite long too, at 265mm, with a slim down-curved nose. This gives you plenty of room to shift your weight forward for climbing, while the seat's flat shape makes it easy to move around.

Construction

The low-profile Allure is made from high-quality materials and is well put together. It sports a lightweight nylon fibre base and LPU foam padding – although some might find the padding a bit too minimal. Compared to the more generously upholstered Diva Gel Flow, it has a very firm feel and it did take me a few rides for my behind to adapt to it. The Allure's wings are not as flexible as the Diva's either, although this didn't pose any problem, particularly because of its narrower width. Having spent several long days in the saddle, I can vouch for its comfort.

The Allure comes in two models: with titanium-alloy rails, tested here, or chromoly rails. The Ti-alloy version, as well as saving weight, is a little more forgiving because the titanium offers slightly more flex than chromoly, and helps absorb road vibrations. You pay for the privilege, though, as the chromoly model retails around £20 less, but then it weighs about 50g more.

Price-wise it compares well with others we've tested on road.cc. A lighter but similar sounding firm-rather-than-armchair option that Sarah got on well with is Fizik's Luce S-Alloy, at 250g and £86.99, and Tass liked the Specialized Ruby Expert, rrp £115 and weight 256g. But you can pay less: I really liked the £49.99 Fabric Scoop Gel saddle; no cutout but lots of comfort and not that much heavier at 273g.

> Buyer's Guide: 9 of the best women's saddles

Ultimately, I found the Allure very comfortable, and I'm impressed by its durability – the synthetic cover hasn't scuffed in a few months of riding, and it's easy to wipe clean. I also like that it doesn't look 'girly' and it comes in a veritable rainbow of colours so you can coordinate it with your bike.

Verdict

A firmer feel than some, but ultimately comfortable for long day rides and for off-road use too

Representatives from several agencies on the table as well as key community partners were in attendance.

“We’re very happy with what was accomplished in the past year,” says Inspector Shawna Spowart at the Cornwall Community Police Service. “The Situation Table provides wrap-around support for those who are experiencing extremely stressful and risky periods in their lives.”

From its launch in May 2017 until early May 2018, the work accomplished by the Situation Table has helped 30 local individuals and 11 families.

The CSDG Situation Table is composed of 26 frontline, acute care and social service agencies that work collaboratively to help ensure the safety of individuals, families and groups of people who are at high risk of suffering from violent acts.

When a case is referred to the Situation Table, the various partners in the project, which include school boards, the police, the Children’s Aid Society, the Cornwall Community Hospital and the Canadian Mental Health Association, meet and work together to reduce the imminent risk of harm, usually within 24 to 48 hours. The Situation Table remains involved in the case until the level of risk has been reduced.

“An early collaborative intervention from the Situation Table has proven it helps prevent crimes and improve the safety and well-being of the community and local residents,” explains Elyse Lauzon-Alguire, Situation Table Chair and Interim Coordinator. “Rapid mobilization Tables such as the CSDG Situation Table make police services part of a stronger safety net, rather than being the entire net themselves.”

Most situations that come to the Table concern a single individual, a family, or a group of people that are affected by multiple risk factors, including mental health issues, domestic conflict, addictions and homelessness. The CSDG Situation Table works to mitigate the risks rather than wait for a harmful incident that would require an emergency response, all while protecting the privacy of the people being assisted.

Many speakers called for justice, dignity and a human rights-based approach to affordable housing in cities. Leilani Farha, UN Special Rapporteur on Adequate Housing, argued that housing (SDG target 11.1) is the most significant issue facing cities today, and highlighted the injustice of development that destroys urban neighborhoods and displaces residents.

Marc Pecsteen, Permanent Representative of Belgium and Vice-President of the Economic and Social Council of the UN (ECOSOC), chaired the session reviewing SDG 11. Discussions drew on the joint report by UN-Habitat and partner agencies, released on 9 July, which outlined global progress and challenges for sustainable cities. The report titled, ‘SDG 11 Synthesis Report: Tracking Progress Towards Inclusive, Safe, Resilient and Sustainable Cities and Human Settlements,’ presents UN agencies’ joint position.

Benjamin Rae, Statistics Division, UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), stressed that, if States continue to rely on the private sector for housing, then they are obliged to ensure markets provide affordable housing.

Rohit Aggarwala, Columbia University, noted there is no “one size fits all” formula for achieving the various SDG 11 targets, and called for thoughtful and comprehensive management of urban issues and appropriate distribution of powers.

Penny Abeywardena, Commissioner, Mayor’s Office for International Affairs, New York City, highlighted that New York is the first city in the world to submit a voluntary local review to the UN, and has declared 11 July to be Global Goals Day in honor of the SDGs. She highlighted commonalities between the SDGs and the OneNYC campaign, including: principles of growth, equity, sustainability and resilience; consultative processes with local agencies, residents and businesses; commitment to leave no one behind; and measurement of progress. Noting that “progress is in fact possible,” she highlighted the city has achieved cleaner air and water, record wage growth, and tripled the number of children accessing quality early childhood education.

Jean Todt, UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Road Safety, observed that urbanization is strongly correlated with the use of motor vehicles. He highlighted the economic and social cost of road accidents, and argued that road safety (SDG target 11.2) should be considered part and parcel of sustainable mobility and transport, citing a combination of necessary policy elements, including affordable public transport and infrastructure for motorized and non-motorized transport.

Maimunah Mohd Sharif, Executive Director, UN-Habitat, noted that, while the percentage of slums, informal settlements and inadequate housing has decreased, their absolute numbers nevertheless has increased. She defined three key challenges for implementing SDG 11: housing affordability (SDG target 11.1), accessibility and adequacy of housing; management of urban sprawl (SDG target 11.3 on sustainable human settlement planning); and access to public spaces (SDG target 11.7). She added that monitoring progress will depend on having common definitions and units of analysis, and drew attention to UN-Habitat’s National Sample of Cities as a model for aggregating data from different cities within a country so as to discern dominant patterns.

Meera AlShaikh, Project Manager, Smart Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), highlighted the high ecological footprint of urban areas and presented Dubai’s strategies for providing solar energy, increased use of recycled water, and various technologies including blockchain, AI and ICT services to enable Dubai’s transformation as a smart city.

Other speakers emphasized the need for finding new approaches to citizen participation, participatory governance by the urban poor, cities’ connections with rural ecosystems, post-disaster management to “build back better,” and the need to stop gender-based violence.

Many UN Member States, major groups, UN agencies and international organizations made interventions from the floor, highlighting country and programme experiences. Delegates linked improvements in urban spaces to poverty alleviation, and some countries, including Brazil and Sierra Leone, stressed the right to housing as an integral part of sustainable cities. They noted the particular needs of women, persons with disabilities, youth, and elderly persons, and drew attention to conflict as a driver for migrants and refugees moving to cities. Several delegates gave examples of “smart city” approaches that not only promote the use of digital technologies but also increase social inclusion, environmental sustainability and quality of life for urban residents.

Many also cited air quality as an important element of sustainable cities, noting the benefits of electric vehicles for reducing air pollution. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) noted that only 12% of cities meet World Health Organization (WHO) air quality standards.

Concluding the session, Abeywardena highlighted that “this is not just about SDG 11,” but about the roles that cities will play in achieving all the SDGs.

Official background notes are also available for each of the SDGs under review, and may be accessed by clicking the links in the headings below. Additional inputs submitted by intergovernmental forums, Major Groups and other stakeholders are available here.

SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation

The first in-depth review took place on 9 July 2018, on SDG 6, calling for greater efficiency of water use.

A UN-Water Synthesis Report on Water and Sanitation finds that the world is not on track to meet SDG 6. Analyzing global progress towards each target, the report also highlights ways of accelerating progress through integrated water resources management, eliminating inequalities and other means of implementation (MoI). A summary write-up of the report is on the SDG Knowledge Hub here. A guest article also reviews the report, and the role of citizen science in monitoring SDG indicator 6.3.2. A side event on transboundary water cooperation highlighted progress towards 6.5.2, but noted challenges associated with lack of data, particularly around shared aquifers.

A report titled, ‘Global Review of National Accountability Mechanisms for SDG 6,’ commissioned by End Water Poverty & Partners, finds weak accountability mechanisms for water and sanitation, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Based on reviews of 25 countries, the report notes, among other lessons, that few of the countries studied use third party validation, and that civil society involvement should be increased. A write-up of the report and HLPF launch event is available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

A second SDG Knowledge Hub guest article on SDG 6 by Emily Walsh, Mesothelioma Cancer Alliance, highlights the issue of asbestos in US drinking water, outlining how the SDGs can help align efforts.

SDG 7 – Affordable and Clean Energy

The in-depth review of SDG 7 took place on 10 July 2018, anticipating the end of coal.

The Global Fuel Economy Initiative (GFEI) launched a report, titled ‘Delivering SDG 7.’ The report identifies current trends on energy use in transportation, noting how it is improving energy efficiency on a country-by-country basis. Working in over 70 countries, GFEI aims to accelerate the transition to zero emissions vehicles and reduce emissions from the freight industry. The report also outlines where references to fuel economy are found in countries’ Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) submitted to the HLPF. A press release on the report is also available.

Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) released a report titled, ‘New Energy Outlook 2018.’ Based on economic analysis, the report projects trends in renewable energy and fossil fuel costs, estimating that more than 50% of energy demands will be satisfied by wind and solar by 2050. A summary write-up is available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities

The in-depth review of SDG 11 took place on 11 July 2018, emphasizing the role of cities.

The UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) launched a synthesis report, intended to complement the Secretary-General’s overarching progress report on SDG implementation. Titled, ‘Tracking Progress Towards Inclusive, Safe, Resilience and Sustainable Cities and Human Settlements,’ the report’s chapters outline the importance of the urban dimension to the 2030 Agenda; monitoring efforts and methodologies; and the global baseline status of the targets and indicators under SDG 11. A press release is also available, as is a write-up on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

The Partnership on Sustainable Low Carbon Transport (SLoCaT) released an analysis of countries’ 2018 VNRs to highlight the role of the transport sector in achieving the SDGs. The preliminary results show that, despite improving since 2016, there remain gaps on the inclusion of transportation and its contribution to sustainable development, despite the topic being mentioned in 95% of VNRs submitted. The report’s landing page notes that “80% of VNRs refer to the role of sustainable transport in achieving the SDGs but only 12 out of 40 VNRs (30%) offer considerable information with specific cases and policy examples on sustainable transport.” A summary write-up is also available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production

The in-depth review of SDG 12 took place on 12 July 2018, calling for circular economies and sustainable lifestyles.

UN Environment has launched a One Planet Strategy. Titled, ‘One Plan for One Planet 5 Year Strategy 2018-2022,’ the document outlines four common operation objectives, strategic principles and approaches across the One Planet network, which was formed to implement the 10 Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production (10YFP) for which UN Environment serves as Secretariat. It also features an overarching logic model, noting the programme’s outputs, outcomes and impacts.

The Plan’s overarching objectives are to: 1) be an effective implementation mechanism of SDG 12; 2) catalyze ambitious action by providing tools and solutions that support the shift to sustainable consumption and production (SCP); 3) lead the cohesive implementation of SCP; and 4) demonstrate the benefits and impacts of SCP and its role in addressing key environmental and social challenges. An overview of side events relating to SCP and SDG12, co-convened by UN Environment and the One Planet network, is available here.

SDG 15 – Life on Land

The in-depth review of SDG 15 took place on 13 July 2018, finding mixed progress.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) released its ‘2018 State of the World’s Forests’ report, which analyzes progress towards sustainable forest management for sub-indicators of SDG 15. The report finds that people who are furthest left behind often live in or near forests. FAO also recognized forests’ role in providing clean water (SDG 6), a source for energy (SDG 7), climate mitigation and adaptation measures (SDG 13), and recreational activities, among other SDGs. A summary write-up is available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

The Global Assessment Report was launched by the International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO) at an HLPF side event. Titled, ‘Forest and Water on a Changing Planet: Vulnerability, Adaptation and Governance Opportunities,’ the report articulates the linkages between water management, forests and climate, and answers questions including: do forests matter? Who is responsible and what should be done? How can progress be made and measured? International governance systems and the SDGs, a press release notes, can optimize climate-forest-water relations by creating norms. A summary write-up is available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

An SDG Knowledge Hub guest article by Cristiana Pașca Palmer, Convention on Biological Diversity, notes that although there have been increasing commitments to implementing SDG 15, the data on available indicators show decline. She offers a ‘to do’ list for Goal 15. A guest article by experts from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) identifies solutions that can help achieve healthy forests and ecosystems.

SDG 17 – Partnerships for the Goals

The in-depth review of SDG 17 took place on 13 July 2018, warning against trade barriers and calling for the fulfillment of aid commitments.

Launched during the HLPF Partnership Exchange the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) and The Partnering Initiative (TPI) published a guidebook that seeks to amplify the benefits of partnerships. Titled, ‘Maximising the Impact of Partnerships for the SDGs,’ the guidebook outlines value added to both society and to individual partner organizations, describing how partnerships can be more than the sum of their parts. A summary write-up is available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

Released just prior to the HLPF, a paper by authors from the German NGO Forum on Environment and Development, Unfairtobacco, Global Policy Forum, Misereor (German Catholic Bishops’ Organisation for Development Cooperation), and Bread for the World examines businesses’ contributions to the SDGs. Titled, ‘Highjacking the SDGs? The Private Sector and the Sustainable Development Goals’ the paper notes the difficulties of measuring business engagement with the SDGs, but offers recommendations for policy-makers, businesses and civil society. It features case studies on the financial system—with a focus on bond markets—as well as the tobacco industry. The paper, business-SDG engagement, and findings on the bond market were discussed at an event held at German House on 13 July 2018.

The Congress showcased new and emerging technologies for processing and using bamboo fiber and composite materials, highlighting its potential as a renewable natural resource.

Congress speakers and participants emphasized ways that bamboo and rattan can contribute to the SDGs on: no poverty (SDG 1); affordable and clean energy (SDG 7); sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11); responsible consumption and production (SDG 12); climate action (SDG 13); life on land (SDG 15); and partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17): with reference to activities in Asia, Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean.

BARC 2018 took place from 25-27 June, on the theme of ‘Enhancing South-South Cooperation for Green Development through Bamboo and Rattan’s Contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals.’ The Congress, organized by the International Bamboo and Rattan Organization (INBAR) and China’s National Forestry and Grassland Administration (NGFA), welcomed approximately 1,200 participants, including 500 visitors from 68 other countries. A ministerial summit and three high-level dialogues took place, in addition to 80 parallel sessions.

On SDG 1, speakers drew attention to projects that have promoted women’s entrepreneurship and empowerment through developing and promoting bamboo and rattan-based products. Terry Sunderland, University of British Columbia (UBC), called for a holistic approach and cautioned that calls for increased cultivation of bamboo should take into account land tenure and the role of women in economic activities, to ensure that rural communities truly benefit.

On SDG 7, participants discussed ways to expand the manufacture and distribution of bamboo charcoal, which is already being undertaken in Ghana, Jamaica and several other countries, noting the possibilities for small businesses in making bamboo charcoal briquettes, and the health benefits of substituting smoke-free bamboo charcoal for traditional fuels.

On housing (SDG target 11.1), discussions focused on construction standards and the properties of bamboo-based building products, including their lightness, flexibility, and superior insulating properties, as well as their resistance to fires, land subsidence and seismic activity. Participants noted that bamboo has been successfully used to build emergency shelters, and that the development of new types of resin, which used in conjunction with bamboo-based products, creates non-carcinogenic alternatives to treated pine.

On SDG 13, speakers highlighted the high levels of carbon sequestration in bamboo, and discussed methodologies for calculating the extent of sequestration. They noted that bamboo also has benefits for reducing carbon emissions in terms of emissions that are avoided by substituting bamboo for conventional timber products.

Regarding SDG 15, many participants expressed enthusiasm for cultivating bamboo to restore degraded lands and promote disaster risk reduction (DRR). They noted the value of bamboo as a critical food source for the giant panda, adding that conservation efforts around this iconic species could serve as “a giant umbrella” for the conservation of other species.

Discussions also touched on bamboo and rattan-related activities that promote food security (SDG 2), gender equality through women’s economic empowerment (SDG 5), and innovation in industry (SDG 9), with participants highlighting the market potential of bamboo across a variety of applications, including hi-tech and niche products in healthcare, sporting goods, and bamboo-composite building materials.

The conference adopted in principle the Beijing Declaration, which affirms INBAR member States’ support for developing the global bamboo and rattan industry through assessment of stocks, market and technology research, innovation, and standard setting. The Declaration calls upon national governments and other relevant parties to implement several recommendations, including, inter alia: carrying out inventories and assessments; establishing value chains accessing local, regional, and international markets by way of appropriate standards setting and quality control; encouraging bamboo and rattan technology innovation and research, as well as exchange of know-how. The Declaration also calls for investment from bilateral and multilateral financing mechanisms to support bamboo and rattan programmes and initiatives.

INBAR announced outcomes of BARC 2018 at the end of the conference, including several project agreements and upcoming meetings. Delegates noted agreement to initiate or extend several projects with UN agencies, partners, and donors, including the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the Government of the Netherlands, the Gaborone Declaration for Sustainable Development, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO), and conservation agencies willing to collaborate on the Giant Panda National Park that is being established by the Government of China. Further, the China Green Carbon Foundation (CGCF) offered to offset the carbon emissions generated by the Congress within the next 10 years through a bamboo-planting project in Yunnan province, China, thus making the Congress a carbon-neutral event.

Also at the meeting’s close, J.C. Hutchinson, Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Agriculture and Fisheries, Jamaica, announced a Caribbean Bamboo Conference to take place from 27-29 November 2018. It will bring together policy makers from the English-speaking Caribbean with experts from INBAR member States to discuss challenges and opportunities for bamboo in the region.

The report provides “more exact confirmation” that healthy, productive forests are essential to sustainable agriculture.

SOFO 2018 analyzes the importance of forests and trees in conserving biodiversity (SDG 15), tackling climate change (SDG 13), improving urban habitats (SDG 11), providing safe drinking water (SDG 6), supporting food security (SDG 2), reducing inequalities (SDG 10) and ending poverty (SDG 1), among other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva explained that SOFO 2018 provides “greater evidence on how forests are critical to livelihoods of the world’s poorest,” including a better understanding of the trade-offs and “more exact confirmation” that healthy, productive forests are essential to sustainable agriculture.

SDG 15 (life on land) includes several indicators that focus on forests. The report finds positive change globally on three indicators: proportion of forest area located in legally established protected areas; proportion of forest area under long-term forest management plans; and forest area under independently verified forest management certification schemes. The report shows no/small change globally on two indicators: forest area net change rate; and aboveground stock in forest. The report illustrates regional variation in all five indicators, with Eastern and Western Asia and Australia and New Zealand showing positive progress across all five SDG indicators.

The report further underscores the significant income generated from non-wood forest products (NWFPs), stressing that the real figure is likely much higher than global estimates of US$88 billion. For example, one in five people globally depend on NWFPs for food, nutritional diversity and income. In Europe, one in four people collects food, such as fruit and berries, directly from forests. In Uganda, the non-cash value of forest products is up to two to four times higher for local people than the cash value.

On the governance of forests, the report further documents the importance of clear legal frameworks on forest tenure rights, and commends growing trends in local governance, with national governments devolving forestry rights to local and community-based tenure. SOFO 2018 underscores the importance of strengthened legal frameworks in securing the rights of local communities and smallholders to access forests and trees, contributing to ending poverty and achieving sustainability.

SOFO 2018 highlights several positive trends, such as increasing awareness on forest preservation and increasing sustainable forest practices. For example, 56% of paper is recycled today, compared to less than 25% in 1970. The report also showcases a global increase in forest areas managed for soil and water conservation over the past 25 years. Populations in Vienna, Austria; Bogota, Columbia; Johannesburg, South Africa; and Tokyo, Japan rely on protected forests for drinking water, and in the US, 180 million people rely on forests for their drinking water.

The report will be presented and discussed at the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), which is taking place in New York, US, from 9-18 July 2018. SDG 15 is one of the goals to be discussed during the HLPF’s “in-depth review.” [FAO Press Release] [UN Press Release] [Publication: 2018 The State of the World’s Forests]","The report provides “more exact confirmation” that healthy, productive forests are essential to sustainable agriculture.

The report examines challenges facing youth-led innovation for the SDGs and proposes recommendations to create more integrated ecosystems of support for youth change makers.

The second edition of the ‘Youth Solutions Report’ features SDG solution projects led by youth innovators in academia, business, charity and research, with the aim of showcasing their work and highlighting opportunities for potential investors to support the projects. Projects are classified in three categories: design, pilot and prototyping phase; implementation phase (less than 18 months); and implementation phase (more than 18 months). Projects must take into consideration synergies and trade-offs to the SDGs and have potential impacts that are measureable within the SDG indicator framework.

The report’s solutions, which come from 61 countries, deal with crucial sustainable development issues, including clean energy, education, digitalization, e-participation, healthcare, ecosystem restoration, sustainable agriculture and waste. As an illustration, NatureCoin in South Korea aims to stop the discharge of plastics into the seas using disruptive technology in environmental protection that rewards users of a cryptocurrency when they recycle disposable waste. The initiative addresses SDG 9 (industry, innovation, infrastructure); SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities); SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production); SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 14 (life below water); and SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

The report analyzes barriers young people face in accessing financing, mentoring opportunities and generating visibility for their solutions. On financing, the report recommends developing a robust investment pipeline and designing youth-focused funding vehicles for the SDGs. For instance, SDSN Youth is supporting a pipeline of high-quality solutions to fund. To address the lack of visibility on youth-led solutions, the report highlights the potential of social media to level the playing field by enabling youth to connect and interact with the world. The report suggests that governments and other stakeholders can support such interactions by improving internet infrastructure and access and adjusting attitudes towards young entrepreneurs, among other actions.

On monitoring and review, the report stresses the importance of aligning youth solutions within the SDG indicator framework and considers opportunities for young innovators to support SDG follow-up and review. The report argues that aligning youth-led solutions with SDG targets and metrics can position youth to enhance the impact and efficiency of their solutions and connect youth initiatives with SDG-oriented funders.

SDSN will host a series of digital activations to raise awareness on the report’s solutions, including a Twitter chat on 10 August.

115,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/iclei-adopts-new-strategy-for-climate-action-and-sustainability/,"Thu, 05 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,ICLEI Adopts New Strategy for Climate Action and Sustainability,"21 June 2018: ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability has announced a new strategy to tackle urban development challenges and climate change that will help achieve the SDGs and meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Announced at the ICLEI triennial World Congress, the ‘ICLEI Montreal Commitment and Strategic Vision 2018-2024’ identifies pathways towards sustainable urban development.

Convening in Montreal, Canada, from 19-22 June 2018, the meeting, which aimed to support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by strengthening action taken in urban areas worldwide, emphasized that building sustainable cities will help realize the SDGs, particularly SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), which, participants stressed, can be used as a “central lever” to advance all 17 SDGs.

The ICLEI Montreal Commitment and Strategic Vision 2018-2024, which was adopted by the ICLEI Council on 30 May 2018, in advance of the World Congress: provides guidance for action by ICLEI members and network cities; lays out a roadmap for advancing sustainable urban development through 2024, taking into account the Paris Agreement, the SDGs and the New Urban Agenda (NUA); and describes a new model of more inclusive sustainable development governance.

The strategic vision focuses on systems thinking, which highlights the complex relationship among urban systems, and emphasizes an integrated approach to policy and planning. It lays out five interconnected pathways towards 1) low emission, 2) nature-based, 3) circular, 4) resilient and 5) equitable and people-centered development, and supportive policy approaches related to sustainable governance and management, innovation and science, and innovative finance models.

The ICLEI Montreal Action Plan 2018-2021 outlines a roadmap for implementing the Montreal Commitment and Strategy, and explains how each of the five pathways advances the SDGs.

The five pathways aim to cut across sectors and jurisdictional boundaries and create connection points across urban systems to enable local and regional governments to take an integrated approach to sustainable urban development, for example, by determining where equity intersects with resilience or where nature-based solutions can contribute to resilience building. The ICLEI Montreal Action Plan 2018-2021 outlines a roadmap for implementing the Montreal Commitment and Strategy, and explains how each of the five pathways advances the SDGs.

In the ICLEI Montreal Commitment and Strategic Vision 2018-2024, ICLEI members pledge to: scale up and expand the model of sustainable cities and regions; make sustainability a fundamental and inextricable part of local and global development; tackle the most pressing issues with the long-term interests of citizens in mind; and undertake a collective effort for global change across all sectors and levels of government.

More specifically, the ICLEI Montreal Commitment and Strategic Vision 2018-2024 aims to, inter alia: promote 100% renewable energy; support industrial legacy in cities transitioning to sustainable economies; lead the transition to a green economy through sustainable public procurement networks; connect climate action to urban development and engage local and regional governments in making Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) fit for the Paris Agreement; and lead the implementation of global biodiversity targets at the city and regional levels.

More than 1,000 participants attended the congress, representing local, regional and national governments, international agencies, the private sector, academia, community groups and other partners.

The ICLEI World Congress, first held in 1990, takes place every three years to showcase the efforts of local and regional governments to advance sustainable urban development. ICLEI is a global network of more than 1,500 cities, towns and regions in over 100 countries committed to sustainable development, which acts as a bridge between local and regional governments worldwide.

116,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/synthesis-report-highlights-challenges-in-meeting-global-water-goals/,"Mon, 09 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Synthesis Report Highlights Challenges in Meeting Global Water Goals,"5 July 2018: The world is not on track to reach the Sustainable Development Goal on clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), according to an UN-Water Report based on the latest data available for the 11 SDG 6 global indicators. The report titled, ‘SDG 6 Synthesis Report 2018 on Water and Sanitation,’ offers the High-level Political Forum (HLPF) a “joint position from the UN family on the global status on SDG 6 and other water-related targets.”



SDG 6 has eight targets, addressing: drinking water; sanitation and hygiene; water quality; water-use efficiency; integrated water resources management; water-related ecosystems; and means of implementation. The Synthesis Report outlines the challenges faced under each of these targets, provides charts depicting country and regional performance, discusses accelerating progress on the Goal, and provides summaries of ‘key messages’ on each target. The report concludes with general recommendations, including adopting “smart technologies” and engaging in multi-stakeholder partnerships, among other measures.

On drinking water (SDG target 6.1), coverage increased from 81% to 89% between 2000 and 2015, but progress among the lowest-performing countries has been insufficient to achieve universal coverage by 2030. On sanitation (SDG target 6.2), access to basic sanitation services increased from 59% to 68% over that same time period, but rural areas lag behind, and managing fecal sludge has become a challenge. The report highlights that substantial investment will be required, particularly in rapidly growing urban areas, to install sewerage networks and sanitation systems, as well as strengthen the capacity of local and national authorities to manage them.

While progress monitoring on water and sanitation drew on data from at least the year 2000, when the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were adopted, Synthesis Report authors observe that there has been a shorter history of collecting data on the other SDG 6 targets.

On water quality and wastewater treatment (SDG target 6.3), the report notes challenges for both developed and developing countries, especially with regard to monitoring industrial pollution. Preliminary estimates suggest that, in high to middle-income countries, 59% of household wastewater flows are safely treated, while the extent of industrial pollution is unknown.

On water-use efficiency (SDG target 6.4), the report finds a wide range of efficiency levels across the globe, and calls for additional indicators and data that can reflect improvements in agricultural use of water, and reduced losses in municipal distribution networks.

On integrated water resources management (IWRM) (SDG target 6.5), the report finds that most progress towards implementation has been in the areas of cross-sectoral coordination and public participation at the national level, but levels of financing, action on gender issues and aquifer management still remain low.

On water-related ecosystems (SDG target 6.6), the authors report that the world lost 70% of its natural wetlands over the last 100 years. Artificial water bodies such as reservoirs and rice paddies have increased; however data collection systems do not differentiate between artificial and natural wetlands. They call for further detailed data on water-related ecosystems and their benefits, and for complementing local data with earth observation data.

On means of implementation (SDG targets 6 a. and b.), the report cites research findings that the capital investments necessary to reach SDG targets 6.1 and 6.2 are around three times the current levels of investment, and that investments in achieving other targets will also require a significant increase.

The authors argue that achieving SDG 6 is crucial for achieving the rest of the 2030 Agenda. They also emphasize the interdependence among SDG 6 targets, noting, for example, the energy sector’s role in water withdrawals, and the possibility of reducing water pollution to increase access to freshwater.

To help develop key messages to be conveyed to the HLPF, an online multi-stakeholder dialogue on the report was launched on 2 May with a briefing for UN Member States. The dialogue, which will continue through September, will seek input according to the following guidelines: overall feedback (2-16 May); main messages for the HLPF (25 June to 9 July); and looking forward and next steps (31 August to 14 September).

At the HLPF, further discussions on achieving SDG 6 will take place in the context of several water-related events. They include, inter alia: a half-day review of SDG 6 implementation hosted by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA); a UN-Water side event on global progress on water and sanitation; a ‘Water and Faith Communities’ side event organized by the Ecumenical Water Network; and a side event on ‘Ensuring Intergenerational Policy Dialogues for the Achievement of SDG 6,’ which will explore opportunities for greater youth engagement, organized by the Water Youth Network, UN-Water, the International Hydrological Programme of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO-IHP) and the World Youth Parliament for Water (WYPW).

The SDG 6 Synthesis Report offers the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) a progress report on the eight indicators under the clean water and sanitation Goal. The first dialogue focused on the collection of overall feedback on the report. It asked the questions: How did you like the report?; Are there areas, topics or messages that are missing from the report, or that you would like to highlight or modify in view of HLPF? and What could be improved in possible future editions of the report? Respondents’ comments will be presented in a separate publication at the conclusion of the dialogues.

Providing feedback in the online public dialogue, United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) underscored that all investment in planned sanitation infrastructure, in collaboration with local and regional governments, can have positive externalities for human development and the achievement of SDG 6 and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). UCLG explained that many local and regional governments are responsible for the provision of this service and they know better than any other tier of governance what vulnerable groups in what areas of the territory require more integration and better access to this service.

The Groundwater Solutions Initiative for Policy and Practice (GRIPP) proposed adding language related to the fact that SDG 6 and other cross-cutting targets within the SDG framework cannot be achieved without developing pro-active measures for groundwater management at all levels, including enhanced replenishment, demand management, protection, monitoring, reporting and enforcement. GRIPP further called upon the representatives of the respective custodian agencies to make an extra effort to further improve the step-by-step methodologies for the monitoring of SDG 6 target indicators, explaining that the currently proposed methodology generally recognizes the role of groundwater but may need to clearly specify the contribution of groundwater in the weighted calculations. By GRIPP’s intervention, the methodology should also include adequate groundwater measurement and monitoring methodologies to collect necessary data on a regular basis and in a way that can easily be applied at the national level.

Other stakeholders addressed issues related to, inter alia, the need to: better investigate the coherence among the SDG 6 targets within Goal 6; track the strength of enabling environments for private sector involvement, not just highlight the need for general cooperation with the private sector; include a stronger emphasis on water and sanitation as a human right; and include a stronger recognition of Indigenous Peoples as rights-holders.

The NDC-SDG Linkages website includes a clickable world map, which indicates how closely aligned each SDG and its 169 targets are with each country’s NDC.

The website enables users to search NDC content for all countries, and explore linkages between countries’ NDCs and specific SDG targets. It allows users to click on a specific SDG to view the map and determine, based on a spectrum of color shading for each country, the SDG targets each country’s NDC is aligned with, as well as which countries’ NDCs align with the highest number of targets for each specific SDG.

For example, more than 50 countries’ NDCs are linked to SDG target 2.4 (ensuring sustainable food production systems and implementing resilient agricultural practices by 2030), and many countries’s NDCs are also aligned with other targets for this SDG. However, only a few countries’ NDCs are linked to SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) targets, with only one NDC (Egypt) linked to SDG target 16.5 on substantially reducing corruption and bribery.

More than 50 countries’ NDCs are linked to SDG target 2.4 (ensuring sustainable food production systems and implementing resilient agricultural practices by 2030).

Many countries’ NDCs are aligned with many of the targets under SDG 13 (climate action). For example, almost all NDCs are aligned with target 13.1 on strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters. However, only a handful of NDCs, and none from developed countries, incorporate SDG target 13.a on mobilizing US$100 billion annually by 2020 to address developing country needs.

At the same time, for each SDG, the user is able to click on a specific country on the interactive map to see how many SDG targets are incorporated into that country’s NDC. For example, for SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), China has five targets linked to its NDC, India has seven, and the US has zero targets linked. For SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), Canada has four targets aligned with its NDC, Niger has five, and Argentina’s NDC does not link to any SDG 7 targets.

Climate Watch is an online platform that compiles datasets to enable users to analyze and compare NDCs, access emissions data, identify how countries can leverage their climate goals to achieve their sustainable development ambitions, and map new pathways to a low carbon future. The platform allows users to create and share data visualizations and comparisons of climate commitments. It contributes to the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change by using open data to increase transparency and accountability, and provides analysis on how countries can enhance climate action.

The website’s partners include Climate Action Tracker, Climate Analytics, the NDC Partnership, the UNFCCC, the World Bank Group, the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ).

On the final day, 11 countries presented their VNRs, bringing the total number of participating countries to 46.



The HLPF convened under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) from 9-18 July 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US, with the Ministerial Meeting taking place from 16-18 July, and held jointly with ECOSOC’s High-level Segment. The meeting focused on the theme of ‘Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies.’

The Bahamas’ VNR presentation noted the vulnerability of The Bahamas given its location in a volatile hurricane zone, and outlined challenges, including in sectors related to poverty, youth unemployment, education, health, energy efficiency, and coastal resilience. He outlined SDG-related plans to promote land reform, empowerment, and backyard farming. Romania’s VNR presentation described work across national and local governments to advance the SDGs, and highlighted: breaking down silos to address a complex agenda; the need for stability to support human rights; and the importance of SDG implementation, commencing with individual lifestyles.

Lebanon’s VNR presentation emphasized the country adopted a bottom-up and “whole of government” approach to SDG implementation. The presentation highlighted good progress in education, heath, women, poverty reduction and development of small and medium enterprises and recognized the need for more work in areas improving statistical capabilities. Hungary’s VNR presentation focused on: water management; a sustainable energy strategy, which includes a programme to promote the use of electric cars; a focus on sustainable cities, which includes housing, climate change and air quality-related components; and a national strategy on sustainable consumption and production (SCP).

Malta’s VNR presentation highlighted: a high and steady economic growth rate; investments in skills development and health and education, especially on life-long opportunities for education and training; a high employment rate; and efforts to ensure gender equality and social inclusion, including of persons with disabilities and the LGBTQ+ community. Poland’s VNR presentation described social, economic and environmental initiatives, including ones to: help families with children through cash transfers; assist the elderly; promote innovation, research, and development through tax relief; help start-ups; and deal with air pollution. In response to questions, Poland noted measures to implement a circular economy; address water management; and tackle air pollution as part of efforts to implement the Paris Agreement on climate change.

Singapore’s VNR presentation highlighted: the implementation of integrated closed-loop systems for recycling water and waste materials; an integrated long-term planning for sustainable cities, including an emphasis on urban greenery; and a long-lasting commitment to combine environmentalism and development, particularly in the area of water management. On SDG 13 (climate action), Singapore said it is one of the first Asian nations to implement a national carbon tax and described a Climate Action Package, which aims to develop climate resilience capacity in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region. Spain’s VNR presentation focused on: high levels of inequality and youth unemployment; high levels of gender violence; large pay gaps between men and women; high levels of women’s participation in politics (11 out of the 16 ministers are women); and high vulnerability to climate change.

Saudi Arabia’s VNR presentation highlighted: a national water strategy to achieve universal clean water access; the involvement of women and youth in urban planning; and local partnerships for SDG implementation. Responding to questions, Saudi Arabia noted close collaboration between ministers and Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund plans to increase investments in renewables. Paraguay’s VNR presentation addressed institutional processes such as the establishment of audits and indicators for monitoring progress on the SDGs; programmes fighting violence against children and adolescents; and ongoing efforts to improve the well-being and living standards of indigenous peoples and rural communities, among other actions. Paraguay identified the need for greater statistical capacities as a future challenge.

Qatar’s VNR presentation showcased: plans to increase economic growth; improvements in the literacy rate; reduced youth unemployment; and the country’s universal access to clean drinking water. Qatar said it leads the Middle East and North Africa peace index.

On stakeholder participation, The Bahamas said it does not have a strong culture of engagement with civic organizations. Romania acknowledged the importance of involving universities in the VNRs. Lebanon highlighted the inclusion of CSOs in the VNR drafting process and elaborated on private sector involvement in the 2030 Agenda, which took place primarily through the UN Global Compact network for Lebanon. Hungary described youth participation in the SDGs and efforts to promote inclusivity of disadvantaged people, such as Roma communities. Singapore and Spain both shared their countries’ multi-stakeholder approaches to SDG implementation, with Spain explaining it has 50 organizing platforms for civil society participation and decentralization in SDG implementation. Saudi Arabia highlighted coordinated support of the private sector and civil society. Qatar emphasized the contributions of civil society to SDG implementation and the drafting of the VNR.

Several countries highlighted alignment of national development plans and strategies with the 2030 Agenda, including Poland and Paraguay. Malta elaborated on a national law mandating mainstreaming of sustainable development in all policies. Saudi Arabia described the alignment between Saudi Arabia’s ‘Vision 2030’ and the SDGs. Spain said it has a national committee for SDG implementation and a research and development strategy for the SDGs.

According to the Earth Negotiations Bulletin (ENB), the 46 VNRs presented during the 2018 session provided a “good snapshot of action on the ground, but also of the numerous challenges faced by national and local actors.” The ENB noted that the challenge of capacity and financial resources, notably in a number of developing countries, was a recurring issue among the VNRs, and reflected that the level of participation of non-state actors in the preparation of the VNRs varied among countries in scale and depth. The ENB underscored some frustration among participants at the lack of follow-up to and feedback on the VNRs, and suggestions for more clear and consistent reporting methodologies.

During a session on integrating the NDCs and SDGs at national level, Michael Comstock, UN Development Programme (UNDP), noted that SDG-related efforts contribute to NDC goals and vice-versa, given the “distinct but interlinked” processes. He highlighted research from the World Resources Institute (WRI) that finds climate actions align with 154 of the 169 SDG targets. However, he underscored challenges that hinder implementation, particularly the siloing of parallel processes with little communication between ministries despite substantive overlaps and potential duplication. Comstock outlined UNDP support to both the SDG and NDC processes, closing with a preview of a UNDP report titled, ‘Aligning NDCs and SDGs: Lessons Learned and Practical Guidance,’ to be launched later this year. [Presentation on Dialogue Objectives by Michael Comstock, UNDP]

Lee Cando, NDC Partnership, also stressed countries’ challenges of coordination, both horizontally across ministries and development partners, and vertically between national, sub-national and local governments. She flagged NDCs’ interdisciplinary nature, emphasizing that they cut across issues, and are not stand-alone climate or environment issues. Rather, they encompass a wide range of topics, including agriculture (SDG 2), water (SDG 6), energy (SDG 7), transport (SDG 11) and forestry (SDG 15). [Presentation on Transforming NDCs into Action by Lee Cando, NDC Partnership]

Dialogue participants highlighted “the need to mobilize the trillions of dollars of private investment” needed in order to collectively realize countries’ NDCs and the SDGs.

Sofia Gonzales, NewClimate Institute, presented the SDG Climate Action Nexus (SCAN) Tool for linking climate actions to the SDGs. The tool allows for analysis of trade-offs between SDGs that are in conflict, where progress on one may detract from or undermine that of another. However, for all SDGs, she noted, the synergies outweigh the trade-offs. [Presentation on SCAN Tool by Sofia Gonzales, NewClimate Institute]

Representatives from Georgia and Armenia shared their countries’ experiences. Tea Avazashvili, Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development, Georgia, reviewed steps that the country has taken towards diversifying and improving its energy sources and security, noting policy developments around energy efficiency and renewables, which align closely with SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy). Georgia’s key challenges for incorporating NDC and SDG actions, Avazashvili delineated, include low levels of awareness and lack of human, institutional and regulatory capacity. Asya Murudyan, Ministry of Nature Protection, Armenia, emphasized the country’s actions around adaptation as highlighted in its NDC.

With finance often being seen as an opportunity to join up implementation efforts towards the SDGs and Paris Agreement on climate change, participants in the session on private sector engagement acknowledged “the need to mobilize the trillions of dollars of private investment” needed in order to collectively realize countries’ NDCs and the SDGs. Discussions covered strategies and means of implementation that are broadly recognized as contributing to both the climate and development agendas, such as public-private partnerships (PPPs), an enabling policy environment and cooperation on green technologies to accelerate society’s transition towards more sustainable economic growth.

The Dialogue also featured discussions on how to integrate gender equality (SDG 5) into NDC implementation. Natasha Olofinskaya, UNDP, highlighted that gender is an enabling factor for all 17 SDGs, noting that it is not only supportive of climate mitigation and adaptation measures, but also has positive impacts on poverty reduction (SDG 1), hunger eradication (SDG 2) and health (SDG 3).

Forests cover around 30% of the Earth’s land area, containing 80% of terrestrial biomass and providing habitat for over half of the world’s known terrestrial plant and animal species. Many of which provide humanity with essential benefits and services. The biodiversity of inland water, addressed as well by SDG 15, sustains ecosystems and ecosystem services that are key for human well-being, as well as for many life stages of aquatic and migratory species.

But biodiversity does more than that. Healthy ecosystems play a critical role in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development imperative of ‘leave no one behind’. For example, ecosystem services are estimated to make up between 50% and 90% of the livelihoods needs, among poor rural and forest-dwelling households. The UN Human Rights Council at its 34th Session noted that the loss of biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services has a disproportionate effect on people who are vulnerable for other reasons, including gender, age, disability, poverty or minority status. The loss of biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services is likely to accentuate their social inequalities and marginalization (SDG 10) by decreasing their access to basic materials for a healthy life and by reducing their freedom of choice and action.

Biodiversity and healthy ecosystems also support transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies, the theme of the 2018 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). Urban and rural ecosystem services and nature-based solutions contribute to climate-change mitigation and adaptation (SDG 13), such as shade provision, and flood and drought protection. More green space generally means more vegetation that can act as a carbon sink for partially offsetting urban emissions. And increasing the biodiversity of urban food systems can enhance resilience through food and nutrition security (SDG 2): local food systems have historically proved to be critical to a community’s survival in the face of food security crises.

Biodiversity, SDGs’ Basis

While all the SDGs are important in themselves and for the achievement of the others, biodiversity is clearly the linchpin between all of them. Essentially, without biodiversity, we would not exist, let alone develop.

Biodiversity provides the essential resources and ecosystem services that directly support a range of economic activities, such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries and tourism, contributing to poverty eradication (SDG 1). The link between biodiversity and human health (SDG 3) is increasingly acknowledged: many pests and diseases are consequences of ecosystem disturbance; many medicines have been derived from biological products; and a substantial proportion of the world’s population depends on traditional medicines derived from biodiversity for their health care needs.

Protecting biodiversity has a direct impact on gender equality (SDG 5), as biodiversity loss and degraded ecosystems can perpetuate gender inequalities by increasing the time spent by women and children on collecting valuable resources including fuel, food and water, and reducing the time for education (SDG 4) and income generating activities.

Healthy ecosystems underpin the delivery of water supplies, water quality, and guard against water-related hazards and disasters (SDG 6), while the bio-energy produced from renewable biomass (such as forestry byproducts and agricultural residues) and other forms of renewable energy generated based on ecosystems (such as hydropower systems), can provide major opportunities for supplying cleaner and affordable energy (SDG 7). Marine and terrestrial ecosystems are essential for many national and global economic sectors that provide employment (SDG 8), while biodiversity and healthy ecosystems can provide reliable and cost-effective natural (green) infrastructure (SDG 9).

Biodiversity underpins the day-to-day functioning of cities and human settlements by delivering the basic services and conditions that enable, support and protect human production, consumption and habitation (SDGs 11 and 12).

Biodiversity underpins all fishing and aquaculture activities, as well as other species harvested for foods and medicines (SDG 14). Environmental crime such as wildlife trafficking, illicit fishing and illegal timber trade threaten global security by benefiting organized crimes and non-state armed groups, while conflicts over natural resources, environmental degradation and contamination often lead to social insecurity and violence (SDG 16).

The UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and its Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 provide a global framework for international cooperation on science, technology and innovation related to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Under the Convention, governments work together to disseminate knowledge and technologies for environmental management, enhance South-South cooperation, and strengthen national and local capacities for policy and science. Such capacities and wealth of knowledge are essential for the SDGs implementation and monitoring (SDG 17).

Where Are We in Achieving SDG 15?

The science is clear and the alarm bells are ringing: biodiversity loss and destruction of ecosystems continue at unprecedented rates according to the Red Life Index. The recent Intergovernmental science-policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) regional assessments reports, launched in March, present a worrying picture in all regions of the world. Furthermore, the World Economic Forum’s Global Risk Report listed ecological collapse, together with biodiversity loss, among the top global risks in terms of impact. We are on the brink of crossing ecological boundaries and reaching tipping points in climate and ecosystems that might lead to an acceleration of planetary destruction. Humanity’s “Titanic” is moving faster and faster towards the iceberg.

The 2018 UN Secretary-General Report ‘Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals’ found that progress in preserving and sustainably using the Earth’s terrestrial species and ecosystems is uneven.

The number of protected forests, areas under long-term management plans, and voluntary certifications have increased. From 2000 to 2017, average worldwide coverage of terrestrial, freshwater and mountain key biodiversity areas by protected areas increased from 35% to 47%, from 32% to 43% and from 39% to 49%, respectively. In 2015, bilateral official development assistance (ODA) in support of biodiversity amounted to US $8.8 billion, an increase of 39% in real terms over 2014. This is good news.

Yet, wildlife poaching and trafficking continues to thwart conservation efforts. While 15% of land is currently under protection, that does not cover all areas important for biodiversity. Land and soil degradation undermine the security and development of all countries, currently brining more than 1 billion people under threat.

The global community appears committed to conserving biodiversity: as of April 2017, 144 countries ratified the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture and 96 countries ratified the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization. But much more needs to be done.

“TO DO” for SDG 15

Response indicators for SDG 15 show that while commitments towards implementation are increasing, the indicators available on the state of Life on Land show decline. Solving this dichotomy between commitments and outcomes is imperative.

First, it is essential to understand what is continuing to implicate this decline and to internalize biodiversity knowledge within mainstream decision-making in biodiversity-relevant sectors. Bridging existing biodiversity-related knowledge and facilitating engagement of local actors in sustainable development processes is also important.

Second, governments need to provide an enabling environment to support evidence based policy making and development planning pathways, underpinned by high quality, timely, reliable and disaggregated data, in a way that empowers all relevant actors to become effective change agents in their own context.

Third, governments could exchange insights and experiences on innovations and solutions to address biodiversity and development challenges. This could be explored through diverse networks, knowledge and capacities to position the pivotal role of biodiversity in societal transitions emerging in all economic sectors and regions. This could leverage long term nature relevant impact investments, communication, data, technologies and other resources in a way that benefits our natural capital.

Fourth, governments could undertake natural capital assessments and accounting, and formulate goals to work towards a “sustainable balance sheet” within all policy sectors. Rather than presenting a static picture one could think about a “dynamic balance sheet,” in which economies in balance with nature generate as much ecological, economic and societal value as is used.

Overall, the 2018 HLPF could support further actions to further implement the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 in the remaining two years of the UN Decade on Biodiversity, and call for an ambitious new global framework on biodiversity to be negotiated under the Convention on Biological Diversity.","Healthy ecosystems play a critical role in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development imperative of ‘leave no one behind’.

Just over 1000 days after the Goals were agreed upon, the SDG Business Forum opened with a call on all participants to think critically about the progress made so far, considering the long way ahead.

“Three years in, I think we need a reality check. We’re not going fast enough. How do we scale the positive experiences presented at the #SDGBizForum? And how do we help entrepreneurs do the same for their sustainable innovations?” @ICCSecGen @iccwbo #HLPF pic.twitter.com/oixlVGtPgx — SDG Business Forum (@SDGBizforum) July 17, 2018

Under this year’s theme ‘Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies’, 47 countries reported on progress so far. But according to a new report by the United Nations Development Solutions, no country is on track to deliver on the 2030 Agenda. This concerning trend underscores the importance of partnering with all economic actors in society to ensure that implementation of the 17 Goals will be realised in time to achieve our common objectives within the next 12 years.

Business is already partnering to speed up progress for the SDGs, but more can be done to establish action-oriented collaborations with the United Nations and governments around the world. Here are four takeaways on how we can improve partnerships in the year ahead:

1. We need to be transparent about both progress and failures

It was clear that both business, governments and the UN representatives at the Forum want to see more transparency in discussions around the SDGs.

Jean-Pierre Clamadieu, CEO, Solvay, said that “transparency is critical to raising benchmarks and keeping companies challenged,” and called on companies to continue their transformation for the SDGs. “Things are changing — probably not at the speed we would like — but we are moving in the right direction.” “I’m a big believer in naming and faming companies that are doing good, and naming and shaming those who do not play a role,” said Erik Solheim, Executive Director, UN Environment. Rebecca Self, CEO Sustainable Finance, HSBC, highlighted the need for more alignment in the way we report on sustainability targets and investments with ESG policies. “I think we need to be more innovative about our reporting processes.”

Tonye Cole of the Sahara Group, Nigeria, intervened from the audience to share an example of ways to develop Voluntary National Reviews (VNR), the mechanism by which governments report on SDG progress at the High-level Political Forum each year. By collaborating with local business organisations and the government, the group has now established a dialogue where Nigerian businesses feed information on activities that are later taken up in the country’s official government communiqué on SDGs.

To provide governments with an idea of what business is doing in all countries around the world for the SDGs in focus this year, ICC launched a report at the SDG Business Forum on ‘Business for Sustainable and Resilient Societies’, which highlights case studies from businesses taking action, and policy recommendations on how governments can help more companies implement the SDGs into their strategies. Here are a few highlights from the report:

2. Trade is key to sustainable development and inclusive growth

“Trade is essentially a partnership that can drive economic growth, increase incomes […] and empower societies,” said David MacLennan, CEO, Cargill, during the panel discussion on ‘Leadership and Innovation for the SDGs’. “In a time when trade is under attack, we cannot forget to talk about its positive impact on sustainable development.”

Working together for the SDGs requires governments, businesses and civil society to act openly and engage in partnership across borders. Participants at the SDG Business Forum agreed that trade can fuel inclusive growth, if a dialogue that includes both big and small businesses is established. The Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation is a great example of how the public and private sector can partner to enable more efficient cross-border trade.

3. Technology can help speed up transformation for the SDGs

Technology can not only help governments and businesses communicate digitally and thereby be more transparent about progress for the SDGs; it can also provide governments with the tools to improve lives. Financial solutions, digital access to information on health and connectivity to global markets are just some of the benefits that Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) can bring.

ICC just published a paper on ICTs’ role in fuelling the Goals in focus this year. Read the full report with more case studies like this:

The Global Enabling Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) in partnership with Accenture also presented a new report called ‘Enabling the Global Goals’, which points to strong positive correlations between digital access and the SDGs.

The Portal’s launch fulfills UNESCO’s voluntary commitment made at the 2017 UN Ocean Conference, as well as progress on the Sustainable Development Goal on life below water (SDG 14).

The Ocean Literacy Portal will provide a “one-stop shop for ocean literacy” through sharing resources, information on ocean projects and events based on scientific knowledge. It covers a broad range of ocean topics, from marine litter to marine policy, and its users can search for resources organized by: students; educators; scientists; media; policymakers; and private sector. Portal users can also register for the ‘Ocean Literacy Collaborative Workspace (UNESTEAMS),’ an online collaboration and knowledge-sharing platform that enables users to collaborate with fellow members to co-create and develop joint projects or co-work on topics and share resources.

UNESCO and partners submitted the voluntary commitment titled ‘Ocean Literacy for All: A Global Strategy to Raise the Awareness for the Conservation, Restoration, and Sustainable Use of Our Ocean’ to support implementation of SDG 14, which was the focus of the UN Ocean Conference. According to UNESCO, the ocean literacy encourages more informed and responsible behavior towards the ocean and its resources among all citizens and stakeholders. It encompasses understanding the state of the ocean as well as more in-depth understanding of individual and collective responsibilities towards the seas.

The ocean literacy commitment aims to: encourage cooperation and exchange on ocean education to improve ocean literacy; raise awareness of the two-way interaction between the oceans and peoples’ everyday lives and empower citizens to adjust their everyday behavior; and seek and apply innovative ways to make current and future citizens ocean literate so that they recognize environmental challenges and make informed and responsible decisions related to use of the ocean resources and ocean stewardship.

Also in support of this commitment, UNESCO held an ‘International Workshop on Ocean Literacy’ in December 2017 and plans to release a publication on ocean literacy. The Swedish government has provided financial support for the initiative.

The report covers developments from 2015-2017 on migration and sustainable development in the region, and identifies SDG targets that are directly and indirectly related to human mobility. Titled ‘Situation Report on International Migration: Migration in the Arab Region and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,’ the report is published in the lead-up to the anticipated adoption of the UN Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration in late 2018.

The three-part report addresses: trends in international migration in the Arab region; changes in migration governance in 2016 and 2017; and linkages between international migration and the SDGs.

Approximately 41% of the global population of internally displaced people lives in the Arab region.

The report finds that approximately 41% of the global population of internally displaced people lives in the Arab region, and numbers of women migrants have increased, due to recent conflicts and violence. Various sub-regions have different migration patterns, with the Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC) hosting a larger concentration of migrants than anywhere else in the world, and the Mashreq region serving as a source of labor migration and displacement due to conflict.

In terms of migration governance, Arab countries maintain restrictive and gender-based policies on access to nationality. However, the report notes some improvements in upholding the rights of migrant workers and in combating human trafficking.

The authors identify four types of relationships between migration and the SDGs: the level of development in an area as a driver for mobility; migration as an opportunity for development; migrants as contributors to development in their countries of origin and also in their countries of destination; and mobile populations as vulnerable populations whose specific needs should be considered.

They highlight SDG target 10.7 on facilitating orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, as well as other relevant targets: protecting migrant workers’ labor rights and providing a safe and secure working environment, especially for women (SDG 8.8); reducing the transaction costs of remittances (SDG 10.c); expanding scholarships for students from developing countries (SDG 4.b); eliminating trafficking in persons, especially of women and girls, and forced labor and exploitation (SDG targets 5.2, 8.7, and 16.2); and ensuring meaningful data collection (SDG 17.18).

The report refers to several international frameworks that can help governments assess their own policies: the Multilateral Framework on Labour Migration; the Migration Governance Framework; the Migration Governance Index; and a dashboard of indicators of measuring policy and institutional coherence for migration and development.

126,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/stakeholders-share-views-on-hlpf-effectiveness-ahead-of-2019-review/,"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Stakeholders Share Views on HLPF Effectiveness Ahead of 2019 Review,"9 July 2018: On the sidelines of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), participants exchanged views on the value, role and future of the HLPF, including an upcoming process to review its format and organizational aspects. The side event titled, ‘Stakeholder Engagement in the HLPF and its Review in 2019,’ was organized by the Major Groups and Other Stakeholder (MGOS), and took place on the first day of the HLPF.

Opening the event, Jeffery Huffines, CIVICUS, noted that in 2019, the UN will hold two sessions of the HLPF: one under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and another one at the level of the UNGA. In addition, beginning in September 2019, he said governments will begin a process of reviewing the HLPF’s format and organizational aspects.

The HLPF was established in 2013, through UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution 67/290, in accordance with paragraph 84 of ‘The Future We Want,’ the outcome document of the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). Resolution 67/290 was followed by the adoption of UNGA resolution 70/299 in July 2016 that clarifies various elements related to the follow-up and review functions of the HLPF, including the specific themes of the Forum for 2017, 2018 and 2019, as well as the set of SDGs to be reviewed in depth in those years. Resolution 70/299 also notes that progress in its implementation and in the implementation of UNGA resolution 67/290 will be reviewed by the UNGA at its 74th session (2019-2020) “to benefit from lessons learned in the first cycle” of the HLPF.

In the context of this upcoming review process, panelists at the side event highlighted concerns and suggestions with regard to MGOS participation in the HLPF. Stefano Prato, Society for International Development, noted that despite a “significant shrinking” of space for civic engagement, there is capacity to “bridge democratic and bureaucratic deficit.” He called on MGOS to take concrete steps to ensure the participation of “right-holders” (such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) persons, migrants and refugees), in the Forum. He also called on MGOS to “connect the dots” by linking engagement mechanisms between various thematic platforms, such as financing for development (FfD) or the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). He underlined the need to better organize, engage more closely with the regional level, and change the nature of the HLPF in a way that allows taking “collective” decisions on issues that need to be addressed.

Mohammed Ali Loutfy, Disabled Peoples International (DPI), said: coalitions composed of civil society and stakeholders should be better supported and recognized as part of SDG reviews; more stakeholders should be involved in SDG implementation at the national level; and there should be increased engagement with local authorities and grassroot groups, and improved coordination between UN agencies and civil society. He called for bringing different participatory processes together, and suggested to have stakeholders represented in the office(s) in charge of SDG implementation at the national level.

Beisheim noted that the thematic reviews lack guidelines, have difficult-to-follow preparatory processes, and lack actionable results.

Marianne Beisheim, German Institute for International and Security Affairs, characterized the HLPF as “the institutional home” of the SDGs, recalling that one of its roles is to follow up on and review progress on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. She said there are complementary components of the follow-up and review process, such as the thematic reviews, regional reviews, voluntary national reviews (VNRs), the SDG progress report issued by the UN Secretary-General, and the Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR). On issues with the thematic reviews, she noted, inter alia, the absence of guidelines, the difficulty to follow preparatory processes, and the lack of actionable results. On VNRs, she remarked that quality of national preparatory processes and reports vary, national reviews often lack analysis of good practices and challenges, and there is limited room for critical questions from MGOS. She underlined the limited time for in-depth discussions at the HLPF, and the need to secure actionable results for both the thematic reviews and the VNRs.

Among other suggestions, Beisheim called for guidelines and for including policy recommendations from thematic reviews and VNRs in HLPF outcome documents. She also proposed that designated custodian institutions publish a roadmap on preparatory and follow-up process for thematic reviews “in good time,” and that the HLPF makes more room for debates related to VNRs.

Rebecca Malay, Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement, GCAP, noted that most thematic reviews and VNRs do not frame the SDGs based on a human rights approach. She remarked that the SDG indicators are often “confined” to technocrats, without civil society involvement. She also observed that the many independent reports prepared by civil society organizations on SDG national implementation (“shadow reports”) are not available on the HLPF’s VNR website.

On lessons learned regarding the HLPF so far, Sachini Perera, International Women’s Rights Action Watch (IWRAW), RESURJ, said the review of the HLPF in 2019 should take into account the ongoing UN reform, and should examine how human rights can be incorporated in the Forum, adding that human rights processes are currently overlooked when assessing SDG progress.

Discussing stakeholder engagement in the HLPF and its review in 2019, Jan-Gustav Strandenaes, Stakeholder Forum, said paragraph 15 of resolution 67/290 defines civil society’s rights and privileges at the HLPF. This paragraph allows MGOS to: attend all official meetings of the forum; have access to all official information and documents; intervene in official meetings; submit documents and present written and oral contributions; make recommendations; and organize side events and round tables, in cooperation with UN Member States and the UN Secretariat. Compared to the UN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) that preceded the establishment of the HLPF, however, Strandenaes noted that some privileges have been lost, including the access and participation to all negotiations, access to all rooms and participation in all meetings, and access to all delegates on the floor. He also underscored the “enormous” mandate of the HLPF, as defined in resolution 67/290 and the 2030 Agenda, and identified elements that should be improved, including on emerging issues, the science-policy interface, stakeholder engagement, and on developing and negotiating the Ministerial Declaration.

The World Water Data Initiative is a global effort previously launched by the Government of Australia to promote hydrometry as a basis for implementing SDG 6 on access to clean water and sanitation. The announcement of WMO’s role came at a one-day dialogue on strengthening hydrological services and improving forecasting, monitoring and use of water supplies.

In March 2018, the High-Level Panel on Water (HLPW) recommended, in its report titled, ‘Making Every Drop Count,’ that the World Water Data Initiative should continue. The Initiative builds the capacity of national governments to plan adequately for water stress and scarcity, floods, drought, and freshwater pollution. WMO’s role now is to develop Phase II of the Initiative.

At the dialogue event, WMO also launched a call for proposals to develop cost-effective solutions for hydrological monitoring, which are appropriate for developing countries including Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS). The WMO HydroHub, a platform for sharing of knowledge and expertise, is offering seed funding of up to CHF 100,000 for “innovative solutions in operational hydrology.” The deadline for submissions is 20 August 2018. [WMO Press Release] [HydroHub Innovation Call][SDG Knowledge Hub story on HLPW outcome package]","25 June 2018: The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) took on the leadership of the World Water Data Initiative at a meeting of the WMO Executive Council in Geneva, Switzerland.
The World Water Data Initiative is a global effort previously launched by the Government of Australia to promote hydrometry as a basis for implementing SDG 6 on access to clean water and sanitation.
The announcement of WMO’s role came at a one-day dialogue on strengthening hydrological services and improving forecasting, monitoring and use of water supplies.
In March 2018, the High-Level Panel on Water (HLPW) recommended, in its report titled, ‘Making Every Drop Count,’ that the World Water Data Initiative should continue.

128,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/odi-analyzes-countries-readiness-to-leave-no-one-behind/,"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,ODI Analyzes Countries’ Readiness to Leave No One Behind,"18 July 2018: A briefing note and index launched in the margins of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) reviews the readiness of 86 countries to “leave no one behind.” With the SDGs in effect for nearly 1,000 days, the Overseas Development Institute’s (ODI) ‘Leave No One Behind Index 2018’ explores the extent to which countries have the required data, policies and financing in place.

Elizabeth Stuart, ODI, emphasized during the launch event in New York, US, on 18 July 2018, that “we know what it takes” to deliver on a leave no one behind agenda, as articulated by the Index:

data to identify who is left behind and take stock of progress;

a reprioritization of policies to ensure that affected communities receive the resources they need;

finance, particularly in the areas of education, health and social protection; and

a rethinking of donors’ “risk appetites” to go beyond a poverty reduction agenda.

The 2018 Index builds on an inaugural Index released in 2017, adding a policy indicator on resilience, in line with the theme of the 2018 HLPF. Data collected on the additional indicator show that, of the 86 countries reviewed, more than half (46) are “not ready” to leave no one behind from a resilience perspective. Stuart said a new indicator will be added annually, in line with the theme of each year’s HLPF.

The updated Index includes all countries that presented Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) in 2017 and 2018. On progress, the briefing note highlights that much of the progress made since last year has been in the realm of data, and 11 countries have improved their index score since 2017. Overall, ODI finds that 55 countries are “ready” to meet their commitment, 24 are “partially ready,” five are “not ready,” and two have insufficient data to make an informed assessment. The briefing note concludes that “many countries are insufficiently prepared” to leave no one behind from a resilience perspective, with a quarter failing to enact appropriate policy frameworks. Further, the briefing note flags as a concern the finding that, despite the theme of the 2018 HLPF, most countries fail to identify, let alone prioritize, those most at risk of being left behind in the preparation of their National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) and other adaptation projects. A search of 57 countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement on climate change found that almost half did not contain a single mention of ODI’s keywords relating to a leave no one behind agenda.

ODI’s Index considers four indicators of outcomes: under-five mortality rate; financial inclusion; access to electricity; and undernourishment.

During the event, Achim Steiner, UN Development Programme (UNDP) Administrator, highlighted that the leave no one behind terminology can “mean a thousand different things to a thousand different people,” and can be viewed from a variety of lenses, including income, geography, gender or location. On this, he noted a UNDP discussion paper to be released in the coming weeks titled, ‘What does it mean to leave no one behind?’ that will present a framework for implementation. Steiner also flagged that the SDGs are not a starting point, but rather a reminder of what we have left to do, following the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) era. He and Stuart acknowledged, however, that the SDGs were agreed during a “high water mark for multilateralism,” and that in today’s very different political environment it is important to “keep driving through” and continue a positive narrative.

Isidoro Santana, Minister of Economy, Planning and Development, Dominican Republic, outlined challenges his country is facing, especially on tax capacity and domestic resource mobilization. He lamented that although a significant amount of public funding goes towards education, this leaves other social issues unattended. He noted that the Dominican Republic and many other middle-income countries (MICs) face a decline in official development assistance (ODA) at a time when domestic resources are not yet able to fill the finance gap, and addressing this could help to deliver the leave no one behind agenda.

Celina Caesar-Chavannes, Member of Parliament, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Development, Canada, described measures that her government has taken to achieve leaving no one behind domestically, highlighting indigenous communities, affordable housing, and safe, clean drinking water as areas needing more action. She noted policy reforms that aim to lift children out of poverty, enhance workers’ benefits, and introduce a rights framework for indigenous communities, calling the SDGs an opportunity to link the “usual and unusual suspects together.” Caesar-Chavannes also emphasized Canada’s “feminist foreign policy,” saying it provides a gateway to being able to name and talk about those who are left behind. She noted investments in Canada’s national statistics office to add capacity on disaggregation and better tracking of outcomes.

While ODI’s Index primarily focuses on countries’ readiness to leave no one behind, it also considers four indicators of outcomes in order to demonstrate actual progress: under-five mortality rate; financial inclusion; access to electricity; and undernourishment. It aggregates data on these outcomes to assess whether countries are on track to leave no one behind, scoring them as on track, off track or making partial progress.

ODI’s analysis finds “a clear correlation” between countries’ readiness and outcome scores.

The five winning enterprises focus on eco-inclusive waste management, energy and green technology in Colombia, India, Tanzania and Uganda.

SEED will support the winners with tailored advisory services that help with business and financial plan development, as well as marketing and promotional activities to scale up operations and provide replicable business cases. The winners join a network of more than 230 enterprises from 38 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America who have also received SEED Awards.

Promoting social and environmental enterprises is critical for communities where entrepreneurship drives sustainable development.

The five winning enterprises, selected from a pool of nearly 250 applications, are:

Amazóniko, which focuses on green technologies in Colombia, offers a collaborative recycling web application that motivates users to recycle through a door-to-door collection service and rewards scheme. The programme helps formalize recyclables collection in collaboration with workers, and provides sustainable employment to the waste management sector. The enterprise contributes to implementation of SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and 12 (responsible consumption and production).

Corporación Acción Semilla, which focuses on waste and sanitation in Colombia, collects organic waste from the food service industry and landscaping services, and converts it into fertilizer for the agricultural activities of local smallholder farms. The enterprise charges clients a fee, and earns profits from the sale of crops and compost. The enterprise contributes to implementation of SDGs 8, 12 and 13 (climate action).

Daily Dump, which focuses on waste and sanitation in India, enables urban households, communities and businesses to segregate and compost their waste, and increases awareness and responsibility for decentralized resource consumption and disposal. It contributes to implementation of SDGs 11, 12 and 13.

EcoAct Tanzania, which focuses on waste and sanitation in Tanzania, uses environmentally friendly, energy-efficient plastic extrusion to upcycle plastic waste into durable, affordable plastic timbers for construction. The enterprise mitigates climate change by reducing plastic pollution, wood dependence and deforestation, and contributes to SDGs 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), 12 and 13.

Khainza Energy, which addresses energy in Uganda, produces methane from organic waste secured from farms and households, and distributes it in affordable, recyclable cylinders along with cooking appliances. Khainza Energy incorporates local women, farmers and youth along distribution channels, creating value for consumers and local communities. This project contributes to implementation of SDGs 5 (gender equality), 7 (affordable and clean energy) and 12.

The 2018 SEED Low Carbon Awards are supported by the International Climate Initiative of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU). SEED is based on the premise that promoting social and environmental enterprises is critical for communities where entrepreneurship drives sustainable development. The initiative recognizes innovative, inclusive and environmentally friendly start-ups in developing countries, provides them with business know-how support, and profiles them to encourage growth and sharing of experiences.

130,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/wri-report-recommends-greater-alignment-of-sdg-ndc-implementation-to-enhance-action/,"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"WRI Report Recommends Greater Alignment of SDG, NDC Implementation to Enhance Action","17 July 2018: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on climate change should be implemented jointly to help scale up actions and impact, according to a study that finds that, in most countries, climate actions under Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and national targets under the SDGs have been defined and advanced separately.

The paper, which was developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), examines the ways in which the alignment of the two processes can be increased, despite their distinct histories, communities of actors and political dynamics.

The paper titled, ‘Connecting the Dots: Elements for a Joined-Up Implementation of the 2030 Agenda and Paris Agreement,’ explains that the SDGs and climate actions embedded in NDCs are still largely implemented under distinct tracks, despite growing recognition of the strong connections between the two agendas, the opportunities they present for synergies, and the “short window of opportunity” for addressing the interlinked challenges of climate change, ecosystem degradation, poverty, rising inequality and fragile governance.

Drawing on examples and lessons learned from 11 countries and the EU, the publication outlines efforts to bridge the two implementation tracks, and explains that a growing number of countries have began taking concrete steps to advance both agendas as one. More specifically, the report provides options and examples for linking institutional, policy, financial, and monitoring and reporting frameworks that support joint implementation, which can reduce transaction costs and enhance policy coherence.

The paper describes five areas where countries are taking action to jointly implement the agenda: 1) ensuring institutional coordination; 2) ensuring alignment of and synergies between nationally relevant SDG targets and climate actions; 3) mainstreaming the SDGs and NDCs jointly into national planning and budgets; 4) optimizing financial resources; and 5) designing mutually supportive monitoring and reporting frameworks.

Cross-fertilization between SDG and NDC targets can lead to greater ambition.

On coordinating institutions, the paper explains that SDG and NDC lead institutions can build on their different strengths and authorities to more effectively engage governments and other stakeholders, and calls for consistent leadership and bringing the climate and development communities together.

On alignment of and synergies between SDG and NDC targets, the paper notes that climate policymakers have acknowledged limited understanding of the ways in which the SDGs can support climate policymaking, while sector ministries often view NDCs as technical documents that are difficult for use in policy planning. It explains that cross-fertilization and alignment can lead to greater ambition, and calls for designing single long-term carbon-neutral, sustainable development strategies.

The paper states that while few countries have sought greater alignment, Mexico released a study identifying NDC actions with the greatest SDG benefits as priority “development accelerators.” In addition, Kenya undertook an SDG impact assessment for its National Climate Change Action Plan 2018-2022. Both studies, it notes, call for, inter alia, measures to maximize climate action benefits on inequality reduction and gender equality.

On jointly mainstreaming both agendas into policy planning and budgeting, the paper recommends: sector-specific guidelines; consistent use of performance frameworks and budget-tagging systems that consider the objectives of both agendas; a comprehensive gap analysis of both agendas; monitoring; and involving SDG and NDC lead institutions in planning processes. The paper discusses Colombia’s use of consistent guidelines and support for building the SDGs and NDCs into local development plans, and explains that several countries have also started reviewing and enforcing SDG-NDC mainstreaming.

On optimizing budgetary and financial resources, the paper recommends, inter alia, mobilizing and tracking SDG-related and climate finance, and integrated fiscal and regulatory reforms to help scale up finance for both agendas.

On mutually reinforcing monitoring, evaluation and reporting frameworks, the paper states that: consistent sets of SDG, climate and other development indicators and common data strategies support integrated monitoring of outcomes, and national progress reports can more systematically address SDG-climate linkages. It outlines the ways in which the Philippines, Finland and Kenya have assessed the relevance of global SDG indicators in monitoring climate actions, especially adaptation, noting that several countries have included SDG and NDC reporting in annual growth reviews and budget processes.

In addition, the report describes the ways in which international development can better support national efforts to link the two agendas, and urges development partners to support national efforts to link implementation efforts through an integrated approach to capacity building and project planning.

The report suggests that global reporting frameworks under the Paris Agreement and the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) could better support national efforts to merge SDG and NDC implementation, and contends that the HLPF and Talanoa Dialogue offer near-term opportunities for countries to develop synergies to ramp up national ambitions.

It also approved the reorganization of the current Department of Management and Department of Field Support into the proposed new Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, and Department of Operational Support. Following agreement on these matters in the (UNGA) Fifth Committee (Budgetary and Administrative). Following agreement in the Fifth Committee on resolutions outlining these decisions, the UNGA met to adopt the text.



The Fifth Committee concluded the second part of its resumed session on 5 July 2018, in New York, US. The new departments on peacebuilding were considered in a text titled ‘Special subjects relating to the programme budget for the biennium 2018-2019.’ The other reorganization was outlined in a text titled, ‘Shifting the management paradigm in the United Nations.’

In a meeting on 8 June on strengthening the accountability system of the UN under the new management paradigm, delegates called for continued refinement of policies and practices to improve accountability. Christian Saunders, introducing the Secretary‑General’s report on the matter, explained that the increased delegation of authority under that new management paradigm will be accompanied by a simplification and streamlining of the rules, policies and procedures. The increased delegation of authority will also be accompanied by the development and dissemination of administrative guidance along with training, support, monitoring and accountability mechanisms. By leveraging the global management reporting capabilities of Umoja, the proposed Business Transformation and Accountability Division would use business analytics to provide real‑time reporting on performance to senior managers, as well as other internal and external stakeholders.

Carlos Ruiz Massieu, Chair of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ), supported by the US, noted that future reports of the Secretary-General must expand on the implementation of the accountability system by providing more complete information on the overall status. The US recommended including benchmarks to substantiate the impact of accountability initiatives.

Switzerland, also for Liechtenstein, said roles and responsibilities must be clarified. She noted that greater authority should be given to managers entrusted to deliver on UN’s mandates, who in turn must be held accountable for their decisions, performance and conduct. She added that managers have the tools and ability to exercise such authority. China called for strengthening the supervision of accountability by the Committee for Programme and Coordination and the Fifth Committee. He further expressed support for the establishment of the Business Transformation and Accountability Division to support the implementation of the reform measures.

In their discussions, delegates noted some “positive momentum” as the global financial system strengthened, but warned that the threat of international trade barriers could undermine global economic growth.

Mahmadamin Mahmadaminov, Vice-President, UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), chaired the session, and Gillian Tett, US Managing Editor, Financial Times, moderated discussions.

Speakers addressed issues related to aid, trade, taxation and technology, drawing on an HLPF background note on SDG 17. The session aimed to build on the outcomes of the ECOSOC Forum on Financing for Development (FfD Forum) that took place in April 2018 (E/FFDF/2018/3), and recommendations from related processes, including the Development Cooperation Forum (DCF), the World Investment Forum, the UN World Data Forum, and the the Multistakeholder Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) for the SDGs.

On foreign aid (SDG target 17.2), Yongyi Min, Statistics Division, UN Department for Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), reported that official development assistance (ODA) declined between 2016 and 2017, and aid to the least developed countries (LDCs) grew just 1% in real terms during the same period. Viet Nam and the Asia Pacific Regional civil society organization (CSO) Engagement Mechanism lamented the decline in ODA, and Courtenay Rattray, Permanent Representative of Jamaica to the UN, called on ODA providers to fulfill their commitments. France announced plans to increase its contribution to support the SDGs. Belarus called for support for middle-income countries.

On mobilizing additional financial resources (SDG target 17.3), panelist Steven Waygood, Aviva, pointed to US$300 million invested in capital markets that could be leveraged for the SDGs. He called on the UN and civil society to support the development of rules and standards to make capital markets more sustainable and transparent. Finland welcomed diversification of financing for development, including leveraging private sector funds. The Dominican Republic also called for alternative sources of finance.

In 2017, only Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and the UK met or exceeded the UN benchmark for ODA contributions.

On debt sustainability (SDG target 17.4), Rattray further called for better debt management monitoring by national and international actors. South Africa cautioned that turning to innovative sources of finance could result in further indebtedness.

On the multilateral trade system (SDG target 17.10), Masud Bin Momen, Permanent Representative of Bangladesh to the UN, commented that economic globalization has suffered a setback with the rise of inward-looking and protectionist tendencies. Lead discussant Kavaljit Singh, Madhyam, warned that poor countries could become “collateral damage” in a global trade war, and the EU emphasized that an open, rules-based trade system can strengthen SDG implementation.

Several panelists commented on the role of technology in development (SDG targets 17.6, 17.7 and 17.8). Bin Momen pointed to its transformative potential. Panelist Robin Ogilvy, Special Representative, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), stressed the importance of researching how digitalization is influencing policy choices. Panelist Alfred Watkins, Global Solutions Summit, stated that, while cost-effective technological solutions to sustainable development exist, technology deployment measures are missing.

The HLPF Background Note further elaborates on the threat of trade barriers, noting these could have potentially large repercussions, especially for developing economies, and that persistently high levels of inequality also pose challenges for sustainable development. The background note reports a renewed increase in global carbon emissions in 2017, which, it argues, shows that the global system continues to be unable to align investment with long-term sustainable development objectives.

In 2017, ODA as a share of donors’ gross national income (GNI) was nowhere near the UN benchmark of at least 0.7% of GNI, with overall levels remaining low at 0.31%. Only Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and the UK met or exceeded the UN benchmark.

On improving domestic capacity for tax and other revenue collection (SDG 17.1), the background note reports that the rate of taxation has declined in LDCs and sub-Saharan Africa in recent years. Foreign direct investment (FDI) to LDCs declined by 11% between 2016 and 2017. Global remittances by international migrants to their countries of origin also declined somewhat, due to stricter immigration policies adopted by destination countries.

The Declaration addresses the impacts of climate change, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, climate change displacement and security, climate change finance, climate change and the marine environment, and regional initiatives.

High-level representatives from American Samoa, Samoa, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu and the Territorial Assembly of Wallis and Futuna participated in the Polynesian Leaders Group’s Sautalaga (open discussion) on the implications of climate change in the region. The meeting convened from 28-29 June in Tuvalu.

On the impacts of climate change, leaders express deep concern at the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) draft report on the risks to small island developing States (SIDS) and territories, including marine ecosystem impacts, sea level rise and extreme weather events. Leaders observe that these risks threaten the survival of island communities, particularly those living on coral atolls, and note with alarm that current global efforts to combat climate change are insufficient to secure the 1.5 degree Celsius limit.

On GHG emissions, leaders urgently call on all nations and their communities to “take dramatic steps to reduce GHG emissions,” including through significantly raising the ambition of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Leaders note that their GHG emissions are “very low” but commit to a low GHG emission development pathway and reaffirm support for the Regional Pacific NDC Hub.

They look forward to the completion of the Paris Agreement Implementation Guidelines, noting there should be “a complete package on the implementation of all elements of the Paris Agreement” and should include Loss and Damage. Leaders call for, inter alia: decarbonizing the global economy and transitioning to a low carbon, renewable energy and energy efficient development pathway; eliminating “unfair trade practices” that make such decarbonization difficult; and phasing out the use of coal in the power sector.

Leaders confirm that their territorial boundaries under UNCLOS shall remain unchanged despite sea level rise.

On climate change displacement and security, leaders express deep alarm at the growing number of people displaced by climate impacts. Noting that people displaced by such events who are forced to cross national borders are not defined as refugees, leaders call for a legal regime to protect people displaced by climate change and support Tuvalu’s efforts to seek legal protection for people displaced by climate change through a UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution. They encourage the UN Secretary-General to appoint a special advisor on climate change and security and a special rapporteur to the UN Security Council to report on security threats caused by climate change. Leaders further call for, inter alia: establishing a ‘Grand Coalition of Pacific Leaders on Climate Change Displacement and Migration’ to find regional solutions to climate change-related displacement and migration. Leaders confirm that their territorial boundaries under the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) shall “remain unchanged despite the effects of sea level rise.”

On climate change finance, leaders note with concern the costs of climate change-related severe weather events that cause devastation and loss of lives in the region and welcome the Task Force of the Pacific Island Climate Change Insurance Facility (PICCIF) and encourage it to expedite its work. They further encourage eligible Polynesian countries to develop Green Climate Fund (GCF) Country Programmes while also respecting the principle of leaving no one behind.

On climate change and the marine environment, leaders note climate change’s “devastating impacts” on the marine environment, particularly the health of coral reefs in the region, and call for Pacific-wide collaboration to “locate, study, manage and conserve heat-resilient coral communities, or ‘Super Reefs.’ Leaders commit to review the Pacific Marine Climate Change Report Card and how it can be effectively used.

Leaders express deep concern on climate impacts on the distribution and abundance of tuna in the Pacific Island region and encourage plans by Conservation International, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) and the Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) to develop a greater understanding of these effects and to develop adaptation strategies to protect tuna stocks.

On regional initiatives, leaders commit to give serious consideration to the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme’s (SPREP) Integrated Ocean Governance and Health Oceans Programme and welcome efforts by the Pacific Island Forum Secretariat to develop regional policy initiatives that link oceans and climate change.

134,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/twi2050-assays-global-transformations-for-the-sdgs/,"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,TWI2050 Assesses Global Transformations for the SDGs,"12 July 2018: On the sidelines of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), The World in 2050 Initiative (TWI2050) launched its first report exploring transformational pathways to attain the SDGs. The report is based on the premises that no science-based pathways exist for successfully achieving all the SDGs simultaneously, and the global transformations necessary to achieve the Goals urgently need a “robust scientific foundation and fact-based way forward.”

The report titled, ‘Transformations to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,’ notes that attaining the SDGs by 2030 requires “deep transformation” at all levels and across all areas of human activity, new social values and norms, and changes in “individual belief systems” that shape attitudes and behaviors. It shows that transformation towards a sustainable future is possible, but ambitious action is needed “now.” This calls for, inter alia, investing in future priorities such as high-quality schools, improved health systems, efficiency and zero-carbon energy, environmental conservation and restoration, better food systems, more sustainable lifestyles, good governance institutions, and global cooperation initiatives to leverage dynamics towards the implementation of the SDGs.

The report identifies major sustainable development challenges that are described by the SDGs, namely:

many people are trapped in an extreme poverty that is multidimensional, and have high and rising inequalities of income, employment and social status;

human activity is degrading the physical environment and the global commons;

demographic stresses are arising from high fertility rates (mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of the Middle East), rapid urbanization (especially in Africa and parts of Asia) and rapid aging; and

weak and bad governance, failing institutions, a rise in nationalism in many countries and regions, intensifying international conflicts, and eroding multilateral systems are undermining the local, national and global capacities to implement the 2030 Agenda.

The publication also outlines the need to move beyond the sectoral and fragmented approach, and it focuses on six “exemplary transformations” needed to achieve the SDGs by 2030. Those are: human capacity and demography; consumption and production; decarbonization and energy; food, biosphere, and water; smart cities; and digital revolution. The report also emphasizes the need to link these transformations with governance considerations, arguing that transformations require governance structures and capabilities, political action, and the formation of actors of change at local, national and global levels.

During the report’s launch event on 12 July, Jeffrey Sachs, Director, Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), outlined the importance of making governance work and of “re-establishing planning,” since, he said, there is currently “no planning” in much of the world, and a lack of capacity to think ahead. Alessandra Casazza, UN Development Programme (UNDP), explained that in many African countries, for example, planning systems need to be modernized, but governments favor incremental changes to “drastic changes,” and budgets are often based on sectoral approaches. She added that some countries are starting to adopt program-based budgeting and other cross-sectoral approaches, but their effectiveness requires political will and leadership, in addition to capacity.

Among elements the report should consider in the future, participants noted the need to assess the financial resources required to implement the “transformations” identified. Others called for examining the transformations needed at the country level, and for relying not only on models, but on other approaches as well. Nebojsa Nakicenovic, Deputy Director General, International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), remarked that a 2019 edition of the report could be complementary to the Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR), also scheduled to be released in 2019.

Prepared by more than 60 authors and 20 organizations, TWI2050 uses a framework that allows modeling and analytical groups, such as integrated assessment and Earth system modelers, to explore jointly a series of measures needed to achieve all the SDGs, while accounting for synergies and trade-offs.

TWI2050 is a global research initiative that seeks to “provide the fact-based knowledge” to support the policy process and implementation of the SDGs, and to address “transformational challenges” related to achieving the 17 SDGs “in an integrated manner.” The initiative brings together a network of more than 150 participants including leading policymakers, businesses, modeling and analytical teams from around the world. It was launched in 2015 by IIASA, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), and the Stockholm Resilience Centre (SRC).

The population of Nigeria is on the spiral with an estimation of about 198 million people and a land area of 923.768 kilometres, and also annual precipitation of 1,150 mm (4000mm in the South to 350 mm in the North, Nigeria has a water resources potential of 370 Billion Cubic metres made up of 287 BCM/year generated internally and 88 BCM from trans boundary sources.

Indeed, Nigeria is not a water poor country but it is a fact that subsequent administrations have made it a point to inequitably distribute investments in the sector and other challenges in the water sector which could therefore be regarded as potentially water stressed.

Presently, the total demand for water supply, agriculture, livestock, and aquaculture livestock is estimated at about 80 BCM/year but it is expected to surpass 160BCM/year by 2030 if the current effort at revitalising the sector is sustained.

Challenges in the water resources sector

It is interesting and at the same time no longer news that Nigeria was unable to attain the MDG targets for access to water supply and sanitation mainly due to poor investments, low capacity and other challenges in the water resources sector. As at 2015, the National Access to potable water and adequate sanitation was 69 and 29 per cents respectively with national access to pipe borne water supply only 7%.

Again , it is estimated that about $5.0 Billion annual investments will be required to meet the SDG targets in with the current level of investments at less than half a billion Dollars

This sectorial challenges and successes were brought to the fore when the Nigerian Academy of Engineering which provides a platform for harnessing technological resources and making inputs to national developmental process at the highest level of Governance made an invite to one of their members and current Minister of Water Resources Engineer Suleiman Adamu to throw more light on ‘Current Developments in Nigeria’s Water Sector’. Even as Adamu painted a brighter future, the revelations and challenges occasioned by neglect and U – turn from the original mandate of the agencies in the water sector was mind boggling.

The Minister who assumed office in 2015 threw light on the status of the sector and current developments in the last two and half years as he itemised the teething problems that has now challenged the Ministry to revitalise this very important sector that can spur the much touted agricultural revolution.

Strikingly, there were 11 very important challenges he raised to include; Inadequate Policy Issues, Poor funding/low budgetary provisions, Absence of effective legal framework, Institutional and human capacity weaknesses and lack of political will/delays in budgetary appropriation by the legislature. Others are arbitrary budgetary allocations by the legislature, poor investment by state Governments, Lack of enabling environment for private sector participation, poor revenue generation and inadequate cost recovery for services, inadequate power supply, and lack of ownership of water facilities by beneficiary communities and poor operations and maintenance culture.

It could be of interest to note from Adamu’s expose that as at 2015, the “only potent policy document for the water sector is the National Water resources master plan developed with a grant assistance from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The document reviewed and made recommendations on how to best harness the water resources of Nigeria with respect to institutional development, water supply, food security.

Unfortunately, the very important aspect of developing the water resources has not been aligned with the plan while most of the projects embarked therein were not properly planned or not adequately funded which lead to several projects littering the country but abandoned.

Documents from the Ministry reveal that within the same period there were 116 large projects including irrigation 37, Dams 38, Water supply 41 , many of which were abandoned or in comatose state due to the fact that they require review of cost or lacked consistent funding for completion. From the document review, most of the projects had attained 40 – 60 per cent level of completion with outstanding liabilities totalling N88, 848,112,579.77 and requiring additional contractual commitment to completion to the tune of N264, 990,081,982.53.

One robust policy the Fellow of Nigerian Society of Engineers believes can further stimulate positive developments in the sector is a document that will guide the activities of the sector “The National Water Resources Bill and National Water Resources Policy were in limbo, there was no irrigation and drainage policy. The National water supply and sanitation Policy adopted in 2000 needed critical review. Strikingly the National Water Resources Bill had been under preparation since 2006 but has not seen the light of the day”

In what he described as institutional lapses and inadequacies, Adamu faulted that the “deployment of human resources, technical capacity, planning, design and contract administrations of projects, areas of data generation and management. Important departments such as planning, research and statistics, River Basin Development operations and inspectorates were headed by non-technical personnel and could not therefore adequately deal with challenges at hand”

Daily water demand

Although out-dated, the National Water Supply and sanitation Policy puts the daily water demand for urban dwellers at 120 litre/capita/day, semi urban (small towns) at 60litres and Rural dwellers at 30 litres a day, it may be of interest to note the national coverage as at 2015 was 69 per cent comprising of urban: 80 per cent (small towns): 68 % and Rural: 60%. By implication 31% or 52.7 million Nigerians did not have access to water supply, with high concentration in the rural areas. Therefore, since the country was also not able to meet the MDGs target on access to water supply, it has therefore become necessary that concerted efforts must be put in place to alleviate the problem and improve the trend towards achieving 100% access to water supply by 2030 if viewed in line with the newly adopted United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the estimation that the population could grow to 257 million by that time.

Another worrisome issue is that fact that pipe-borne water supply in the urban areas has continued on the downward trend especially in the urban areas from 30% national coverage in 1990 to about 7% in 2015. The Water Resources Minister Adamu therefor explains that after the unpleasant revelation it became necessary that an aggressive effort to address the situation is embarked by ensuring that all tiers of government partners to ensure radical changes and improvement in the sector.

It is also understood that sanitation has declined from 30% in 2010 to 28% in 2015. Adamu explains that “open defecation has been on the increase and there was not a single LGA in Nigeria that is free due to lack of adequate political support and poor coordination of efforts between all stakeholders in the different tiers of government”.

But it is also interesting to note that challenges of sanitation are not only limited to rural areas , it is equally a huge problem in urban settings , especially in public places and urban slums.

On irrigation, Nigeria has the potential of about 3.14 million Hectares of land suitable for irrigation out of which about 440,853Ha has been planned. Out of this, only 128,097Ha of the planned area has been developed and about 50,000Ha of the developed area lost to failed infrastructure and poor operations and maintenance. According to Adamu, “the current annual water demand for irrigation in wet and dry seasons including FADAMA lands is about 1.926BCM. This translates to about 0.7% of our internally generated potential. The total water demand for the planned irrigated area of more than 4000, 000Ha”

The Minister also confirmed that “There are over 250 large and medium dams across the country with a storage capacity o of about 30BCM/year. The storage capacity of these dams put together is more than the future demand estimated to the year 2030. Water demand analysis has shown that there is enough storage capacity in each of the 8 Hydrological Areas even without taking into consideration the large hydropower dams. Almost all the dams in the country are not utilised optimally to serve the purpose of their existence. Adamu after carefully going round the authorities came to the conclusion that” their management and operation is poor and they lack basic instrumentation gadgets. In addition poor watershed management, growing siltation of rivers and climate change are becoming a serious challenge to the storage capacities and operational efficiency of these dams and reservoirs”

sNigeria currently boasts of 12 River Basin Development Authorities at different locations. Modelled after the United States Tenesee valley Basin Development concept following the drought of the 1970s The Authorities have the primary function of serving as operators, managers and developers of water resources infrastructures within their catchments to prosperity as integrated rural development drivers in the areas of food production and employment generation. But the performance of the RBDAs over the years cannot be describe as desirable not due to technical failings but largely on account of policy and institutional inadequacies. Adamu also observed that the “unfortunate decision of the then Technical Committee on Privatisation and Commercialisation (TCPC) to strip them of their” non-water” assets in the late80s and making them solely managers of irrigation infrastructures” further deteriorated the state of the authorities. For the River Basin Authorities to survive and regain their lost glory and perform optimally to deliver the mandate of their establishment, Adamu says “they require complete restructuring to operate as technical and professional agencies with clear objectives. Therefore there were compelling needs for institutional, organisational and policy reforms that would propel the authorities to serve as effective vehicles for integrated rural development as originally envisioned”

In a bid to tackle the myriad of problems slowing the pace of development in the sector, Adamu explained that adopted “immediate and Long Term Strategies for the Water sector (2016 – 2030) easily referred to as the Water Sector Road map. The current developments being witnessed in the Ministry are being guided by the document featuring eight very important points to achieve: Conclusion of the draft national Water resources Policy, National Irrigation and drainage policy and Water resources Bill; organisation and manpower review of the Ministry towards repositioning for enhanced service delivery; Prioritising and executing the ministry’s project and programmes; developing and implementing a national irrigation development programme; Identification of dams with hydro power potentials for development ; developing and implementing a national water supply and sanitation programme to attain SDGs; developing a Blue Print and action plan to strengthen the River basin development authorities and creating partnerships as alternative sources of funding projects. Besides, the ministry has embarked on organisational reforms with a view to strengthening it. There exists now a professionalised Department of River Basin Operations and Inspectorate.

In addition to the 12 Basin Development authorities the Ministry is also administering for other agencies, Nigerian Hydrological Services Agency, National Water Resources Institute, Nigerian Integrated Water Resources Commission and Gurara Water management Agency established principally to manage the beneficial uses derived from construction of the dam, water supply, irrigation and Hydropower. Government in pursuant of the approved Road map considered Gurara Management “non-sustainable and against tradition whereby similar facilities are handed over to RBDAs for operations and management, therefore considered counterproductive, recently wound up and the responsibility of managing some of the facilities transferred to Upper Niger River Basin Development Authority.

While working towards the success of the of the Roadmap Adamu confirmed securing the approval of the National Water Resources Bill, National Water resources Policy and National Irrigation and Drainage Policy by the Federal Executive Council since September 2016. The National Water resources Bill is now before the national Assembly and when passed into law will establish water sector governance. The Bill, though not new, rather an amalgamation of Water Resources Laws that has been in existence since 2004 and being re-enacted with what the necessary modifications to actualise current global trends and best practices in Integrated Water Resources management.

Although many did not understand all about the Bill Adamu explains that “the federal Government intends to ensure through the provisions of the law that the water resources of the Nation are protected, used, developed, conserved, managed and controlled in a sustainable manner for the benefit of all person in accordance with its constitutional mandate”

According to the Minister, government having “properly diagnosed the challenges of improved access to water supply and sanitation in the country began to proffer solutions in collaboration with the state Governments who are directly responsible for the provision of potable water. Some of the solutions include initiating a programme tagged “partnership for Expanded Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (PEWASH)” as a collaborative instrument to mobilise resources and harness the efforts of government at all levels, Development Partners, Private Sector, NGOs, Philanthropists and communities towards achieving zero % open defecation and 100% access to water Supply and sanitation by 2030 in accordance with Sustainable development goals.

The report titled, ‘Finland and the 2030 Agenda: A follow-up report by CSOs,’ discusses the state of sustainable development in Finland, visions about the future, and recommendations for decision-makers at the global, national and local levels.

The report covers SDGs 6, 7, 11, 12 , 15 and 17. It explains that while the SDGs are linked, some can be at odds with each other, and recommends looking at decisions that are detrimental to sustainable development.

Regarding Goal 6 (clean water and sanitation), the report notes interlinkages with, among others, SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 5 (gender equality) and SDG 3 (good health and well-being), as investments in water and sanitation can lead to reduced health care costs. It also notes that: Finland’s investments in water sector projects have decreased by more than the cutbacks in development cooperation; water distribution networks are aging; and funding for research is lacking. (Read more on Finland’s aid decline here.) The report recommends that Finland, inter alia:

update its international strategy for the water sector;

promote private sector and local investments in the water sector;

increase international cooperation to strengthen know-how and increase the sector’s attractiveness;

ensure the sustainable use of existing water resources;

invest in more efficient water consumption, wastewater management, recycling and reuse technologies, and education and research; and

on the part of municipalities and regional governments, inform residents about water stewardship.

Regarding SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), the report notes that: Finland’s energy production is largely based on fossil fuels; the country’s fossil fuel consumption per person is more than European and global averages; and one in ten species in Finland is endangered. Globally, the report recommends that Finland: ensure an ecologically sustainable and fair energy system that functions without fossil fuels; join the Eradicating Ecocide initiative and, when necessary, criminalize conspicuous consumption; and from 2020, contribute annually to international climate funding by at least €200 million, particularly for least developed countries (LDCs).

Nationally, the report suggests that Finland set binding energy targets; harmonize licensing practices; and ban fossil energy production by 2030 and stop coal and peat use by 2025. Locally, the report calls on municipalities and provinces to: stop using coal and peat in energy produc­tion plants; begin using wood-based solutions; improve energy efficiency through economic incentives; and introduce demand-side man­agement in buildings owned by municipalities and provinces.

Regarding SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), the report recommends that, globally, Finland should: initiate a programme for “reciprocal sustainable urban development”; ensure that business activities in cities in developing countries support the well-being of residents and the environment; and encouraging less consumption, such as through a voluntary carbon tax.

Nationally, the report recommends that Finland use taxation reform to support and fund local circular and sharing economy through taxation reform. It also suggests considering expenses that future generations will have to bear when making public purchases. Local recommendations include restricting the construction sector’s ability to affect municipal decision-making.

Regarding SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), the report recommends that Finland: oblige companies to map and reduce negative impacts on human rights impacts; promote the international treaty on corporate human rights responsibilities; strengthen tax justice in Finland and the EU by requiring reporting from multinational corporations; and ensure development cooperation funds are in line with the Paris Agree­ment’s 1.5°C target.

The report explains that, by a 2017 law, public organizations can include labor rights, human rights and environmental conditions in their procurement criteria. Thus, it recommends: developing indicators that describe human well-being and the environment for monitoring state policies and budgets; making responsi­ble procurement decisions in public institutions; and halting the exploitation of child labor and forced labor from procurement chains.

Of relevance to SDG 15 (life on land), intensive forestry is threatening forest species in Finland; around 36% of threatened species live primarily in forest, and 70% of forest habitat types are threatened. However, only about 5.7% of actual forests, or productive forestland, is legally protected from logging, and the government aims to increase logging by 20%. In light of this, recommendations include:

protecting at least 17% of Finland’s forest area;

demanding corporate accountability to stop biodiversity loss;

advocating for a higher level of carbon emission targeting in the EU;

advancing activities that enhance ecosystems’ carbon sinks and storages;

halting support for peatland draining;

shifting municipal management of commercial forests to forestry without clear cutting; and

helping schools, daycare centers and educational institutions diversify learning environments and include environmental education.

Regarding SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals), the report calls for: increasing funding of civil society actors to 15% of Finland’s development cooperation; strengthening the UN’s role in international tax-related cooperation, and ensuring all countries can participate in tax system renovation; increasing Finland’s international climate funding to €200 million a year by 2020; and reinvesting carbon trade income in international development and climate funding.

Nationally, the report recommends: using the SDGs as a basis for government programming and budgeting; improving data collection and monitoring to better determine progress regarding sustainable development; and exe­cuting the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive to make aggressive tax planning illegal. Local-level recommendations include: organizing an application procedure for annual grants for environmental education and information; increasing financing of associations and citizens’ groups; and including guidance on sustainability and social responsibil­ity in procurement instructions.

The authors note that Finland’s Ministry of Finance has initiated a process to assess the national budget from a sustainable development perspective. However, Finland’s budget proposal for 2019 is expected to be estimated mainly from the climate change perspective, focusing on carbon neutrality and resource use, and they recommend widening the planning to cover other sectors.

The report recalls that Finland was one of the first countries to develop a national implementation plan (adopted in 2016 and approved by parliament in February 2017) and to define national indicators required to monitor progress on sustainable development. Finland presented a voluntary national review at the 2016 session of the HLPF, which highlighted its use of 39 national sustainable development indicators to monitor and review status and trends in sustainable development, which would be revised in line with the 2030 Agenda.. Providing an update on progress in 2017, Annika Lindblom, Secretary-General, Finland’s National Commission on Sustainable Development, noted that stakeholders from civil society, business, and the research community were involved in the definition of SDG indicators, and the follow-up and review system is anchored in the eight objectives of the ‘Society’s Commitment.’ The system is composed of ten indicator “baskets,” each of which contains four to five indicators to be updated once a year, based on inputs from authorities and the public. A monitoring platform will be made available on the sustainable development website of the Prime Minister’s office.

The 2018 SDG Index from the Sustainable Development Solutions Network and Bertelsmann Stiftung assessed Finland as one of the highest-ranking countries on the SDGs, but notes that even those face significant challenges in achieving the SDGs.

The report highlights a number of issues relevant to implementing the SDGs in South Africa, from partnerships and tools to the role of science, technology and innovation (STI).



The South African SDG Hub, housed at University of Pretoria, aims to connect South African policy makers with research and innovations for implementing the SDGs.

The report titled, ‘Implementing the SDGs in South Africa: Challenges and Opportunities,’ presents in graphs the country’s progress against the indicators for SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG 15 (life on land), SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) and SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

The report describes South Africa’s national planning, monitoring and evaluation system for the SDGs, which it says “is coherent and allows for alignment between planning, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation.” The report explains that Statistics South Africa monitors the SDGs prioritized by the national government, while the remaining Goals “will require social partners to assess relevance, provide data and agree on progress made.” The chapter also addresses promotion of citizen and multi-stakeholder engagements, expansion of youth involvement and knowledge infrastructure.

The report outlines the UN’s engagements with the Government of South Africa on the SDGs. The UN and the Government are discussing a Mainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support (MAPS) mission that will assess SDG alignment with South Africa’s Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF 2014-2019) and identify SDG Indicators Accelerators. The UN is supporting harmonization of interventions and civil society organization (CSO) accountability through convening 36 CSO alliances under an umbrella agenda, among other actions.

In addition, the UN Global Compact (UNGC) South Africa network has identified strategic action projects aligned with the SDGs, and is working to establish a national SDG institutional coordination mechanism at the provincial and local levels to drive SDG implementation throughout the country.

The report also considers the role of development partners and the role of researchers. It highlights “a large volume of research” relevant to SDG implementation, and identifies the coordination and dissemination of research on SDG implementation as a primary challenge. On STI, the report asserts that, despite considerable investments and advancement, equitable access to knowledge infrastructure remains a challenge, and South Africa is working to promote more equitable access in line with the principle of leave no one behind (LNOB).

In June, Johan Rockström and Pavan Sukhdev presented a new way of viewing the Goals, showing ‘how food connects all the SDGs.’ Inspired by this challenge to find the connections among SDGs and following recent headlines that highlight shortcomings in the food supply chain, this brief explores the food sector’s relationships with health (SDG 3), decent work (SDG 8), life below water (SDG 14) and zero hunger and sustainable agriculture (SDG 2), particularly in relation to responsible consumption and production (SDG 12).



In the US, reports that an herbicide (glyphosate) is present in common breakfast food products have stunned consumers. While similar findings have previously been made public by earlier studies that found the product in Cheerios, a US court judgment this month that awards US$289 million to a cancer patient who was exposed to high levels of the chemical has again focused global attention on glyphosate and food supply chains more broadly. In Africa and other developing country contexts, processed and nutrient-poor foods are seen as being correlated with malnutrition and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), as noted in two op-eds (here and here) on IPS News and an article on Devex.

A group of more than 25 experts, researchers and heads of organizations published an article in Agronomy for Sustainable Development calling for a “profound four-part transformation” of food systems in line with the SDGs. The first and second transformations, on healthy food and on sustainable production practices, address the issues exposed in the headlines mentioned above. They also speak to the early aspects of a four-stage approach to implementation 1) where arbitration processes must balance tensions between diverse actors’ interests and 2) governance of food systems must prioritize human development alongside resource stewardship, ecosystem health and equitable economic growth. To measure food systems’ contributions to the SDGs, the authors propose a framework that takes into account “interactions between food and nutrition security, environmental health, climate and social justice.”

SDG target 12.3 aims to halve food loss and waste by 2030. A thought piece by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) considers ways of tackling the issue, noting that each year, 1.6 billion tons of food representing over US$1 trillion in value is lost or wasted. The authors identify five key drivers of food loss and waste: awareness, supply chain infrastructure, supply chain efficiency, collaboration and policy environment. They highlight 13 initiatives that companies can take to address them, building on research by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and World Resources Institute (WRI). Companies that take on these initiatives, the article notes, will reduce their environmental footprints while achieving higher profit margins.

UK company It’s Fresh! came out with a food waste calculator, as summarized on Sustainable Brands. The calculator is aimed at households and individual consumers, to demonstrate the amount of money wasted and environmental harm caused when food goes in the trash. Generation 2030 author Mira Piel also addressed the state of food waste in Europe, noting that policy measures must acknowledge connections between multiple SDGs with regard to environmental impacts and health. She reports that at the EU level, the main policy targeting food waste is the Waste Framework Directive, which sets the framework for policy action regarding food waste until 2030, but includes only a vague definition of food waste, and postpones the introduction of a common EU methodology and legally binding reduction targets.

As with SDG 12, food plays an important role in trends that will support or undermine SDG 14. Greenpeace USA examines seafood sustainability in the tenth edition of a report titled, ‘Carting Away the Oceans.’ The report features a scorecard for major retailers’ sustainability practices in categories of policy, initiatives, labeling and transparency, and inventory (Whole Foods tops the list). Greenpeace notes an overarching theme of progress: whereas all companies profiled in the inaugural 2008 report received failing grades, 90% in the 2018 report earned passing scores. However, the report highlights, none of the profiled retailers feature comprehensive commitments to phase out single-use plastics, and many still source from seafood suppliers that have come under fire for human rights abuses in the Asia Pacific region. A summary article is available on Sustainable Brands.

SDG target 8.7 calls for immediate and effective measures to be taken to eradicate forced labor and end modern slavery, among other abuses. In May 2018, Greenpeace East Asia launched an investigative report that links human rights violations to Taiwan’s distant water fishing (DWF) fleet. Titled, ‘Misery at Sea,’ the report delves into legal and regulatory frameworks that inform the fishing industry’s low-cost business model. The publication features case studies based on interviews and other investigative reports to examine violent instances and deaths that occurred at sea, and to issue recommendations for action and systemic change. A recommended area of action is to reduce the fishing industry’s overcapacity and eliminate subsidies that contribute to this, per SDG target 14.6.

Also linking food supply chains to decent work, the recently-released 2018 Global Slavery Index examines risk factors for modern slavery in the fishing and cocoa industries. Fishing outside of national waters, dependence on distant water fishing, current practices around subsidies, significant unreported fishing and low productivity or low value of catches are all prominent risk factors that the Index notes reflect two overarching sets of drivers: national fisheries policy and wealth/institutional capacity.

In the cocoa industry, the Index applies the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) measurement framework for forced labor of children (also covered by SDG target 8.7) to help determine the prevalence of modern slavery in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. Key drivers for the industry include chronic poverty of farmers and their inability to influence the value chain, price instability of cocoa, low levels of education, and low oversight of small-scale farms. The Index also looks at global, regional and country data to show modern slavery’s prominence and trajectory. It finds that slavery is most common in Africa and the Asia Pacific region, particularly in areas marked by conflict, though “the prevalence of modern slavery in highly developed, high-income countries is higher than previously understood.” On Devex, Kelli Rogers covers “a new roadmap” for the private sector to combat slavery in its supply chains.

One potential way of improving food supply chain sustainability is through voluntary standards. Sustainable agriculture, one facet of SDG 2, may be partially achieved through such standards, as Kimberly Ann Elliott examines for the Center for Global Development. Her policy paper titled, ‘What Are We Getting from Voluntary Sustainability Standards for Coffee?’ finds that evidence remains thin for determining whether voluntary certification schemes for agricultural commodities such as coffee are indeed delivering on-the-ground impacts in terms of price farmers receive, quality of product, working conditions and environmental impacts. She does find that certification, although context-dependent, can have modest positive effects and few negative impacts, but the cost of compliance can negate economic gains.

A blog by Carol Gribnau on Hivos’s website notes that the plethora of actors in the food system need to come together to facilitate change. She outlines multi-stakeholder approaches such as Hivos’s promotion of “Food Change Labs,” describing a recent pilot in Zambia. She also describes Hivos’ 2018 Coffee Barometer, which measures the coffee sector’s sustainability.

On palm oil, a news article on Sustainable Brands notes that institutional investors representing US$6.7 trillion have called on the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) to strengthen its draft production standards. A key ingredient in not only food items, but also cosmetics and cleaning products, palm oil certified by the RSPO is a major determinant in improving agricultural practices and food sustainability, in addition to commodity production and land management (SDGs 2, 12 and 15). As the investors recognize, making progress on the range of SDGs to which the palm oil sector is connected demands both an increase of ambition to meet environmental targets and the scaling up of support to ensure that local producers are able to meet the tighter standards without compromising in areas such as decent work (SDG 8).

Commentators note that the SDG Index, a global ranking, shows Australia is performing well on health, education and well-being, but is doing poorly on environmental goals, and ranks lowest in the world on climate action. Australia is currently holding a Senate inquiry into actions for promoting SDG implementation domestically and through its aid programme.

At the domestic launch of Australia’s Voluntary National Review (VNR) in Sydney on 15 June, Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Julie Bishop, highlighted SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) as being of particular importance to Australia. She drew attention to Australia’s contribution to establishing SDG 5 as a stand-alone goal in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, its role as custodian of the Great Barrier Reef, and its status as an island continent and part of the Pacific Ocean. She launched the Australian SDGs Website developed by the Global Compact Network Australia (GCNA), which showcases sustainable development initiatives by government and allows for stakeholders to upload case studies of their SDG-related work.

The Australian Government maintains a reporting platform on the SDGs, which provides official government data on the SDG indicators. The data platform, the Australian SDGs website and the VNR report together make up the reporting package on Australia’s action on the SDGs.

The Australian SDGs Hub for Business suggests ways in which companies can explore changes to their work practices to contribute to achieving the SDGs.

Besides the Australian SDGs website, the GCNA has also established an online Australian SDGs Hub for Business. This website explains the relevance of each of the 17 SDGs to business, and suggests ways in which companies can explore changes to their work practices to contribute to achieving the SDGs.

In the lead-up to the presentation of Australia’s VNR to the HLPF, Monash University academics John Thwaites and Tahl Kestin published an article on the online portal The Conversation. Their 11 July article highlights data from the global SDG Index showing that Australia has done well on measures of health and well-being (SDG 3), and is providing good quality education (SDG 4); however, performance on the environmental goals, such as SDG 14 (life on land) is low in comparison to other countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and ranks lowest in the world on climate action (SDG 13). They call for more deliberate action by Australia, such as developing a national implementation plan and allocating specific funds for SDG implementation.

The SDG Index lists Australia in 37th place overall, a fall from its 26th place the previous year. Thwaites and Kestin explain that Australia’s performance on climate is measured not only by its domestic emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), but also by the emissions accounted for in the goods it consumes, its vulnerability to climate change, and its exports of fossil fuels. The SDG Index takes into account the “spillover” effect – the extent to which countries are promoting or impeding the ability of other countries to meet the SDGs. Based on its fossil fuel exports, Australia’s carbon emissions are estimated at 44 tonnes per person each year, more than those of Saudi Arabia (35.5 tonnes per person) or the US (710 kg per person).

142,https://www.devex.com/news/challenges-facing-sdg-2030-deadline-for-safe-water-and-sanitation-93249,"Thu, 09 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Devex,Challenges facing SDG 2030 deadline for safe water and sanitation,"CANBERRA — Under goal six of the Sustainable Development Goals, governments are committed to targets for clean water and sanitation by 2030 — including universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene.

In the lead up to a High-level Political Forum held at the United Nations in July, which discussed progress and challenges on a range of SDGs, including goal six, WaterAid Australia drew attention to the challenges of achieving the objective.

By analyzing the most recent data from the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund, which shows the percentage of the population in each nation with access to basic water and sanitation, WaterAid showed that the goal is unlikely to be achieved by 2030. The current rate of progress will see centuries before universal access to basic water and sanitation is achieved.

Further analysis of the source data, which shows progress achieved on a range of water and sanitation indicators between 2000 and 2015, suggests that only 21 countries are on target to achieve basic water and sanitation services for their entire population. Meanwhile, 68 countries have seen progress on targets decline since 2000.

The 'S word:' Is it time for the sanitation sector to reconsider subsidies? As donors and implementers grapple with how to deal with the world’s looming sanitation crisis, old debates over the use of subsidies are flaring up again. But experts told Devex of an emerging consensus that there is space for subsidies — if deployed in new and smarter ways.

Responding to environmental and political obstacles, as well as the challenges created in getting the last percentage of the population across the line for basic water and sanitation services, are barriers governments are being asked to urgently deal with, to ensure SDG 6 can be achieved.

Which countries are achieving targets?

Of the 21 countries that have achieved, or are on track to achieve, basic water and sanitation access for the entire population, only three countries classified as developed countries are expected to achieve both basic water and sanitation targets — Australia, Estonia, and Portugal.

There are also developing countries that have made major gains between 2000 and 2015, including Laos, Sri Lanka, Tokelau, and Vietnam. Based on the current rate of progress, these countries are expected to provide basic water and sanitation services for the entire population by 2030.

According to the data, Laos has been one of the biggest achievers. In 2000, less than half of the population had access to basic water and just over a quarter of the population had basic sanitation. By 2015, more than 80 percent of the population had access to basic water while almost three-quarters of the population had basic sanitation.

Based on its current rate of progress, Laos is projected to achieve national access to basic water and sanitation by 2024.

Vietnam is another success story according to the data. In 2000, almost a quarter of the population — most of them living in rural areas — were missing out on basic water access, with nearly half without basic sanitation. By 2015, more than 91 percent of the population had access to basic water, putting the country on track to achieve universal basic water access by 2025.

Now, just under 80 percent of the population has access to basic sanitation — with huge gains made in rural Vietnam. By 2028, the country is projected to achieve universal access based on current progress.

Which countries are in decline?

A concerning trend in the data is countries moving backward on access to basic water or sanitation for populations between 2000 and 2015. These include a wide range of nations: Bermuda, Jordan, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Serbia, Slovenia, and Zimbabwe.

“For every dollar spent on water and sanitation, on average $4 is returned in economic benefits, according to World Bank estimates.” — Tom Muller, director of policy and programs for WaterAid Australia

In 2000, Papua New Guinea had enabled 36.7 percent of its population to access basic water and 18.7 percent basic sanitation. By 2015, this number had declined to 36.6 percent and 18.6 percent respectively — small declines by percentage but major barriers to achieving universal basic and water access by 2030.

Other countries started 2000 with a major percentage of their population having accessible water and sanitation, only to drop.

In 2000, Nieu, for example, was providing more than 99.2 percent of its population with access to basic water and 100 percent of its population with access to basic sanitation. Fifteen years later they had both declined — basic water coverage declined to 98.2 percent and basic sanitation to 97.8 percent.

In 2004, Nieu was hit by the worst cyclone on its record, Cyclone Heta, which is likely to have played a role in the decline of water and sanitation. This demonstrates the challenges of natural disasters, conflict, and more, in the ability to achieve the 2030 targets.

Where is progress slow?

For other countries, barriers come from two key challenges: Starting from a low base or slow progress in achieving the final percentage points.

Equatorial Guinea’s population coverage of basic water rose from 48.9 percent in 2000 to 49.6 percent in 2015 — an average improvement of 0.05 percent each year. Based on this rate of progress, Equatorial Guinea will achieve national coverage for basic water by 3119.

The challenge for Equatorial Guinea is in rural areas. While water coverage for urban regions is dramatically improving — with total coverage expected to be reached by 2037 in urban areas — coverage is worsening in rural areas, dropping from 39.9 percent coverage in 2000 to 30.5 percent in 2015. For basic sanitation, the entire nation is moving backward.

Why you should care about 'systems' in WASH The focus in the water, sanitation, and hygiene sector needs to shift from the number of pumps or latrines built to a more sustainable, systems-wide approach, according to many insiders. Enter Agenda for Change, a coalition of organizations that seek to demonstrate how this can be done through collective action.

Similarly, Eritrea has a long road ahead. Beginning in 2000, data shows just 16.8 percent of the nation had access to basic water and 7.5 percent access to basic sanitation. By 2015, these numbers had improved, increasing to 19.3 percent and 11.2 percent respectively. But this slow rate of improvement projects that basic water will be provided to the entire population by 2507 and basic sanitation by 2374.

For Vanuatu, the rate of progress on water will see the country just miss the 2030 deadline. Vanuatu is projected to achieve national coverage by 2031. Just over half the population had access to appropriate facilities for basic sanitation in 2015, but with an annual progress of 0.2 percent, the country is projected to achieve basic sanitation targets by 3468.

These three nations also face other challenges.

Equatorial Guinea faces political challenges under the dictatorship of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo who seized control of the country in a 1979 military coup. Eritrea has faced conflict with neighboring countries, U.N. sanctions, and droughts. And Vanuatu faces the impact of natural disasters, with Cyclone Pam causing widespread devastation in 2015, as well as the high cost of delivering services to the Pacific region.

At the time the data was collected, Puerto Rico was struggling to provide basic services to the last 3 percent of its population, in both water and sanitation. In 2015, basic water coverage had increased from 97.1 percent to 97.1. Yet, because the annual rate of growth averaged 0.003 percent, Puerto Rico was predicted basic national water access by 2773, with basic sanitation predicted by 2443. The data does not take into account the impact of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico last year, on basic water and sanitation availability.

Despite national basic water coverage, 1 percent of Germany’s population has no access to basic sanitation. The country’s slow rate of progress means universal coverage is projected by 3753.

Belgium too struggles with slow progress. While nearly the entire population has access to water now, national basic sanitation is projected to be achieved by 4817.

Addressing the challenges

Achieving universal basic water and sanitation services by 2030 are hampered by a range of local factors. Although projections show the challenging road ahead for water and sanitation, they do not factor in additional challenges — such as future natural disasters, conflicts, and economic crises — have in achieving universal access targets.

Top employers in water, sanitation, and hygiene: A primer 663 million people still don't have access to clean and safe water, and 1 in 3 people don't have a decent toilet. WASH sector NGOs, intergovernmental organizations, and private consultants are all crucial players in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6. Check out this Devex roundup of some of the biggest employers in WASH to find out if any are right for you.

With data at hand showing the gravity of the challenge, it is hoped that better practices might be developed, through planning and policy, to support universal access. By breaking the data down into in rural and urban coverage, it becomes evident where they exist: Commonly in rural areas.

At the conclusion of a High-level Political Forum, former President of the U.N. Economic and Social Council Marie Chatardová spoke on the challenges of water and sanitation coverage.

“We … held extensive discussions on the SDG 6 on water, 7 on energy, 11 on cities, 12 on sustainable consumption and production, 15 on life on land, and 17 on partnerships,” she said.

“We came up with many recommendations … Those include establishing a ‘blue fund’ to support design and implementation of transboundary water management for SDG 6.”

She highlighted the importance of partnering with the private sector and other new partners to achieve the goals. But whether the outcomes of the High-level Political Forum, including delivery of the proposed blue fund, will achieve significant changes in the projections is yet to be seen.

“For nations to be years off track in meeting the human right to water and sanitation is shocking,” said Tom Muller, director of policy and programs for WaterAid Australia, prior to the political forum.

“The meeting of ministers at HLPF must result in more than just words of encouragement because we have only 12 years left to keep the promise made to those living without clean water or a decent toilet. Governments must prioritise water, sanitation and hygiene — the basic building blocks of any stable and prosperous community — ensuring proper financing is put in place to build a more sustainable country today and for future generations,” he said.

WaterAid is calling on governments, donors, financial institutions, and the private sector to prioritize financing for water and sanitation and to integrate the provision of water, sanitation, and hygiene into strategies for education, health, and nutrition programs globally.

Experts are calling for more investment into research and programs to tackle stigma and barriers surrounding issues of sanitation.

“For every dollar spent on water and sanitation, on average $4 is returned in economic benefits, according to World Bank estimates,” Muller said.

With one child dying every two minutes from diarrhea caused by dirty water, poor sanitation, and bad hygiene, according to WaterAid, more than a quarter of million children will die each year basic water and sanitation targets are not met — a figure unacceptable to both Muller and the objectives of the SDGs.

The report is based on data from 79 countries, and finds that only 59% of domestic wastewater flow is collected and safely treated, and insufficient information is available for estimates of industrial wastewater treatment.



SDG target 6.3 sets out several objectives for improving water quality, including halving the proportion of untreated wastewater, and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse of water. An indicator for this target (6.3.1) measures “Proportion of wastewater safely treated,” through two sub-indicators on domestic and industrial wastewater (SDG indicators 6.3.1a and 6.3.1b, respectively).

The report explains the methodology used to develop the global baseline on wastewater, and provides definitions of the terms used in the sub-indicators on domestic and industrial wastewater. The authors caution that their findings probably represent the “upper limit” of current achievements, as the data come mostly from high-income and middle-income countries, and likely do not reflect the situation in many Asian and African countries.

The report draws attention to the contributions of SDG target 6.3, if achieved, to other elements of the 2030 Agenda.

The agencies highlight that many millions of people are at risk from contaminated water, and urge policy makers to regulate and enforce pollution control measures. They emphasize the need to better harmonize reporting on this issue through the application of common metrics.

The report also draws attention to the contribution of SDG target 6.3, if achieved, to other elements of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, for example, in relation to drinking water, sanitation, and water-use efficiency (SDG targets 6.1, 6.2, and 6.4, respectively), reduction of waterborne diseases (SDG target 3.3), water availability to boost food production (SDG target 2.4), nutrition (SDG target 2.2), and sustainable urbanization (SDG target 11.2).

The report recommends using the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) codes to identify heavy polluters, pollution sources, and types of pollution as a basis for applying the “polluter pays” principle, especially with regard to industrial pollution. It also proposes an additional SDG indicator to capture the extent of wastewater reuse.

The wastewater baseline report was one of seven such studies launched by UN-Water at World Water Week 2018 in Stockholm, Sweden. It was prepared under the UN-Water Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6, which brings together three complementary initiatives: WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP), Integrated Monitoring of Water and Sanitation-Related SDG Targets (GEMI), and UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS).

The publication titled, ‘The SDGs and Cities: International Human Mobility,’ provides an overview of cities’ various strategies, initiatives and efforts. It includes a practical tool with 13 possible lines of action to be implemented by local governments to deal with international human mobility from a human rights perspective, and emphasizes social participation and the systematic production of information.

The 13-part practical tool focuses on migrant and refugee populations in vulnerable situations.

The tool aims to advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by facilitating, promoting and replicating implementation of local public policies aimed at helping migrants and refugees. It focuses on migrant and refugee populations in vulnerable situations, and aims to enhance and promote the exchange of experiences and best practices regarding international human mobility in LAC cities.

According to the report, almost 80% of Latin American population lives in cities. The study notes that the proportion of the immigrant population is higher in cities as migrants tend to settle in large urban areas. This causes difficulties for local authorities to implement policies for integrating new inhabitants, related to the lack of resources, services and technical capacity.

The Handbook describes 13 actions, relevant implementation strategies, reasons such actions are needed, indicators and targets associated with SDGs 10 (reduced inequalities), 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), 4 (quality education), 3 (good health and well-being), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 5 (gender equality) and 11 (sustainable cities and communities). The actions include:

Guarantee access of migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees to public policy-making processes (SDG targets 10.7 and 16.7);

Create a specific institution for caring for, receiving and integrating them (SDG targets 10.7, 16.6 and 16.b);

Provide training for local governments, focusing on rights (SDG targets 10.2, 10.7 and 16.b);

Develop anti-discriminatory campaigns that underscore “interculturality” for human and sustainable development (SDG targets 10.7 and 16.b);

Implement programmes that grant local identification and improve access to housing, health and education (SDG targets 10.2, 10.7, 11.1 and 16.9);

Complement curricula in schools and teacher training colleges with intercultural and bilingual education (SDG targets 4.1 and 10.7);

Develop skills improvement programmes (SDG targets 8.7, 8.8 and 10.7);

Implement programmes to care for women migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees that are victims of gender violence, and design strategies to raise awareness about this problem (SDG targets 5.1, 5.2, 10.7 and 16.1); and

Provide cultural mediators and interpreters for health and healthcare services (SDG targets 3.8 and 10.7).

Between 2000 and 2015, the number of international migrants worldwide increased from 173 million to 244 million. Around nine million international migrants live in LAC countries. International and regional organizations are advancing an agenda to promote safe migration and respect for migrants’ rights through the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, which will be adopted in December 2018 in Marrakesh, Morocco.

The Handbook was prepared in response to the global phenomenon of human mobility in urban areas. The UNESCO Regional Office for Science in LAC and the LAC Coalition of Cities against Racism, Discrimination and Xenophobia collaborated with ICPHR-UNESCO on the Handbook.

146,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-water-unep-report-details-progress-on-iwrm-implementation/,"Thu, 30 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"UN-Water, UNEP Report Details Progress on IWRM Implementation","26 August 2018: UN-Water and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) have published a report detailing progress made on implementation of integrated water resources management (IWRM), as measured by SDG indicator 6.5.1 (degree of IWRM implementation). Launched at World Water Week 2018 in Stockholm, Sweden, the report finds that IWRM provides a critical framework for achieving SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), as well as all other SDGs.

The report, serving as a “global baseline” for the indicator, presents a snapshot of the current state of affairs on water management, and emphasizes the need to accelerate progress. The report is the result of a participatory approach in which representatives from different sectors and regions responded to a questionnaire. It describes the efforts of 172 countries to implement IWRM, including successes and challenges, as well as coordination and collaboration beyond monitoring. According to the report, IWRM provides multiple benefits, including sustainable and efficient agriculture, economic stability, ecosystem protection, and peace and security. However, the publication concludes, without accelerating progress, 60% of countries are unlikely to achieve SDG target 6.5 on implementing IWRM at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation, by 2030.

As 80% of countries have already laid the foundations for IWRM, the report calls for focusing on implementation, accelerating its implementation, and taking collective action that builds on multi-stakeholder monitoring and reporting processes to accelerate implementation.

The report cites the challenges of developing a network of policies and laws that create an enabling environment, coordinating diverse players with different and often competing interests, generating data to make effective decisions, and securing the financing to implement plans. It highlights that while subnational, basin, aquifer and local levels tend to lag behind national-level implementation, multi-level coordination is critical, and many countries have arrangements and organizational frameworks for cooperation in most of their transboundary basins and aquifers.

The UN-Water Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6 supports countries’ efforts to monitor water and sanitation across sectors, compile data to report on global progress and achieve SDG 6.

Regarding wider implementation across sectors, the report calls for: adopting integrated approaches to water supply and wastewater treatment measures; identifying opportunities to integrate water into sectoral programmes and planning processes; and finding and adopting innovative, blended and multi-sector financing approaches to achieve sustainable water resources management under the 2030 Agenda. The report underscores that IWRM is an ongoing process with incremental impacts, and each country can identify pathways to make progress, as no “one-size-fits-all” approach exists for IWRM implementation.

The publication provides an overview of areas requiring action to advance sustainable management of water resources as identified by countries, including improving basin and aquifer management, financial arrangements and capacity development. The report also mentions specific actions highlighted by countries, including increasing monitoring stations, improving enforcement mechanisms and increasing cost recovery for water-related services.

Reporting from countries on SDG 6 core indicators provides a platform for dialogue on strengthening water resources management across sectors and stakeholders, and on identifying specific needs for capacity development, technology transfer and investments.

The report is one in a seven-report series launched by UN-Water that tracks progress towards SDG 6 targets using the SDG global indicators under the UN-Water Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6, which brings together the: World Health Organization (WHO)/UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP); Integrated Monitoring of Water and Sanitation-Related SDG Targets (GEMI); and UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS). The collaboration supports countries’ efforts to monitor water and sanitation across sectors, compile data to report on global progress, and ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030.

Leading Locally, Achieving Together","With the vision “to build a Resilient Navakavu – O Navakavu Qoi!” the Navakavu Revitalization Strategy 2018-2022 (NRS) was a timely development framework for the Yavusa vakaturaga o Navakavu, a traditional Fijian unit, which comprise of five villages – Muaivuso, Nabaka, Waiqanake, Namakala and Ucuinamono. It is a leading example of how local governance structures are helping to meet national and international development frameworks and priorities.

With the mission to revitalize, strengthen and position Navakavu to engage in opportunities for growth and prosperity for a transformed Fiji, the NRS is linked to the Fiji National Development Plan 2017-2021 (NDP) and the Sustainable Development Goals 2016-2030 (SDGs). The NRS was officially launched by the Prime Minister of Fiji and President of UNFCCC COP 23 Honourable Josaia V Bainimarama on 6 June 2018, at the Novotel Conference Centre. In a statement supporting the NRS mission, he said:

“… [W]e recognize that there is immense opportunity in a growing Fijian economy, and we want to put the Yavusa o Navakavu in the best possible position to realize those opportunities… Today marks the beginning of your conference to launch the Navakavu Revitalization Plan from 2018-2022, a plan that builds upon the strategic blueprint laid out in Fiji’s five-year and 20-year National Development Plan….I applaud your community for coming together to determine how you can capitalize on all the great progress and all the new opportunity that has come to Fiji. Because a government alone can only do so much. It can create a favorable environment, but it is up to individuals to take advantage…]”

The five NRS Strategic Goals that link to the Fiji NDP and SDGs address, inter alia, employment, housing, education, health, land, and infrastructure. The NRS strategic goals show how national development plans (the NDP) as well as international development roadmaps (the SDGs) can be implemented at the local level in a way that reflects local needs and priorities.

The five NRS Strategic Goals address employment, housing, education, health, land and infrastructure.

The NRS launch coincided with the 21st Anniversary of the Navakavu Marine Protected Area (NMPA), which is helping to meet the targets of the SDG on life below water (SDG 14), among others. The NMPA is a joint initiative led by the Vanua o Navakavu with the close support and assistance of the Institute of Applied Science (IAS) of the University of the South Pacific (USP) and the Fiji Locally Managed Marine Areas Network (FLMMA). In Navakavu, there is a local Committee comprised of family unit heads that has worked to increase awareness of the need for, and the implementation of, strategies for fisheries conservation and the sustainable use of marine resources in the area.

The paramount chief of Navakavu, the Goneturaga Na Rokobaleni, and His Council have approved the commencement for the gazetting of the Navakavu Marine Protection Area to platform its long-term plan of a Live Marine/Science Laboratory, which would serve as an initiative integrating conservation, education and tourism objectives. Community discussions are underway on this “Navakavu Reef to Ridge Initiative.” It covers an area of some 3.3 square km, which is equivalent to approximately 18% of the community fishing ground area of 18.5 square km.

Local efforts are also targeting youth to ensure longevity and the intergenerational reach of projects. On 29 June 2018, the Minister for Youth and Sports, Hon Laisenia B Tuitubou, was the Chief Guest with the Navakavu Youth in commemorating the World Oceans Day. The paramount chief and his Council joined the youth together with officials from the Ministry of Fisheries, Ministry of Forestry, FLMMA network and Pacific Islands Association of Non-Government Organisation (PIANGO).

The commemoration of the Navakavu Youth World Oceans Day is in line with the Goals under the Sustainable Development Goals, the Fiji National Development Plan, the Plan for the Yasana o Rewa, the Tikina o Suva and Goal 4 of the Navakavu Revitalization Strategy 2018-2022.

The children and youth replanted mangroves and native trees to celebrate the day and plans are in place to clean up rubbish from our land and our beaches and our ocean. The youth and children have taken leadership as custodians of our Ocean. They too feel this moral obligation, as we are all committed to this sacred responsibility.

TCAP is helping the Government of Tuvalu to better manage the risks of coastal hazards by: implementing measures that reduce the impacts of climate-induced sea level rise and intensifying storm events on infrastructure; developing a long-term coastal adaptation strategy; building the capacity of national and local authorities to better implement adaptation actions; and investing in youth. Specifically, the project focuses on: strengthening institutions, human resources, awareness and knowledge for resilient coastal management; reducing the vulnerability of critical coastal infrastructure to wave-induced damages, including homes, schools and hospitals; and establishing a sustainable financing mechanism for long-term adaptation efforts.

The project focuses on three of Tuvalu’s nine inhabited islands, which have 2,780 meters of high-value vulnerable coastline.

TCAP builds on existing initiatives, and uses a range of measures for coastal protection, such as ecosystem initiatives, beach nourishment, concrete and rock revetments, and sea walls.

Checkpoint communiqués from Malta and Qatar followed Germany’s communiqué.

The ABS Clearing-House is a global repository of information that helps provide legal certainty and transparency in the context of the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). The ABS Clearing-House, inter alia, enables countries to monitor how genetic resources are used along the value chain for commercial or non-commercial research, which is valuable especially when genetic resources have left the country.

The Nagoya Protocol monitoring system provides “an important tool for connecting users and providers of genetic resources.”

The checkpoint communiqués from Germany and Malta mark the first time the ABS interoperability functions were used to automatically publish information on the ABS Clearing-House: information published on EU’s DECLARE tool – an EU-wide tool that enables users of genetic resources to submit the required due diligence declarations – was automatically transferred and published on the ABS Clearing-House.

Using interoperability mechanisms like the application programming interface of the ABS Clearing-House supports Parties to the Nagoya Protocol in automating the publication of information on the Clearing-House.

150,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/india-presents-the-first-bonn-challenge-country-progress-report/,"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,India Presents the First Bonn Challenge Country Progress Report,"14 August 2018: India has published the first-ever country progress report under the Bonn Challenge on forest landscape restoration, which concludes that the country is on track to achieve its pledge of restoring 13 million hectares of degraded land by 2020 and an additional 8 million hectares by 2030.

The report titled, ‘Bonn Challenge and India: Progress on Restoration Efforts across States and Landscapes,’ is co-published by the India Country Office of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and India’s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.

Based on a survey of secondary data on interventions by government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOS) and the private sector, the report states that India restored approximately 9.8 million hectares of degraded land between 2011 and 2017, with nearly 95% of the restoration activities reported being led by government agencies. Despite the limited data on private sector and NGO restoration efforts, the report emphasizes the vital role that all stakeholders play in the planning and implementation of restoration programmes, highlighting NGOs’ technical expertise and knowledge of local conditions and private companies’ financing capacity.

Among “transformational changes” brought about by public restoration programmes, the report notes increased biodiversity and forest productivity linked to the Joint Forest Management Committee (JFMC) approach. Some of the benefits listed include the creation of livelihood opportunities in remote areas by linking villages to markets for sale of non-timber forest products, better irrigation facilities for crop production, and improved transport and health care facilities. Moreover, the report notes that by providing villagers with opportunities to participate in micro-plans, the JFMC model has “ushered in a new era of forest protection in the country” by successfully involving communities in the protection and sustainable harvesting of natural resources and bringing in expertise and aligned interests of multiple stakeholders in forest restoration, “thereby making it socially more inclusive.”

The Joint Forest Management Committee model has “ushered in a new era of forest protection in the country” by making forest restoration “socially more inclusive.”

On the role of the private sector, the report analyzes submissions by 11 private companies, noting that many afforestation and restoration activities undertaken by private companies are often a result of legal compliance, or form part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) obligations. The report finds that out of the total 193,290.3 hectares of land restored and afforested by the surveyed private companies, around 97% was under mixed plantations containing fast-growing exotic tree species as well as cash crops. It calls for “a more bio-centric approach” to motivate private companies to adopt more sustainable and ecological models of restoration based on native species that are adapted to local conditions and better suited to the recovery of faunal diversity.

Drawing on 14 submitted contributions by NGOs, the report notes that this sector plays a “small but active role” in the restoration of degraded lands, including unique and threatened ecosystems such as grasslands and mangroves. Of the total 352,677.9 hectares restored by the surveyed NGOs, the report notes that a total of 322,610.9 hectares (91.5%) was restored using mixed plantation model, while 8.5% of restoration activities were based on using a mono plantation model, mainly in coastal areas planted with mangrove.

The report draws on five case studies across seven states “that have all the indicators of a good restoration model” with a view to promoting broader learning and upscaling of restoration efforts. The case studies highlight different approaches and partnership arrangements, including from a government-funded joint forest management committee in Nagaland, NGO-led grassland and rainforest projects in Gujarat and Valparai respectively, and efforts by Tata Power to reverse environmental degradation in Lonavala region caused by the construction of the Valvan Dam.

While concluding that India is appropriately positioned to meet its restoration commitments under the Bonn Challenge, the report notes that additional efforts are needed to comprehensively capture the restoration efforts being undertaken by all actors in future stocktaking reports. The report further emphasizes the importance of verifying the quality of reported restoration efforts through the adoption of a robust monitoring, evaluation and learning system, and recommends that better use be made of NGOs’ technical knowledge and use of scientifically robust monitoring protocols to support such efforts.

Noting overall progress towards forest landscape restoration goals across the region, IUCN observes that at the first Bonn Challenge roundtable in Asia, held in May 2017 in Palembang, Indonesia, restoration pledges crossed the 150 million hectare milestone.

The Bonn Challenge is a global effort to bring 150 million hectares of deforested and degraded land into restoration by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030.

Prior to 1991, the USSR and Iran shared control of the sea.

The five countries reached the deal, known as the Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea, on 12 August 2018 during the Caspian Sea Summit in Akta, Kazakhstan. One major point of contention leading up to the Summit was whether to define the Caspian Sea as a lake, meaning it would be divided equally between all five countries, or as a sea, which would then be governed by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The agreement divides the seabed into territorial zones (as is the norm with a lake) and the surface as international water (as is the norm for an officially designated sea).

UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the agreement will be “invaluable” in regulating a range of issues among the Caspian Sea littoral countries.

In a statement, UN Secretary-General António Guterres welcomed the signing of the agreement, noting that it demonstrates the importance of regional cooperation and multilateralism for maintaining international peace and security. He highlighted the convention as a “significant step” towards easing regional tensions, and said it will be “invaluable” in regulating a range of issues among the Caspian Sea littoral countries.

152,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-christopher-robin,"Fri, 03 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘Christopher Robin’,"“It must be hard to imagine your father as a child,” Christopher’s wife, Evelyn (Hayley Atwell), says to their daughter, Madeline (Bronte Carmichael), in the most self-aware, ironic line of Marc Forster’s Christopher Robin.

For a Hollywood family film, something that seems even harder is imagining a father as an actual adult.

As played by Ewan McGregor in the latest exercise in Disney brand management, Christopher Robin is all grown up, but he’s not really an adult. (The name “Milne” isn’t mentioned; in this universe, “Robin” is his surname, not his middle name.)

I want to say Christopher is a family-film stereotype of a man who has grown up the wrong way, having lost all touch with what’s important in life, except he isn’t thought out clearly enough to be much of a character at all.

You know the type I mean: the man caught up in work and grown-up things who has no clue how to be there for his loved ones, until at last he learns a valuable lesson about play, imagination and/or family time.

In honor of the dad in Mary Poppins, we could call stories like this “Let’s Go Fly a Kite” movies, though Pooh fans will not be surprised that, instead of a kite, Christopher Robin has a balloon. (I thought about calling them “Cat’s in the Cradle” movies, but on a hunch, I Googled it. Sure enough, TV Tropes already thought of that, though the site’s preferred label is “When You Coming Home, Dad?”)

When such movies are done well, you get, say, The Incredibles or John Favreau’s Chef. When they aren’t, you get Jim Carrey in Mr. Popper’s Penguins or Steven Spielberg’s Hook — possibly the closest analogy for Christopher Robin, though Hook, for all its flaws, was clearly a personal film for Spielberg, whereas Christopher Robin feels cobbled together from bits and pieces of other movies without a cogent vision of its own.

At any rate, until Winnie the Pooh and the rest of Christopher Robin’s childhood friends show up to help him recover his childlike spirit, we’re stuck with a story in which, when Madeline asks for a bedtime story, Christopher Robin idiotically begins reading a dry British history text instead of something like Treasure Island, which is what Madeline really wants to hear.

Christopher also wants to send Madeline to the very best boarding school, which is not what Evelyn and Madeline want.

All the same, Madeline has absorbed some of her father’s work ethic; when Evelyn suggests that Madeline go out and play, Madeline embraces it as an assignment, and an opportunity to achieve, and is nonplused by her mother’s suggestion that she instead simply have fun. (She winds up pretending to play tennis with the balloon — and imagining herself winning Wimbledon.)

Most centrally, to Evelyn and Madeline’s crushing disappointment, Christopher has bailed on a promised family outing to his old countryside cottage in Sussex in order to work over the weekend on a big presentation for his London office on Monday. Notably, Christopher works at Winslow Luggage as an efficiency expert, an occupation that can function as Hollywood shorthand for a soulless corporate cog.

“If I work really hard now,” Christopher tries to explain, “in the future our lives will be ...”

“Impressive? Worse?” Evelyn interrupts. “We don’t care. We want you.”

In the midst of this too-familiar exchange, Christopher seems so caught up in the presumed plot tropes that he’s forgotten to mention a crucial fact: The callous boss (Mark Gatiss) who dropped this assignment on him earlier that day plans to fire a bunch of good people unless Christopher can figure out how to save their jobs by Monday.

“Your father promised these people good jobs after the war!” Christopher pleads, sounding not at all like a corporate cog without a soul. “They’d do anything for this company! I’d do anything for this company.”

So on the one hand Christopher Robin wants to be a movie about a London executive caught up in his work when he should be playing with his daughter in the country, reliving the magic of his childhood days; but on the other hand, it’s saddled him with a genuinely noble mission.

I’m reminded of a thoughtful line in P.J. Hogan’s flawed but interesting 2003 take on Peter Pan, in which the much ridiculed figure of Mr. Darling gets a remarkably sympathetic tribute from his wife.

Mary Darling tells her daughter Wendy that her father is a brave man. Since this version of George Darling is a rather milquetoast figure much put upon by his co-workers, this requires some explanation, so Mary continues:

“There are many different kinds of bravery. There’s the bravery of thinking of others before oneself. Now, your father has never brandished a sword nor fired a pistol, thank heavens. But he’s made many sacrifices for his family and put away many dreams.”

Continuing in a poignant, poetic mode that almost sounds like A.A. Milne, but much more like J.M. Barrie, Mrs. Darling adds that he put his dreams away “in a drawer. And sometimes, late at night, we take them out and admire them. But it gets harder and harder to close the drawer. He does. And that is why he is brave.”

That is an actual idea, one with real poignancy, about adulthood and fatherhood and loss — something lacking in Christopher Robin. Actual ideas, I mean.

Like Forster’s own Peter Pan-themed movie, the J.M. Barrie biopic Finding Neverland, Christopher Robin is handsomely appointed and mounted, with a lovely sepia-toned limited-animation prologue and flipping storybook pages with chapter heads like “In Which Christopher Robin Gets Some Sad News” moving the story through an opening montage from Christopher Robin’s last party in the Hundred-Acre Wood to boarding school, the death of his father, marriage, the war, and so on.

Also like Finding Neverland, Christopher Robin is full of melancholy and a wan approximation of the whimsical spirit of its literary inspiration. (As a point of comparison, the 2011 reboot The Muppets, with Jason Siegel and Amy Adams, had a similar melancholy tone, but nailed the whimsy.)

Pooh, Tigger, Piglet and Eeyore are sufficiently themselves to arouse our affections for these beloved characters, whether we know and love them principally from the A.A. Milne stories or from the best Disney cartoons, including the classic anthology The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh and the latter-day 2011 Winnie the Pooh.

I love them both, and I’m glad that Christopher Robin doesn’t entirely take its bearings from the cartoons.

For one thing, while Jim Cummings continues his dead-on impressions of Sterling Holloway’s Pooh and Paul Winchell’s Tigger, no great effort has been made to reproduce the other familiar voices. I also appreciate that Tigger, Piglet and Eeyore are rendered not as computer-animated animals, like Paddington, but as well-worn stuffed animals. (Rabbit and Owl, on the other hand, are real creatures of the Hundred-Acre Wood.)

On the other hand, the characters often sound like they’re just reprising their greatest hits. Many lines are familiar, although the film’s mantra, “Doing Nothing often leads to the very best Something,” is a suitably Milne-esque epigram that seems original to the film.

The 2011 Winnie the Pooh included a chapter about dealing with a nonexistent Heffalump, and in Christopher Robin, there’s a digression about battling a nonexistent Woozle — though the film winds up tagging Christopher’s boss at Winslow Luggage as a real-life Woozle.

Here’s the thing: Christopher already knew his boss was (semantics aside) a Woozle. He was resisting him from the outset. Why isn’t that worthy, too? Because he wasn’t confident and goofy while he did it? Give me the bravery of the 2003 Peter Pan’s Mr. Darling any day.

When a movie like Christopher Robin works, you want to surrender to its magic. I sat down to Christopher Robin hoping to surrender. Fifteen minutes in, I wanted to stage an intervention with the characters, which is not what happens when a movie like this works.

Reviewing Paddington 2, I observed that not only was Hollywood unable to make such movies, no one there really wanted to. For details, see Christopher Robin.

154,https://www.sentinelassam.com/editorial/sdg-6-safe-drinking-water-for-all/,"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",The Sentinel,SDG-6: Safe drinking water for all,"Availability of safe drinking water has remained a long-pending issue in the country. A sizeable percentage of population across India continues to draw water from unsafe sources for drinking and other household requirements. We live in a world where millions of people – the majority of them children – die every year from diseases that are associated with non-availability of safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene. According to an estimate made by UN, a quarter of the world’s population is likely to live in countries affected by chronic or recurring shortages of water by the end of 2050. Only about two and a half billion people have gained access to improved drinking water sources across the globe since 1990. In comparison to that about 663 million people are still without any kind of access to safe drinking water and facilities for sanitation. In a span of a quarter of a century between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of the global population using an improved drinking water source has increased from 76% to about 91%. But despite that nearly 1,000 children die each day in this world due to diarrhoeal diseases that are water and sanitation-related, and are indeed preventable.

The country has an ambitious National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) – a centrally-sponsored scheme – which is aimed at providing every person in rural India with adequate safe water for drinking, cooking and other domestic basic needs on a sustainable basis. Safe water is to be readily and conveniently accessible at all times and in all situations and therefore, the scheme focuses on the creation of the infrastructure. This has resulted in the provision of significant additional resources to the sector and for the development of infrastructure and capacities for the successful operation of drinking water supply schemes in rural areas.

Going by government data, a little over 78 per cent of habitations in rural India have been covered under NRDWP. The programme has been however marred by various instances of slip-backs. The annual report of the ministry of drinking water and sanitation for 2017-18 has attributed this to (i) depletion of ground-water levels due to excessive extraction by competitive sectors such as agriculture and industry, (ii) reduction of water bodies and storage capacity due to silting, (iii) successive droughts and inconsistent rains, and (iv) pollution of water bodies because of increased use of pesticides/fertilizer and effluent from industries.

The report has also said that out of a little over 1,22,000 rural habitations in the eight North-eastern states, only about 66,000 have been fully covered under the NRDWP till the end of 2017, while another lot of about 43,000 rural habitations have been only partially covered. The government has set a target of making 2,134 such habitations “fully covered” by the end of 2017-2018, but the ground reality is that it is far behind the target.

Quality of drinking water too has remained a major issue, especially in Assam. The government report says there were as many as 662 “quality-affected villages” in Assam during 2017-18. In Tripura the figure stood at 524, while there were 16 such villages in Nagaland and 10 in Meghalaya. Details of the remaining North-eastern states were not shown in it.

One key factor responsible for non-availability of safe drinking water in villages across India is the lack of community participation and community ownership of the projects. According to a World Bank report, the key issue was that systems were designed and constructed by state agencies with little participation from local communities. It said that while people lacked a sense of ownership, maintenance was neglected. Consumers also treated water as a right to be provided free-of-cost by the government, making systems financially unsustainable.

Clean or safe water is a critical input for survival, and its absence can causes serious issues related to the health, food security, and livelihoods of families across the world. Although this planet has sufficient fresh water to achieve a regular and clean water supply for all, the UN has blamed bad economics and poor infrastructure for the prevailing situation. Droughts have afflicted some of the world’s poorest countries in the recent years, thus further worsening hunger and malnutrition.

It is also a fact that floods and other water-related disasters account for about 70% of all deaths that are related to natural disasters. Global goals and national priorities on reliable energy, economic growth, resilient infrastructure, sustainable industrialisation, consumption and production, and food security, are all inextricably linked to a sustainable supply of clean water. Hydropower is one of the most crucial and widely-used renewable sources of energy and as of 2011, represented 16% of total electricity production worldwide.

The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) have committed the international community to expand international cooperation and capacity building on water and sanitation related activities and programmes, and also to support local communities in improving water and sanitation management. Through Goal 6 of the SDG, the countries of the world have resolved to achieve universal access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation and hygiene to all in the next 15 years.","Availability of safe drinking water has remained a long-pending issue in the country.

156,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-launches-2030-strategy-and-global-partnership-initiative-for-youth/,"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Launches 2030 Strategy and Global Partnership Initiative for Youth,"24 September: A day before the opening of the 73rd UN General Assembly’s (UNGA) high-level General Debate, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres unveiled Youth 2030, a strategy reflecting the UN’s new commitment to working with and for young people. Officials also launched Generation Unlimited, a global multi-stakeholder partnership initiated by the UN Children’s Fund’s (UNICEF) to “ensure that every young person is in education, learning, training or employment by 2030.”

The strategy ‘Youth 2030: Working With and For Young People’ originates from a decision of Secretary-General Guterres, who made it a priority to reset the UN system’s focus on youth and reorient and mainstream the organization’s activities towards youth. He tasked his Envoy on Youth, in conjunction with the UN system and youth themselves, to lead the development of the strategy.

Youth 2030 will act as an umbrella framework to guide the UN across its three pillars (peace and security, human rights and sustainable development) in all contexts. It seeks to “significantly strengthen” the UN’s capacity to engage young people and benefit from their views, insights and ideas, and to ensure that UN’s work on youth issues is pursued in a “coordinated, coherent and holistic manner.” It comprises five priorities: i) amplify youth voices for the promotion of a peaceful, just and sustainable world (engagement, participation and advocacy); ii) support young people’s greater access to quality education and health services; iii) support young people’s greater access to decent work and productive employment; iv) protect and promote the rights of young people and support their civic and political engagement; and v) support young people as catalysts for peace and security and humanitarian action.

Per the strategy, its governance arrangements will be rooted in existing global, regional and national mechanisms, and guided by a High-Level Steering Committee chaired by the Envoy on Youth. The Committee will also be composed of: the UN Inter-Agency Network on Youth Development (IANYD) co-chairs; a select number of biennially rotating UN entities; and two biennially rotating representatives of a global youth-led platform or organization. The Steering Committee will seek to ensure alignment with other UN processes and reforms, will identify a suitable arrangement for its interactions with the UN Sustainable Development Group (UNSDG), and will discuss annual reports on the strategy’s implementation, which will be prepared by the Secretary- General’s Envoy on Youth with input from the IANYD. These reports will be submitted to the UNSDG and the UN Secretary-General’s Executive Committee.

Generation Unlimited (or “Gen-U”) seeks to contribute to the delivery of Youth 2030 by creating synergies between partners to mobilize support and maximize results. It will complement and build on existing programmes that support adolescents and young people. The partnership explores co-creating innovative solutions, brokering support, mentoring and funding. It focuses on three key challenges, namely: access to secondary age education; acquisition of employability skills; and empowerment, especially of girls. It brings together the private sector, governments, international and local organizations, and young people, and is co-chaired by Secretary-General Guterres and Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda.

Youth 2030 and Generation Unlimited were launched during an event co-hosted by the UN Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth, Jayathma Wickramanayake, and UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore on 24 September 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. Guterres told participants that: the world is home to 1.8 billion young people, the largest generation in history; more than one fifth of young people are not in employment, education or training; one in four is affected by violence or armed conflict in some way; and millions of girls become mothers while they are still children. He said the Youth 2030 strategy should help the UN become a leader in working with young people, and should spur new partnerships, but “bold new approaches” will be required to deliver on it.

María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, President of the 73rd UNGA, said through the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the UNGA recognized youth as agents of change for the first time. She added that youth are “amongst our best educated, most innovative, and most creative resources” when it comes to addressing health care solutions or education or economic opportunities.

Fore called on governments, businesses, foundations, academia, non-profits, communities and innovators to help get every young person in school, training or age-appropriate employment by 2030 – the aim of Generation Unlimited – and to develop concrete plans to expand the funding base needed to reach more young people, in more communities and countries.

Jim Yong Kim, World Bank President, remarked that the nature of work is changing very quickly, and many countries are not prepared for a future of work, which is more digitally demanding. Paul Kagame remarked that the youth strategy is a practical framework and is also aligned with the African Union’s (AU) Agenda 2063. Nana Akufo-Addo, President of Ghana, said access to education is helping the “growth of democracy,” and that Ghana has adopted a Free Senior High School (HSH) policy. Uhuru Kenyatta, President of Kenya, said progress for youth is progress for all humanity, and his country offers free primary and secondary education. He also noted that education without work opportunity is not a solution.

The Bangtan Boys (BTS), a South Korean music group, noted that together with UNICEF, they launched the Love Myself Campaign to address violence toward children and teens around the world. Brad Smith, President of Microsoft, outlined various partnerships between Microsoft and UN entities, including the creation of a new learning platform with UNICEF, a project with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) to provide literacy to refugees, and an initiative with the International Labour Organization (ILO) on the future of work.

Federica Mogherini, High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and board member of Generation Unlimited, said investing in the younger generation is an investment for the future, but also for today. She announced a new Africa-Europe Alliance that will increase support for scholarships and exchange programmes with the goal of over 100,000 students benefitting from its support (ERASMUS+ programme) in the next ten years.

157,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-secretary-general-briefs-governments-on-resident-coordinator-reforms/,"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Secretary-General Briefs Governments on Resident Coordinator Reforms,"11 September 2018: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has briefed Member States on plans for the inception of the reinvigorated Resident Coordinator (RC) system. The UN General Assembly (UNGA) had requested him to present the implementation plan – including to operationalize funding arrangements for the reinvigorated RC system – in resolution 72/279 on the repositioning of the UN development system to align it with the 2030 Agenda.



A final draft of the implementation plan was issued on 31 August 2018. The document outlines funding milestones for the RC system, with the first being to reach US$145 million in firm funding commitments by the end of September 2018. The remaining budget will be secured progressively between October 2018 and March 2019. The “essential elements” of the system should be operational on 1 January 2019, the plan notes.

The RC financing package is proposed to include three pillars:

A 1% coordination levy on tightly earmarked third party non-core contributions to UN development-related activities, to be paid at source;

Doubling the current UNDG cost-sharing arrangement among UN development system entities; and

Voluntary, predictable, multi-year contributions to a dedicated Trust Fund to support the inception period.

On 11 September 2018, UN Member States were briefed on the plans. Addressing delegates at UN Headquarters in New York, US, Guterres said they will receive a final copy of the inception plan by 14 September. He said his transition team is focused on coordinating overall implementation of the repositioning resolution, setting targets, and tracking progress towards the requested deliverables, while ensuring minimal disruption to UN’s work on the ground. He added that the team is staffed primarily through secondments from the UN system, which ensures strong buy-in and leverages the expertise of a various UN entities.

Guterres reported that the implementation plan specifies short- and medium-term actions for the next 18 to 24 months. It identifies immediate actions needed, including the establishment of a funding platform to receive, consolidate, manage and account for all contributions and financial transactions of the reinvigorated RC system, which will be called the ‘Special Purpose Trust Fund.’ This Fund has received funding commitments or “soft pledges” from 15 countries, amounting to US$75 million for 2019, out of the needed US$290 million, he reported.

The Plan also outlines a number of services that the UN Development Programme (UNDP) will continue to provide to the new RC system, on a fee-for-service basis. It provides an initial “recalibration” of functions and relationships at the country, regional and headquarters levels.

Responding to Guterres’ presentation, New Zealand, also for Canada and Australia (CANZ), said Member States should not micromanage the process, but rather count on the Secretary-General’s leadership. She called on all Member States to “now seriously consider support for predictable and sustainable funding for the system.” She stressed that the review of multi-country offices (MCOs) must not lag behind the broader changes to the RC system. She inquired how the changes in UN management and the peace and security pillar will support the changing role of the RC, and about the link between changes to the RC system and the mandate on “sustaining peace.”

Egypt, for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China), supported by Maldives for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and China, stressed the need for national ownership and national leadership over the developmental process. He also called for strong accountability of the RCs to national governments. With regard to enhancing coordination between the UN development system, humanitarian assistance and peacebuilding efforts at the national level, he said this should only be done in countries facing humanitarian emergencies and in conflict and post-conflict situations.

References to geographical “balance” rather than “diversity” were welcomed by G-77/China and China. They added that gender and geographic balance should also be considered for staffing the UN Development Operations Coordination Office (DOCO). G-77/China underlined the importance of hiring qualified nationals in the RC offices.

The G-77/China continued to express concern, as it had done throughout the repositioning consultation process, that RC funding appears to be largely dependent on voluntary contributions until 2020, and he urged “traditional donors” to come forward with the required funds. He also addressed the proposal for a 1% coordination levy on tightly earmarked, third party non-core contributions to the UN’s development-related activities that would not be charged on local government cost-sharing and cooperation among programme countries, and suggested including civil society and the private sector in the levy to provide additional revenue streams. He emphasized the importance of official development assistance (ODA) as a critical source of funding for the UN development system. Finally, he stressed the importance of open communication between missions in New York and DOCO regarding the progress on the RC system and UN Country Teams (UNCTs).

Mexico expressed support for the Secretary-General’s proposal that contributions from civil society and foundations as well as the private sector will initially be exempt from the 1% levy, with Member States shouldering that amount. Expressing full support for the Secretary-General’s proposed plan, the EU supported by Colombia said the UN membership needs “to act in boards but also in the Fifth Committee” (Administrative and Budgetary) to support funding for the RC system. The EU added that its member states will contribute their part.

On the proposed 1% levy, the EU noted that exclusions must follow those “set out explicitly” in the resolution, namely only local government cost-sharing and cooperation among programme countries. He mentioned that the management of all three pillars of the RC financing package will sit with the voluntary fund, thus the oversight transparency costing of this fund is imperative. He added that more work is needed on both structure of the fund and to broaden its donor base. Finally, he called on UN development system entities to “properly analyze” cost implications for their respective agencies, and encouraged the Secretary-General to better incorporate specialized agencies in the reform process.

The EU observed that the implementation plan places a lot of emphasis on cooperation with regional commissions, and less on the role of the UN Sustainable Development Group’s (UNSDG) regional hubs. While acknowledging that the issue will be discussed in depth in 2019, he nevertheless encouraged more focus on the functioning of regional hubs and improved cooperation with RCs.

AOSIS expressed regret that its members were not consulted on the timeframe of the review of MCOs, and lamented that the majority of financial resources are already accounted for, while the regional and sub-regional levels of the RC system remain undefined. She stressed that all UN development system entities, not only those based in New York, should be involved in the reform process. Mexico stressed that the regional commissions should play a coordinating role in the regional level of the reform processes.

Norway said that without financing, the RC system is “in danger,” and announced that Norway will contribute $US4.1 million in 2018 and additional support in 2019. She expressed support for pooling the three major funding streams for the RC system into a common “special purpose fund” in the UN Secretariat.

Colombia addressed RC appointments, noting that while the Secretary-General has achieved geographic parity in the RC appointments made to date, incoming candidacies are only 40% from the global South, and called on all Member States to increase parity among candidacies. She further invited focus also on the relationship between RCs and UNDP Resident Representatives moving forward.

The US emphasized that the RC reform should aim to shift away from the paradigm of “the development of developing countries,” in order to foster “truly sustainable development.”

As part of the UNGA resolution, UN Member States agreed to separate the functions of the RCs from those of the UNDP Resident Representatives. In the briefing exchange, Russia cautioned that any further “extensions” of the RCs’ authority must be mandated by Member States, and any additional UNDP expenditures related to the transition of the RCs should be considered and approved by the UNDP Executive Board. He added that without clear proof of savings enabled by the reform and of strengthened effectiveness, “it will be problematic” to justify additional investments in changing the UN development system, including the large expansion of DOCO and the RC offices. Russia also said the newly independent RC system should not be “exploited” to “artificially blend” the three UN pillars (development, peacebuilding and human rights) under the “sustainable development banner.”

Noting that the joint executive board of UNDP, the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) and the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS) recently approved a new cost-sharing arrangement, agreeing to double their organizations’ respective contribution, Switzerland invited the other UN funds, programs and specialized agencies to follow their example and double their contributions.

UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed responded to several of the issues that had been raised by Member States. On better incorporating specialized agencies into the reform of the UN development system, Mohammed said that Robert Piper, head of the transition team, is currently meeting with specialized agencies. She also noted that the transition team includes seconded staff from UNDP, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the regional commissions.

Mohammed said the UNSDG transition team is working with a transition team at UNDP to ensure alignment and avoid any disruption in the field, as the separation between the RCs and UNDP Resident Representatives is implemented. Addressing concerns raised about the MCOs, she said her team will hold consultations with Member States that are impacted by MCOs, and will report back to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in 2019.

On the levy, Mohammed said this will be discussed during the dialogue on the Funding Compact for the overall reform of the UN development system, which will begin in October 2018. She said no decisions on the exclusion of the private sector and civil society have been made yet.

She reported that there has been “a surge” of traditional donors contributing to the RC fund since her office circulated the draft implementation plan. She also noted contributions from non-traditional donors, and said the first deposit in the RC fund had been from a non-traditional donor. She said Member States will be able to see what is going on with the funding “in real time” on the website of the RC fund.

This edition of “the magazine of the United Nations” focuses on the SDGs, and examines actions the UN has taken in its “lead role in advancing the 2030 Agenda.”

The articles cover topics that do not always feature prominently when discussing SDG implementation, such as disarmament and sexual violence. Pramila Patten, Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, highlights gender-based violence, which she describes as the “missing dimension” of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Patten links sexual violence to a human rights-based approach and the “leave no one behind” principle. She notes that “when war erupts, and the threat of rape at gunpoint becomes a pervasive terror,” women are unable to access fields, marketplaces and water points, and that girls are unable to attend school. Patten further highlights the disproportionate economic and health impacts of war on women, connecting to the majority of the SDGs. She also flags the importance of time: whereas men can invest hours in work, education or civic engagement, women—especially in developing countries—are often burdened with unpaid labor such as cooking, cleaning and childcare. Patten closes by calling on countries to legislate gender equality not only as a moral and social justice imperative, but also a smart economic choice.

Izumi Nakamitsu, UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, discusses the nexus between disarmament, arms control and development, outlining the linkages to SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), and noting that the issue and its connection to development are not new. She references Article 26 of the UN Charter and points readers to the Secretary-General’s Agenda for Disarmament launched on 24 May 2018, which aims to take the issue out of its “narrow, isolated security lens.” Nakamitsu stresses the importance of disarmament to achieving SDG targets 16.1 (reduce all forms of violence and related death rates) and 16.a (develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions), and flags that disarmament is explicitly recognized in SDG target 16.4 (reduce illicit financial and arms flows). She also draws linkages to Goals 3 (good health and well-being), 4 (quality education), (5 (gender equality), 8 (decent work and economic growth) and 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed follows by arguing that success on the SDGs will be “measured in how well we live up to the commitment to leave no one behind.” Doing so, she notes, entails providing a voice and platform for meaningful participation and engagement, particularly by the most marginalized and vulnerable. To make this a reality, Mohammed calls for six elements to be put in place, including: making the SDGs better known in society; investing in more transparent and accountable institutions; creating appropriate spaces for young people and fostering their ideas and leadership potential; and connecting overlapping agendas.

The Pacific-EU Marine Partnership Programme (PEUMP) will assist the regional organizations in supporting national and regional activities throughout the Pacific.

The signing follows agreement between the EU Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development and the Secretary General of the Pacific Island Forum Secretariat (PIFS) on the partnership programme. The two agreed to develop the programme at the 2017 Our Ocean Conference, which took place in Malta.

The five-year PEUMP has a holistic, multi-sector approach to marine resources and aims to contribute to the region’s environmental, economic and social development. The programme will focus on four key areas. First, the PEUMP will support sound coastal and ocean governance with a focus on biodiversity protection and sustainable fisheries and marine resource use. Second, the programme will use a rights-based approach to encourage participation of men, women and youth in decision making, and mainstream gender equality and human rights. Third, PEUMP will mainstream climate change and environmental issues. Finally, the programme will strengthen regional, national, sub-national and local capacity to deliver sustainable fisheries management and sound ocean governance through education, training and research.

Health of our oceans has a direct impact on the lives of every person who calls the Pacific their home.

SPC Director General, Colin Tukuitonga stressed that the “health of our oceans has a direct impact on the lives of every person who calls the Pacific their home.” He said the programme aligns with Pacific Islands Forum leaders’ vision of a ‘Blue Pacific’ and will help to ensure that Pacific communities can sustainably manage and conserve their ocean resources. Jean-Louis Ville, Head of Unit for East Asia, South-East Asia and the Pacific at the European Commission Directorate General for International Cooperation and Development, recognized the essential role of oceans in “ensuring food, livelihoods, biodiversity and climate resilience” but noted that the world’s oceans face increasing threats from unsustainable management practices and the negative effects of climate change. He said the EU-Pacific partnership will address such threats and support sustainable management of the Pacific’s marine resources.

The report highlights that the positive effects of secondary school education for girls include near-elimination of child marriage.

The publication titled, ‘Missed Opportunities: The High Cost of Not Educating Girls,’ reports that fewer than two-thirds of girls in low-income countries complete primary school, and only one in three girls completes lower secondary school. SDG target 4.1 calls for ensuring that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes by 2030.

On average, the report notes, women who have a secondary education are more likely to work and they earn almost twice as much as those with no education. Secondary school education for girls also brings the near elimination of child marriage, lowers fertility rates by one-third in countries with high population growth, and reduces child mortality and malnutrition. In addition, the report highlights that women with secondary education are less likely to experience intimate partner violence, report higher levels of psychological well-being, and have healthier children who are more likely to go to school and learn.

Over the past 20 years, many countries have reached universal primary education, with girls’ enrollment at the primary level in developing countries rivaling that of boys. However, the report notes, larger benefits of education would come from completing secondary school.

In order to reap the full benefits of education, the publication recommends that countries improve both access to and quality of education for girls, and implement policies to support healthy economic growth that will generate jobs for an expanding educated workforce. It underlines that investments in the education system are especially crucial in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa, where only 40% of girls complete lower secondary school.

The event took place on 24 September 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. The meeting focused on three priorities for scaling up financing for the SDGs: aligning global financial and economic policies with the 2030 Agenda; enhancing sustainable financing strategies; and seizing the potential of financial innovations, new technologies and digitalization to provide equitable access to finance.

Opening the meeting, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres noted that while efforts to achieve peace require a surge in diplomacy, efforts to achieve the SDGs require a surge in financing and investments. He stressed the need for women to have equal access, be equally represented in decision making, and be equally considered in how investments are made. The Secretary-General proposed focusing on the following objectives:

All developed countries must meet the commitments they made in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development;

We must continue to support developing countries in creating conditions for mobilizing domestic resources, including tax reform and other good governance measures; and

We need to step up efforts in developing innovative financing and in mobilizing private investment.

Christine Lagarde, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director, announced that the IMF has done analytical work to see what it will take for low-income developing countries to meet the SDGs, looking at five areas that are critical for sustainable and inclusive growth: education, health, water and sanitation, roads, and electricity. She said countries investing in these sectors will address deficits in human capital and physical infrastructure, which represent a drag on their income and future prosperity. Lagarde cautioned that debt burdens are rising, with 40% of low-income developing countries being now at high risk of debt distress or in debt distress. She also emphasized that foreign aid remains crucial, and preferably takes the form of grants. She said advanced economies can do more, and can better target their aid budgets to support countries most in need. She highlighted that while budget conditions are tight in many advanced economies, returns on well-targeted aid—in terms of poverty reduction, job creation, and improving security and stability—are very high.

Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, underscored that investments should focus on the best return in the long term, rather than the best return in the short term. He called for securing more solid flows of capital to the most vulnerable countries and sectors, such as infrastructure, which will bring key long-term returns.

Mia Amor Mottley, Prime Minister of Barbados, said small island developing States (SIDS) should be at the frontline of fighting climate change instead of being the victims of climate change, but they do not have the resources. She called for a hospitable and equitable international environment, supportive of SIDS’ needs and priorities. Jusuf Kalla, Vice President of Indonesia, invited a focus on enhancing the performance of national economy.

Laurence D. Fink, CEO of BlackRock, noted that 35% of today’s workforce is comprised of millennials, who have made it clear that they want to work for purpose-driven companies, and the SDGs provide the companies with an opportunity to respond to that demand. Emphasizing the need for better data on sustainability, Fink said that as more companies report on sustainability, data will improve and more capital will flow into sustainability.

Robin Shanahan, CEO of PIMCO, said the SDGs provide capital markets with the objectives they need to align themselves with sustainable development. She emphasized the importance of sustainable development bonds.

Mark Wilson, CEO of Aviva Group, underscored the need for transparent, consistent, free, and simple benchmarks that actually measure the SDGs. He highlighted the work of the World Benchmarking Alliance to that end. The World Benchmarking Alliance was launched on the evening of 25 September 2018. It is funded by Aviva, the Index Initiative, and the UN Foundation.

Philippe Le Houérou, International Finance Corporation (IFC) CEO, called for being more proactive in approaching investors rather than waiting to be approached by investors. He recommended using ODA to leverage private investment and strengthen domestic markets to attract investors, explaining that if we “don’t create but destroy markets,” we will not go from billions to trillions but from billions to millions, and fail in SDG implementation.

Bill Gates, Founder, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, emphasized that the financial system needs to evolve to support developing countries, with foreign aid being a fundamental pillar. While they are not a substitute for public investment, he said private sector and foundations can help as well. He explained that philanthropic foundation can: use challenge grants to seek innovate approaches to deep-seated challenges; de-risk investments; partner with others (such as development banks) to scale up successful projects; and increase the impact of innovative collaborations, an example of which is Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.

Financial inclusion for women is imperative, as women choose to invest in exactly the issues the SDGs are about.

Kristalina Georgieva, CEO of the World Bank Group, said the Bank is working on the launch of a youth bond to connect financial markets with the purpose embedded in the SDGs. Mary Ellen Iskenderian, CEO of Women’s World Banking, emphasized that financial inclusion for women is imperative, as studies show that women choose to invest exactly in the issues the SDGs are about.

Ashish Thakkar, Founder, Mara Group, noted that digitalization will be key to formalizing the informal sector. He also highlighted the need to give access to finance to women and youth entrepreneurs, to that end. He announced that the Mara Group will produce the first quality, affordable, African-made smart phones to enable this.

In the ensuing discussion, participants raised issues related to: the need for regional integration, especially in Africa; strengthening governance institutions to improve the business environment; the potential of pension funds to provide needed investments in the SDGs; the need to support fragile states; the need for a global corporate tax reform that makes companies pay their fair contributions; the increase of public risks from private investments; and the need to invest in women.

Closing the meeting, Liu Zhenmin, head of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), underlined that investment in sustainable development reduces volatility. He said while the UN cannot invest, it provides a vehicle for promoting the momentum to invest in the SDGs and is committed to providing impartial support to Member States. UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed noted three key messages from the meeting: domestic resources are important; the return of investments in the 2030 Agenda “go a very long way”; and reaching everyone requires that we be innovative.

Prioritizing activities to be taken in the near-term, the report synthesizes knowledge gained from the early stages of the Plan’s formulation, and informs coming steps in the process, which is being undertaken with support from the Green Climate Fund (GCF).

Titled, ‘Nepal’s National Adaptation Plan (NAP) Process: Reflecting on Lessons Learned and the Way Forward,’ the report is a joint initiative by Nepal’s Ministry of Forests and Environment (MoFE), the NAP Global Network, Action on Climate Today (ACT) and Practical Action Nepal. The report describes the institutional and policy context behind Nepal’s NAP process and covers development planning, climate policy and climate finance while articulating linkages to the SDGs. It highlights that Nepal is “one of the first countries to receive approval” for NAP funding from the GCF Readiness Programme.

Nepal’s NAP process aligns with key principles of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the commitment to leave no one behind (LNOB). Describing Nepal’s current development planning context, the report points to three- and five-year plans that guide inclusive development. It recognizes the current (14th) plan for 2016-2019, which works towards achieving the SDGs and graduating to middle-income country (MIC) status by 2030. Although the paper primarily focuses on near-term priorities, it underscores that “Nepal’s longer-term development vision is guided by the SDGs,” and references a national roadmap for SDG achievement. The roadmap commits to the development of adaptation plans for local governments, climate-smart agriculture (CSA), and the integration of climate change into school curricula.

Nepal’s NAP process aligns with key principles of the 2030 Agenda, including the commitment to leave no one behind.

The report describes Nepal’s NAP process as being “political as well as technical.” Thus, in order to achieve the goals set out by both Nepal’s current development plan and NAP, an enabling environment must be created that permits technical inputs to be used effectively in policy and decision making.

The NAP process covers seven thematic areas, each of which will be tied to a specific “adaptation pathway.” The paper highlights concrete actions to be taken under each pathway. The thematic areas directly map to the SDGs: agriculture and food security to SDG 2 (zero hunger); water resources and energy to SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation) and 7 (affordable and clean energy); public health, water, sanitation and hygiene to SDGs 3 (good health and well-being) and 6; urban settlements and infrastructure to SDGs 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure); forests and biodiversity to SDG 15 (life on land); climate-induced disasters to SDG 13 (climate action); and tourism and natural and cultural heritage to SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 11, 12 (responsible consumption and production) and 14 (life below water). Gender and social inclusion as well as livelihoods and governance are considered as cross-cutting themes, drawing on SDGs 5 (gender equality), 8, 1 (no poverty) and 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions).

The report on the NAP process has been informed by stakeholder consultations, including a workshop held in February 2018. Key priorities and takeaways from the early stages of the NAP formulation process include:

Evolving the working groups that have been established;

Engaging provincial and local governments;

Developing a NAP framework that continues to build momentum;

Compiling and sharing information on vulnerability and adaptation options;

Expanding stakeholder engagement mechanisms;

Completing vulnerability and risk analyses;

Developing a finance strategy; and

Creating an enabling environment for sub-national integration of adaptation efforts.

The report outlines next steps to be taken under each priority, but notes that the country’s changing governance context presents both a challenge and opportunity for integrating climate change adaptation into national decision-making processes.

The strategy outlines how UNDP will “elevate and integrate” gender equality across all of its work.

UNDP’s Third Gender Equality Strategy outlines four priorities to address structural barriers to gender equality. The priorities are:

removing structural barriers to women’s economic empowerment, including women’s disproportionate burden of unpaid work;

preventing and responding to gender-based violence;

promoting women’s participation and leadership in all forms of decision-making; and

strengthening gender-responsive strategies in conflict and disaster prevention, preparedness and recovery.

Improving women’s access to productive resources could reduce the number of hungry people by 12-17% globally.

The four-year strategy provides evidence on how gender equality accelerates development. For instance, when women participate in peace agreements as negotiators, mediators, signatories or witnesses, peace agreements are 35 percent more likely to last at least 15 years. In another example, if women have the same access to productive resources as men, women would increase their farm yields by 20-30%, which would then increase the total agricultural output for developing countries by 2.5-4% annually and reduce the number of hungry people in the world by 12-17%.

The strategy includes an annex on lessons learned from implementation of UNDP’s Gender Equality Strategy 2014-2017. The key lessons – which the 2018-2021 aims to address – include the importance of addressing structural barriers to gender equality, ranging from legal and institutional to attitudinal and societal barriers, and tackling structural challenges, including care responsibilities that prevent women from equally participating in the economy. Other lessons learned include the need to mainstream gender equality in climate action and crisis resilience, an area in which UNDP intends to focus more attention in its new strategy. The strategy calls for integrating gender equality and women’s participation at the earliest stages possible and for creating opportunities for women to contribute to and participate in sustainable livelihoods in ways that improve outcomes for them and their families. UNDP will launch guidance for country offices on how to improve their work on fragility and recovery from a gender lens.

The 2018-2021 strategy calls for working more closely with civil society and the private sector, including by creating space and opportunities for women’s organizations and networks. The strategy recognizes the role of the private sector in creating a decent work environment for women and changing behaviors, values and norms. To advance this work, the strategy identifies two initiatives: the Private Sector Seal, a certification program for companies; and the Inclusion and Equitable Development Programme, which will work to unlock public and private investments in gender sensitive projects at the local level in least developed countries (LDCs).

Introducing the Third Strategy to the UNDP Executive Board, Abdoulaye Mar Dieye, UNDP, emphasized the central role of gender equality in the 2030 Agenda. In addition to SDG 5, he said gender equality is reflected in 36 SDG targets and 54 SDG indicators across the Global Goals. Dieye stressed that gender equality and women’s empowerment are essential in ensuring that no one is left behind, and said UNDP will work to ensure gender equality is part of all its development efforts. As part of this effort, the UNDP Administrator plans to sign on as an International Gender Champion, while senior managers throughout UNDP are expected to champion gender equality in meetings and speeches and ensure gender balance in panels and missions.

UNDP notes that the strategy is consistent with the Common Chapter of the strategic plans of UNDP, UN Women, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), as well as with direction received from the UN’s Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review (QCPR).

UNDP and UN Women have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on strengthened collaboration. Key areas of cooperation in the MOU include: policy and legal reforms to advance gender equality; economic empowerment; mobilizing the private sector to advance gender equality; women’s political leadership; gender based-violence; and crises/post-crises response and early recovery.

The EIE is a tool designed to give cities easy access to climate-relevant data so they can make evidence-based decisions about the environment. Currently in beta testing, the EIE is founded on the idea that “data and technologies can help accelerate the actions, industries and investments that enable the world’s transition to low-carbon future.”

The EIE uses information commonly found in Google Maps, such as building footprints, building typologies, street-level imagery and historical data, and aggregates this information to a city scale. Using this information, along with additional datasets, the EIE employs standardized methods to calculate information related to climate change.

Data are currently available for five pilot cities: Buenos Aires (Argentina), Melbourne (Australia), Victoria (Canada), Mountain View (US) and Pittsburgh (US). Data for each of these cities are organized in three categories: building emissions, transportation emissions and energy offset potential. Within each of these categories are supplementary indicators that were developed in collaboration with the GCoM, who helped Google connect with cities around the world to understand what data they required to reduce their emissions.

By introducing solar power onto flat roofs, the city of Victoria could reduce carbon emissions equivalent to taking 7,660 vehicles off the road for a year.

Within the building emissions category, users can explore estimated carbon emissions by residential and non-residential buildings. Beyond displaying this information in a map, the EIE also provides suggested actions for reducing emissions, such as lighting upgrades and rooftop solar power, and calculates the potential impacts of these investments. This potential can be further explored in the energy offset potential category. In the case of Victoria, for example, the EIE estimates that by introducing solar power onto flat roofs, the city could reduce carbon emissions equivalent to taking 7,660 vehicles off the road for a year, or growing 929,000 seedlings over 10 years.

Under the transportation emissions category, users can view the estimated emissions produced by mode of transport and the differences between in-bound and out-bound traffic. For cities interested in reducing their transportation emissions, the EIE provides links to implementing electric vehicle charging stations or introducing a car-free downtown. All the data are also available for download in a comma-separated values (CSV) format, including the metadata for the indicator.

By providing all this information in an online platform, the EIE aims to bring “data analytics to conversations about renewable energy.” While EIE has brought this information to fruition in five cities, Google plans on launching similar datasets for thousands of cities and towns around the world.

Among other activities, participants celebrated the winners of the Stockholm Water Prize and the Stockholm Junior Water Prize.

World Water Week attracted a record number of 3,700 participants. It opened with calls for nature-based solutions, such as “green infrastructure” in cities, to protect and restore water resources. UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, in her opening address, highlighted ways to spread the risk from water-related disasters in a more equitable manner, and urged all concerned to be involved in actions for addressing the world’s water crisis.

Torgny Homgren, SIWI Executive Director, declared that water scarcity has become “the new normal” in many parts of the world. Other speakers referred to examples where water scarcity has contributed to poverty, conflict, and the spread of waterborne diseases, as well as hindering access to education for women and girls.

The UNFCCC, in a press release, noted the pressures exerted by climate change on food security and health around the world, adding that water scarcity also calls into question the future of water-intensive energy production.

The UN-Water Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6 launched a set of global baseline reports during World Water Week, bringing together work undertaken through the World Health Organization (WHO)/UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP), Integrated Monitoring of Water and Sanitation-Related SDG Targets (GEMI), and the UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS).

On the proportion of wastewater that is safely treated (SDG indicator 6.3.1), the WHO and UN Habitat report that, based on data from 79 countries, only 59% of domestic wastewater is collected and safely treated, while insufficient information is available to estimate the level of industrial wastewater treatment.

Water scarcity has become “the new normal” in many parts of the world, said SIWI Executive Director, Torgny Homgren.

On ambient water quality (SDG indicator 6.3.2), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment) finds that, based on 52 submissions, more than half the water bodies assessed are of good quality. However, the authors propose mapping of trends in water quality to indicate whether water bodies are improving, stable or degrading, noting that it is not practical to set universal parameters of water quality.

Regarding progress on water-use efficiency (SDG indicator 6.4.1), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) notes that average water-use efficiency currently stands at around US$15/m3 worldwide, though there are significant differences among countries and regions.

On the level of water stress (SDG indicator 6.4.2), FAO reports that water stress increased between 1996 and 2016 for most countries in the world, and has more than doubled in 26 countries, 15 of which are in Africa.

On the degree of integrated water resource management (IWRM) implementation (SDG indicator 6.5.1), UN Environment reports that 80% of countries have laid the foundations to establish IWRM, but that 60% of countries are unlikely to achieve the target of implementing IWRM at all levels by 2030 (SDG target 6.5). Hence, the report notes, multi-level coordination and collective, multi-stakeholder measures will be critical.

On the proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational agreement for water cooperation (SDG indicator 6.5.2), the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) find insufficient progress, and propose undertaking joint projects that alleviate poverty and conflict, in tandem with water-related objectives.

On water-related ecosystems (SDG indicator 6.6.1), a report published by UN Environment on behalf of UN-Water notes that, while severe water scarcity affects more than 200 river basins annually, with direct impacts on 2.67 billion people, progress on monitoring and reporting indicator 6.6.1 is slow. The report calls for “significantly upscaling” in situ monitoring of water quality and quantity.

World Water Week celebrated innovations in the field of water treatment. Stockholm Water Prize laureates Bruce Rittmann and Mark van Loosdrecht were recognized for their work in biotechnology-based processes to treat drinking water and waste water, while minimizing the energy footprint of water treatment. A ceremony highlighted the contribution of the two scientists to better understanding how microorganisms can transform organic pollutants in water. Kartik Chandran, World Water Prize Committee, noted in a blog post the potential of environmental biotechnology not only for improving drinking water and recycling or purifying wastewater, but also in interacting with complex biological systems to enable the achievement of goals in energy, food, and human health.

Also honored during World Water Week were the winners of the Stockholm Junior Water Prize, Caleb Liow Jia Le and Johnny Xiao Hong Yu from Singapore. The two teenagers have developed a way to produce reduced grapheme oxide, which can purify water, using locally available durian rind and sugarcane fiber.

The report responds to the main theme of the 2018 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) – transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies – and reviews Taiwan’s implementation of the six SDGs reviewed by the HLPF in 2018.



Taiwan launched a Voluntary National Review on the SDGs on the sidelines of the UNGA in New York, US, in September 2017. During the launch, EPA Minister Lee Ying-yuan said Taiwan will promote sustainable development, implement the SDGs in a timely manner, and share the results of global partnership with the international community. He also urged other countries to work with Taiwan in pursuit of sustainable development for the world and all humankind.

The 2018 Report on SDG Implementation addresses issues and concerns raised by the participants of seven public fora held in Taiwan by the National Council for Sustainable Development in 2017 and 2018, focusing on six issues identified as priorities: smart water resources management; sustainable energy transformation; clean air; sustainable materials management and the circular economy; ecological conservation and green networks; and international partnerships for the SDGs. The report’s analysis sets out Taiwan’s vision for these issues, exploring their current status and describing measures to be taken.

In addition, the report indicates that the National Council for Sustainable Development, which is chaired by the Premier, is formulating Taiwan’s own sustainable development goals, with the SDGs as its reference. To implement Taiwan’s SDGs, the report says the government will work with other countries to realize the official SDGs and will set down more ambitious targets for Taiwan’s sustainable development than those enshrined in the SDGs.

Taiwan’s SDGs comprise 18 goals, 143 targets, and 342 indicators. The 18 goals are:

Strengthen social care services and economic security for the disadvantaged

End hunger, ensure food safety, and promote sustainable agriculture

Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages

Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all

Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls

Ensure environmental quality and sustainable management of environmental resources

Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all

Promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all

Build an affordable, safe, environmentally friendly, resilient, and sustainable transportation structure

Reduce inequality within Taiwan, and between Taiwan and other countries

Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable

Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns

Improve adaptive actions to combat climate change and its impacts

Conserve and sustainably use the marine ecosystems, and prevent the degradation of marine environment

Conserve and sustainably use terrestrial ecosystems to ensure the persistence of biodiversity and prevent land degradation

Promote peaceful and inclusive societies, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable inclusive institutions

Establish diversified partnerships and work together to advance a sustainable vision

Build a nuclear-free homeland by 2025

During an interview on 18 September 2018, Chan highlighted Taiwan’s achievements against these goals, including the reduction of both household and industrial waste by 80% and biodiversity conservation, with eight of Taiwan’s species previously on the endangered list no longer endangered. He also noted Taiwan’s Electricity Act that states that, by 2025, nuclear power generation equipment should be completely shut down and the proportion of renewable energy in the energy mix should reach 20%.

New pledges totaling more than 11 million hectares were made by Burkina Faso, Tanzania and Togo ahead of the recently concluded Global Landscapes Forum (GLF) Africa 2018. To date, 27 African countries have made pledges to restore more than 96.4 million hectares of degraded land by 2030.

According to estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), Africa loses around three million hectares of forest annually, while 65% of land is impacted by degradation. AFR100 aims to contribute to an integrated and sustainable approach to forest and land restoration through supporting a “mosaic” of interventions such as agroforestry, planting, and natural tree regeneration, while also contributing to improved ecological functionality of degraded landscapes and the well-being of local communities.

During GLF Africa 2018, which took place from 29-30 August 2018 in Nairobi, Kenya, Burkina Faso announced that it would restore five million hectares of degraded forest landscapes, adding to pledges made by Tanzania and Togo to restore 5.2 million and 1.4 million hectares, respectively. The pledges were announced on the sidelines of the 3rd AFR100 Annual Partnership meeting, which convened from 26-28 August 2018 in Nairobi, Kenya. The key objectives of the meeting, which brought together 177 participants, included: highlighting landscapes where restoration is being successfully implemented and could be scaled up; showcasing policies and incentives that have supported implementation of large-scale forest landscape restoration (FLR); announcing new pledges to the AFR100 Initiative; and highlighting initiatives by development partners, international finance institutions and mechanisms to support implementation of their AFR100 commitments.

The commitments announced under AFR100 support the Bonn Challenge, the New York Declaration on Forests and the African Resilient Landscapes Initiative.

Discussions at GLF Africa 2018 also touched on strategies to enhance the application of monitoring tools, such as the Bonn Challenge Barometer of Progress and the Collect Earth tool, to track progress in achieving the intended country contributions. Two complementary monitoring tools were highlighted at the AFR100 partner meeting: TRENDS.EARTH, developed by Conservation International, which monitors land use changes using earth observations to measure progress towards SDG target 15.3 on land degradation neutrality; and the Global Land Tool Network, coordinated by the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), which tracks progress in access to land and tenure security issues.

AFR100 is a pan-African, country-led effort launched in 2015 with the overall goal of bringing 100 million hectares of land across Africa into restoration by 2030. The commitments announced under AFR100 also support the Bonn Challenge adopted in Germany in 2011, whose overall objective is to restore 150 million hectares by 2020, the New York Declaration on Forests that stretches the goal to 350 million hectares by 2030, and the African Resilient Landscapes Initiative (ARLI) to promote integrated landscape management to contribute to adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. AFR100’s lead implementation agency is the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), which hosts the Secretariat. The Initiative is implemented with support from the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) and World Resources Institute (WRI), with funding from the World Bank and Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).

The projects were based on the Global Compact’s Tenth Principle (anti-corruption) and on SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), with a focus on SDG target 16.5 to “substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms.”Through the projects, which were supported by the Siemens Integrity Initiative Second Funding Round, businesses, governments and civil society worked to increase compliance standards across Brazil, Egypt, Japan, Kenya and Nigeria.

In Brazil, Japan, Kenya and Nigeria, the project connected various stakeholders to discuss challenges and opportunities, as well as to identify collective efforts to combat corruption, increase transparency, and create an enabling environment for businesses and flourishing societies. The UNGC’s four Local Networks organized workshops that engaged 900 participants, helping them develop resources to improve anti-corruption compliance among business participants and establish a strategy to ensure ongoing commitment towards anti-corruption.

In Egypt, in collaboration with the Egyptian Junior Business Association, UNGC created the Integrity Network Initiative, a multi-stakeholder, business-led group of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) committed to tackling corruption. SMEs that joined the Initiative signed a ten-step Integrity Pledge and were trained on various aspects of anti-corruption compliance. The project trained personnel from over 400 SMEs and developed guidance materials for SMEs on topics including transparency in customs, public procurement, code of conduct, and internal controls, along with an online support desk.

To mark the completion of the projects, UNGC released the second edition of its publication titled, ‘Promoting Anti-Corruption Collective Action through Global Compact Local Networks.’

Also to increase government transparency, improve accountability, and strengthen citizen engagement as well as government responsiveness, on 19 July 2018 the World Bank and development partners launched the Open Government Partnership (OGP) Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF). The US$12 million Fund was created with Agence Française de Développement, the Department for International Development UK, and Global Affairs Canada.

In countries and sub-nationals that participate in the OGP, the MDTF will support implementation of open government reforms, an inclusive and participatory dialogue and decision-making process, and build an evidence base on the impact of open government reforms. The first awards were given to nine civil society organizations to facilitate the participatory process of developing OGP Action Plans in five countries and four sub-nationals.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will convene the meeting on 24 September 2018, on the margins of the UN General Assembly’s (UNGA) 73rd general debate.

The synopsis document outlines the Strategy’s background, objectives and way forward. According to the synopsis, the Strategy focuses on leveraging the convening power of the UN to bring together the relevant actors to accelerate mobilization of finance for the 2030 Agenda. The Strategy is built on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on financing for development (FFD), and on the Paris Agreement on climate change. It also draws on the work of the UN’s Inter-Agency Task Force on FFD, as well as ongoing work on financing within the UN and with its key partners.

The Secretary-General will provide a three-year roadmap of actions and initiatives covering the years 2018-2021.

The Strategy aims to accelerate progress in key areas where the leadership of the Secretary-General can galvanize action from the global to the local arena. Guterres sets out the key elements of the role that the UN can play in supporting the mobilization of finance for sustainable development, as well as actions that the UN will take to help accelerate and deepen the transformation of financial systems to provide development finance efficiently. The three key areas – or objectives – are:

Aligning global economic policies and financial systems with the 2030 Agenda;

Enhancing sustainable financing strategies and investments at the regional and country levels; and

Exploiting the potential of financial innovations, new technologies and digitalization to provide equitable access to finance.

As for the way forward, the Secretary-General will provide a three-year roadmap of actions and initiatives covering the years 2018-2021, building on current and future activities of key stakeholders, to mobilize investments and support for funding the 2030 Agenda. The UN Deputy Secretary-General will lead its implementation.

The high-level meeting on 24 September 2018 will serve to: launch the Secretary-General’s Strategy for Financing the 2030 Agenda; take stock of and accelerate eﬀorts by diﬀerent stakeholders to operationalize the AAAA; and build momentum around key actions and initiatives by national governments, business and the international community that have high potential to accelerate implementation of the AAAA and the 2030 Agenda, and call on actors to report back on progress at the 2019 High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development. Following the meeting, a Secretary-General’s summary will highlight key action points, as a guide to follow-up discussions on sustainable financing at relevant fora over the next three years.

UN Member States adopted a political declaration that recognizes the period 2019 to 2028 as the Nelson Mandela Decade of Peace, and calls for redoubling efforts to pursue international peace and security, development and human rights.



The ‘Nelson Mandela Peace Summit’ was mandated by UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution 72/243 of December 2017, in which UN Member States decided to hold a high-level plenary meeting on global peace in honor of the centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela. The Summit took place in New York, US, on 24 September 2018, the day before the start of the UNGA 73 general debate. The Summit was preceded by the unveiling of a statue of Nelson Mandela, offered to the UN by the government of South Africa in recognition of Mandela’s lifelong efforts to promote peace and security and protect human rights.

Governments and other stakeholders praised Mandela for living by the principles that underpin the UN, and for representing the values of peace, solidarity, cooperation, equality and respect for all human beings. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, president of UNGA 73, remarked that the principle of multilateralism is currently being challenged, but moving away from multilateralism is to endanger our species and our planet. She called for a social contract based on shared responsibility, and said the only existing space to achieve this contract is the UN. She described the UNGA as the most representative and legitimate space for dialogue and reconciliation.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Mandela, also known as Madiba, was one of humanity’s great leaders and had devoted his life to serving his community as a lawyer, a prisoner of conscience, a peacemaker, a president and a respected elder. He remarked that as president of South Africa, Mandela expanded access to health care, education, housing, water, sanitation and electricity, and championed women’s rights and South Africa’s landmark 1996 Constitution, “which remains a beacon for human rights and equal opportunity.” Guterres noted that 2018 marks the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but that human rights are currently under growing pressure around the world.

Speakers from Africa shared stories about Mandela’s role in strengthening democratic institutions, and said he inspired generations to struggle against oppression.

Representatives of several African countries shared stories about Mandela’s role in helping strengthening the region’s democratic institutions, noting that he inspired generations in its struggle against oppression. Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the African Union (AU), noted that the AU declared 2014-2024 as the ‘Nelson Mandela Decade for Reconciliation in Africa,’ and said this celebration of the centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela is a marker of freedom, solidarity and peace. Cyril Ramphosa, President of South Africa, said since the formation of the UN, several crises that have tested the limits of diplomacy and the multilateral system, and the UN has endured as a force for stability, cooperation and the peaceful resolution of conflict. Nowadays, he said, the UN faces more intricate and complex challenges, such as terrorism, transnational organized crime, illicit flows of finance and the growing number of refugees. He called for a UN that is responsive, adaptable and able to deal with challenges its founders could not have imagined. He also called on the UN to not rely on the “political interests of a few,” saying an impasse between major powers often impedes the entire organization’s ability to act.

Leo Varadkar, Prime Minister of Ireland (Taoiseach), remarked that peace is made “not with your friends, but with your enemies,” and reconciliation is achieved by “moving beyond the hurt and pain of the past towards truth and forgiveness.” He called for renewing efforts to advance gender equality around the world, and to give young people a greater say in the decisions that will affect them and the future of our planet.

Graça Machel, founding member of The Elders, noted that global security has deteriorated “remarkably” in the past decade, and the number of armed conflicts has increased. She said there is no justification for the loss of life and suffering in places like Syria, Yemen, Palestine, South Sudan, Central African Republic and Myanmar, and cautioned against the Summit being “another talk shop.” She said that she and the president of South Africa launched the Global Peace initiative, an initiative of the African Centre for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes (ACCORD) to bridge the gap between peace and development. She referred to the publication ‘Sparks of Hope,’ a compendium highlighting the courage and leadership of “change agents across the world,” and asked participants to the event to take inspiration from this work.

Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General of Amnesty International, said Nelson Mandela spent the vast majority of his life as a civil society activist, but today, as people gather to honor him, thousands of activists and human rights defenders around the world are imprisoned or have been tortured and killed. Naidoo asked to not adjust to the deadlocks that “continue to haunt the UN Security Council,” as the five permanent members use their power “not to prevent and stop suffering but shield themselves and others committing the worst crimes.” He also called for averting catastrophic climate change, noting that thousands are regularly devastated by extreme weather events. He called on “the one leader who still denies climate change” to put himself “on the right side of history.”

At the end of the opening segment, governments adopted the ‘Political Declaration Adopted at the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit.’ The declaration is the result of intergovernmental consultations that took place from May to September 2018 under the facilitation of Jerry Matthews Matjila, Permanent Representative of South Africa, and Geraldine Byrne Nason, Permanent Representative of Ireland. Per the declaration, Heads of State and government and other representatives of UN Member States recommend that the UN explore means to systematically consider the needs of present and future generations, including through inter-generational dialogue, within its decision-making processes. They also welcome the establishment of the UN High-Level Advisory Board on Mediation, encouraging its further efforts and contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security and prevention of armed conflicts.

In the declaration, countries: note that sustainable development cannot be realized without peace and security, and peace and security will be at risk without sustainable development; commit to redouble efforts to build a just, peaceful, prosperous, inclusive and fair world; emphasize the importance of a comprehensive approach to sustaining peace; recognize the need to address threats to global peace and security, including challenges to the primacy of multilateralism; and reaffirm commitment to uphold the sovereign equality of all States, respect for their territorial integrity and political independence. They also: encourage parties to armed conflict to take immediate, concrete measures to end cycles of conflict and prevent relapse; recognize that there is no single template for peace, and commit to availing their best practices to those who seek different models for peace; stress the importance of the equal participation and full involvement of women and the meaningful participation of youth in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security; and resolve to ensure the protection, rights and well-being of children, especially in armed conflict.

Countries and groups of countries addressed the Summit during a plenary session throughout the day. Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, said there is no unilateralism or “happy protectionism” since the world needs openness, cooperation, rules and principles to resolve conflicts, eradicate poverty, reduce inequalities, and develop free and fair trade that creates jobs and new opportunities for all. He called for mobilizing energy to reform, modernize and revitalize multilateral institutions, rather than disengaging from them.

Singapore for the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), noted that since its inception in 1967, ASEAN has worked to create a culture of dialogue, cooperation and consensus, and to support a common effort to achieve sustainable development. Saudi Arabia for the Arab Group said Nelson Mandela made clear that the South African revolution will never achieve all its aims until all people, including the Palestinians, also gain their freedom.

As noted by Secretary-General Guterres, in 2015, the UN decided to award the Nelson Mandela Prize every five years to two individuals who have made significant contributions to the service of humanity. In addition, Nelson Mandela International Day is observed each July, and is an occasion for all to take action and to promote and engage in community service.

The Summit followed the International Day of Peace on 21 September 2018, on the theme ‘The Right to Peace – The Universal Declaration of Human Rights at 70.’ The UNGA is expected to resume its tribute to Nelson Mandela on 2 October.

Children are most at risk in their first year, with the highest risk being among newborns in their first month of life. Based on current trends, the authors anticipate that about half the countries in the world will not achieve SDG targets on child mortality by 2030, but only after 2050.



The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Population Division of the UN Secretariat’s Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) and the World Bank collaborated on the child mortality report, which shows uneven progress, although child survival has improved among all age groups since the year 2000. Children in the poorest households are almost twice as likely to die before the age of five as those from the richest. Rural children are more at risk than urban children, and the children of mothers without any education are 2.6 times more likely to die before reaching the age of five, compared to the children of mothers with high school or tertiary-level education.

Environmental factors also influence child mortality. For example, exposure to air pollution is a factor in higher mortality levels among children under the age of one, the Group reports.

The agencies note that child mortality has declined in recent years, especially in children between one and four years old, where it declined by 60% between the years 2000 and 2017. Deaths of children under one year declined by 51% during the same period, while the rate for children aged 5-14 declined by 37%. However, in many places improvements are insufficient for meeting the 2030 deadline.

The report contains charts detailing progress by region and subregion, and calls for concerted efforts, investments and innovative approaches to accelerate progress, particularly in countries and communities that are falling behind.

173,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/wateraid-publishes-company-guide-to-assessing-business-case-for-wash/,"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,WaterAid Publishes Company Guide to Assessing Business Case for WASH,"30 August 2018: WaterAid and partners have launched a guide to help companies establish the business case for investing in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) as part of their operations in developing countries. The step-by-step guide titled, ‘Strengthening the Business Case for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: How to Measure Value for Your Business,’ enables companies to calculate the business value of WASH interventions and estimate their financial return on investment (ROI).

Launching the guide, WaterAid cited estimates that every US$1 invested in sanitation returns US$5.5 in increased productivity, and every US$1 invested in drinking water supply returns US$2.

The non-governmental organization (NGO) stated that progressive companies now view WASH as a “core business” priority, rather than considering it a part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) or philanthropic action. For example, ensuring better WASH services results in fewer worker sick days and greater efficiency of operations. The guide seeks to meet the need of companies to provide robust evidence of the financial value of investing in WASH.

WASH interventions can result in health and productivity benefits for people, and greater efficiency and resilience of supply chains.

Previous research conducted by WaterAid showed that, while many multi-national companies did have WASH policies in the workplace, there was typically less attention given to WASH in the supply chain and in workers’ homes.

The guide proposes six steps for measuring the business value of WASH interventions: 1) understanding the “impact pathway” in terms of the anticipated outcomes and impacts for people, communities and businesses; 2) identifying what to measure and how; 3) establishing a baseline; 4) implementing and monitoring WASH interventions; 5) analyzing data and measuring benefits; and 6) communicating the results.

The agency notes that WASH interventions can result in health and productivity benefits for people, greater efficiency and resilience of supply chains, and better stakeholder relationships for companies.

The guide was created and published in partnership with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and the Overseas Development Institute (ODI). Many other companies and international organizations contributed to developing the guide, including Diageo, Coca-Cola, Nestle, Sainsbury’s, UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and CARE International, among others.

WaterAid and partners launched the guide on 30 August at World Water Week in Stockholm, Sweden.

The awards event took place at Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, US, on 25 September 2018, with the ceremony hosted by Loyiso Madinga, a South African comedian from The Daily Show. Madinga and other speakers emphasized the uniquely important role of young people in solving problems and bringing people together, and of reaching across generations.

Johar’s poem was featured in a film, ‘We the Goalkeepers,’ screened at the start of the awards night. The poem concludes, “Because when you’re too tired of waiting on others/ to save the day/ You stand tall, and show that saving the world/ is child’s play.”

Melinda Gates, Co-Chair of the Gates Foundation, presented the Goalkeepers 2018 Progress Award to Dysmus Kusilu, founder of Solar Freeze. Kusilu said that growing up in Kenya, he was taught that to work in agriculture is to be a failure. Gaining inspiration from his “sweet grandmother and her sacrifices,” he decided to turn failure into success by inventing a pay-as-you-go service using mobile phones to help smallholder farmers store their produce more efficiently and increase their yields.

UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed told the audience of the UN’s launch of two youth initiatives earlier in the day: the Youth 2030 strategy and Generation Unlimited. She said the initiatives will put youth at the forefront of the UN’s work “in a more earnest way” than ever before. Among the areas of leadership shown by young people recently, she said the march towards gender equality and ending sexual harassment is “one of the loudest cries I’ve heard.”

Mohammed presented the Goalkeepers 2018 Changemaker Award to Nadia Murad, an advocate for the Yazidi community and genocide survivors. Murad said that following the 2014 attacks by ISIS to “ethnically cleanse” Iraq of Yazidis – during which Murad was abducted and enslaved – the majority of Yazidi people remain in IDP camps “in the same tents given to them in 2014.” Having lost her six brothers in the genocide and seen countless fellow Yazidi girls and women kidnapped, bought and sold, and disappeared, Murad said her survival “came with purpose, responsibility and hope.” However, hope “has an expiration date; it requires action to survive.” She said working together is the only way to heal after a genocidal campaign.

Henrietta Fore, UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Executive Director, said the Generation Unlimited initiative aims to ensure that by 2030 every young person is in school or age-appropriate training. She presented the Goalkeepers 2018 Campaign Award to Amika George, a student who founded the #FreePeriods campaign and has built support for the idea of period poverty.

When George accepted the award, she told the audience that girls around the world her age and younger miss up to 20% of their school curriculum each year because they cannot afford menstrual products, and she campaigns to provide the products for free. She urged, “enough with the shame” and euphemisms that belittle menstruation, and cause social isolation and educational lags for girls in poverty.

Bill Gates, Co-Chair of the Gates Foundation, noted that the average age of the leaders, innovators and activists featured during the ceremony was 24 years old. He welcomed Erna Solberg, Norway’s Prime Minister, praising her dedication to action for SDG 4 (quality education). Solberg spoke in her capacity as the co-chair of the UN Advocates for the SDGs to stress that “we need business with us” to reach the Goals.

The evening event also featured performances by Ed Sheeran, a singer-songwriter from the UK who performed against a backdrop of footage of himself and other Goalkeepers as babies and children, and Fatoumata Diawara, a singer-songwriter from Mali who was joined by the Brooklyn Youth Chorus.

175,https://bigthink.com/pfizer/inside-the-uns-global-health-goals-how-pfizer-is-supporting-sdg-3-good-health-and-well-being,"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Big Think,How Pfizer is supporting SDG #3: Good health and well-being,"Caroline Roan: We were proud to sign on to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

For us goal number three is our north star: ""Good health and wellbeing."" Every day our scientists are working to discover, develop and bring to market medicines and vaccines that help people live longer and healthier lives. And for us goal number three allowed us to have a dialogue and an engagement with the United Nations and with governments globally to ensure that we're partnering with them to provide access to quality healthcare.

When we think about access to medicines we think about a comprehensive strategy that includes both donation and philanthropic support as well as creative commercial strategies designed to drive access to the most vulnerable and underserved populations globally.

So for Pfizer we have a number of initiatives that we're very proud of. One which I like to say is our oldie but goodie was launched in 1998. The International Trachoma Initiative was launched to address a blinding disease called trachoma. At the time it was launched, we had a product that treated active infection that causes this disease. And if the infection goes untreated over time people do go blind. And what we discovered was that our medicine could treat this infection, but our medicine was not sufficient: Alone that medicine would not do the work that needed to be done at a public health level.

For our work to address a blinding disease called trachoma we've used a public health strategy called SAFE. SAFE stands for surgery – S, for advanced cases of the disease. A – the distribution of the antibiotic that Pfizer makes to treat the active infection. F which is face washing and E which is environmental development. Together that comprehensive initiative working now with more than a hundred partners has achieved elimination of this disease in six countries. That's profound. And it's one of our greatest accomplishments as a company. It did not happen overnight. It has taken more than two decades to achieve that progress, but we have our eyes on the prize which is full elimination of this disease by the year 2020.

Another example where Pfizer is working to meet the evolving global health needs is in the area of oncology. We have chemotherapy agents that are very important for patients globally. And we worked with our partners, the American Cancer Society, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, and CIPLA to make 11 prioritized chemotherapy agents available in East Africa where there is a disproportionate burden of cancer. We're really proud of that initiative because we're taking some of our very important core essential medicines and making them available to reach more patients in areas of the world that several years ago did not have this need.

So the business case for corporate responsibility has been debated for years and there are different perspectives on this. I think for Pfizer and for the pharmaceutical companies we can't deliver our business unless we deliver for society.Keeping that patient that we serve front and center to how we make the decisions that the company takes every single day.

When we discover, develop and bring to market medicines and vaccines that help people live longer and healthier lives our communities are healthier, society is healthier, and we deliver both for our business and our shareholders, but also for society.","For us goal number three is our north star: ""Good health and wellbeing.""

176,https://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/convention-on-biological-diversity-overcoming-research-impediments/,"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Convention on Biological Diversity: Overcoming Research Impediments,"Success of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) depends on our understanding of biodiversity. Hence, CBD and the subsequent Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-sharing (NP) urge signatory nations to promote and encourage research on biodiversity. However, imposition of sovereign rights of nations on their biological resources and the emphasis on the CBD third objective of fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources (GR) through access and benefit-sharing (ABS) are coming in the way of achieving the primary objectives of the CBD relating to conservation of biological diversity and its sustainable use.

In the meantime, examples of financially significant ABS agreements are scarce even after a quarter century of existence of the CBD. A survey of megadiverse countries having functional ABS legislation showed that very few commercial ABS agreements (2.05 per year per country) have been concluded, suggesting a lack of demand for GR by potential users. Instead, the regulations to harness perceived benefits by individual countries have made much needed biodiversity exploration and research difficult and in some cases even impossible. The global research community has been complaining about the challenges they face in accessing and exchanging biological material for research as well as international collaborations that are crucial for the global food security and conservation of biodiversity.

No Substitute for Sharing of Biological Resources

Biological resources being truly renewable, their use promotes further improvement and ex situ conservation as in the case of crop plants. Use of any biological resource in a given area does not limit its use elsewhere. However, throughout the negotiations in the run up to the CBD and NP, biological resources were treated akin to non-renewable resources such as oil and coal.

The principles underlying the CBD and NP are laudable, and both underscore that access to GR should also address the issues of equity. However, with the third CBD objective of ABS making a slip, it is becoming evident that the CBD and NP may not be able to address the issues of equity raised by developing countries at the Earth Summit in 1992, which ultimately culminated in nationalization of genetic resources. As governments began to enact national legislation to regulate access to biological resources within their borders for benefit-sharing from the derived products, consequences of such actions on biodiversity research and food security are being overlooked. The principal victim of these legislative actions is biodiversity research that includes inventories and international collaborations as its core. Such restrictions, apart from curtailing research and development, run counter to the objectives of the CBD. Enormous amounts of biological data, including Digital Sequence Information (DSI), are increasingly being published via the database portals of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC). The unlimited and open access DSI encourages collaboration among researchers besides enabling conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. As access to DSI is coming to the center stage of negotiations in the forthcoming 14th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 14) to the CBD, the global research community is increasingly concerned about the free flow of information, which is essential for the advancement of science.

New Treaty for Non-profit Research and Development

Not-for-profit research, such as inventories and taxonomic studies, intended for the public domain, should be differentiated from commercial research leading to proprietary rights. On the one hand, access has to be open when the benefits are in the public domain, and the providers of the biological resource are free to make use of the benefits just as anybody else. On the other hand, if the benefits are confined to the private realm through intellectual property rights, the provider may secure a share bilaterally.

The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA), popularly known as the “Seed Treaty,” provides a promising model for international collaboration on biodiversity research. The treaty ensures worldwide public accessibility to GR of essential food and fodder crops. While the CBD and NP necessitate access to GR on a bilateral basis through case-by-case negotiations, the Seed Treaty adopts a multilateral system for ABS (MLS) through a Standard Material Transfer Agreement, averting the need for bilateral negotiations. The MLS established under the Seed Treaty has been viewed as a very successful model in terms of volume of material exchanged (8,500 transfers every week) in contrast to the very limited performance of the bilateral system of the CBD and NP. Exchange of genetic material under the Seed Treaty is exempted from the NP requirements, and the benefit sharing requirement arises only when access for further research and breeding is restricted through intellectual property rights. One possible course of action for the CBD COP might be to add a legally binding treaty to promote and facilitate biodiversity research, conservation and international collaboration. Such a treaty could address legal uncertainties in the governance of global research commons such as microbial culture collections held by the World Federation of Culture Collections as well as DSI published through the portals of INSDC or taxonomic type materials held in various museums all over the world.

Intrinsically, GR is a public resource – truly renewable, non-rivalrous and non-exclusive – much similar to the knowledge resources. Its dissemination across national boundaries further enriches their diversity, value and conservation. For example, cultivation of a crop variety in a region does not limit its use elsewhere. Thus, it is imperative that GR are retained as common heritage. Man, as a biological species, depends more or less on the same GR for survival, irrespective of the national boundaries. Open access to GR addresses the issues of equity by ensuring access to biological resources for all. This advocates the universal freedom to study, distribute, modify and utilize GR by any one and for any purpose. As in the case of open source software licenses, many forms of free and open access licenses can be conceived for GR too. The open access model offers people the right to freely distribute copies and modified versions of GR with stipulation that the same rights should be preserved in derivative works in the future.

Biodiversity forms the basis of global food and livelihood security, and the nations of the world are linked in a complex web of genetic interdependence that ensures global food security. Countries have gained much more than their individual contributions through the exchange and sharing of a myriad kinds of crops and domestic animals from all over the world. Similarly, international collaboration is inevitable for understanding life on earth, its conservation and sustainable use. The objectives of the CBD are interlinked with the Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and three SDGs in particular: SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15 (life on land). It is time that the forthcoming CBD COP take stock of the impacts of parochial restrictions on open access and free exchange of biological resources due to the NP and national ABS regimes, and adopt the necessary course correction to help achieve sustainable development for all.

Article content The last string of the grant was whatever Community Living could come up with and the resources and tools they develop should be shared from a provincial level point of view with other remote rural communities in Ontario. “Throughout the last several months all the agencies have been working closely together developing and promoting the new Employment Connector services of SDG,” said Michelle Alguire, executive director of Community Living Stormont. “Although we are different agencies, we stand united with our belief in employment support. We believe that people with intellectual disabilities have the right to work in their communities and to earn a fair wage for the work they do.” Alguire said they also believed the Employment Connectors support services will engage and recruit new employers. “We are hoping this is what is going to happen,” she said. “They are going to engage and recruit new employers and build on the ones we already have. The service will also focus on explaining the reason why employers will benefit by hiring people with intellectual disabilities.” The Employment Connector services will also focus on on-site job coaching and provide the resources and tools people will need to educate and train the employees to do their job. “We are so excited by what is happening here and (we hope) you will be enthused by what is coming as well,” said Debbie Boardman, executive director of Community Living Dundas. “We are so pleased to be involved in this initiative for people who have intellectual disabilities.”

Boardman thanked a number of people who helped with the Employment Connectors initiative and made sure to thank a special young man. “I would be remiss if I didn’t thank Jeffrey (Faye),” she said. “Jeffrey is a young man who is involved in the video and he works at Foodland in Winchester. Thank you to Jeffrey for giving us the opportunity to share your story.” The video Boardman referred to was a promotional video to explain how employers can benefit by hiring a person with intellectual disabilities. The idea is to share this video across the province to assist agencies in rural areas. “I would like to thank the three executive directors for being very supportive in this endeavour,” said Maurice Dupelle, manager of Community Living Glengarry. It’s huge to brand a new program and promote it and try to implement it in our community.” “I’m anxious to see how it is going to be implemented and rolled out in our communities,” said Alguire.

178,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-urges-tackling-waste-management-on-world-habitat-day/,"Tue, 09 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Urges Tackling Waste Management on World Habitat Day,"1 October 2018: The UN recognized World Habitat Day with calls for increasing imagination and innovation to address global waste management challenges. The Day focused on the theme, ‘Municipal Solid Waste.’



According to the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), 99 percent of purchased items are discarded within six months, and the world produces two billion tonnes of waste annually. On World Habitat Day, UN-Habitat called for society to “make small adjustments to our consumption styles,” such as by making a conscious effort to fix broken items rather than throw them away, recycle correctly and identify and use alternatives to disposable plastic items, including bottles, cups, cutlery and plates.

The SDGs, the Paris Agreement on climate change and the New Urban Agenda (NUA) all address solid waste management. SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) includes target 11.6, which focuses on reducing the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management issues. SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) includes targets focused on environmentally sound management of all waste through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse (targets 12.4 and 12.5) and reduction of food waste (target 12.3). Under the Paris Agreement, countries’ nationally determined contributions (NDCs) can include action on waste management as part of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In addition, the NUA commits to “environmentally sound management and minimization of all waste.” UN-Habitat is working to support countries to translate these commitments into practical and sustainable actions at the local level.

The call for action on ‘Waste-Wise Cities’ asks communities, cities and towns around the world to rethink, reduce, recycle, refuse and reuse waste.

In a statement for the Day, UN-Habitat Executive Director, Maimunah Mohd Sharif, stressed that tackling waste management challenges “requires imagination and innovation,” and demands that people “rethink” waste. She observed that effective waste management “starts with us as individuals,” and stressed that, through collective action, the world can become “cleaner, greener, safer, healthier and happier.”

UN-Habitat supports cities to improve their waste management practices through implementing community-based waste management collection and recycling and supporting cities to design cost-effective systems to collect and dispose of garbage. The agency also created the ‘Trash to Art’ project, which invited local artists to “make a statement on sustainability” by creating art using discarded materials.

The global observance of World Habitat Day took place at UN-Habitat headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya. In a statement at the event, the President of Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta, described solid waste management as “one of the greatest challenges of our time in a rapidly urbanizing world.” He urged every single person to take personal responsibility for managing waste, and called for developing innovative and sustainable solutions to tackle the global solid waste problem.

Also on the Day, UN-Habitat and its partners discussed a call for action on ‘Waste-Wise Cities’ that aims to recognize cities’ efforts to lead effective waste management initiatives. The call for action asks communities, cities and towns around the world to “rethink, reduce, recycle, refuse and reuse waste.” Communities, cities or towns that improve their solid waste management and reduce their waste management expenditure will be publicly recognized as ‘Waste-Wise Cities.’

World Habitat Day is celebrated annually on the first Monday of October to reflect on the state of cities and towns and on the right of all to adequate shelter.

The publication describes the relationship between intellectual property, innovation and the SDGs, and showcases examples of WIPO’s contributions to the SDGs.



SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) explicitly recognizes the link between economic and social progress and innovation. In the publication’s introduction, WIPO Director General Francis Gurry elaborates on the relationship between intellectual property, innovation and the SDGs. He states that intellectual property as a policy “exists to create an enabling environment for – and to stimulate investment in – innovation,” and to create a framework for sharing and trading new technologies around the world. He further explains that the “economic imperative at the heart of innovation is fundamental to the process of societal transformation that the SDGs aim to achieve.

A WIPO-led partnership seeks to ensure that diseases that are more common among poorer populations are not neglected.

The publication titled, ‘WIPO and the Sustainable Development Goals: Innovation Driving Human Progress,’ highlights the role of innovation in achieving the SDGs, including SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and SDG 13 (climate action). On SDG 3, the report explains how intellectual property systems support health care innovation by encouraging investment in new drugs and technologies while reassuring companies of a secure return on their investment. To ensure that diseases that are more common among poorer populations or that affect comparatively few people are not neglected, WIPO leads a public-private partnership (PPP) to tackle neglected tropical diseases, malaria and tuberculosis.

On SDG 4 (quality education), WIPO works with its member States to support equal access to education, such as by implementing treaty-based adjustments to the intellectual property systems, so that books for visually-impaired people can be more easily shared across national borders. The WIPO-led ‘Accessible Books Consortium’ works to harness technologies to produce books for visually impaired people globally.

11.C Support least developed countries, including through financial and technical assistance, in building sustainable and resilient buildings utilizing local materials.

Progress to date

The progress report for SDG11 makes for bleak reading, confirming that delivering sustainable urban development is one of the biggest challenges set by the SDGs. ""With rapid urbanization, many cities are facing challenges in managing population growth, ensuring there is adequate housing and resilient infrastructure to support these growing populations, and addressing the environmental impacts of expanding cities and vulnerability to disasters,"" the UN states.

Rapid globalisation, which in recent years has seen the proportion of the global population living in cities top 50 per cent for the first time in human history, has triggered huge environmental and development challenges.

Between 1990 and 2014 the share of the global urban population living in slums may have fallen from 46 per cent to 23 per cent, but the rapid expansion of the overall urban population means the total number of people living in slums has risen from 689 million to 881 million.

This surge in the number of city dwellers has also seen one of the main environmental benefits of urban living eroded. Population density in cities is falling as they expand, often in an unmanaged fashion. Globally, the average rate of physical expansion of cities is about one and a half times that of population growth. Anyone who has ever visited an emerging economy mega-city will be unsurprised to hear the trend is most stark in Eastern and South-eastern Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and Central and Southern Asia.

The fall in urban density is driven in part by improving per capita incomes and transport links, but it also brings with it significant new challenges in the form of lost agricultural land, worsening congestion, and generally higher environmental impacts.

It also makes it harder to deliver the basic infrastructure many cities still lack. The UN's latest progress report confirms that managing solid waste ""continues to be a challenge in many regions with significant and adverse effects from uncollected waste in cities, including direct and indirect effects on the health of residents and the environment"".

A study of 213 cities found just a quarter of municipal solid waste is collected, with the share falling to less than half in the cities in sub-Saharan Africa.

Developing world cities face similar challenges improving resilience in the face of natural disasters and climate impacts. Unplanned and rapid urbanisation and poor land management, together with non-risk informed policies and investments are major underlying risk drivers of disaster mortality,"" the UN notes, and as result almost 90 per cent of disaster-related deaths between 1990 and 2013 occurred in low and middle-income countries.

The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction was agreed in 2015 and provides a template for countries to develop more effective disaster resilience strategies that are likely to become more important as climate impacts escalate. However, a recent UN survey found that of the 87 states that responded to the questionnaire, only 50 reported they have national disaster risk reduction strategies and 34 have local strategies in place. More encouraging progress is being made through investments in

Moreover, in 2015, out of 95 countries, 84 reported investing in drainage infrastructure and the adoption of building codes, but basic resilience remains a major issue for many large cities.

Meanwhile, industrialised and developing world cities alike continue to be gripped by a public health crisis in the form of air pollution. In 2016, 91 per cent of the urban population still breathed air that did not meet the WHO's Air Quality Guidelines value for particulate matter (PM 2.5) and more than half was exposed to air pollution levels at least 2.5 times above that safety standard. The emergence of electric vehicles and the growing adoption of clean air policies in European and US cities are yet to bring air quality into line with health standards in many regions.

Business implications

It is not just the majority of the global population that resides in cities, it is also the bulk of economic activity. Cities have always been the primary crucibles of business activity and as such SDG11 promises to address some of the major challenges businesses face and open up a raft of new opportunities for the private sector.

Delivering on SDG11 should drive significant new infrastructure investment, boost the global construction sector, and usher in a whole new sector in the form of fast-emerging 'smart city' technologies.

Meanwhile, improved air quality, road safety, more public transport and green spaces all promise to enhance employee health and productivity, while minimising costs to businesses from congestion and pollution. Similarly more resilient cities with clearer disaster management plans are likely to be critical to minimise the costs to businesses and insurers associated with rising climate risks.

However, the lack of clearly quantifiable targets or specific definitions for sustainable urban development, coupled with the slow progress to date in tackling urban problems and rapidly growing urban populations, especially in the developing world, all serve to fuel fears that businesses will continue to see unsustainable urban planning act as a drag on development.

Business risks

The primary risks associated with SDG11 will arise from any failure to deliver on the goals.

As the leading development economist Lord Nicholas Stern has long argued the only long term development path available is a sustainable development path. This is particularly apparent in cities, where endless congestion, choked air, and the insecurity created by slum conditions, make running a business infinitely harder.

Poor air, limited waste management services, and weak public transport provision all translate into higher costs, lower productivity, increased risks, and worse labour markets for businesses.

As has been evidenced in countless developing world cities, poorly planned urban development to provide new offices for businesses can create reputational risks as impacted communities respond to the resulting displacement and/or gentrification.

However, government efforts to deliver on SDG11 could also create some business risks. The private sector is likely to be required to contribute to the considerable cost of essential urban infrastructure upgrades, while new planning rules could slow development and new mega-projects could lead to short term disruption for businesses.

Business opportunities

The business opportunities arising from SDG11 are both multi-faceted and obvious. More sustainable cities are simply a better environment in which businesses can operate. They lead to lower air pollution, less crime, and less congestion, all of which result in lower running costs, as well as a healthier, wealthier and more productive populous from which to draw employees and consumers.

They are also essential to continued economic development, especially in climate vulnerable emerging markets. The wider adoption of the Sendai Framework will be of critical importance to many businesses facing rising risks with the insurance industry likely to put particular value on enhanced urban resilience efforts.

Similarly, the global tourism industry stands to benefit from the pledge to protect the world's cultural and natural heritage, although all businesses also stand to gain from employee and customer bases with the freedom to enjoy such resources.

More broadly, the commitment to tackle slums and provide drastically improved urban transport infrastructure provides a huge investment opportunity for many businesses, as well as a critical path for delivering efficiency savings and greenhouse gas emissions reductions through new smart city, internet of things, and AI enabled technologies.

Effective sustainable urban development and planning regimes should also help trigger progress against numerous other SDGs through enhanced resource and energy efficiency, reduced air pollution, and city environments that aid healthier and happier lifestyles. In short, the pace of the global revolutions in green buildings, smart grids, and electric vehicles will be determined to a large extent by what happens in cities.","11.3 By 2030, enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning and management in all countries.

Accompanying reports on the Task Force’s activities highlight interlinkages among actions directed at addressing climate change-related displacement and achieving the SDGs.

The Task Force was established following a request by the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 21) to the UNFCCC to the Executive Committee (ExCom) of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts (WIM). The Task Force presented its report to the eighth ExCom meeting, which took place in Bonn, Germany, from 18-21 September 2018.

The Task Force report, inter alia: provides the contextual background in which the recommendations were developed; summarizes the technical outputs of the Task Force’s activities; and links to more detailed reports of those activities, which were undertaken in collaboration with other UN agencies and international organizations.

The WIM ExCom set up the Task Force in March 2017 to develop recommendations for integrated approaches to avert, minimize and address displacement related to the adverse impacts of climate change, in accordance with the mandate to the WIM from COP 21. To provide input to the recommendations, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the Platform on Disaster Displacement (PDD) organized a stakeholder meeting from 14-15 May 2018 in Bogis-Bossey, Switzerland, which brought together Task Force members and those working on the human mobility and climate change nexus. The recommendations will be presented at COP 24 in Katowice, Poland, and are directed to the ExCom, UNFCCC and Paris Agreement constituted bodies, Parties, UN agencies, relevant organizations and other stakeholders. They are elaborated in a PDD-produced report, which looks at the evolution of the UN’s response to climate change and disaster displacement, current UN institutional frameworks and mandates for displacement related to climate change, and coordinating integrated approaches to disaster displacement associated with climate change.

While the migration and climate nexus is not explicitly referenced in the 2030 Agenda, the SDGs provide several entry points.

The Task Force report also includes summaries of its activities, which are elaborated in longer accompanying reports, produced by the lead agencies/organizations for that specific activity.

For example, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) produced a detailed report on the mapping of existing international and regional guidance and tools, including those related to averting displacement related to climate change, which highlights, inter alia:

The Capacity for Disaster Reduction Initiative (CADRI), which delivers capacity development services in risk reduction to support national efforts to achieve the SDGs;

The UN Development Programme (UNDP) SDGs Assessment Tool, which helps assess the contributions of climate action to the SDGs, and compiles information about the impacts of climate action, including displacement and resettlement, to feed into progress reports on nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and SDG implementation; and

The ‘Global Migration Group Handbook for Improving the Production and Use of Migration Data for Development,’ which includes guidance to producers and users of international migration data and is expected to contribute directly to monitoring SDG implementation.

[Publication: Mapping of Existing International and Regional Guidance and Tools on Averting, Minimizing, Addressing and Facilitating Durable Solutions to Displacement Related to the Adverse Impacts of Climate Change]

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) produced a report titled, ‘Mapping Human Mobility and Climate Change in International Processes, Policies and Legal Frameworks,’ which focuses on, inter alia, migration, displacement and planned relocation, as well as human rights and international labor standards. The report highlights, among other instruments, the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, which makes the link between climate change, disasters, environmental degradation, migration and achieving the SDGs.

It also suggests that, while the migration and climate nexus is not explicitly referenced in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the SDGs provide several entry points related to targets under SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and SDG 13 (climate action).

The guide titled, ‘Migration and the 2030 Agenda: A Guide for Practitioners,’ discusses the interlinkages between migration and the SDGs and suggests a process for integrating migration and the SDGs into legislation, policies, programmes, projects and other initiatives.



The publication was developed with the support of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). It notes that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development marks the first time that “migration is integrated explicitly into the global development agenda.” Within the 2030 Agenda, the central reference to migration is made in SDG target 10.7 (Facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people). Other targets are also related to migration.

The guide highlights the SDGs’ direct references to “migration-related issues,” as well as cross-cutting connections where SDG areas “may affect or be affected by migration.” On the SDG targets that directly reference migration (direct connections), the guide identifies: student mobility (SDG target 4.b); human trafficking and exploitation (targets 5.2, 8.7 and 16.2); labor migration and employment (targets 8.5, 8.7 and 8.8); migration governance (target 10.7); remittances (target 10.c); and migration data (target 17.18).

The publication identifies cross-cutting connections between migration and the following areas and targets:

Poverty and growth (SDG targets 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, 1.a, 1.b, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 and 10.1);

Social protection (SDG targets 1.3, 5.4 and 10.4);

Health (SDG targets 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.7, 3.8, 3.b, 3.c, 3.d, 5.6, 8.7, 8.8, 10.7 and 10.c);

Education (SDG targets 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 10.7 and 10.c);

Gender (SDG targets 5.2; 5.3, 5.4, 5.a and 5.c);

Children (SDG targets 1.2, 4.2, 4.5, 4.a, 5.1, 5.2, 8.7, 10.7, 16.2 and 16.3);

Cities (SDG targets 11.1, 11.3, 11.b and 11.c);

Climate change (SDG targets 1.5, 10.7, 11.5, 13.1 and 13.3);

Citizenship, rule of law and inclusion (SDG targets 10.2, 16.3, 16.4, 16.7, 16.9 and 16.b); and

Diaspora and partnerships for development (SDG targets 8.9, 9.2, 12.b, 17.3, 17.5, 17.13, 17.16, 17.17 and 17.18).

The authors note that the implementation of migration-related aspects of the 2030 Agenda should be integrated with other sustainable development initiatives, and should engage all levels of government and across sectors. It encourages users to adapt the process to fit their unique context, and outlines four steps of implementation, namely: kick-off; prioritization; implementation; and monitoring and reporting. The guide also highlights: tools designed to help organize and inform actors as they work through the implementation process; suggestions for stakeholder participation; and relevant case study examples.

Among the case studies, the publication documents the experience of Armenia, which initiated a process of nationalizing migration-related SDGs. The process involved: examining migration and development issues in the context of the SDGs; prioritizing relevant targets; and developing a set of proxy indicators. It also comprised efforts on data, including an exercise to map migration data, and the improvement of national migration data collection and usage.

Another example discussed in the guide concerns the implementation of an IOM project in Ghana to support the government in mainstreaming migration into national development policies and achieving policy coherence, in line with the SDGs.

In December 2018, governments will gather in Marrakech, Morocco, to adopt the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. The Compact is the first intergovernmentally negotiated agreement prepared under the auspices of the UN aiming to address all dimensions of migration in a comprehensive manner.

About HSBC Amanah’s SDG sukuk



On 20 September 2018, HSBC Amanah priced an offering of RM500 million for a senior unsecured fixed rate SDG sukuk, due in 2023, from its existing multi-currency sukuk programme of RM3.0 billion. The sukuk is rated AAA by RAM Rating Services Berhad and proceeds will be utilised for working capital in the ordinary course of HSBC Amanah’s Islamic banking business, to finance eligible businesses and projects in accordance with the HSBC Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Bond Framework.

HSBC Amanah, RHB Islamic Bank Berhad and Maybank Investment Bank Berhad acted as joint lead managers on this transaction while HSBC Amanah acted as the sole lead arranger and sole SDG structuring adviser. The offering received strong investor demand, with final orderbooks in excess of MYR1.4 billion and a bid to cover ratio of 2.85x from 25 accounts across government agencies and pension funds (51%), financial institutions (31%), insurance companies (9%), asset managers (8%), and corporates (1%).



The sukuk priced at the tight end of the final price guidance at a fixed profit rate of 4.30% per annum from an initial price guidance of 4.30%-4.40%. This transaction represents the lowest coupon for a 5-year non-government guaranteed sukuk/bond in the MYR market in 2018 to date as well as the tightest spread over the benchmark Malaysian Government Securities for a financial institution since 2013 and for an Islamic bank in the MYR market since HSBC Amanah’s inaugural MYR sukuk in 2012.

An accompanying symposium offered countries the opportunity to share national progress on statistics for implementing the SDGs and Agenda 2063 and to discuss regional indicators for the two agendas.



Heads of national statistics offices (NSOs) from 51 African countries, representatives from international organizations, intergovernmental organizations, NGOs, academia and research institutions and the private sector attended StatCom-Africa VI, which took place on the theme, ‘Enhancing the Capacity of National Statistical Systems to support policies for Africa’s economic diversification and industrialization.’ Participants identified the importance of national ownership, adequate resources and adequate resources for the region to support statistical transformation initiatives. They called for States to support the implementation of the SDGs and Agenda 2063 through the 2020 round of housing and population censuses.

In a keynote address, Vincent Hendricks, University of Copenhagen, Denmark, reflected that scientists do not typically like to sell themselves or their products, believing that their value is “self-evident,” but he said “it doesn’t work that way” in reality. He urged statisticians to realize that they “are the experts and not the politicians” and they should use their data “for the good of their communities.” He called for taking ownership of their data and using it to change their communities, advance democracy and help African governments promote evidence-based policymaking.

The meeting also reflected on key challenges faced by NSOs, including enhancing the capacity of statistical systems and aligning statistics with global, regional and national development agendas. Participants underscored the role of creative and innovative approaches to overcome challenges, and called for all stakeholders to collaborate to meet the growing demand for data to inform and implement development agendas. Participants also supported disaggregating indicators for monitoring basic human rights as a way to address inequalities, and investing in civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) system.

The Director of the African Centre for Statistics (ACS), Oliver Chinganya, presented the ACS’ proposed strategic framework for the 2018-2019 biennium. The framework aims to “improve the production, dissemination and use of quality data and statistics” within the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063. He said the Centre is working to support the design of national strategies on statistics, dissemination of information and best practices and production of harmonized statistics.

Participants took note of the statistical programme and urged UNECA to continue supporting States in building their statistical capacity in collaboration with the African Union Commission (AUC), the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the African Capacity Building Foundation (ABCF).

Also within the StatCom-Africa VI meeting, the 13th session of the African Symposium on Statistical Development (ASSD) convened in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 3-4 October 2018. The symposium focused on the theme, ‘Application of economic statistics and national accounts in support of sustainable development.’ Countries shared progress and challenges in statistical development in line with the SDGs, with some reporting on how their countries have aligned national development plans with the SDGs.

Others highlighted a lack of data to support SDG indicators. A representative for South Africa said that his country lacks data to compile economic indicators to support monitoring of targets under SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

The portal tracks 51 African countries’ progress towards the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and displays the data in either an index or a dashboard format.



The index provides an aggregate measure of a country’s progress across all 17 SDGs. Progress towards an indicator is standardized on a scale of 0 (poor progress) and 100 (strong progress), relative to the objective of that indicator. For example, SDG indicator 4.1.1 measures proficiency in school subjects. The closer a country’s students are to achieving proficiency in these subjects, the closer their index ranking is to 100. Each standardized indicator score is then aggregated to determine a single value between 0 (poor) and 100 (strong) to a country.

Only seven countries in Africa have scores over 60 out of 100: Egypt, Ghana, Cabo Verde, Algeria, Mauritius, Tunisia and Morocco.

Of the 51 Africa countries that had substantial data to develop an index score, only seven countries had scores over 60; Egypt (60.70), Ghana (62.45), Cabo Verde (63.36), Algeria (63.95), Mauritius (64.04), Tunisia (65.88) and Morocco, who had the highest score with 66.08. Conversely, 16 countries had scores below 50, with the two lowest scores recorded for Somalia (36.15) and the Central African Republic (35.70).

Aside from displaying data in an index format, users can also view countries’ progress towards each SDG in an interactive dashboard. In the dashboard, users can view countries index scores on an SDG-by-SDG basis, or view a countries’ overall progress towards the SDGs in a trend-based dashboard.

The trend-based dashboard presents countries’ progress by using red, orange, yellow or green arrows to represent decreasing, stagnating, moderately increasing or on track trends, respectively. For countries with no available data on an SDG, white is used. Users can decide to view all 52 countries data, or filter searches based on five geographic areas: North Africa, East Africa, Central Africa, Southern Africa and or West Africa.

According to the portal, progress towards the SDGs varies widely by country and region. In North Africa, four out of five countries with data are on track to achieving SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and half of the countries in Eastern Africa are on track to achieving SDG 15 (life on land). In Central, Southern and Western Africa, 30 of 35 countries with data are on track to meeting SDG 13 (climate action). Although progress towards the SDGs is being made throughout Africa, no country is on track to meet SDGs 2 (zero hunger), 3 (good health and wellbeing), 4 (quality education), 11 (sustainable cities and communities) or 14 (life below water).

The Africa SDG Index and Dashboard is built on the Global SDG Index and Dashboard, which SDSN launched in 2016. The release of the Africa focused platform was accompanied by a publication of the same name, which further details findings and the methods used to develop index rankings.

The announcement came during the seventh Conference on Climate Change and Development in Africa, which convened in Nairobi, Kenya, from 10-11 October 2018. African experts identified priorities and expectations for the continent, including:

effective implementation of existing instruments and conventions;

entry into force of Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol;

completion of work on the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP);

support for African initiatives, such as the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative and the Africa Adaptation Initiative; and

predictable and adequate finance to fight climate change.

Participants also emphasized that converting nationally determined contributions (NDCs) into investment plans and other climate actions requires the appropriate enabling environment, including aligning contributions with existing national plans and enhanced capacity-building interventions.

The conference aimed to facilitate science-practice-policy dialogue, which focused on advancing and sharing lessons learned from implementation of NDCs, the role of climate information and services (CIS) to support them and climate finance for NDCs, which will require significant inflows of conditional finance for their implementation. Partnerships in Africa related to NDC implementation include the Africa NDC Hub, the African Partnership Facility for NDCs and the NDCs facility of the Agence française de développement.

The initiative will focus strategically on the intrinsically interconnected areas of biodiversity and climate change.

The 21 million Euro Joint Pacific Initiative for Biodiversity, Climate Change and Resilience was launched during the One Planet Summit in New York, US, one year after it was announced by French President Emmanual Macron at the 2017 edition of the Summit. The EU and France are contributing 10 million Euros each, with an additional one million Euros coming from New Zealand and Australia. The initiative also welcomes contributions from other donors.

The initiative aims to build an international coalition to catalyze and streamline funding for climate action and biodiversity protection.

The joint communique by the four partners mentions that the initiative translates into concrete action their commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, complemented by the new European Consensus on Development, the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), and the Paris Agreement on climate change. Noting that these international agreements set global climate efforts on a new course, providing the international community “with an unprecedented opportunity for progress,” the communique links the initiative with SDGs 13 (climate action), 14 (life below water), 15 (life on land), 3 (good health and well-being), and 17 (partnerships for the Goals).

The communique further explains that the project embraces “the twin goals” of climate action and biodiversity protection, with the initiative seeking to build an international coalition to catalyze and streamline funding in these areas. By pooling resources and coordinating actions, it aims to help the Pacific region adapt to the effects of climate change, protect biodiversity, and increase resilience.

More specifically, the initiative will finance projects in areas such as climate change adaptation and mitigation, ocean governance (including sustainable fisheries and aquaculture), and the environment (including waste management, biodiversity and eco-tourism).

UK Environment Minister Thérèse Coffey urged other countries to designate 30 percent of the world’s oceans as marine protected areas (MPAs) to address challenges posed by climate change, plastic pollution and overfishing.

The UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Aichi Target 11 and SDG target 14.5 aim to protect at least 10 percent of coastal and marine areas by 2020. The UK is advocating for increasing this target to 30 percent by 2030. Currently, only seven percent of oceans are formally protected. Further, according to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment), more effective governance and management of these protected areas is critical to ensure that these MPAs are not “paper parks.”

Coffey is expected to encourage other countries to support increased coastal and marine ocean protection during the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA 73) high-level General Debate. The Government of the UK has also announced it will encourage adoption of the 30 percent target at the 14th meeting of the CBD Conference of the Parties in November 2018.

Marine protection should be the rule, not the exception.

In a statement in New York, US, UK Environment Secretary, Michael Grove, also emphasized the importance of global action to protect the world’s oceans. He said the UK has already protected marine habitats,“but we must go further.” He called for working together to ensure the health of the world’s oceans for future generations. The UK has classified more than 200,000 square miles of coastal waters as MPAs and has pledged to protect four million square kilometres across its overseas territories by 2020.

UN Environment Executive Director Erik Solheim welcomed the UK’s call to enhance global marine protection. He stressed that “marine protection should be the rule, not the exception.” UNEP Patron of Oceans, Lewis Pugh, described the Government of the UK’s action as a “landmark decision” for ocean conservation. He stressed, however, the importance of focusing “not only on the number but the nature of the protection,” explaining that fully protected MPAs are necessary for the ocean to recover. If other countries join the UK and follow through on their commitment, he said, such a decision will be “the most important moment for ocean conservation in history.” [UNEP Press Release] [CBD Aichi Targets] [Lewis Pugh Website on Ocean Protection Press Release] [Climate Action Press Release]","25 September 2018: The Government of the UK has called for protecting 30 percent of the world’s oceans by 2030.

The funding will support countries in Africa and Asia to prevent wildlife poaching and illegal wildlife trade and help countries to reduce consumer demand for species and their products.

According to the GEF, there is an urgent need to tackle wildlife crime. Leopards are extinct in 23 out of the 89 African and Asian countries where they originally lived, and only four percent of tigers remain in the wild. In Africa, the numbers of African elephant and black rhino are “plummeting.” Birds, pangolins, primates, sharks, turtles and other species are all facing severe pressure from wildlife trade.

Illegal trade in wildlife is one of the “most lucrative illegal businesses in the world,” generating between US$7 billion to 23 billion per year. This crime contributes to corruption and conflicts and deprives local communities of natural capital and opportunities to benefit from nature-based tourism. The GEF estimates that crimes affecting natural resources “cost societies more than US$70 billion a year.”

Illegal trade in wildlife is one of the most lucrative illegal businesses in the world.

The GEF is working to tackle wildlife crime through its Global Wildlife Programme (GWP), which works in 19 African and Asian countries. The partnership focuses on wildlife conservation and crime prevention for sustainable development and is funded by the GEF and led by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment). The increased funding will broaden the partnership’s reach and impact and help countries to take their own measures to tackle illegal wildlife trade.

The GEF has allocated a total of US$168 million to combat wildlife trafficking during its GEF-7 funding cycle, which runs from 2018-2022. The GEF announced this increased funding in advance of the ‘Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference,’ an event hosted by the Government of the UK. The event aims to combat wildlife trade as a serious organized crime, close markets for wildlife species and products and build coalitions to deliver change.

The report observes that open dumpsites generate greenhouse gases (GHG) that can negatively impact the region’s agriculture, biodiversity and tourism.

The report titled, ‘Waste Management Outlook for Latin America and the Caribbean,’ finds that the region inadequately disposes of 145,000 tons of waste every day. Although LAC has improved its waste collection coverage, the uncollected waste affects more than 40 million people, particularly those living in impoverished or rural communities.

The report further highlights challenges posed by LAC’s management of organic waste. This type of waste represents approximately 50 percent of all waste produced in the region but is the least managed. As a result, the region’s unmanaged organic waste contributes to generation of GHGs, including methane, and degrades the quality of other recyclable materials in the garbage.

Waste management is a key step in strengthening climate action and protecting human health.

LAC’s linear economy system, which is based on a “throwaway scheme,” poses another challenge to sustainable waste management. Only ten percent of the region’s waste is recycled, reused or recovered, underscoring its limited progress in transitioning towards a circular economy. By 2050, the report predicts that 671,000 tons of urban waste will be generated daily by 2050.

The report identifies improved organic waste management and movement towards a circular economy as potential opportunities for the region to transition to more sustainable waste management. UNEP also recommends that countries close open dumps to minimize effects on human health and the environment. Additional recommendations focus on developing laws and policies on waste management, promoting public and private investments and raising awareness on sustainable waste management and the circular economy.

Such actions are in line with global commitments under both the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change. SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) includes targets focused on environmentally sound management of all waste through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse (targets 12.4 and 12.5). Under the Paris Agreement, countries’ nationally determined contributions (NDCs) can include action on waste management as part of efforts to reduce GHG emissions.

UNEP launched the report during the XXI Forum of Ministers of Environment of the region, taking place in Buenos Aires, Argentina, from 9-12 October. UNEP’s Regional Director for LAC, Leo Heileman, urged LAC countries to “consider waste management a top political priority” and a key step in strengthening climate action and protecting human health.

The A4SD survey also explores follow-up and review processes for SDG implementation at all levels.

The HLPF plays a central role in overseeing a network of SDG follow-up and review processes at the global level. In 2019, the UN will hold two sessions of the HLPF: one under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), from 9-18 July, and another one at the level of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), on 24-25 September.

The A4SD survey, prepared in collaboration with Newcastle University, includes a total of 31 questions addressed to civil society stakeholders. The questions focus on follow-up and reviews of the 2030 Agenda implementation at the national, regional and global levels.

The Action for Sustainable Development survey asks how governments continue to engage after their VNR presentations.

At the national level, the survey examines topics such as: the shift in policies and priorities by governments to focus on the sustainable development agenda; opportunities and level of engagement in the follow-up and review and process, including in Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs); and how governments continue to engage after their VNR presentations.

At the regional level, the survey explores items such as: linkages between UN regional follow-up and review mechanisms and VNR countries, including in terms of sharing lessons learned from previous VNR countries; providing opportunities for multi-stakeholder partnerships; and assessing regional challenges and shared regional targets. The survey also includes questions on the effectiveness of various elements of engagement such as giving access for persons with disabilities, organizing outreach in different languages, providing funding to enable stakeholders to participate in official meetings, and strengthening the capacity of national stakeholders to engage.

At the global level, the survey explores engagement opportunities provided to stakeholders on, inter alia, accessing relevant information and documents, participating in formal meetings of the HLPF, and contributing independent evidence, assessments, and reports. It also considers the effectiveness of the HLPF engagement modalities, and calls on stakeholders to provide their views on activities such as: the inclusion of “shadow” or “parallel” reports by stakeholders on the UN’s online VNR platform; the organization of official HLPF sessions aiming to exchange learning experiences between national governments and stakeholders; ensuring a more accessible stakeholder accreditation process; and giving greater opportunities for civil-society-led side events.

The survey is available online in English, French and Spanish, and responses should be submitted by 9 November 2018.

The UN Foundation’s annual stakeholder survey aims to take stock of the 2018 HLPF, and to gather views on how to maintain momentum on SDG implementation and ensure success at the 2019 HLPF sessions and beyond. The survey considers, among other topics: the overall takeaways of the 2018 HLPF; the effectiveness of HLPF events and sessions; aspects of the VNRs and the thematic reviews that are effective and that could be improved; the extent of stakeholder groups’ participation in the HLPF; conditions required to make the 2019 HLPFs and VNRs a success; ways to maximize the effectiveness of the 51 countries that will present their VNR at the 2019 HLPF; and “what we must get right” in 2019 to ensure SDG achievement by 2030.

The survey is available online and responses are due by 31 October.

Beginning in 2019, governments are expected to initiate a process of reviewing UNGA resolution 67/290 on format and organizational aspects of the HLPF and UNGA resolution 70/299 on Follow-up and Review of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at the Global Level.

The two reports were released in advance of the London Conference on Illegal Wildlife Trade in October, which focuses on ways to mobilize global efforts to address the poaching crisis endangering elephant, rhino, and other species populations.

The publications titled, ‘China’s Ivory Market after the Ivory Trade Ban in 2018,’ by TRAFFIC and ‘Demand under the Ban: China Ivory Consumption Research Post-Ban 2018,’ commissioned by TRAFFIC and WWF, provide a first analysis of trends in supply and demand for ivory products in China’s markets since the new legislative changes.

According to China Ivory Consumption Research Post-Ban 2018, 14% of respondents claim to have purchased ivory in the past 12 months, compared to 31% of respondents who reported doing so in a similar 2017 pre-ban survey. Since 2017, the number of stores with ivory for sale decreased by 30%, though the publication notes that the number remains high, given that trade is now banned. Online illegal ivory trade appears to also be declining, and the average number of new ivory advertisements decreased by 26.6% on websites and 10.6% on social media platforms, from pre- to post-ban.

Further amplification of messaging is needed to increase public awareness.

General support for the ivory ban is high, with nine out of ten respondents expressing their agreement with and support for the ban once made aware of it.

However, data reveal that ivory trafficking hotspots remain, including along the border with Viet Nam. Another point of concern, the publication notes, is the low level of awareness of respondents when asked about the ivory ban. While spontaneous (unprompted) awareness of the ban has doubled since the law changed – from 4% to 8% of those surveyed – further amplification of messaging is needed to increase public awareness.

SDG target 15.7 asks countries to take urgent action to end poaching and trafficking of protected species and address both demand and supply of illegal wildlife products. The studies find that 18% of regular outbound travelers bought ivory products on trips abroad, with Thailand and Hong Kong being the top two markets. The publications emphasize that making Chinese travelers aware of the ban and alternative souvenirs to ivory is critical to ensure continuation of positive demand reduction, and carry over into long-term benefits for wild elephant populations.

The publications titled, ‘China’s Ivory Market after the Ivory Trade Ban in 2018,’ by TRAFFIC and ‘Demand under the Ban: China Ivory Consumption Research Post-Ban 2018,’ commissioned by TRAFFIC and WWF, provide a first analysis of trends in supply and demand for ivory products in China’s markets since the new legislative changes.
General support for the ivory ban is high, with nine out of ten respondents expressing their agreement with and support for the ban once made aware of it.
Another point of concern, the publication notes, is the low level of awareness of respondents when asked about the ivory ban.

We focus particularly on knowledge offerings relating to SDGs 8 (decent work and economic growth), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and 10 (reduced inequalities).

Technological progress reshapes, rather than replaces, markets and production systems, according to WDR 2019.

The World Development Report (WDR) 2019, released during the meetings by the World Bank Group, focuses on “the changing nature of work,” particularly in the face of technological advances and fears that automation will replace employees with machines. The publication asserts that such fears are unfounded, noting that technological progress reshapes, rather than replaces, markets and production systems. It considers issues raised by automation and digitization vis-à-vis businesses, and reviews how these impacts can be harnessed to promote social protection and inclusion, describing the idea of a new social contract. A summary blog on the report is also available. The report also presents the World Bank’s Human Capital Index, which was formally launched in Bali. A World Bank press release notes that “jobs of the future require more investment in people.”

However, Sophie Edwards reports on Devex that civil society responses to the WDR have been less than positive, due to “a strong deregulatory thrust” and “attacks on many basic work rights” in a world where “technology is pushing down the value of labor in the economy.” Edwards notes that in a side session during the annual meetings, World Bank staff painted an optimistic scenario where new opportunities are created, but flagged that the poorest citizens and informal workers may not be able access those new jobs without increases in social protections from governments.

Also exploring fears of negative impacts on employment, the Pathways for Prosperity Commission on Technology and Inclusive Development released a report titled, ‘Charting Pathways for Inclusive Growth: From paralysis to preparation.’ The report examines the impact of technological innovation on growth, jobs and livelihoods, recognizing that “technologies are radically transforming peoples’ lives.” It explores whether frontier technologies such as machine learning will indeed benefit the world’s poorest. The Commission finds that estimates of job losses due to automation—which range from 9-80%—are misleading because the methodologies behind them tend to “ignore the upsides of technological progress” that often result in new opportunities. The report identifies five pathways that developing counties can pursue to ensure inclusive growth: 1) raising value from agriculture; 2) new global value chains in manufacturing; 3) global trade in services; 4) linking the informal sector to the formal economy; and 5) diverse, connected domestic economies that reduce costs and increase innovation. Across these pathways, the Commission underscores the need to create “a digital-ready country” that guides markets towards innovation through broad support for entrepreneurs and maximizes inclusiveness by ensuring a level playing field. The Commission is hosted by Oxford University’s Blavatnik School of Government.

Shanta Devarajan, Acting Chief Economist of the World Bank, compares the two publications above – ‘The Changing Nature of Work’ and ‘Charting Pathways for Inclusive Growth’ – in a post on The Brookings Institution’s blog titled, ‘the future of inclusive growth.’ Devarajan notes that both paint “an optimistic picture of the impact of technology on developing countries” and “provide a robust platform for harnessing the power of technology for inclusive growth.” Each report, he explains, addresses the impacts of technology on inequality, noting that efficiency gains outlined in the Pathways report can benefit poorer segments of society. He writes that farmers, who tend to have comparatively low incomes, could benefit from improved crop yields driven by data analytics and biotechnology. However, he cautions that the WDR articulates a blurring of firms’ boundaries, changing production patterns and employment trajectories.

Turning to SDG 10, Development Finance International (DFI) and Oxfam launched the Commitment to Reducing Inequality (CRI) Index 2018. The index, which assesses governments by their initiatives to bridge the gap between rich and poor, focuses on efforts in three policy areas: social spending, progressive taxation, and higher wages and stronger labor rights for workers (particularly women). This second edition builds on the 2017’s “beta version,” adding new sub-indicators in the tax and labor categories. Top overall performers include Denmark, Germany and Finland, while laggards are Nigeria, Uzbekistan and Haiti. However, the findings stress that all of the 157 countries it covers “could do more, even those near the top.”

IBON International published a paper, titled, ‘Implementing the World Bank Group’s Maximizing Finance for Development (MFD): Reinforcing Corporate Capture of the Global South.’ The piece looks into the implementation of the MFD model in Indonesia, Kenya and Peru, and articulates a need to move beyond this approach. The authors argue that the systematization of private actors in the model poses risks to peoples’ right to participate in development. They cite a UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) report that finds “differences in private and social returns” of “bankable” projects under the MFD approach, and call for national development strategies to “be owned and led by the people… whose rights to land, social services and to development are at stake.”

On financing poverty eradication more broadly, Development Initiatives launched ‘Investments to End Poverty 2018’ during the IMF and World Bank meetings. The report explores ways of strengthening aid amidst a “rapidly changing development finance landscape,” the mobilization of all resources to leave no one behind, and moving from data to impact through increased transparency. The executive summary emphasizes that business as usual leaves people behind, and that urgent action is needed to change trajectories on meeting aid commitments and identifying the synergies between difference resources. It highlights growing global inequality, lamenting that that the world’s poorest are “falling further and further behind,” that information provision has not kept pace with the need for disaggregated data, and that investments must be made to ensure both wellbeing and economic potential, such as social protection, health and education.

Finally, as noted above, the World Bank launched its Human Capital Index, one pillar of the Human Capital Project, which aims to raise awareness on lack of investments in “human capital,” which encompasses peoples’ skills, health, knowledge, and resilience. Investing in these areas can enable increased productivity, flexibility and innovation, and can act as “a central driver of sustainable growth and poverty reduction,” the authors argue. The Index reviews five indicators on health and education that can be linked to productivity as an adult, in order to arrive at an aggregate score between 0 and 1. As noted by Devex, Singapore tops the list with a score of 0.88. The Human Capital Summit was held on 11 October 2018, in the margins of the IMF and World Bank meetings.

A report by McKinsey Global Institute titled, ‘Outperformers: High-growth emerging economies and the companies that propel them,’ examines why some emerging economies have grown faster and more consistently than others. The report examines 71 developing economies and identifies two factors that help explain their “outperformance”: a policy agenda that promotes growth, and the role of large companies. Among other findings, the authors highlight changes in the global landscape on demographics, trade patterns and the digital revolution, which they note provide new opportunities in both manufacturing and services.

The Strategy underscores the UN’s critical role in supporting and accelerating the mobilization of finance and focuses on three objectives to accelerate progress from global to local levels, linked to areas where the Secretary-General’s leadership can galvanize action.Titled, ‘The Secretary-General’s Strategy for Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2018-2021),’ the Strategy was released on the occasion of a UN High-level Meeting on the same topic on 24 September 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. A synopsis was released on 17 September 2018 as part of the webpage for the meeting.

The Strategy’s first objective is to align global financial and economic policies with the 2030 Agenda. The Strategy argues that, when public policies are “firmly and consistently formulated to achieve sustainable development,” such policies can realign incentives and alter market perceptions of risk. At the same time, despite growing private interest in impact and sustainable investing, there are not yet globally agreed definitions of concepts and existing sustainability principles have not led to standards to guide sustainable finance, including sustainability bonds, SDG bonds or green bonds.

To deepen markets for sustainable finance, the UN is framing discussions on definitions, principles, guidelines and standards.

To address these challenges, the UN is working with global policymakers and regulators to increase understanding on the role of public policy in developing a sustainable financial system, including through framing discussions on definitions, principles and guidelines and developing standards to facilitate the deepening of markets for sustainable finance. In addition, private financial institutions are working with the UN to understand the relevance of environmental, social and governance challenges to finance, such as considering how to address sustainably in private enterprise and finance business models.

The Strategy’s second objective aims to enhance sustainable financing strategies and investments at country and regional levels. To achieve this objective, the UN will support the development of sustainable financing strategies at the country and regional levels, including by providing advice and support for creating investible projects, building enabling environments and developing financing strategies. UN country offices and regional teams will also provide capacity building support for domestic resource mobilization (DRM) to support countries to strengthen and increase the effectiveness of their tax systems to provide government funding for the SDGs, including by addressing illicit financial flows, base erosion, tax evasion and tax transparency.

The third objective focuses on seizing the potential of financial innovations, new technologies and digitalization to provide equitable access to finance. The Strategy identifies access to finance as a prerequisite for sustainable and equitable development, noting that the digitalization of finance has facilitated “major progress in financial inclusion” in recent years. Despite this progress, large gaps remain, particularly for women, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and people in the poorest countries. To close these gaps, the UN will bring together policymakers, financial regulators and innovators in the space of digital finance and fintech to exchange experiences and best practices on innovative financial instruments, including on the implication of new financial technologies for regulatory frameworks and the development of global norms.

To execute the Strategy, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will provide a three-year roadmap of actions and initiatives. The roadmap will build on key stakeholders’ current and future activities to mobilize investments and support for financing the 2030 Agenda.

The Deputy Secretary-General will lead the Strategy’s implementation on behalf of the Secretary-General, in coordination with heads of entities within the UN system.

The guide highlights that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development requires using the best data and information available from multiple sources to design, implement and monitor evidence-based policies, and interpreting and sharing data and information “in a way that is logical and makes sense.”

Authored by Luis Gerardo González Morales, UN Statistics Division (UNSD), and Tom Orrell, Founder, DataReady Limited, on behalf of the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD), the guide defines interoperability as the ability to join up data without losing meaning. It clarifies that data are interoperable when they can be easily re-used and processed in different applications, allowing different information systems to work together.

The guide titled, ‘Data Interoperability: A Practitioner’s Guide to Joining up Data in the Development Sector,’ proposes a roadmap that can be used as an assessment framework by data managers in development organizations and governments to assess the degree to which their systems are interoperable. It brings together examples of good practices from across the development sector, and notes that new sections, examples and guidance will be used to update the guide.

Chapter 1 on data management, governance and interoperability discusses institutional frameworks and interoperability, oversight and accountability models, as well as legal and regulatory frameworks. It stresses the importance of “effectively governed” data, as data need to be controlled with oversight and accountability as they move within and between organizations during its lifecycle. It also notes that data issues need to be considered cross-cutting, in the same way that gender, human rights and partnership issues are considered in the development field, and calls for more cogent management, funding, oversight and coordination.

Chapter 2 on data and metadata models makes specific recommendations to overcome structural obstacles to data interoperability. It also provides guidance and examples for modelling multi-dimensional data in the development sector.

Chapter 3 explores the role of standard classifications and vocabularies in data interoperability, and highlights examples of commonly used classifications and vocabularies in the development sector. It stresses the need to adopt standard vocabularies and classifications early in order to expose data without ambiguities.

Chapter 4 on open data formats and standard interfaces provides an overview of various approaches that exist to make data “discoverable,” and discusses data formats, application programming interfaces and user interfaces to support interoperability. Chapter 5 on linked open data outlines guidance on the dissemination of data and statistics on the web.

The production of the guide was supported by an Advisory Group drawn from the Collaborative on SDG Data Interoperability membership. The Collaborative is convened by UNSD and GPSDD, and comprises over 90 individuals, ranging from official statistics representatives to local civil society groups.

The UN World Data Forum 2018 convened from 22-24 October, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

The project seeks to serve as communication and educational tool to engage the global public in the SDGs.



The Good Life Goals is a joint initiative, and the 10-YFP Sustainable Lifestyles and Education programme, co-led by the governments of Sweden and Japan, is represented in the project by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) and the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES). Launching the goals at UN Headquarters in New York, US, on 25 September 2018, Solitaire Townsend, Co-founder of Futerra, remarked that sharing a set of clear Good Life Goals and meaningful actions for each SDG can help build confidence that everyone is important, needed, and can contribute to achieving the SDGs.

For each SDG, the Good Life Goals propose five actions that people can take to have tangible impact on the SDGs. For example, on SDG 1 (no poverty), the project outlines the five following actions to “help end poverty”: i) learn the causes of poverty at home and abroad; ii) share and donate what you can; iii) buy from companies that pay people fairly; iv) save, borrow and invest responsibly; and v) demand decent wages and opportunities for all.

On SDG 13 (climate action), the project suggests to “act on climate” by: i) learning about climate solutions; ii) calling “for more renewable energy in your country;” iii) eating more plants and cutting down on meat; iv) walking and cycling rather than driving; and v) demanding leaders to take bold action “today.” A video on the Good Life Goals provides an overview of the actions that can be taken for each of the SDGs.

A WBCSD press release notes that, from a business perspective, the Good Life Goals can provide companies with valuable insight into the ways the SDGs link to the actions, activities and lifestyles of their customers, and this understanding can help brands more effectively engage with people around the behaviors that are connected to their products and services. WBCSD also remarks that exploring the linkages between people’s day-to-day lives and the SDGs can help businesses identify innovation opportunities capable of offering better and more sustainable lifestyles. Finally, the Good Life Goals can be used by brands, NGOs and governments to engage their audiences effectively in influencing sustainable development, and can provide companies with a simple tool that they can use to enhance awareness of the SDGs among their own staff and promote a corporate culture that is aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, WBCSD says.

SDG Impact aims to empower investors and businesses to contribute to the SDGs, including by providing country-level data and SDG investment roadmaps.

The initiative invites investors and companies of all sizes to: 1) adapt and transform their core business strategies to deliver financial, social and environmental performance, and 2) to use the SDGs as the basis for engaging in untapped markets.

The event titled, ‘How the Private Sector Can Align to the SDGs,’ took place on 25 September 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US, served as the “soft launch” of SDG Impact, and was organized by UNDP and the governments of Turkey and Norway. Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator, said SDG Impact aims to empower investors and businesses with the clarity, insights, and tools required to support and authenticate their contributions to achieving the SDGs. It will have three offerings, beginning with “impact management,” which encompasses the principles, frameworks, and standards to help investors channel capital toward SDG achievement. UNDP has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Impact Management Project (IMP), which is a collaborative effort of over 1000 organizations, housed by Bridges Fund Management, that works with investors on delivering impact through financial investment.

Steiner said UNDP expects to establish SDG impact management standards, working in partnership with IMP and a network including the International Finance Corporation, the Principles for Responsible Investment, the Global Reporting Initiative, the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative, and the UN Global Compact. The newly developed standards will be the basis for an SDG Impact Seal and Certification programme, he noted.

The second offering of SDG Impact, Steiner said, is “impact intelligence,” to provide investors with insight into local industries, entrepreneurs and projects that advance the SDGs. Finally, “impact facilitation” involves leveraging UNDP’s in-country presence for network development, and matchmaking between investors and enterprises working to achieve the SDGs. This component entails a forum called ‘SDG Impact Investor Convenings’ to build cross-sector connections and identify investment opportunities. An SDG Accelerator initiative of UNDP, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Republic of Turkey is currently in a testing phase, and will launch in Turkey to help enterprises and start-ups align their businesses with the SDGs.

Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, Turkey’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, explained that by utilizing the convening power of UNDP, the Accelerator Program aims to catalyze market-based solutions for challenges of displaced people and residents of the least developed countries (LDCs). Upon the request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, UNDP is running a feasibility study for the SDG Impact Accelerator. The initial project partners estimate that the design of the Accelerator and its feasibility plan will be completed by the beginning of 2019.

Jens Frølich Holte, State Secretary, Norway’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stressed that “it is a big problem if we educate our youth into unemployment,” thus vocational education is needed to respond to the demands of the labor market. He said Norway has launched a knowledge bank that serves as one-stop shop for expertise, ranging from fisheries and renewable energy to petroleum and taxation, and Norway will focus on investments in vocational training. He added that the lack of relevant skills also presents a major problem for the private sector.

Tilak Marapana, Sri Lanka’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, said his government has started several social impact funds, from private equity to debt, including a US$5 million fund to provide support for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). He mentioned that the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Sri Lanka is vibrant with many ideas, but needs access to financing and private sector support. To that end, the government has supported the creation of a binary impact investment network.

Stefano Manservisi, Director-General of the European Commission’s Directorate General for International Cooperation and Development (DEVCO), said the Commission currently focuses on EU countries’ meeting their official development assistance (ODA) commitments, as “we need to move from billions to trillions, but we need first the billions.” Two other EC priorities that he identified included fostering investing and working with countries to leverage domestic resource mobilization (DRM), especially through taxation. As sectors of particular importance for the Commission, he mentioned agribusiness, energy, creation of MSMEs, cities and digitalization. He called for a mix of ODA, public policies and private investment, he announced that the EC will invest €24 million over the next four years in the Horn of Africa.

Five UN entities shared their expertise on illicit trafficking in wildlife and strengthening wildlife legislation.

The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment), the Secretariat of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES), the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC) organized the Symposium, which convened in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, from 11-12 September 2018. Participants representing criminal justice authorities and national wildlife management authorities came from over 19 francophone and lusophone African countries to attend the event.

In advance of the Symposium, a survey found that countries in Central and West Africa apply more lax penalties for wildlife crime compared to East Africa and Asia, which apply tougher penalties, both in terms of prison time and monetarily. In Central and West Africa, the average prison time for wildlife crime is two months, with an average maximum prison time of five years. Participants from Central and West Africa acknowledged the need for tougher penalties in the region, saying they will work to increase penalties for wildlife crime in Central and West Africa.

UNEP presented analysis it had conducted for an upcoming report on the status and gaps in combating illegal trade in wildlife and forest products. UNEP identified a lack of legal provisions for dealing with organized crime and corporations as a key gap. UNDP described the challenges of addressing wildlife crime in the context of country and regional instability, including in countries like Angola and Mali. UNDP highlighted opportunities for countries to implement conservation programmes and improve their legal frameworks with support from the Global Environment Facility (GEF).

African governments will redouble their efforts to prevent, detect and penalize wildlife crimes.

DESA presented the UN Forest Instrument and the UN Strategic Plan for Forests. These instruments address the illegal harvest and trade of forest and wildlife products, the role of sustainable natural resource management in preventing and combating illegal harvest and trade, and collaboration among governments and local communities to tackle illegal harvest and trade.

The UNDOC introduced a forthcoming guide on drafting legislation to combat wildlife crime. The guide will be launched during the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, on 17 October.

The CITES Secretariat explained that CITES is the only international legally binding instrument with an agreed definition of illegal trade in wild fauna and flora, and described the Convention’s minimum requirements for national legal frameworks for controlling trade in fauna and flora, emphasizing that effective legislation should also take into account the needs of rural communities that live alongside wildlife. She said that 15 of the 19 countries participating in the Symposium still need to put in place additional measures to effectively implement and enforce CITES.

According to CITES and UNEP, governments across Africa have committed to “redouble their efforts to prevent, detect and penalize” wildlife crimes. Governments will strengthen their legal frameworks, increase regional and national cooperation, collaborate with local communities to prevent and address the illegal harvest and trade in wildlife and forest products, and raise awareness on the drivers and impacts of wildlife crime. Participants also suggested raising awareness among national parliamentarians on the need to control trade and combat illegal trade to enable them to develop and support strengthened legal frameworks.

Symposium participating countries include Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cabo Verde, Central African Republic (CAR), Chad, Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Gabon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique, Niger and Togo.

The side event served as the launch of UNEP’s Global Plastics Platform, which will encourage and support commitments to reduce plastic pollution.

Frans Timmermans, European Commission, opened the event held at UN Headquarters in New York, US, on 25 September 2018. He said plastic pollution has gained widespread attention, but regulation is still needed. Referring to the European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy, adopted in early 2018, he said the EU plans to make plastics more circular and to ban them where there are feasible consumer alternatives.

Marine biologist Sylvia Earle urged participants to “rethink the whole problem of single-use, throwaway goods,” as recycling “only marks the start of another problem.”

Erik Solheim, UN Environment Executive Director, said the economic threat of plastic pollution can become an opportunity. He said UN Environment has established a Global Plastics Platform, which will support countries and cities in establishing policies to reduce plastic pollution. UN Environment notes that in 2018, a number of countries announced plans to ban single-use plastics: India said it will ban all single-use plastic by 2022; Botswana, Chile and Peru announced plastic bag bans; Nigeria revealed plans to establish recycling plants across the country; and Brazil announced a national plan on plastics.

In addition to policy support, the Platform will explore ways to change the design, production, consumption and disposal of plastics around the world, in line with a transition to a more circular economy. UN Environment reports that such efforts will include identifying opportunities to reduce economic and industrial waste. The Platform will build on and advance the World Economic Forum-hosted Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy, the work of the Regional Seas Conventions, and other existing initiatives and partnerships.

UNGA’s 73rd session will be “decisive” in the international community’s ability to reach SDG targets on oceans, climate and biodiversity by 2020.

Susan Goldberg, National Geographic, moderated a panel with heads of state and ministers from Aruba, Canada, Colombia, Iceland, Norway and Rwanda, as well as business leaders in retail and waste management. Officials from other countries spoke from the floor. Speakers highlighted several commitments, policies and initiatives, including on single-use plastics:

Aruba will ban all single-use plastics by 2020, following its 2016 ban on single-use plastic bags;

Spain will ban plastic bags in 2021;

Rwanda has drafted a law banning single-use plastics, following its 2008 ban on plastic bags;

Norway is considering a ban on single-use plastics in coordination with the EU;

Kenya is working with the East African Community to extend its plastic bag ban to other countries;

Sweden and Costa Rica are working to reduce single-use plastics at the UN and in its missions, including through sustainable procurement practices;

Costa Rica has a national strategy to replace single-use plastics with renewable and combustible alternatives; and

Iceland places a recycling fee on plastic goods.

Canada banned the sale of microbeads in 2018, and Iceland is developing a policy on microplastics. Norway is establishing a producer responsibility scheme for discarded fishing gear. In Iceland, discarded fishing gear can be traced to its owner.

Colombia is implementing a strategy for packaging and packaging waste. The country expects to make use of 30% of its waste by 2030, and is managing waste through public-private partnerships (PPPs). The world’s fourth largest retailer, the Schwarz Group, is developing a strategy to reduce and recycle all of its packaging. Spain is finalizing a circular economy strategy called España Circular 2030, which will include plastic pollution measures.

In addition, Norway launched a High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy on 24 September 2018, which will report in 2020. Norway also provided the initial pledge to the World Bank’s PROBLUE fund to support healthy and productive oceans, including by tackling marine pollution.

Almost all speakers underlined the need to engage the public and key stakeholders in order for the policies to succeed. Aruba’s Prime Minister noted that people resisted the 2016 ban on plastic bags, because the government had not worked to raise awareness before the policy change. She said that in preparation for the 2020 ban, officials have involved stakeholders to ensure that “people are begging for the decision.” Norway’s climate and environment minister said the government must involve the fishing industry in order to better control illegal discarding of fishing gear and waste at sea. Canada’s environment minister said that once the public learned about microbeads in everyday products, they agreed that it was a problem.

Suez, a leading waste and water management company, said 93% of plastic products use virgin materials, and encouraged increasing the amount of recycled plastic. France also called for businesses to include recycled plastics in their products, and said France will build on Canada’s work on plastics pollution as the Group of 7 (G7) president. In June 2018, the Ocean Plastics Charter was endorsed at the Canada-hosted G7 Summit by the EU, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and the UK.

Canada noted that even with Canada being “good at recycling,” the rate is only 11%, so the chemicals industry has a role to play in finding “leapfrog solutions.” The UK noted the launch in partnership with Canada of a PPP, the Global Plastics Action Partnership. She called on companies such as Suez to make it easier to recycle plastic waste.

Sweden said it is spending US$10 million per year until 2020 to cover municipalities’ costs for cleanup, promote innovation to combat microplastic pollution, and reduce discarded fishing gear. Sweden also established a government inquiry on possible measures to “go beyond EU legislation” on marine pollution. She highlighted the UN Environment Assembly’s (UNEA) Ad Hoc Open Ended Expert Group to identify options for combating marine litter for consideration by UNEA-4, noting the need for stronger global and regional architecture on the issue. The Union for the Mediterranean said it is working to identify marine litter hotspots in the Mediterranean region.

Turning to the local level, the mayor of Freetown, Sierra Leone, highlighted the health consequences of uncollected waste. She said Freetown’s approach will include: getting collection systems working, which needs investment; starting a recycling system and encouraging more businesses to join the sector; innovation and competition for clearing waste and fighting plastic; and joining the move to ban single-use plastic.

The Office of UNGA President Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces said the UNGA President will launch a global campaign and call to action to address plastic waste “once and for all.” She observed that the UNGA’s 73rd session will be “decisive” in the international community’s ability to reach SDG targets on oceans, climate and biodiversity by 2020.

202,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/unisdr-report-finds-dramatic-rise-in-climate-related-disasters/,"Tue, 16 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNISDR Report Finds “Dramatic Rise” in Climate-related Disasters,"10 October 2018: The UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) released a report that finds economic losses from climate-related disasters have increased by 151 percent. The report recommends integrating disaster risk reduction (DRR) into investment decisions to ensure sustainable development in a changing climate.

The report titled, ‘Economic Losses, Poverty and Disasters 1998-2017,’ examines key trends over the last 40 years on the effect of disasters on economic losses and human lives. The report finds that disaster-hit countries reported direct economic losses of US$2,908 billion. Out of these disasters, climate-related disasters accounted for 77 percent of the total. The report concludes that climate change is increasing the severity and frequency of extreme weather events and cautions that disasters will continue to impede sustainable development as long as the economic incentives to develop in hazardous-prone locations outweigh perceived disaster risk.

The report further cautions that economic losses suffered by low and lower-middle income countries are likely to have “crippling consequences” on their future development and their ability to achieve the SDGs, particularly SDG 1 (no poverty). Within this context, the report underscores the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and move towards a more sustainable world.

Economic losses from extreme weather events are unsustainable and a major brake on eradicating poverty in hazard exposed parts of the world.

Earthquakes and related tsunamis contributed to the largest number of lives lost, accounting for 56 percent of the total or 747,234 lives lost. In total, 1.3 million people lost their lives between 1998-2017 and an additional 4.4 billion people were rendered homeless, displaced, injured or in need of emergency assistance as a result of disasters. Although earthquakes caused the majority of fatalities, 91 percent of all disasters were attributed to storms, floods, droughts, heatwaves and other extreme weather events.

The report profiles economic losses by country, with the largest losses in the US, at US$944.8 billion, followed by China, at US$492.2 billion, and Japan, at US$376.3 billion. Other countries among the top ten for economic losses include India, Puerto Rico, France, Germany, Italy, Thailand and Mexico. Although high-income countries experience the majority of absolute economic losses, the report emphasizes that disaster events have a disproportionate impact on low and middle-income countries (MICs).

The report also raises concerns on the limited economic data found in disaster reports. The Sendai Framework for DRR includes Target c, which seeks to “reduce direct disaster economic loss in relation to global gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030.’ However, 63 percent of disaster reports do not contain economic data on losses from disasters. Low-income countries, for example, recorded losses for only 13 percent of reported disasters between 1998 and 2017; in other words, there are no loss data for 87 percent of disasters in low-income countries. These limited data hinder countries’ ability to measure progress towards this goal.

UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction, Mami Mizutori, said the report’s analysis shows “economic losses from extreme weather events are unsustainable and a major brake on eradicating poverty in hazard exposed parts of the world.” She called for doing a better job of capturing economic data to better understand what works in reducing economic losses, saving lives and livelihoods and managing economic risk.

UNISDR released the report in advance of the International Day for Disaster Reduction, which takes place on 13 October, and this year focuses on Sendai Target c.

203,https://sustainablebrands.com/read/supply-chain/addressing-sdg-5-5-steps-to-promote-gender-equality-in-the-supply-chain,"Mon, 08 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",Sustainable Brands,Addressing SDG 5: 5 Steps to Promote Gender Equality in the Supply Chain,"In 2015, the world got one step closer to a better future when 193 countries committed to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a framework for addressing the global community’s most critical economic, social and environmental challenges. These goals aim to eliminate poverty and hunger, promote global access to healthcare and education, protect earth’s natural resources, achieve gender equality, and more.

Specifically, SDG 5 calls for gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls, and should be a critical consideration for global supply chains, as there’s tremendous opportunity to make an impact. Women hold 60 to 90 percent of global supply chain jobs, particularly in the apparel and agricultural sectors, and represent the majority of workers in low-wage jobs in the lower tiers of the value chain. Despite their prevalent role, women lack access to social protection measures, especially maternity protection, and face limited career opportunities.

There are five steps companies in all industries and sizes can take to reap the benefits of gender equality in the supply chain.

1. Increase transparency with better metrics and reporting.

Setting up meaningful and accurate metrics and goals, appropriate to the size and sector of the organization, is key for quality reporting, which in the end means more transparency into sustainable progress. When teams have the right metrics for evaluating where the company and its suppliers stand on gender equality, it’s easier to set targets, measure success and benchmark performance against competition.

Start with the most basic key performance indicators (KPIs), such as gender ratio across various roles and the corresponding level of remuneration. GRI G4 standards provide robust reporting frameworks for gender equality and diversity.

2. Prioritize robust policies and programs.

If policies and programs to tackle gender inequality don’t exist in your supply chain, it is high time to design and implement them. When gender equality is weaved into the management system and this foundation for progress is in place, the next step is to prioritize gender-related programs. For example, L’Oréal — the leader of Equileap’s cross-sector ranking of gender equality performance — is convinced that gender parity is a strategic lever for performance and growth. The cosmetics giant has put forward a sustainable sourcing program that specifically addresses the vulnerability of women when it comes to climate change. The cumulative effects of poverty, cultural and social barriers, exacerbated by climate change, put the health, wellbeing and livelihood of women at great risk. L’Oréal is addressing this critical issue through research and regional programs that empower women and help them diversify their income, and by supporting external initiatives such as Women4Climate, designed to create sustainable and inclusive communities.

A network of supporters and allies is crucial for business success, and this wisdom also applies to achieving the SDG on gender equality. One key step is to support female entrepreneurs or companies with a mission to fight gender inequality. Global Entrepreneurship Monitor reports that in 2018 there are 30 percent more male entrepreneurs in the world and that women make up only 40 percent of the new entrepreneurs in the U.S. This makes it even more imperative to support the existing 200 million female business owners worldwide and encourage growth of female entrepreneurship across the globe. A company can send a strong message by selecting suppliers with effective gender-specific policies and programs in place. This is especially relevant for the retail and agricultural sectors, where low-tier workers are predominantly women.

4. Benefit from global expertise.

Demonstrate commitment to global goals and gender parity by partnering with leading organizations and joining key initiatives. As robust as gender equality and women’s empowerment policies and programs may be, there’s a lot to be gained by formally endorsing worldwide initiatives such as Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEPs) and HeForShe’s IMPACT 10x10x10 framework, or joining other national or local initiatives. Participating in well-established initiatives offers the chance to dip into a network of global experts on critical subjects and access best practices and tools that that can break through barriers to gender equality in your own operations and throughout your global supply chain.

5. Educate and train suppliers.

Forced and child labor is firmly on the agenda of most large corporations. However, few acknowledge the vulnerability of girls and women to modern slavery: Females constitute 99 percent of victims in the commercial industry and 58 percent in other sectors. By eliminating forced and child labor in your supply chain, you strongly contribute to achieving SDG 5. Engaging suppliers is key here — selecting only pre-qualified suppliers, continuous monitoring and training of existing suppliers, and engaging them in the conversation about gender parity and your vision of a fair and equal workplace are the most fundamental steps to have in place.

The importance and the impact of gender equality is easy to underestimate when facing seemingly more critical issues. However, gender is an inalienable component of every other global goal. Educating girls and preventing child marriage helps eliminate global poverty, and full and equal participation of girls and women in global politics will definitely bring us closer to achieving the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development, which the SDGs support.","These goals aim to eliminate poverty and hunger, promote global access to healthcare and education, protect earth’s natural resources, achieve gender equality, and more.

204,https://www.businessgreen.com/news/3063771/bunzl-catering-supplies-reveals-sdg-focused-roadmap-for-action,"Tue, 02 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",www.businessgreen.com,Bunzl Catering Supplies reveals SDG-focused 'roadmap for action',"Company becomes latest corporate to integrate UN SDGs into its sustainability strategy

Bunzl Catering Supplies has become the latest business to tie its environmental targets to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with the release of a new sustainability strategy that specifically targets five of the United Nation's goals.

The company yesterday announced the launch of a new digital sustainability report, Sustainable Future 2018, which updates progress against its current green targets and sets a number of new goals based on the SDGs.

Bunzl Catering Supplies, which is part of global distribution and outsourcing giant Bunzl and is one the world's largest providers of catering supplies, food packaging, and single use utensils, said it had chosen to focus on five SDGs where the company believes it can have ""the most meaningful impact"".

The chosen SDGs are SDG3 on good health and wellbeing, SDG12 on responsible consumption and procurement, SDG13 on climate action, SDG14 on life below water, SDG15 on life on land.

The report highlights a number of specific SDG targets that the company has now adopted as its own internal targets. They include targets to halve the number of deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents, provide on-going education opportunities for employees, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources by 2030, integrate climate change measures into national policies, 'substantially reduce' waste generation by 2030, and prevent and ""significantly reduce"" marine pollution of all kinds by 2025.

Joanna Gilroy, head of sustainability for Bunzl Catering & Hospitality Division, that adopting the UN Sustainable Development Goals as a ""roadmap for action"" for the company had delivered a number of benefits.

""The SDGs underpin our Sustainable Future programme, which has helped raise the profile of Sustainability in our business,"" she said in a statement. ""We know that Sustainability is not a nice-to-have, but rather a fundamental part of our core strategy, that protects and creates opportunity from the three things no business can survive without: a healthy environment, healthy people and healthy progress.""

Elsewhere in the report the company detailed how it had responded to growing concerns about single use items by teaming up with 13 other organisations from across the supply chain for disposable paper cups, to sign an agreement with the Alliance for Beverage Cartons and the Environment (ACE UK) to increase PE lined paper cup recycling. ""As result of this agreement, the UK now has 12 national waste providers offering a paper cup collection service,"" the firm said.

The report also confirmed progress against existing sustainability targets, revealing that in 2017 30 per cent of the company's consumed power came from renewable sources, while it achieved an 11 per cent increase in recycled cardboard.

It added that this year it is aiming to secure 70 per cent of its power from renewables and achieve zero waste to landfill.

Bunzl is part of a growing trend for corporates to integrate the UN's SDGs into their own sustainability strategy, as detailed in a major new investigation from BusinessGreen for the site's new SDG Hub.

Speaking to BusinessGreen, James Gomme of international green business group WBCSD, urged more firms to assess how the SDGs could support their sustainability efforts.

""A lot of companies are already doing a lot of great stuff in sustainability - this is not a new agenda,"" he said. ""Companies have made great progress and it is important they translate that into the SDGs and show how they have contributed already. But it is also important they integrate sustainability into new strategy and production development. It is vital you highlight what you are already doing, but it is also important you have new projects coming through.""","Bunzl Catering Supplies, which is part of global distribution and outsourcing giant Bunzl and is one the world's largest providers of catering supplies, food packaging, and single use utensils, said it had chosen to focus on five SDGs where the company believes it can have ""the most meaningful impact"".

The Department for International Development (DfID) officially kicked off the Voluntary National Review of the SDGs earlier this week and invited interested parties to contribute directly to the review process.

""People in the UK are doing a lot. We know this,"" the department said on the new website for the Review. ""We would like you to tell us more about it. We are keen to hear about projects at the local level that are helping to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals. In the Voluntary National Review, we would like to showcase several examples of the great work being done across the country by different groups.""

As such, businesses and other parties are invited to either fill out a survey on how they are contributing to the SDGs or provide emailed submissions.

The review presents an opportunity for the growing number of companies that have integrated the SDGs into their wider sustainability strategies to showcase their work. According to a recent survey of over 150 sustainability executives from the Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) network 71 per cent are either using the SDGs to set internal targets or intend to do so in the near future.

The SDGs include 17 goals and 169 targets, and unlike previous international development goals they are global in their reach, requiring industrialised and developing nations alike to embrace clean energy, sustainable agriculture, and low carbon infrastructure.

As such many of the targets are directly relevant to the UK, and the government is set to detail how its industrial, clean growth, and environment strategies all contribute to the SDGs. Businesses also have a critical role to play in delivering on SDGs that cover everything from clean energy and buildings to industry and transport.

A DFID spokesperson urged businesses to come forward with submissions for the national review.

""The UK is making good progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, with the private sector, NGOs and government all working together to achieve them, but there is still more to be done,"" they said in an emailed statement. ""That is why it is so important that UK businesses use the Voluntary National Review to show how they are using innovation and expertise to help build on the momentum we need to reach the Goals.""

However, the government is also under pressure to provide a more detailed SDG strategy after a report earlier this summer from the UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development (UKSSD) argued the country was only performing well against a quarter of the SDG targets deemed relevant to the UK.

The report said there were policy gaps or inadequate performance across 57 per cent of the 143 UK-relevant targets, while 15 per cent had 'little to no policy in place' to address them.

Last year the Environmental Audit Committee of MPs similarly accused the government of having 'no strategy or vision' for meeting the SDGs, while a PwC report earlier this year accused multiple governments of paying 'lip service' to the goals.","Businesses, communities, and NGOs across the UK are being urged to submit information on how they are supporting the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as part of the UK's first review of progress against the international targets.

As part of our Mission Possible campaign, edie brings you this weekly round-up of five of the best sustainability success stories of the week from across the globe.

Published every week, this series charts how businesses and sustainability professionals are working to achieve their 'Mission Possible' across the campaign’s five key pillars - energy, resources, mobility, built environment and business leadership.

From a green buildings initiative in Singapore to a huge new energy storage plant in Scotland, each of these projects and initiatives is empowering businesses and governments to achieve a sustainable future, today.

ENERGY: Planning permission for huge battery storage facility in Scotland approved

A recent Bloomberg New Energy Finance study predicted that the global energy storage market will double six times by 2030. Domestically, the early signs are encouraging, with the UK’s largest storage portfolio carried out in June by UK Power Reserve and energy storage firm Fluence.

In the latest storage success story, UK energy technology firm Pivot Power this week gained planning permission to build a new 50MW battery facility in Harker, near Carlisle.

Once complete in October 2019, the 25-container facility is expected to be able to store enough energy to power 6,000 homes for a 24-hour period on a single full charge. It will be co-located with an electric vehicle (EV) charging facility, which will have sufficient infrastructure to charge up to 100 vehicles at a time.

“Working with the local authorities, our plans will see Carlisle become a pioneering city for low carbon vehicle adoption, ensuring that the rural areas it serves are not left lagging in the electric vehicle revolution,"" Pivot Power’s chief technical officer Michael Clarke said.

RESOURCES: Everlane launches closed-loop clothing line made from recycled plastics

From Adidas’ ocean plastic trainers to Corona’s recycled beach bottle shirt, more and more companies are moving to design garments incorporating a high proportion of recycled content. Following in the footsteps of The North Face, which last month unveiled a range of products made from littered PET bottles, US fashion retailer Everlane the week launched a range of outerwear made with post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic.

The fleeces, jackets and coats, which went on sale in the chain’s US stores and on its website on Wednesday (24 October), each contain the equivalent of at least 15 recycled drinks bottles – with the full-length puffa jackets containing the equivalent of 60.

The launch of the range, called ReNew, comes after Everlane pledged earlier this year to remove all virgin plastic from its supply chain by 2021. In a bid to raise awareness of the importance of plastic recycling, Everlane has also launched a web page which tells customers how many virgin plastic bottles have been made in the time they spend on the site.

MOBILITY: Norwegian Air to cut CO2 emissions by 16,000 tonnes annually using AI

Sustainable aviation has proven to be something of a hot topic this month, with Virgin Atlantic showcasing its innovative low-carbon jet fuel made from recycled waste gases for the first time and Heathrow Airport moving to waive landing charges for the world's first electric passenger plane once it is developed.

The latest success story in the sector comes from budget airline Norwegian Air, which has started rolling out fuel efficiency technology across its fleet after a trial resulted in fuel savings of 22 kilos per journey.

Called Aventus Air and developed by Swedish firm AVTECH, the technology monitors wind and temperature information to enable pilots to alter their flight paths to boost fuel efficiency. Once the data is collected, it is automatically sent to the aircraft’s systems, where artificial intelligence (AI) is used to optimise the flight path.

Norwegian Air estimates that by installing the software across its entire fleet of 160 aircraft, it will reduce its carbon emissions by 16,000 tonnes each year. The company has already reduced its absolute emissions by almost one-third (30%) since 2008.

THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT: 1,000 built environment sector professionals collaborate to help tackle smart cities challenges

Cities currently account for around 70% of the global energy demand and will be home to 2.5 billion more people by 2050 than they are today.

As cities around the world explore ways to integrate technological solutions and innovations that ensure they’ll remain fit for purpose as urbanisation continues, 1,000 built environment sector workers this week gathered to explore how cities could align with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Meeting in Singapore for an event called the SDG City Challenge (SDGCC) and led by real estate firm City Developments Limited Group (CDL), participants from big-name corporations and governmental organisations debated how cities could best align their development with all 17 of the Global Goals, ensuring no residents were left behind by climate challenges or social inequalities.

“We believe that a sustainable built environment will provide high-quality spaces for people to live, work and play,” CDL’s chief executive Sherman Kwek said.

“Through SDGCC, we hope to encourage participants to adopt the SDGs in their daily lives and better understand how healthy lifestyles, green buildings and eco-friendly practices are intricately connected for a sustainable future.”

BUSINESS LEADERSHIP: Big-name businesses jointly pledge $500,000 to spur action on SDGs

In the wake of UN research revealing that there is currently a $2.5trn “investment gap” between the level of funding currently earmarked for clean growth in developing countries and the amount needed to achieve all 17 SDGs in full, nine corporations this week collectively pledged to invest $500,000 into projects which aim to accelerate global progress on one or more of the Goals.

As part of a new initiative called Lead2030 and led by UK-based non-profit One Young World, RB, AstraZeneca, Deloitte, Credit Suisse, BP, Standard Chartered, Mondi Group, KPMG and Bristol-Myers Squibb have each pledged to invest $50,000 in a project which is already working to address a Global Goal related to that firm’s sector.

One Young World co-founder Kate Robertson said that by pledging the investment, the corporates are “doing the right thing” ethically while “doing the smart thing for their business”.

207,https://www.ncregister.com/features/sdg-reviews-first-man-ryan-gosling-and-damien-chazelle-shoot-for-the-moon,"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",National Catholic Register,SDG Reviews ‘First Man’: Ryan Gosling and Damien Chazelle Shoot for the Moon,"The La La Land filmmakers reunite to explore the private life of Neil Armstrong and the triumphs and tragedies of the space race.

Editor's Note: This review was originally posted on Oct. 10, 2018.

No matter what, somebody was going to go down in the history books as the first man to set foot on the moon. If it hadn’t been Neil Armstrong, it might have been Jim Lovell; if it hadn’t been an American, it would have been a Russian.

First Man makes the case that the man who actually went down in the history books was a man, if not the man, who cared more about the endeavor for its own sake than about who would go down in the history books.

But it also suggests that, no matter who wound up taking that first step on an alien world, that giant leap for mankind would also be one small step for a man no bigger on the inside than any of us.

Armstrong certainly had the right stuff, including the ability to stay cool in the face of an unfolding crisis that could have fatal consequences in seconds and figure out the right thing to do.

In one way that first footstep in the dust on the lunar surface represents all of humanity, and the U.S. flag planted by Armstrong (seen in a number of shots, belying the controversy over the omission of its actual planting) represents the nation that won this climatic chapter in the space race.

But it was not a paradigm or archetype who took that step or planted that flag. It was a fallible, wounded individual with personal baggage he couldn’t leave behind, even on a trip to the moon.

First Man is Damien Chazelle’s third film in a row about special individuals whose quest to achieve great things is linked to emotional isolation from others.

Chazelle won the Best Director Academy Award in 2017 for La La Land, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as creative souls and lovers who ultimately achieve their dreams only after breaking up. His prior film, Whiplash, was about a young drummer who breaks up with his girlfriend in order to focus on his passion and an abusive teacher, played by J.K. Simmons (who won the supporting actor Oscar for the role), who terrorizes his students in order to push the truly talented to greatness.

In this telling of the life of Neil Armstrong, which reunites Chazelle with Gosling in the lead role, the filmmaker has an iconic American incarnation of his favorite theme.

Following James R. Hansen’s official biography First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong, on which it is based, Chazelle’s film finds a key turning point in Armstrong’s life in the devastating loss of his 2-year-old daughter, Karen, to an inoperable brain tumor.

The loss of a child can have an alienating effect on a husband and wife who process trauma and grief differently. Following a theory about presidents who lost children, Hansen suggests that Karen’s death may have helped to spur Armstrong to dedicate himself to an arena far from home and hearth.

For Chazelle, Armstrong’s quest may be for transcendence, or at least transformation. A harrowing opening sequence begins in medias res with Armstrong piloting an X-15 so close to the edge of space that he has trouble returning to Earth.

Still, he recalls that experience with wonder, even reverence, when being interviewed for the astronaut program and asked about the value of making the journey to the moon. On Earth, he says, the atmosphere that surrounds us seems vast, but from the edge of space, the Earth’s blanket of air seems thin and insubstantial.

From this perspective, the point of going to the moon is not what we learn about the moon, but what we learn about our place in the universe.

As an actor, Gosling has charisma to burn — a quality he has to submerge to play the reserved, understated Armstrong. Yet unlike his muted last role, playing a docile replicant in Blade Runner 2049, here Gosling bristles with intelligence and purpose, not to mention an occasional glint of humor.

His Armstrong isn’t one to suffer fools or to give people what they want. How did it feel to be selected to command the Apollo 11 mission? “I was pleased,” Armstrong tells the press, and rewording the question elicits no more quotation-working response.

Fortunately for the press, Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin (Corey Stoll) is more than willing to play to the cameras. Aldrin comes off as a bit of a brute; after one callous remark, he adds defensively, “I’m just saying what you’re thinking.” Armstrong’s laconic retort: “Well, maybe you shouldn’t!”

Claire Foy (The Crown) is well-matched with Gosling as Armstrong’s wife, Janet, who married him in the hope of finding stability and remains supportive of him to the end, but can stand up to him — or his NASA superiors — when necessary. The emotional connection between them is potent even when it is strained.

First Man effectively evokes the urgency of the space race, from the demoralizing frustration at every new milestone the Soviets reached before the United States to the thrill of victory when the U.S. crossed a line first.

We also feel acutely the vulnerability of the astronauts strapping themselves into claustrophobically confined spaces of immensely powerful engines that could easily kill them, and do kill some.

Janet’s angry remark about NASA being “a bunch of boys making models out of balsa wood” rings true because we see — and feel — how treacherous the technology can be.

Following one particularly devastating loss, Armstrong doggedly tells Bob Gilruth, the first director of NASA’s Manned Spacecraft Center, “We’ve got to fail down here so we don’t fail up there.” At what cost? Gilruth asks. “It’s a little bit late for that question, isn’t it, sir?” is Armstrong’s angry reply.

The possibility of failure looms so large that we see the White House has prepared a statement for the public in the event that the Apollo 11 crew don’t make the return trip. The air of foreboding Chazelle creates at the start of the mission almost makes us feel we’re watching the astronauts go to their deaths.

Not all of Chazelle’s choices work so well. Just as he undermined the big musical sequences in La La Land with his insistence on shooting them in showy single takes, here he relies so much on shaky handheld camerawork and extreme close-ups, even in ordinary quiet moments, that it becomes tiresome.

Yet the climactic sequence on the moon is heart-stopping in its stillness and austere splendor, elevating the film from excellence to near greatness. I’m not sure the words “magnificent desolation” have ever been more evocatively put to film than here. Everything else seems to recede — for a time.

That includes, for me, the flag-planting kerfuffle. There is a crucial moment on the moon, the culmination of one of the film’s central themes, that would arguably have been undermined by a flag-planting scene. Aldrin, in that news conference, jokes about his wife slipping him jewelry that she hopes he will bring to the moon and leave there. “What man wouldn’t want to give his wife bragging rights?” he asks rhetorically. When it comes to the point, though, more than bragging rights are in play.

First Man is ultimately more about the “man” than the “first.” It’s the story of a dedicated engineer and a gifted pilot who knew and accepted that his commitment to the program and the goal might cost him his life. Above all, though, it’s the story of a fragile human being who was never the same after a defining tragedy — who loved his daughter to the moon and back.

213,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-establishes-17-academic-impact-hubs-for-sdgs/,"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Establishes 17 Academic Impact Hubs for SDGs,"24 October 2018: The UN has identified 17 universities around the world that will serve as ‘Academic Impact’ Hubs for each of the 17 SDGs. Each university will be charged with promoting scholarship and best practices for its respective Goal. The partnerships are managed through the UN Department of Public Information’s (DPI) project on UN Academic Impact (UNAI).

The announcement was made in New York, US, on 24 October 2018, on the 73rd anniversary of the UN Charter. Ramu Damodaran, DPI, said the global academic community has shown its ability to devise practical ways in which the 2030 Agenda can be achieved, through research projects, innovative curriculum and campus activities.

Universities that serve as Academic Impact hubs for the SDGs were appointed based on their innovative approaches and expertise around a particular goal. For example, the Nagaoka University of Technology (NUT), the global hub for SDG 9 ( industry, innovation and infrastructure), has trained more than 10,000 engineers, and established a ‘GIGAKU SDG Institute’ programme in May 2018.

The other appointed institutions, which will serve three-year, renewable terms, are:

Kristu Jayanti College, India, for SDG 1 (no poverty);

University of Pretoria, South Africa, for SDG 2 (zero hunger);

New Giza University, Egypt, for SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing);

University of La Punta, Argentina, for SDG 4 (quality education);

Ahfad University for Women, Sudan, for SDG 5 (gender equality);

University of Manitoba, Canada, for SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation);

National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Energy Policy and Development Centre, Greece, for SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy);

Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engineering, and Management Sciences, Pakistan, for SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth);

Western Sydney University, Australia, for SDG 10 (reduced inequalities);

Carlos III University of Madrid, Spain, for SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities);

University of Buenos Aires, Faculty of Economic Sciences, Argentina, for SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production);

University of Zurich, Switzerland, for SDG 13 (climate action);

University of Bergen, Norway, for SDG 14 (life below water);

University of Zanjan, Iran, for SDG 15 (life on land);

De Montfort University, UK, for SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions); and

American University in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), for SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals).

These institutions join an existing network of other UNAI hubs that serve as resources on various issues relating to sustainable development and the role of the UN. For example, the J.F. Oberlin University in the US serves as the global hub for research and action around the UN Charter, and the Al Farabi Kazakh National University in Kazakhstan serves as the global hub on sustainability.

UNAI was established in 2010 as a network of educational and research organizations, which now is made up of more than 1,300 member institutions around the world. The project seeks to disseminate information on UN initiatives and promote activities that contribute to shared global goals.

According to the publication’s findings, 679 of 1,146 cities inhabited by more than half a million people are vulnerable to cyclones, floods, droughts, earthquakes, landslides or volcanic eruptions. Combined, these cities are home to 1.4 billion people – a third of the world’s population. The booklet draws on projections from DESA’s ‘World Urbanization Prospects: The 2018 Revision’ report, and notes the importance of understanding urbanization trends as being key to implementing SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

The data booklet offers a definition for the term “city,” distinguishing between administrative boundaries, those delineated by “contiguous urban areas,” and broader metropolitan areas that feature a degree of economic and social interconnectivity. The means of defining a city, it stresses, affects the assessment of its population, with metropolitan areas being home to significantly larger numbers of people than the “city proper” as defined by an administrative boundary.

Nine of the ten cities projected to become megacities by 2030 are located in developing countries.

The publication notes that the world’s cities are growing in both size and number, with most megacities – defined as having more than 10 million inhabitants – being located in the global South. Nine of the ten cities projected to become megacities by 2030 are located in developing countries.

In a news release, lead author of the publication Danan Gu, DESA, emphasizes the importance of cities, noting that urban areas produce approximately three quarters of the world’s economic output. The study, he highlights, aims to better understand cities’ vulnerability, in order to both protect human life and limit economic and infrastructural damages from natural disasters. Key to doing so, he adds, is ensuring preparedness, good governance and resilient infrastructure.

However, these features are more commonly found in cities within high-income countries. Thus, with most of the world’s fastest growing cities being in Asia and Africa, the study reveals a gap, and a need to ensure that cities in developing regions are resilient to natural disasters. DESA’s press release points to a recent report by the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) which finds that only one high-income territory in the past 20 years ranks in the top ten for economic losses as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP).

Including representatives from more than 20 developing countries, this meeting saw a major shift in focus of GAML–from development and refinement of the Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4) indicators toward implementation.

Esther Care Former Brookings Expert R Ramya Vivekanandan Senior Education Specialist, Learning Assessment Systems - GPE Secretariat

UIS plays a critical role in the Education 2030 Agenda by producing cross-nationally comparable education data and works with partners to develop new indicators, methodologies, statistical approaches, and monitoring tools to better assess progress toward international education targets. It is the lead agency for producing the indicators needed to track global progress toward SDG 4, while sharing responsibility for some targets with other agencies.

A primer on the Global Alliance to Monitor Learning (GAML)

GAML was convened by the UIS in early 2016 to provide concrete solutions to develop new indicators on learning needed to achieve SDG 4 and set standards for good practices on learning assessments by bringing together technical experts from around the world. Counting more than 250 members representing a wide range of stakeholders from UN Member States, academia, international organizations, NGOs, civil society, and the private sector, GAML is developing the standards and methodologies needed to measure learning globally while helping countries to produce and use the information to achieve SDG 4.

During the meeting, about 20 countries provided their perspectives to inform decision-making across the learning and skills-related indicators. In addition, four countries—Cambodia, Chad, The Gambia, and Tanzania—explained the data they would likely draw on to inform these indicators, as well as the challenges and needs that confront them. Inclusion of a large country contingent and a new decision-making approach differentiated the fifth GAML meeting from previous ones.

Aligning national and international measures of proficiency in math and reading

Day one of the meeting focused on procedural papers that would enable countries to align their learning outcomes data against content in the reading and mathematics areas, and to establish procedures that would enable the verification of appropriate standards of data collection tools. Of interest was the proposal that both statistical and non-statistical methods be used in these processes.

This was a welcome approach for countries that do not engage in international or regional large-scale assessment programs (LSAs), or that use data from national assessments, citizen-led assessments, or early grade reading/mathematics assessments.

Related Content Product Optimizing Assessment for All

Questions raised by countries included how to manage differences in identification of grade versus years of schooling for reporting—for example on Indicator 4.1.1 for Grades 2/3, end of primary, and end of lower secondary, and whether the proposed frameworks for reading and mathematics would provide sufficient guidance to countries in their local comparisons with their national assessment data.

Working out the details of several learning indicators and respective roles in GAML

During the second day, the Task Force working on indicator 4.4 presented extensive research on how to approach digital literacy and ICT indicators, with a subsequent proposal for adoption of a Global Framework on Digital Literacy Skills. The definition proposed for discussion was: “The ability to access, manage, understand, integrate, communicate, evaluate, and create information safely and appropriately through digital technologies for employment, decent jobs, and entrepreneurship. It includes competences that are variously referred to as computer literacy, ICT literacy, information literacy, and media literacy.”

Target 4.6 calls on countries to ‟ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy” by 2030. Task Force 4.6 described its methodological work, and the potential identification of different minimum proficiency levels according to country economic levels. Member States did not view establishing different minimum proficiency levels positively, especially given that that many countries vary significantly in their adult literacy proficiencies. However, reporting more than one proficiency level appeared sound, which would enable countries to make visible progress over time in a manner that setting just one level might not.

Task Force 4.7 presented extensive research to inform the global frameworks of education for sustainability and global citizenship. Addressing Indicator 4.7.5 in particular which relates to the “percentage of 15-year-old students showing proficiency in knowledge of environmental science and geoscience,” the Task Force discussed a proposal for use of Trends in International Mathematics and Science (TIMSS) Grade 8 assessment of biology and earth science. TIMSS biology includes the topics of ecosystems and human health, while earth science includes the topics of earth’s resources, their use, and conservation.

Recognizing the role of UNICEF rather than UIS as the custodian agency for Indicator 4.2.1 (proportion of children under five years of age who are developmentally on track in health, learning, and psychosocial well-being, by sex), it was proposed that Task Force 4.2 dissolve and transfer its materials and research to UNICEF as the latter finalizes reporting approaches and methods.

Similarly illustrating GAML’s dynamic and responsive nature, there was a proposal that the Assessment Implementation Task Force, a cross-cutting group, re-form as the Capacity Development Task Force to focus on implications of the decisions made by the Task Forces, on country implementation, and on the needs that such decisions will stimulate within countries. Brookings and the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) proposed to jointly lead this new task force.

As Day 2 drew to a close, countries presented a microcosm of the concerns that had been raised throughout the two days and the challenges they faced. Their questions included:

• What are the continuing gaps in data collection and how might these be addressed?

• What are the issues related to consolidation of data sets across agencies and how to resolve them?

• How to develop simple monitoring tools that could be used at decentralized level to capture learning outcomes?

Remaining challenges in SDG 4 monitoring

Beyond these immediate concerns, reporting against the learning and skills-related indicators of the SDGs raised significant philosophical issues for countries. At the national level, some countries noted a move away from reporting the percentage of students reaching particular levels of proficiency, in favor of more meaningful reporting that indicates actual student proficiencies. Although the positive potential implications of SDG reporting can help countries prioritize education, the apparent inconsistency between global reporting needs and constructive use of assessment nationally may need to be reconciled.

Similarly, where national curricula are not well aligned with the curricula that may increasingly be implied by the frameworks for reporting against the SDGs, will national education systems shift their own learning goals accordingly? When this does not happen, how indicative will data cherry-picked from national resources be of real learning outcomes?

Beyond technical questions and capacity needs, participants raised concerns around identification of stakeholders’ roles and responsibilities within countries. This highlighted the need for coordination across agencies (e.g. assessment units/agencies, EMIS units, and national statistics offices), and clear communication about not only the indicators, but also what data collection tools and data would meet required levels of quality for global reporting standards.

What’s the verdict?

While it may have been daunting for country representatives who were new to this platform to constructively engage in discussion during the packed two-day agenda, it was a successful start thanks to the excellent leadership and coordination of UIS.

Now it’s time for diverse stakeholders within countries to have access to similar information, pull it apart, and consider the best options for their own countries to identify data resources and use their reporting as levers for change.","It is the lead agency for producing the indicators needed to track global progress toward SDG 4, while sharing responsibility for some targets with other agencies.

Noting that air pollution affects children “in uniquely damaging ways,” the report finds that 93% of children under 15 around the world breathe toxic air daily.

The report titled, ‘Air Pollution and Child Health: Prescribing Clean Air,’ distinguishes between ambient air pollution (AAP) and household air pollution (HAP) and their sources, noting that the two have contributed to respiratory tract infections which ultimately killed approximately 543,000 children under 5 years old in 2016. The paper underscores that more than one in every four deaths of children under 5 is related to environmental risks. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus drove the issue home in a press release issued for the report’s launch. “Polluted air is poisoning millions of children and ruining their lives,” he stated. “This is inexcusable.”

According to the report, children are at particular risk due to their rapid breathing compared to adults, smaller size, the fact that they live and breathe closer to the ground where pollutants may concentrate, and proximity to polluting fuels used for cooking and heating. They can be exposed to air pollution in utero, through inhalation or through ingestion.

Polluted air is poisoning millions of children and ruining their lives.

WHO stresses that although air pollution is a global issue, the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) which contributes to health impacts and deaths is a burden most acutely felt by low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) – especially those in regions that use polluting fuels for cooking, heating and lighting. Whereas 98% of children under 5 in LMICs are exposed to PM2.5 levels above WHO air quality guidelines, the figure for high-income countries (HICs) stands at 52%.

The report highlights the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as an opportunity to recognize the interlinkages between air pollution and cities (SDG 11), energy (SDG 7), climate action (SDG 13) and health (SDG 3). Towards achieving SDG 7, it cites prior WHO guidance for indoor air quality on household fuel combustion, which discourage the use of kerosene and unprocessed coal due to their health hazards in favor of cleaner biomass and other sources of energy.

Additional findings cover air pollution’s effects on cognitive abilities; negative impacts on mental, motor and lung development; and note that pregnant women who are exposed to air pollution are at increased risk of giving birth prematurely, to underweight children. Recommendations to health professionals emphasize the importance of being informed on air pollution as a risk factor; recognizing exposure; “prescribing” solutions such as switching to clean cooking fuels; and playing an advocacy role when sharing knowledge with policymakers.

The report was released prior to the first Global Conference on Air Pollution and Health, held from 30 October to 1 November 2018 at WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.

To the SCAN-tool

The SDG Climate Action Nexus tool (SCAN-tool) is designed to provide high-level guidance on how mitigation actions can impact achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It can support policy makers to achieve greater policy coherence and to improve the efficiency of implementation by providing them with an initial indication of which climate actions may impact -positively or negatively- specific SDG targets.



The SCAN-tool can also potentially inform the process of putting forward increasingly ambitious pledges of climate action, required every five years under the ambition mechanism of the Paris Agreement. A better understanding of how climate action can reinforce the achievement of SDG targets may increase countries’ confidence to put forward more ambitious NDCs and improve political buy-in.

Key findings:

A first overview of the results (see table below) highlights the following key findings:

In total, 886 linkages were identified between sector-specific actions and SDG targets, with a further 30 identified between general interventions and SDG targets. This important number of links highlights the opportunity and need to approach implementation in an integrated manner.

Synergies outweigh trade-offs for most of the SDGs (in fact, the majority (76%) of linkages identified in the tool are positive).

The SDG agenda in itself is extensive and complex, comprising a total of 167 targets under the 17 goal dimensions. In many cases the targets overlap or even duplicate, thus complicating their attribution to individual subsectors and mitigation actions. This complexity and inter-relatedness within the SDG agenda is difficult to capture in a simplified tool.

Many or perhaps all of the linkages are ultimately very context specific. To understand and manage the synergies and trade-offs, countries will need to undertake a systematic review of individual mitigation actions in their specific context. The SCAN-tool helps indicate where to start with that exercise.

219,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/report-finds-investing-in-healthy-coral-reefs-could-generate-billions/,"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Report Finds Investing in Healthy Coral Reefs Could Generate Billions,"6 November 2018: The Prince of Wales’ International Sustainability Unit (ISU), with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment), the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI) and Trucost, released a report that finds a shift to improved coral reef health could unlock an additional US$35 billion in Mesoamerica and an additional US$37 billion in Indonesia through coastal development, commercial fisheries and tourism. If the world does not implement recommended policies and investments, the report cautions coral reefs could decline 90 percent within the next 30 years.

The study titled, ‘The Coral Reef Economy,’ compares the economic outcomes between a healthy reef scenario and a degraded reef scenario in the Coral Triangle and the Mesoamerican Reef. The healthy reef scenario assumes that increased investment in protection and preservation will return reefs to a healthy state. In a degraded reef scenario, coral reef health would continue to decline from current levels. The study finds there is a “strong business case” for both the private and public sectors to increase investments in the protection, preservation and enhancement of coral reefs.

According to the report, the world has already lost at least one-fifth of the world’s coral reefs. Climate change, ocean acidification, overfishing and destructive fishing and various land-based activities all threaten coral reef health. The report finds that if coral reefs continue to decline in line with historical trends, the value of coral reefs to key sectors could decrease by US$3.1 billion in Mesoamerica and US$2.2 billion in Indonesia by 2030. These losses could have additional effects on local livelihoods and government revenues in the region, resulting in further losses to reef-dependent communities.

If coral reefs continue to decline in line with historical trends, the value of coral reefs to key sectors could decrease.

The two scenarios also estimate potential changes in live coral cover, which is considered an indicator of coral reef health. The healthy reef scenario anticipates a 36.4 percent increase in live coral cover in the Coral Triangle by 2030 and a 14.1 percent increase in live coral cover in Mesoamerica by 2030. The degraded reef scenario predicts a decline from 16.6 percent live coral cover in 2017 to 11 percent live coral cover by 2030 in the Coral Triangle and a decline from an average of 3.7 percent live coral cover in 2017 to 1.6 percent in 2030 in Mesoamerica.

The report warns that funding to protect and manage coral reef ecosystems is “insufficient to maintain reef health and meet internationally adopted targets.” Within this context, the report presents a range of interventions and policies that could produce a financial net benefit and positive return on investment for stakeholders. The study analyzes four strategic interventions: no-take marine protected areas (MPAs); afforestation for erosion management; constructed wetlands to enhance wastewater management; and vegetative filter strips to reduce erosion on cropland. All four of these interventions would also support achievement of SDG 14 (life below water) as well as contribute to SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) and SDG 15 (life on land).

The report argues that a shift towards coral reef health can be achieved through strategic interventions using already available tools and methods. As an illustration, the expansion of no-take MPAs in Mesoamerica could generate a 44 to 1 return on investment. The report also underscores the environmental and social benefits of restoring coral reef ecosystems, including biodiversity conservation and cultural reasons.

The compendium is a result of a UNGA high-level meeting on financing the SDGs, organized by then-President Miroslav Lajcak in June 2018.



The event titled, ‘Financing for SDGs – Breaking the Bottlenecks of Investment, from Policy to Impact,’ brought together representatives of UN Member States, the private sector, UN entities, and other international organizations to explore how the UN can better align itself with the world of international finance in support of the 2030 Agenda. Participants took stock of recommendations, initiatives, and best practices for investing in SDG sectors in developing countries. The information shared at the event was then collected in the toolbox, which includes both existing and future global public and private initiatives.

In his letter announcing the toolbox’s launch to UN Member States in September 2018, Lajcak notes that it addresses both increasing private investment in SDG-related sectors, as well as improving the sustainability and inclusivity of private investments. The toolbox identifies four keys to boost financing for the SDGs:

Provide leadership, by setting guiding principles, galvanizing action, and ensuring policy coherence; Mobilize investment, by raising finance and reorienting financial markets towards investment in SDG sectors; Channel investment, by promoting and facilitating investment into SDG sectors; and Maximize investment impact, by increasing the sustainable development benefits and minimizing the risks of investment in SDG sectors.

The toolbox’s website was launched during the World Investment Forum held from 22-26 October 2018, in Geneva, Switzerland. It will be managed by the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and continuously updated.

The report titled, ‘Energizing Finance: Understanding the Landscape 2018,’ highlights areas related to financing energy access that require urgent action to achieve SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy). It notes that committed finance stands at only half of the US$52 billion required annually to achieve universal electricity access. The report warns that funding for clean cooking has declined, accounting for less than one percent of projected funding needed to stop the millions of deaths caused annually by traditional biomass cooking.

The report aims to help finance institutions and policymakers develop and implement strategies that can be scaled and refined to increase affordability and accessibility of clean and sustainable energy. It provides evidence that finance sources considered the most efficient for unlocking greater capital, such as concessional development finance, are decreasing rather than increasing. For example, concessional development finance for electrification decreased by 7 percent to US$4.8 billion.

Concessional development finance for electrification is decreasing.

According to the publication, for the second year in a row, finance committed across the 20 countries accounting for nearly 80 percent of those living without energy access went down. At the same time, finance for coal-powered energy has been on the rise, with annual commitments up from US$2.8 billion to US$6.8 billion.

Speaking about the report, Rachel Kyte, SEforALL CEO and Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy for All, underscored the need for a strong project pipeline and sufficient levels of public investment to “crowd in private finance.”

Other key findings from the report include: off-grid solutions remain off-track; solar financing is increasing; two thirds of all electricity finance tracked was concentrated in South Asia, mainly in India; and investment favors non-residential customers.

The report calls for urgent action and recommends that:

international public financial institutions fulfill their commitments to close financing gaps for electricity access;

policymakers prioritize non-coal fired or fossil fuel power generation as part of their integrated energy planning and investment processes;

governments adopt integrated approaches to energy sector policy, planning and regulation; and

leaders, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, use a combination of policy, financial instruments and business model innovation to achieve “last mile access.”

Research for the report was undertaken in partnership with the Climate Policy Initiative. The EU provided financial assistance.

225,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/paris21-reports-on-international-support-to-statistics/,"Thu, 01 Nov 2018 07:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,PARIS21 Reports on International Support to Statistics,"24 October 2018: The financing for the data agenda has gained visibility over the past five years, but only 56 of the 102 countries with statistical plans have secured adequate financing to implement them, according to a report prepared by PARIS21. In addition, it finds that available information on domestic support for statistics remains a challenge in many developing countries.



The 2018 edition of the Partner Report on Support to Statistics (PRESS), issued annually by the Secretariat of the Partnership in Statistics for Development in the 21st Century (PARIS21), aims to provide a full picture of international support to statistics. It identifies factors that are important in constructing well-financed national statistical systems, including: a high level of national political interest; donor alignment with government strategies; legal autonomy or giving legal status to national statistical offices (NSOs); the alignment of National Strategies for the Development of Statistics (NSDSs) with country development plans; and coordination between statistical stakeholders through regular inter-agency meetings. The report mainly provides information until 2016, and is based on “newly available data” from an annual donor survey, and the 2016 Creditor Reporting System (CRS) – the official source of information on aid commitments from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries, and some multilateral organizations.

According to the report, support to statistics amounted to US$623 million in 2016, marking a 5% increase from 2015, and the share of official development assistance (ODA) focused on data and statistics was 0.33%. However, the overall amount of funding for data and statistics remains low, and support remains concentrated on certain countries, with the top 25 recipients receiving nearly half of the support dedicated to 165 countries. The top-ten support recipients for 2006-2016 were Bangladesh, Bolivia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania and Vietnam.

The report indicates that a large share of global support to statistics continues to come from a very small number of providers. The top five providers of development cooperation in statistics are the World Bank, the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), Eurostat, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), which contributed 69% of total commitments in 2016. Also, based on a survey on Global Private Philanthropy for Development presented by the OECD in 2018, private philanthropy organizations are getting more involved in statistical development, the report says. Private foundations provided US$23.9 billion from 2013 to 2015, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was the most significant of the foundations surveyed, providing 49% of total resources.

Only two of nine SIDS have their national strategy for statistical development fully funded and under implementation.

On areas benefiting the most from statistical support, the report outlines demographic and social statistics (28% of total commitments in 2016), adding that environmental and multi-sectoral statistics “reached a record level” with the adoption of the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. On gender, it notes that statistics are not prioritized in data collection, resources devoted to them remain “grossly inadequate,” and the three areas where statistical investments are more focused are: sexual and reproductive health and rights, eliminating violence against women, and women’s economic empowerment.

On regional allocations, the report indicates that: Africa received the largest share of statistical support with 56% in 2014-2016; the share of total statistical support committed to Latin America and the Caribbean increased from 5% to 8%, driven by several commitments to national censuses in the region; and the share of commitments received by Asia and Pacific fell by half, due to the fact that some large projects committed in 2013 were no longer included for the 2014-2016 period.

On small island developing States (SIDS), the report notes that commitments to SIDS remain low. It adds that most SIDS are lagging behind in terms of building statistical infrastructure and developing statistical planning, and only two out of nine SIDS have their national strategy for development of statistics fully funded and under implementation.

On fragile states, the report mentions that statistical systems have made progress in strengthening their statistical capacities, but a lack of resources and technical skills has persisted. The authors call for more commitments and long-term investment for strengthening systems and capacity development in contexts experiencing fragility to implement and monitor National Development Plans (NDPs), and the SDGs, and to fill sector-specific gaps in areas such as environmental and economic statistics.

In terms of international initiatives on supporting data and statistics, the report states that a new PARIS21 study is currently exploring the feasibility of setting up a Global Fund for Development Data, that could feed into the reflection regarding a funding framework to underpin the implementation of the Cape Town Global Action Plan. The report points to the creation of a Data for Development group within the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC), to discuss data strategies for development and identify good data for development practices in areas such as financing, partnerships with donors and evaluating data interventions. It also mentions a collaboration on a gender statistics programme between PARIS21 and UN Women, within the framework of the Making Every Woman and Girl Count global flagship initiative.

PARIS21 is a global network of statisticians, policymakers, analysts, and development practitioners which facilitates statistical capacity development, advocates for the integration of reliable data in decision making, and coordinates donor support to statistics with the main objective to achieve national and international development goals and reduce poverty in low and middle-income countries. It was established by the UN, the European Commission, the OECD, the IMF, and the World Bank. Its Secretariat is hosted within the OECD’s Statistics and Data Directorate.

The 3G is a 30-member grouping of small and medium-sized countries that seek greater engagement in G20 processes. Its 11th ministerial meeting took place on 28 September 2018, in New York, US, in the lead-up to the G20 meeting, which takes place from 30 November to 1 December in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

The 3G ministers emphasized the importance of maintaining “an open, rules-based multilateral trading system as embodied by the World Trade Organization (WTO).” The 3G ministers also reaffirmed the role played by international organizations with universal membership in global standard setting.

227,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/ecosoc-special-session-urges-building-vulnerable-states-resilience/,"Tue, 20 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,ECOSOC Special Session Urges Building Vulnerable States’ Resilience,"13 November 2018: The UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) discussed innovative solutions to help vulnerable small island developing States (SIDS) build climate resilience during a special session of the Council. The session featured two interactive panel discussions on commitments and results to date and financing a forward-looking resilience-building agenda in SIDS.

ECOSOC President Inga Rhonda King (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines) opened the session by inviting participants to make the case for including vulnerability as a criterion for ensuring concessional financing for SIDS. UN Development Programme (UNDP) Director for the Regional Bureau for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), Luis Felipe Lopez-Calva, said UNDP supports recognizing SIDS’ vulnerability as a criterion in country classification, including for climate-vulnerable island nations to access concessional financing. The Secretary‑General’s Special Envoy for the 2019 Climate Summit, Luis Alfonso De Alba, said building resilience is an urgent matter for SIDS but recognized that they have difficulty in accessing resources because they are considered middle-income countries (MICs) and sometimes have high debt levels. Colin Granderson, Assistant Secretary‑General, Foreign and Community Relations, Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Secretariat, said middle-income categorization and graduation deny Caribbean SIDS access to concessional financing and low-cost development, leaving them limited fiscal space to build climate-resilient infrastructure. He suggested exploring innovative financial instruments and considering “more open-minded policy approaches,” such as using vulnerability as an additional criterion for accessing concessional financing, creating fiscal space through debt relief and converting bilateral and multilateral debt into special funds to address natural hazards and economic shocks, among other proposals.

Many participants, including King, underscored the continued importance of official development assistance (ODA) alongside other innovative types of financing. The UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), Executive Secretary, Alicia Bárcena, said SIDS will not achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development without finding an effective way to adapt to climate change, urging the UN General Assembly (UNGA) to include SIDS’ resilience on its 2019 agenda. She highlighted ECLAC’s ‘Debt for Climate Adaptation Swap Initiative,’ a proposal for the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to acquire Caribbean debt at a discount to give “fiscal breathing space” for countries to focus on building resilience. Lopez-Calva underscored the importance of building strong partnerships to support States to build resilience, as emphasized at the inter-regional preparatory meeting for the SIDS’ Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway mid-term review. He also welcomed SIDS’ embracing the blue economy approach to improve economic diversification.

A holistic notion of resilience encompasses environmental and economic elements as well as economic diversification.

On resilience, King supported a “holistic notion of resilience” that encompasses environmental and economic elements as well as economic diversification. Granderson said the Caribbean is working to become the world’s first climate-resilient region. He emphasized investing in preparedness for climate change and natural hazards as key to establishing resilience and reducing economic and human costs.

On the UN Secretary-General’s 2019 Climate Summit, De Alba said the UN Secretary-General is focusing on adaptation, emission reduction and increasing the resiliency capacity of the most vulnerable countries, among other issues.

The panel themed, ‘Taking Stock: Commitments and Results to Date,’ featured a number of presentations followed by an interactive discussion. Many speakers described the impacts of natural disasters and climate change on their countries and regions, including the psychological and social costs of rebuilding countries. Dominica said her country has established the Climate Resilient Execution Agency to rebuild it following Hurricane Maria, with a central focus on climate resilience. Egypt, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China (G77/China), said the G77/China appreciates the unique needs of SIDS, and identified the SAMOA Pathway review as a platform for action to move forward. Barbados, on behalf of the CARICOM, called for a vulnerability index and new financing mechanisms as well as assistance for MICs. Canada said her country prioritizes ensuring that vulnerable SIDS have access to concessional financing, and supported strengthening the global risk insurance framework. Cuba said the Paris Agreement on climate change, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and the SAMOA Pathway must be implemented as one package.

The dialogue on ‘Next Steps: Financing a Forward-looking Resilience Building Agenda in SIDS’ reflected on climate finance options, including debt relief, the ECLAC debt and the ‘Debt for Climate Adaptation Swap Initiative,’ fulfilling ODA commitments and replenishing the GCF in 2019. Chamberlain Emmanuel, Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), described the Caribbean Nationally Determined Contributions Finance Initiative (NDC FI), emphasizing the advantages of a public-private partnership (PPP) approach to improve the quantity and quality of bankable projects. Denis Jordy, Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), World Bank, said the Bank believes partnerships are fundamental for action on climate change and DRR. Participants also shared options to build resilience, such as through reforestation of degraded land and energy efficiency, and recognized the potential for climate change to act as a catalyst for a transition to a green and blue economy.

Maldives, on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), said climate change is the biggest challenge for AOSIS, and stressed the importance of also addressing adaptation in SIDS. Nauru expressed concern on the pace of the GCF replenishment, and urged the Fund’s board to promptly agree to a reliable, predictable replenishment process that makes adequate levels of climate finance available to meet the urgent needs of developing States. Nauru further observed that “establishment of an international mechanism on loss and damage” has “waned” as a political priority, and called for speeding up the process to enable vulnerable countries to rebuild from cyclones, droughts and floods.

The agenda aims to support achievement of the CBD’s Vision of Living in Harmony with Nature by 2050.

Egypt, as the President of the 14th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 14) to the CBD, and China, as the future host of COP 15, launched, on 15 November, the ‘Sharm El-Sheikh to Beijing Action Agenda for Nature and People’ in collaboration with the CBD at the UN Biodiversity Conference, which is convening from 14-29 November in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt.

The action agenda has three main objectives: to raise public awareness about the urgent need to stem biodiversity loss and restore biodiversity health for both humanity and the global ecosystem; to inspire and implement nature-based solutions to meet key global challenges; and to catalyze cooperative initiatives in support of global biodiversity goals. The action agenda will be hosted on an online platform that will receive and showcase commitments and contributions to biodiversity from stakeholders across all sectors in advance of COP 15, which will convene in Beijing, China, in 2020. This platform will enable the mapping of global biodiversity efforts, and help to identify key gaps and estimate impact.

The action agenda seeks to enable a paradigm shift in the human-nature relationship from abuse and neglect to respect, value and sustainability.

In explaining the rationale for the action agenda, the CBD states that humans have modified 77 percent of land on Earth, excluding Antarctica, an increase from 15 percent a century ago. Vertebrate populations have declined by 60 percent from 1970 levels, and the oceans have absorbed 60 percent more heat than previously thought, posing additional challenges to efforts to limit global warming. The CBD states that “we are rapidly destroying nature” but stresses that society has the knowledge and skills to change the current path and trajectory. Within this context, the action agenda seeks to enable a paradigm shift in the human-nature relationship “from abuse and neglect to respect, value and sustainability.”

The action agenda will place special emphasis on the nature-climate-oceans-water-land nexus and action areas related to the SDGs. The initiative welcomes the announcements of additional initiatives to raise ambition in conservation, sustainable use and access and benefit sharing (ABS) and in mainstreaming conservation measures and biodiversity solutions across all sectors.

229,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/baseline-report-urges-coherent-efforts-to-realize-sdg-5-all-sdgs-in-asia-pacific/,"Thu, 08 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Baseline Report Urges Coherent Efforts to Realize SDG 5, All SDGs in Asia-Pacific","October 2018: The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and UN Women have released a publication examining gender equality and the SDGs in Asia and the Pacific. The report establishes a baseline for governments and policymakers to monitor and accelerate progress towards gender equality commitments in the SDGs.

In June 2016, the ADB and UN Women signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to strengthen their cooperation and partnership to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment in Asia and the Pacific. The baseline report reflects the high-level commitment of both organizations to support regional cooperation and national efforts to accelerate progress towards gender equality and gender-responsive SDG implementation.

The publication titled, ‘Gender Equality and the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific: Baseline and pathways for transformative change by 2030,’ argues that gender equality should be addressed both in its own right and as a catalyst of progress across all the SDGs. According to the report, inequalities for women and girls “remain stark” across the region on a broad range of indicators: the region has high levels of violence against women and harmful practices; women have poor access to quality sexual and reproductive health services; there are low levels of women in decision-making; a disproportionate share of women engage in vulnerable work; and women bear an unequal share of unpaid care work.

The report focuses on four policy areas, which the authors say highlight the potential of gender equality to catalyze change across the SDGs. On realizing sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), the report emphasizes the synergies and interlinkages between realizing these rights and achieving other SDGs. As an illustration, fewer unplanned pregnancies, greater family savings and productivity could improve household living standards (SDG 1), nutrition (SDG 2), maternal and child health (SGD 3), and school attendance (SDG 4), all of which could potentially catalyze greater benefits for communities and the economy.

On recognizing, reducing and redistributing unpaid care and domestic work, the report highlights how redistributing women’s disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work can unleash their economic potential and enhance other development outcomes, including increased time for women to participate in education (SDG 4), politics and leadership (SDG 5), engage in decent work and economic opportunities (SDG 8) and engage in self-care and leisure activities. Unpaid care and domestic work are a significant challenge for women in Asia-Pacific, according to the report, which finds that over 20% of women in the region identify work-family balance as a key challenge to participation in the labor force. In Bangladesh and Pakistan, 83% and 73% of women say responsibility for domestic work is the primary reason they do not engage in paid work. The report also highlights how demographic changes, such as people living longer, increases the demand for care, underscoring the importance of investing in accessible, affordable and quality services for child, disability and elderly care.

On eliminating violence against women and girls, the authors explain that addressing this would increase women’s income (SDG 1), opportunities to complete education (SDG 4) and participation in paid employment (SDG 8). Some of the highest rates of violence globally are in the Pacific, according to the report, which recommends tackling entrenched attitudes and social norms around gender roles.

On the fourth policy area, empowering women to build climate resilience and reduce disaster risks, the report states that women’s mortality rates in major disasters in the region are much higher than men’s, citing examples from Indonesia and the Solomon Islands. The report finds that women and girls are especially dependent on climate-sensitive natural resources for their livelihoods (SDG 1), are over-represented among food-insecure populations (SDG 2), have less capacity to cope with the adverse climate impacts on water quality and availability (SDG 6) and on coastal and marine resources (SDG 14), including as a result of their lack of access and control over land and other productive resources (SDG 5). Despite these disadvantages, the report emphasizes that women can be important agents of change and play a key role in mitigating and adapting to climate change. The report recommends: more robust data and evidence for better planning, monitoring and implementation of climate action; empowerment of women as key actors in tackling climate change, such as through involvement in sustainable land and ecosystem management and development of early warning systems; and integration of gender perspectives into climate finance.

The report also outlines the data availability for gender-related SDG indicators used in the report, noting that that only 26% are available for more than two-thirds of the countries or territories in Asia-Pacific, and 41% of indicators have no relevant regional data. Further, only three of the 14 official indicators for SDG 5 (gender equality) are classified as ‘Tier 1,’ meaning that data is regularly produced by countries with regional methodologies, and regional data is only available for one of these indicators. The report concludes that “significant investment is needed to monitor gender equality in the SDGs.” The authors call for “heightened urgency” to improve production and use of gender statistics to ensure “evidence-based SDG localization.”

The report concludes with key recommendations to advance a gender-responsive approach to SDG monitoring and implementation, such as: removing discrimination from legal frameworks and promoting change in social norms; promoting gender-responsive institutions and localization to mainstream and prioritize gender equality across all policy sectors; ensuring women’s active and equal participation, representation and leadership at all levels; and increasing financing and investment, including by making gender a priority in domestic resource mobilization.

The landing page of the website also outlines job openings in the three areas of reform.



The UN Secretary-General’s reform agenda aims to enhance the UN’s contribution to sustainable development, ensure more effective capacities to tackle conflict and sustain peace, and improve the UN’s internal management and ability to deliver. As noted in the SDG Knowledge Hub’s Annotated Guide to the UN Secretary-General’s Reform Proposals, the three reform tracks address the fragmentation and bureaucratization of the UN system, which cause gaps, duplication of work, and resource drainage.

On development reform, the ‘United to Reform’ website notes that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will require bold changes to the UN development system for the emergence of a new generation of country teams, centered on a strategic UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) and led by an impartial, independent and empowered resident coordinator (RC). The website includes information on the RC’s role, and on the transition team that has been created to provide strategic leadership and oversight to all aspects of the repositioning of the UN development system. The site also features frequently asked questions (FAQs), as well as a backgrounder and key messages on UN development system repositioning.

On management, the website says the reform process seeks to empower managers and staff in the UN and its Secretariat, simplify processes, increase transparency and accountability, and improve on the delivery of UN mandates. It explains that the reorganization of the existing UN Department of Field Support and the UN Department of Management into two new departments (the UN Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance and the UN Department of Operational Support) seeks to ensure that UN management structures better support all senior managers to achieve effective programme and mandate delivery.

The ‘Management reform’ section of the website also outlines priority areas for improvement, including: improving the speed and responsiveness of service delivery; establishing greater coherence in management structures; strengthening performance management culture; ensuring effective management of resources for mandate implementation; enhancing transparency and accountability; and increasing trust between UN Member States and the UN Secretariat.

Per the website, the peace and security reform process comprises five elements: 1) creating a UN Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and a UN Department of Peace Operations; 2) creating a single political-operational structure with regional responsibilities under the UN Assistant Secretaries-General; 3) establishing a Standing Principals’ Group of the UN Secretary-General and the UN Under-Secretaries-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and for Peace Operations; 4) enhancing certain priority areas to ensure coherence and coordination across the peace and security pillar; and 5) introducing several non-structural changes “in the way the peace and security pillar works.”

The website also notes that the peace and security reform aims at, inter alia, prioritizing prevention and sustaining peace, enhancing the effectiveness and coherence of peacekeeping operations and special political missions, and ensuring a closer alignment between peace and security, UN development and human rights pillars.

The Roadmap seeks to protect key jaguar corridors while also contributing to biodiversity conservation and sustainable development.

The jaguar ranges across 18 countries in Latin America. As a result of habitat loss and fragmentation, human-jaguar conflict and illegal poaching, 50 percent of the jaguar’s original range has been lost, and the jaguar is now extinct in El Salvador and Uruguay. According to the UN Development Programme (UNDP), successful jaguar conservation requires landscape planning and management in development and economic sectors, such as agriculture, forestry and infrastructure, to maintain biodiversity and connectivity. By conserving jaguars, conservation initiatives also maintain biodiversity, forests, carbon, watersheds and cultural and national heritage, and support achievement of the SDGs, the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.

The Jaguar Conservation Roadmap represents the type of innovative partnership that is essential for achieving the SDGs.

The Jaguar Conservation Roadmap for the Americas aims to strengthen the Jaguar Corridor, which ranges from Argentina to Mexico, by securing 30 priority jaguar conservation landscapes by 2030. The regional initiative will strengthen international cooperation and raise awareness on jaguar protection initiatives, such as connecting and promoting jaguar habitats, mitigating human-jaguar conflict and promoting sustainable development opportunities that support the well-being of indigenous peoples and local communities. The initiative also seeks to raise awareness on the jaguar’s role as a keystone species whose presence is indicative of a healthy ecosystem. The Roadmap outlines four strategic conservation pathways: coordinating at a range level to support protection and connectivity; developing and implementing range countries’ strategies and improving contributions to transboundary efforts; scaling up conservation-compatible sustainable development models in jaguar corridors; and enhancing the financial sustainability of systems and actions to conserve jaguars and their ecosystems.

UNDP Head of Biodiversity and Ecosystems, Midori Paxton, said the Jaguar Conservation Roadmap “represents the type of innovative partnership that is essential for achieving the SDGs” and will help protect key jaguar corridors in ways that strengthen sustainable livelihoods for local communities and open up business opportunities for sustainable agriculture and ecotourism.

Also in support of jaguar conservation, the UNDP, Panthera, Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and government representatives announced the creation of the first-ever Jaguar Day to raise awareness about threats facing the jaguar and conservation efforts in support of the species. The Day will be celebrated annually on 29 November.

The Roadmap’s release comes after a UN high-level forum that resulted in the launch of the ‘Jaguar 2030 New York Statement’ by 14 jaguar range countries and international conservation organizations.

Governments are expected to adopt guidelines for implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change and flesh out the details required to operationalize the treaty through the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP). Paris Agreement implementation contributes to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and advances SDG 13 (climate action). This policy brief outlines expectations for the Katowice Climate Change Conference, and is structured around the three questions of the 2018 Talanoa Dialogue: Where are we? Where do we want to go? and How do we get there?

The conference, running from 2-14 December 2018, will include the meetings of five bodies: the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) to the UNFCCC; the 14th session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 14); the third part of the first session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA 1-3); the 49th sessions of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI); and the seventh part of the first session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement (APA 1-7).

The political phase of the Talanoa Dialogue, a political process seeking to inform the preparation of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) initiated in January 2018, will be held during the second week of the COP. Based on information gathered during the Dialogue’s preparatory phase, which is reflected in a synthesis report by the Fijian Presidency of COP 23 and the incoming Polish Presidency of COP 24, the political phase will take stock of Parties’ collective action towards “holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above preindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels,” in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.

Where Are We?

The last round of negotiations in Bangkok, Thailand, concluded with the adoption of identical conclusions under the APA, SBI and SBSTA – the ‘Bangkok Outcome,’ which also includes the ‘PAWP Compilation,’ a 307 page-long document capturing the work of the three bodies. Negotiations in Bangkok were based on a set of seven “tools,” prepared by the APA Co-Chairs. The APA also convened a one-day round table that sought to identify substantive linkages across the various parts of the PAWP, which many saw as constructive. However, progress achieved in Bangkok was “uneven,” and, some noted, likely “insufficient” to set Parties up for a successful conclusion of the PAWP in Katowice.

In preparation for the Katowice Climate Change Conference, APA, SBI and SBSTA Presiding Officers have prepared, under their own responsibility, a joint reflections note addressing progress made at the Bangkok session, and identifying ways forward, “including textual proposals,” to help advance Parties’ deliberations towards the PAWP. Negotiations in Katowice are expected to be informed by this document, which includes nine addenda outlining the ways forward and textual proposals on the various elements of the PAWP. These correspond to the APA agenda items and relate to:

mitigation : developing further guidance on features and transparency of, and accounting for, NDCs; NDC registry; common time frames for NDCs; and modalities, work programme and functions of the forum on the impacts of the implementation of response measures;

: developing further guidance on features and transparency of, and accounting for, NDCs; NDC registry; common time frames for NDCs; and modalities, work programme and functions of the forum on the impacts of the implementation of response measures; adaptation : further guidance on adaptation communication and adaptation communication registry;

: further guidance on adaptation communication and adaptation communication registry; transparency : modalities, procedures and guidelines for the transparency framework for action and support;

: modalities, procedures and guidelines for the transparency framework for action and support; the global stocktake (GST);

(GST); compliance : developing the modalities and procedures for the effective operation of the committee to facilitate implementation and promote compliance, established by Article 15 of the Paris Agreement; and

: developing the modalities and procedures for the effective operation of the committee to facilitate implementation and promote compliance, established by Article 15 of the Paris Agreement; and further matters.

Parties have raised numerous issues under “further matters,” including elaborating the governance and institutional arrangements for the Adaptation Fund to serve the Paris Agreement, a new collective finance goal, guidelines for countries when they adjust their NDCs and loss and damage, which, some Parties feel, the CMP ought to “take up.”

Where Do We Want to Go?

Delivering a detailed set of guidelines on the numerous aspects of the PAWP is no doubt a tall order, especially given the fact that, in Earth Negotiations Bulletin’s (ENB) estimation, the Bangkok session “did little to bring the PAWP into sharper focus,” and there is little clarity on how the multiple cogs and gears will fit together. The task is further complicated by the many sticking points, with deep-rooted divergences, which have also given rise to new disagreements.

For example, differences over differentiation appear to persist in spite of the Paris Agreement arguably “settling the matter” by weakening the developed/developing country firewall. The Group of 77 and China (G-77/China) continues to be concerned over “the attempt by some to undermine” the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC). The Like-Minded Group of Developing Countries (LMDCs) has lamented developed countries’ “repeated attempts” to renegotiate the Paris Agreement by “erasing differentiation” in negotiations on NDCs in the context of mitigation, as well as on compliance and the transparency framework. The BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) have also expressed their desire to see work on mitigation reflect differentiation between developed and developing countries, with developed countries taking the lead on emission reduction. Many developed countries maintain that this bifurcated approach, particularly to NDCs in the context of mitigation, “has no basis” in the Paris Agreement.

The developed/developing divide has spilled over to negotiations under the enhanced transparency framework. Developed countries view transparency of mitigation efforts as key to reaching the objective of the Paris Agreement, whereas developing countries find transparency of support provided and received of paramount importance. Communication by developed countries of transparent and consistent information under Article 9.7 on accounting modalities for provided finance also remains contentious.

Parties will need to advance work on the PAWP in spite of these and other differences in a speedy and coordinated fashion in order to complete the guidelines in Katowice. The incoming COP Presidency’s push for political declarations on a just transition, forests and electric mobility may present an additional challenge, given that the task of operationalizing the Paris Agreement is momentous, and time and resources are limited.

How Do We Get There?

The recent IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15) has warned that while limiting the global average temperature rise to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels is still possible, it will require rapid and “unprecedented” transitions in all aspects of society, including: the transformation of energy, agricultural, urban and industrial systems; engagement of non-State actors; and integration of climate action into broader public policy and development frameworks. The urgency of global, concerted climate action has been highlighted by other reports, including NewClimate Institute’s ‘Global Climate Action from Cities, Regions and Businesses,’ the UNFCCC ‘Yearbook for Global Climate Action 2018’ and the WWF ‘Living Planet Report 2018,’ which paints a “sobering picture” of the impact of human activity on the world’s wildlife, forests, oceans, rivers and climate.

Several States have recently announced ambitious carbon neutrality targets, expanding the membership of the Carbon Neutrality Coalition that includes countries and cities alike. In a recent report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) recognized the importance of government decisions in bending renewable energy trends and achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement and the SDGs. Non-State actors, including federal states, regions, investors, businesses and civil society, showcased a broad range of climate initiatives at the Global Climate Action Summit (GCAS) in September 2018. If implemented, these pledges, together with countries’ NDCs, will bring the world closer to the 2°C target. It remains to be seen if the operational guidelines Parties are expected to agree in Katowice will catalyze climate action ambitious enough to keep the warming under 1.5°C – the temperature threshold that will offer some of the most vulnerable countries “the best chance for survival.”

233,https://www.edie.net/news/7/Report--SDG-alignment-has-generated--233bn-in-business-revenue-last-year/,"Wed, 07 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",edie.net,Report: SDG alignment generated $233bn in business revenue last year,"Report: SDG alignment generated $233bn in business revenue last year

By moving to embed the aims of the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into their sustainability strategies, 13 of the world's biggest corporates have collectively generated $233bn of revenue.

That is the key finding of a new report from financial assessment firm Trucost, which analysed the benefits that the 13 companies had reaped from taking SDG-aligned actions across their value chains, from raw material sourcing to product and packaging disposal.

Covering firms such as technology giant HP, health and beauty chain Walgreens Boots Alliance and energy firms Iberdrola and Ørsted, Trucost’s analysis reveals that the 13 companies collectively generated around $233bn of 'SDG-aligned' business revenues in 2017.

Given that the companies collectively record annual revenues of $266bn, this figure accounts for as much as 87% of each firm’s individual revenue.

The analysis was conducted with the help of Trucost’s newly-developed SDG evaluation tool, which aims to assess whether a company has achieved “holistic” alignment with the SDGs, based on its sector and location.

The tool takes into account the extent to which an organisation is exposed to SDG-related risks; the actions it has taken to mitigate negative impacts on society and the environment; the positive contributions it has made to the SDGs and whether its approach is balanced.

Developed with expertise from the likes of the London School of Economics, the UN Global Compact and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the tool was trialled on 34 companies before being released on Monday (5 November).

Aside from generating raw revenue, TruCost’s managing director and global head of corporate business Libby Bernick explained that the tool was designed to help businesses identify SDG-aligned business value, prioritise risks and opportunities and update their sustainable growth strategies.

""Working with a diverse range of companies and market specialists has enabled us to develop a robust framework to assess SDG-aligned business value so that it is comparable across business activities and regions,"" Bernick said.

""We are grateful for the collaboration of our program participants in helping to address growing demand for holistic SDG metrics to meet the decision-making needs of investors, company boards, and other market participants.""

The 13 companies to have been analysed in the report are Walgreens Boots Alliance, Tarkett, Spectrum Brands Holdings, S&P Global, Rockwool Group, Ingersoll Rand, HP, CLP Holdings, Arm, AMD, Aguas Andinas, Iberdrola and Ørsted

SDG stumbling blocks

Since the unveiling of the framework in 2015, 193 countries, 9000 companies and investors with more than $4 trillion in assets have pledged their support to the SDGs.

But as more and more businesses move to align with all or some of the Global Goals, recent research by KPMG found that companies are still struggling to achieve boardroom buy-in for action on the SDGs due to a lack of available metrics for tracking progress against their aims.

In other words, despite recent studies suggesting that as much as $12trn and 380 million jobs could be generated by 2030 if the SDGs are placed at the heart of global economic strategies, case studies proving the specific benefits of adopting each and all of the Goals at a business level is rare.

Similarly, PwC has found that two-fifths of businesses are still failing to engage meaningfully with the SDGs, while the UN Global Compact has concluded that the private sector is failing to follow through on commitments.

These findings, compounded by the UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development’s (UKSSD) claims that the nation is only performing well on 24% of targets considered relevant to the domestic delivery of the Goals, spurred the UK Government to launch its first review into business performance against the SDGs earlier this year.

Just over a quarter (28%) of businesses have set Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to help them measure and disclose their positive contributions towards the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), despite repeated warnings that corporate action has been slow and weak.

That is a key conclusion of a new report from professional services giant PwC, which has revealed the results of a survey of 700 corporates on SDG action.

Published today (26 November), the firm’s SDG reporting challenge report shows that almost three-quarters (72%) of businesses have mentioned the Global Goals in their annual corporate or sustainability reports this year – a 10% increase since 2017.

Half of the companies, meanwhile, claimed they had identified “priority” SDGs – areas where their firm or sector could maximise their positive impact.

However, the report concludes that concrete measures for SDG action and integration remain “elusive” for the majority of businesses, with an inability to identify ambitious or long-term goals cited as a key barrier.

Specifically, it notes that only 27% of corporate survey respondents mention the SDGs as part of their business or sustainability strategy in annual reports, and that just 19% of chief executive or chair statements in annual reports mention the 17 Goals.

“The increase in companies indicating the SDGs challenge in their reporting is a positive sign of engagement that will increasingly need to be backed by strategies which look beyond business as usual at the opportunities being presented,” PwC’s global sustainability reporting and assurance lead Alan McGill said.

“Success with the SDGs depends on making them a central part of business strategy. What is planned for, measured and reported in public filing is a good indicator of what is embedded in a businesses’ strategy and priorities.”

Ambition or action?

The findings of the new report echo those made by PwC at the start of the year, when the firm surveyed 500 companies across 17 countries on similar issues.

In that survey, PwC found that most respondents were failing to explicitly make the connection between the 17 Goals and 169 targets, placing SDG logos into their reports as “lip service” rather than working to convert stakeholder aspiration into corporate action.

Similarly, sustainability consultancy Corporate Citizenship has warned that tangible plans and partnerships on the global goals have stalled, while the UN Global Compact has concluded that the private sector is failing to follow through on commitments.

The UK Stakeholders for Sustainable Development’s (UKSSD) claims that Britain is only performing well on 24% of targets considered relevant to the domestic delivery of the Goals. This finding has spurred the UK Government to launch its first review into business performance against the SDGs earlier this year.

“While there is a clear appetite for embracing the SDGs, many organisations still lack the strategy, tools and culture needed to transform those commitments into tangible business actions,” PwC’s global SDGs lead Louise Scott added.

“For every one of the 17 Goals, there are pressing real-world issues that directly impact the world of business.”

The initiative will strengthen wildlife law enforcement at ports, and increase cooperation between ports and maritime stakeholders.

According to UNDP, illegal wildlife trafficking from Africa “has surged over the last ten years.” The Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) reports that 403 tons of ivory were seized between 2007 and 2017, an amount equivalent to 54,460 killed elephants. The overwhelming majority of ivory is trafficked via the sea, where there is less risk of interception and arrest. Between 2007 and 2017, only one-third of wildlife seizures were made at exit ports in Africa and only 19 percent of all seizures have resulted in convictions. These statistics underscore the importance of targeting transit points and strengthening law enforcement to end incentives for wildlife poaching and stop the illegal trade in wildlife.

The initiative will build law enforcement agencies’ capacity to detect and intercept illegal wildlife products.

The GEF-financed, World Bank-led Global Wildlife Program (GWP) will target two key African exit ports: Mombasa, Kenya; and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Traffickers regularly use these ports for illegal transportation of poached African wildlife to Asia, including elephant ivory, rhino horns and pangolins. The initiative will strengthen cooperation between key ports in Africa and Asia to prevent illegal wildlife trafficking. In partnership with the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC), the Royal Foundation, the Global Wildlife Program and others, it will raise awareness among port stakeholders on wildlife crime, and build law enforcement agencies’ capacity to detect and intercept illegal wildlife products.

The initiative will also contribute to reaching SDG 15 (life on land) and target 15.7 in particular, which calls for taking urgent action to end poaching and trafficking of protected species of flora and fauna and addressing both demand and supply of illegal wildlife products.

The US$2 million initiative will run for 36 months. The GEF launched the seven-year Global Wildlife Program in 2015. The Program brings together funding from a wide range of partners and works in a number of participating countries to counter wildlife poaching and trafficking.

The Declaration of Astana will feed into discussions at the UN General Assembly’s (UNGA) 2019 high-level meeting on universal health care.



The Global Conference on Primary Health Care took place from 25-26 October 2018, organized by the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the Government of Kazakhstan. A high-level session on the first day adopted the Declaration of Astana and discussed a whole-of-government approach to improving primary health care. Yelzhan Birtanov, Minister of Health, Kazakhstan, anticipated that the adoption of the Declaration of Astana will set “new directions” for developing primary health care as the basis of health care systems.

The Declaration commits to strengthening national health care systems and making health for all a reality, 40 years after the first commitment to primary health care was made in the 1978 Declaration of Alma-Ata. SDG target 3.8 calls for achieving UHC, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health care services, and access to safe, effective, quality, and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.

UNICEF calls for health resources to focus on building strong comprehensive health systems, rather than focusing on single-disease interventions.

UNICEF notes that progress since 1978 has been uneven, with at least half the world’s population lacking access to essential health services, and almost six million children dying from preventable causes before reaching the age of five. The agency calls for health resources to focus on building strong comprehensive health systems, rather than focusing on single disease interventions.

The Declaration acknowledges that, despite “remarkable progress” over the past 40 years, many people around the world still have unmet health care needs. It calls for action to counter the growing costs of health care, medicines and vaccines, and avoid waste and inefficiency in health care spending, acknowledging the impact of disproportionate out-of-pocket spending by patients and their families in causing poverty.

Other issues highlighted in the Declaration include the challenge of antimicrobial resistance, the burden of lifestyle-related and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and the impact of environmental factors, such as extreme climate events, that affect people’s health. The Declaration commits to applying both scientific and traditional knowledge in primary health care, providing decent work and appropriate compensation for health professionals, and investing in education and training of the primary health care workforce.

239,https://businessmirror.com.ph/2018/11/05/despite-growth-phl-not-seen-to-hit-sdg-goal-of-zero-hunger/,"Mon, 05 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",Business Mirror,"Despite growth, PHL not seen to hit SDG goal of zero hunger","THE country’s economic success has not brought it any closer to achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of zero hunger, according to a study released by four United Nations agencies.

The report entitled “Asia and the Pacific Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition” was published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef), World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

The UN agencies said stunting in the Philippines is over 30 percent, which is deemed a “very high prevalence,” while wasting in the country is between 5 and 10 percent, of the population, which is of medium prevalence.

“The situation is similarly challenging in nutrition and health areas, where a large majority of countries in the region risk missing the SDG and World Health Assembly targets. These developments in food security and nutrition are at odds with the region’s continuing high level of economic growth,” the regional heads of the four UN agencies wrote in their joint foreword.

The report stated that while economic growth, particularly higher levels of per capita income, has helped improve nutrition, relying on economic growth and higher incomes is insufficient.

While the Philippines’s performance was still above expectations, the average annual rate of reduction in the prevalence of stunting in the country was slow and closer to flat growth.

The report stated that countries like Bangladesh, Mongolia, Nepal, Thailand and Vietnam did better in reducing stunting among Asia- Pacific economies.

The incidence of wasting among children under five years old in Southeast Asia, which includes the Philippines, needs to be reduced by 44 percent—or 2.3 million

children—to meet the target.

The four UN agencies cited a study in 2016 which found that the key drivers of child stunting were “poor dietary quality and quantity for children under two years, poor nutrition of women before and during pregnancy, and poor sanitation and hygiene practices in households and communities.”

The report added that “primary importance of both good maternal nutrition and appropriate child-feeding practices with timely introduction of diverse complementary foods” were also needed to prevent stunting.

“Wasting and stunting share several common causes, including poor maternal nutrition before and during pregnancy, poor diets of young children, poor personal hygiene, poor household sanitation, and household poverty,” the report stated.

Data made available by the report showed the coverage of 90+ iron folic acid supplements among pregnant women in the country was only 34 percent.

This may have contributed to the slight reduction recorded by WHO in the prevalence of anemia in women of reproductive age in Asia between 2012 and 2016, as indicated in the report.

The report explained during pregnancy, women should receive iron folic acid supplementation within the first trimester and for a minimum of 90 days to prevent anemia.

“The receipt of any iron folic acid supplementation and the receipt of 90+ days of iron folic acid supplementation are global indicators used to track progress in anemia reduction,” the UN agencies said.

Apart from these, water and sanitation also play important roles in improving nutrition nationwide. However, the performance of the country has remained lackluster.

The agencies noted that in the Philippines, there are 57 million Filipinos who do not have piped water supply within the premises of their households.

While this is nowhere near the gap in India where 742 million people do not have piped water supply in their premises, this still makes the country part of the top 10 countries with the most number of people lacking piped water supply in the Asia-Pacific region.

Data also showed that in terms of sanitation, less than 80 percent of Filipinos have access to basic sanitation services. This means over 20 percent of Filipinos do not have basic sanitation services.

The report said there are 6 million Filipinos who continue to practice open defecation, the same as Cambodia. India has the most number of open defecators at 522 million followed by Indonesia with 22 million.

The UN agencies cited various reasons this practice persists: traditional practices, least priority for households, and lack of knowledge about the health risks. Poverty and urbanization has also contributed to this problem.

“The percent of people practicing open defecation has actually increased recently in China, India and the Philippines,” the report stated.

“Open defecation in urban areas is driven by a lack of space to build toilets in high-density settlements and an unwillingness of tenants to invest in toilets where landlords do not provide them,” it added.

This is the first time that the four UN agencies responsible for helping countries in Asia and the Pacific achieve food security, improve maternal and child health and welfare, have jointly published such a report.

Their joint efforts underline the urgency of the present situation and represents a united front and call to action in urging governments to show greater resolve in meeting previous commitments to end hunger and improve food security and nutrition across the region.

The four UN agencies summarize the report’s findings: “What is becoming increasingly clear is that the world cannot meet the 2030 target of zero hunger if Asia and the Pacific— the world’s most populous region—is not leading the way. It is a hard reality but one that must be faced with a united determination to turn things around.”

The report concludes with a cautious note of optimism. “Together, we hope that the findings of this report will contribute to a more informed dialogue. Without doubt, all stakeholders must make much greater efforts to accelerate progress toward the goals of a healthy and hunger-free Asia and the Pacific but their action is needed now. The sense of urgency cannot be overstated.”","THE country’s economic success has not brought it any closer to achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of zero hunger, according to a study released by four United Nations agencies.

Do the Tinsels

Of Tinsel-town

Like Christmas Day?

From my lair

On Mount Critic …

It’s tricky to say.

They Tinsel up holiday movies each year

But I don’t see much joy or holiday cheer.

For years now, they’ve built up a gloomulous glut

Of glum Christmas flicks. They’ve been stuck in a rut —

From R-rated dregs to Tim Allen-ish dreck

And the Jim Carrey Grinch, which is awful as heck.

The Tinsels don’t Seuss well. Their efforts fall flat,

From the unspooky Lorax to Mike in the Hat.

Only Horton was done right, kind and angelic

And Blue Sky’s Who-ville was drolly Geisel-ic.

But Ron Howard’s Who-ville was ugly and vile:

A hell in the ’burbs in true Tinsel-town style.

Shallow, promiscuous, cruel through and through.

If I’d been born there, I would be a Grinch, too.

Now we’re back in Who-ville for the Grinch’s return

With the Lorax and Minions crew — cause for concern.

While they’ve mastered the “secrets” of box-office glory

Their “despicable” debut was their last decent story.

It’s easy to see how this thing could go wrong

With Lorax-ish satire that doesn’t belong

In this tale of kind Whos who welcome a crank,

Enlarging his heart and forgiving his prank.

So I’m happy to state, though my praise may be faint-ish,

My critical heart is more pleased than complaint-ish.

The Tinsels have managed to Seuss out this one

And it’s decent, good-hearted, forgettable fun.

It’s visually playful, with gadgetry Gru-vy

Repurposed in new ways both Grinchy and Who-vy.

Especially the heist — a logistical dream

As much as a mean anti-holiday scheme.

Replacing Karloff-ian malice and spite

Cumberbatch-ian grousing makes this one Grinch-lite.

It’s a kinder and gentler tale than we’ve seen —

Of course he’s not nice, but this Grinch is less mean.

(I knew that he wasn’t as mean as he said

When he caved to his pets and let them in his bed.

And one is a reindeer as big as a moose!

This pushover’s not the guy scripted by Seuss!)

But he does still hate Christmas! The whole thing is bosh!

Except … gingerbread might be worth a nosh

And scenes of togetherness of kith and kin…

He sneers, but it’s clear he’s conflicted within.

And, you know, I’m okay with this sour-sweet sinner:

Clinging to mean … tempted by Christmas dinner.

The Whos are quite decent, I’m happy to say,

In an innocent, cheerful, Ned Flanders-ish way.

They may go a bit far with the whole Christmas thing,

But they sing for-real carols about Christ the King.

Then there’s Cindy-Lou Who, bouncy and sprightly —

A bit like young Ellie from Up, very slightly —

Determined to make contact with Santa Claus,

But her mother’s well-being is her only cause.

(Mom is single, a nurse, and works hard to get by.

It’s the third Dad-less Seuss film with no reason why.)

There are bits that don’t work, to tell you the truth,

Like glimpses of Grinchy’s unfortunate youth.

There’s hit-and-miss slapstick, and weak gags are made,

And added narration doesn’t quite make the grade.

(Pharrell Williams’ delivery falls a bit short;

Anapestic tetrameter isn’t his forte.)

But the group-hug finale sells it with feeling,

And Who-ville, though silly, is warmly appealing.

All are accepted, whatever the hue,

Or the shade, or the size, or the shape of the Who.

Even nasty outsiders, green-furred and alone

Find kindness and mercy to such as them shown.

The classic tale takes this too much as a given.

Seuss’ Grinch is converted — but is he forgiven?

When he brings the Whos’ things back down from Mount Crumpit,

Announcing himself with a literal trumpet,

Does he apologize — repent in the least?

Or merely presume of his place at the feast?

Grace is a gift, not a matter of course.

And that’s one way this movie improves on its source.

244,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-promotes-technological-developments-for-sdgs/,"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Promotes Technological Developments for SDGs,"7 December 2018: The UN General Assembly has adopted a resolution asking key UN bodies for updated findings on the impact of key technological changes vis-a-vis the 2030 Agenda, for discussion at the fourth annual UN Multi-stakeholder Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation (STI Forum). The UN also recently announced that over half the world is using the internet, held a high-level briefing on frontier technologies for sustainable development, and convened a forum on internet governance.

In June 2018, the UN Technology Facilitation Mechanism (TFM) and the Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD), a subsidiary body of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), presented initial findings on ways in which technology can support the SDGs, during the third STI Forum. The UNGA resolution adopted on 22 November 2018 (A/RES/73/17) requests the two bodies to update their findings, invites them to strengthen their synergies and mutually reinforce their work on STI, and requests the Secretariat to avoid overlapping meeting dates to further increase coherence. The fourth STI Forum will take place from 14-15 May 2019. Looking ahead to the UNGA’s 74th session, the resolution also invites the UNGA President to convene a high-level thematic debate to take stock of progress on the topic.

Presenting the draft resolution, Juan José Gómez Camacho, Mexico, said new technologies “can change the destinies of nations.” He called for the consideration of technological change in the next follow-up and review cycle on SDG implementation, given the opportunities presented by new technologies, as well as the fact that their impacts will depend on governments’ ability “to come together and cooperate on realizing a global vision.”

On 7 December, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) announced that more than half of the world’s population will be using the internet at 2018’s end. ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao noted that the milestone “represents an important step towards a more inclusive global information society.” Despite ITU highlighting that 96% of global society now lives within reach of a mobile cellular network, Zhao underscored that many are still waiting to experience the gains associated with internet access or a digital economy. With near-global coverage and the fastest rates of growth taking place in Africa, the impact of the internet on society is only expected to increase.

AI algorithms must shed human biases, participants stressed at the 2018 Internet Governance Forum.

In November, the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) brought together more than 3,000 participants at UNESCO headquarters in Paris, France, on the theme ‘Internet of Trust.’ Key messages are available on the Forum’s eight major topics:

Cybersecurity, Trust & Privacy;

Development, Innovation & Economic Issues;

Digital Inclusion & Accessibility;

Emerging Technologies;

Evolution of Internet Governance;

Human Rights, Gender & Youth;

Media & Content; and

Technical & Operational Topics.

The Chair’s Summary underscores the cross-cutting nature of new technologies, noting that governance of the internet must be both multistakeholder and multidisciplinary to ensure that systems do not discriminate and that artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms shed human biases. [UN Press Release] [IGF Homepage]

The IGF is convened annually by the UN Secretary-General, and this year, was hosted by the Government of France. In his remarks, French President Emmanuel Macron launched the ‘Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace. UN Secretary-General António Guterres described opportunities afforded by the digital world, but also advised vigilance. Recognizing that traditional forms of regulation do not necessarily apply to the new challenges that have accompanied the digital era, Guterres noted the emergence of potential issues around cybersecurity, data and instances of “the Internet being used as a platform for hate speech, for repression, censorship, and control.” Guterres emphasized the need to create a shared language, calling for a dedicated effort to include and amplify weak or missing voices.

Next year’s IGF will be hosted by the Government of Germany. An advisory group containing 52 members has been appointed to lead preparations. [UN News Release]

Also in November, the World Web Summit 2018 took place in Lisbon, Portugal, bringing together approximately 70,000 attendees. The 24 discussion tracks ranged from autonomous vehicles to cryptocurrencies to health. Guterres described the web as having the potential to turbocharge the world’s progress towards the SDGs, saying the UN itself is utilizing technologies to enhance impacts and achieve its goals. He also raised concerns on uneven social impacts, the spread of hate speech as noted at the IGF, and the weaponization of artificial intelligence.

An event titled ‘High-level Briefing on Frontier Technologies for Sustainable Development: Findings from the World Economic and Social Survey 2018’ took place on 1 November 2018 at UN Headquarters in New York, US. Moderated by Elliott Harris, UN Chief Economist, the event reviewed findings from the 2018 survey, a common message of which is that “technology is neither exogenous nor neutral,” meaning that societal needs and policy prerogatives must guide the development, diffusion and adoption of new technologies. The survey and event highlighted national-level policy measures that can maximize technologies’ potential while mitigating risks, taking economic efficiency, equity and ethical considerations into account.

245,http://sdg.iisd.org/news/africa-report-finds-slow-progress-on-clean-water-energy-urbanization/,"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Africa Report Finds Slow Progress on Clean Water, Energy, Urbanization","4 December 2018: The 2018 Africa Sustainable Development Report highlights the region’s progress on the SDGs and shares lessons learned in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Africa’s Agenda 2063. The 2018 report focuses on five Goals, aligned with the focus of the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF): SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation); SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy); SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities); SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production); and SDG 15 (life on land).

The UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), the African Union Commission (AUC), the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the UN Development Programme’s (UNDP) Regional Bureau for Africa jointly prepared the annual report. They launched the report at the 12th session of the Committee of Director-Generals of the National Statistics Office, which took place in Khartoum, Sudan.

On SDG 6, the report finds that access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation has improved in Africa but remains very low by global standards, despite the fact that Africa, excluding North Africa, receives the largest amount of official development assistance (ODA) for water supply and sanitation. In addition, there are wide disparities between and within countries, with higher access in North Africa compared to the rest of the continent. The proportion of people with safely managed sources of drinking water varies from 100% in Mauritius to 19% in Eritrea. Further, 43% of Africa’s rural population has access to basic drinking water services compared to 82% of the urban population. The report identifies several emerging challenges that threaten progress on SDG 6, including climate change, droughts, floods and water management.

On SDG 7, the report finds access to electricity has increased from 39.7% in 2008 to 45.9% in 2014 in Africa. Despite this progress, access to electricity is “much lower than the global average” and rural-urban disparities are “particularly stark,” with an average electrification rate of 70% among the urban population compared to 17% in rural areas. Hydropower generation accounts for slightly over 60% of Africa’s electricity supply but other renewable energy sources, particularly solar, remain “largely untapped.” Africa’s efficiency in energy use has improved but biomass reliance remains a challenge, with approximately 780 million people cooking with solid biomass.

On SDG 11, the report states that Africa is the fastest urbanizing region in the world, with the urban population predicted to increase from 40% today to 51.5% by 2040. The report reflects that much of the continent’s urbanization is “unplanned…and poorly managed,” and is characterized by severe service and infrastructure deficits and social and spatial segregation as well as the world’s highest proportion of slum dwellers. In addition, the report finds that Africa’s cities have made limited progress on air pollution and solid waste collection, loss and damage from disasters, access to public transport and urban sprawl, constraining the region’s efforts to achieve inclusive growth.

On SDG 12, the report finds that Africa, excluding North Africa, wastes more than 30% of its annual food production as a result of poor post-harvest handling, with most losses occurring at the level of production. Africa’s domestic material consumption remains low.

On SDG 15, Africa’s rate of forest cover loss is “much higher” than the global average. In contrast to this regional trend, Ghana and the Gambia have increased their forest cover as a percentage of their land area. Like other regions of the world, the report observes Africa faces the risk of extinction of major animal species. On a positive note, Africa outperforms most world regions in the conservation and sustainable use of its mountain resources.

The report also reflects on SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals), emphasizing that the development of science, technology and innovation (STI) are key for achieving the SDGs and Agenda 2063. The report finds that Africa’s STI infrastructure, as measured by internet access and access to electricity, “is improving but relatively weak” and characterized by low investments in research and development and fragmented innovation systems. The report recognizes the investments made by Kenya, Morocco, South Africa and Tunisia on research and development and strategies to strengthen their innovation systems. The report also underscores the need for strengthening inter-sectoral planning and collaboration to ensure coherent, effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063.

The report recommends that policymakers, inter alia: prioritize investments in water and sanitation to improve access, enhance health outcomes and leverage populations’ productive capacities; improve rural access to energy to address rural-urban disparities; improve access to energy-efficient cooking stoves to enhance energy efficiency, reduce pollution and improve health outcomes; and provide incentives to drive investments in renewable energy. The report also calls for strengthening capacities for urban planning and management to drive inclusive and sustainable economic prosperity and integrating urbanization in national development planning.

Participants discussed the report’s findings at the 13th African Economic Conference (AEC), hosted by the UNECA, AfDB and UNDP in Kigali, Rwanda, from 3-5 December 2018. Adam Elhiraika, UNECA, called for investing in data and analysis on urban trends and impacts of environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainable development, among other recommendations. Chidozie Emenuga, AfDB, said the potential of Africa’s rapidly growing cities and urban settlements “has not been fully tapped.” He urged providing incentives to investments in sanitation, renewable energy and access to electricity.

246,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/un-report-finds-inclusion-gaps-for-people-with-disabilities/,"Thu, 06 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UN Report Finds Inclusion Gaps for People with Disabilities,"3 December 2018: The UN released its first-ever report on persons with disabilities and the SDGs, finding persons with disabilities continue to face numerous barriers to their full inclusion and participation in the life of their communities. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) launched the report during the commemoration of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.

The publication titled, ‘UN Flagship Report on Disability and Development 2018: Realization of the Sustainable Development Goals By, For and With Persons with Disabilities,’ is the first UN system-wide effort to examine disability and the SDGs at the global level. The report is published by, for and with persons for disabilities with the aim of fostering more accessible, disability-inclusive societies.

The report connects findings on persons with disabilities with each of the 17 SDGs. On SDG 1 (no poverty), the report states that poverty rates are 15 percentage points higher, on average, for persons with disabilities; in some countries, the proportion of persons with disabilities living under the national poverty line is double that of persons without disabilities. Similarly, on SDG 2 (zero hunger), the average percentage of persons with disabilities who are unable to afford protein every second day is nearly double that of people without disabilities. In their daily lives, persons with disabilities face challenges in accessibility to workplaces, businesses and public spaces, as well as access to education, health and sanitation facilities, transport and new technologies. Further, the report indicates that persons with disabilities, particularly women and girls, are underrepresented in decision-making and political participation. It concludes that persons with disabilities “are not yet sufficiently included in the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the SDGs.”

The report notes that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is linked to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), and its implementation should be in line with the CRPD to incorporate the disability perspective in all aspects of SDG implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The report provides recommendations on how to achieve specific SDGs for persons with disabilities. On SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), for example, the report suggests eight steps to address the energy needs and implement SDG 7 for persons with disabilities by 2030, such as including targeted measures for persons with disabilities in energy programs and promoting electricity in schools to increase the use of assistive technology in education and enhance opportunities for students with disabilities to participate equally in educational systems.

On data, the report finds “a significant increase” in the number of countries that now include a set of questions on disability in their census: in 1970, approximately 19 countries or areas included questions on disability, while 120 countries or areas did in 2010. To increase the availability of data disaggregated by disability, the report recommends: continuing to build capacity to collect, process, analyze and disseminate data disaggregated by disability; regularly updating international guidelines on the production of data disaggregated by disability; and investing in an international repository of disability data to monitor progress towards the SDGs for persons with disabilities.

Upon the report’s launch, UN Secretary-General António Guterres emphasized that the 2030 Agenda represents a commitment to reduce inequality and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all, including those with disabilities. Despite this commitment, he said, the report “shows that people with disabilities are at a disadvantage regarding most SDGs.” Guterres called for reaffirming commitments to work together for a better world that is inclusive, equitable and sustainable for all, and “where the rights of people with disabilities are fully realized.”

To compile the report, researchers reviewed legislation from 193 UN Member States to highlight good practices that can create a more inclusive society in which people with disabilities can live independently. For instance, 168 countries have disability schemes that provide periodic cash benefits to persons with disabilities, only one-third of these countries cover persons with disabilities regardless of their income status. The report calls for recognizing the contributions of persons with disabilities to society and for enhancing efforts to mainstream the needs, rights and perspectives of people with disabilities into the process of achieving the SDGs at all levels to leave no one behind (LNOB).

To advance inclusive development for all, the report recommends concrete action in four areas: 1) addressing fundamental barriers causing exclusion of persons with disabilities, including discriminatory laws and policies, negative attitudes, stigma and discrimination and lack of access to assistive technology, among other barriers; 2) mainstreaming disability in SDG implementation, particularly for SDG 1, SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7, SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities; 3) investing in monitoring and evaluation of progress towards the SDGs for persons with disabilities; and 4) strengthening the means of implementation of the SDGs for persons with disabilities in the areas of capacity building, technology, finance, policy and institutional coherence and multi-stakeholders partnerships.

The guidelines highlight the potential contribution of improved housing to achieving SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).



WHO developed the guidelines based on reviews of the scientific literature and specially commissioned studies. The guidelines are intended for policy makers who set housing-related policies and regulations, and for industry professionals such as urban planners, architects and housing developers. The guidelines affirm the need to address the social determinants of health and tackle social and health inequalities. WHO emphasized that, besides health considerations, better housing conditions can also increase quality of life and help mitigate climate change, as well-insulated housing decreases heating and cooling costs, reducing energy consumption and contributing to achievement of SDG 13 (climate action).

The 172-page publication devotes whole chapters to the topics of household crowding, low indoor temperatures, high indoor temperatures, injury hazards, and accessibility. Various indoor hazards are also addressed, such as smoke, noise, asbestos and radon, a radioactive gas that is linked with cancer.

248,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/mobile-industry-reports-increasing-impact-across-all-sdgs/,"Tue, 04 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Mobile Industry Reports Increasing Impact Across all SDGs,"28 November 2018: The third edition of the Mobile Industry Impact Report finds that the mobile industry’s impact has increased across all 17 SDGs, with mobile operators aligning activities with the SDGs and integrating the SDGs into their core values, strategies and services. The report, produced by GSMA, emphasizes the mobile industry’s commitment to leverage the power of mobile networks and the services they provide to accelerate achievement of the SDGs.

GSMA represents the interest of mobile operators around the world, including more than 750 mobile operators with over 350 companies in the broader mobile ecosystem. The ‘2018 Mobile Industry Impact Report: Sustainable Development Goals’ from GSMA Intelligence finds that more than two-thirds of the global population are now connected to mobile technology. The authors argue that mobile is a powerful tool for achieving the SDGs, including reducing poverty (SDG 1), improving health care (SDG 3) and education (SDG 4) and driving sustainable economic growth (SDG 8). According to the report, countries with high levels of mobile connectivity have made the most progress is meeting SDG commitments; in other words, “quality of life improves as people gain access to mobile technology.”

Three key characteristics of the mobile industry explain how the industry increases its contribution across the SDGs: deployment of infrastructure and networks, which provide the foundations for a digital economy and act as a catalyst for innovative and diverse services; access and connectivity; and enabling services and relevant content, including mobile agriculture and mobile health. In 2017, there were 690 million registered mobile money accounts around the world, which helped to expand financial and social inclusion.

The report assesses the progress of the mobile industry’s contribution to each SDG with a score between 0 to 100, representing the actual industry impact on that Goal, relative to its potential. SDG 1 (no poverty) has a score of 42, which means that the industry is achieving 42% of its potential impact. The three SDGs most impacted by mobile are SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), with a score of 51% ; SDG 4 (quality education), with a score of 48.2%; and SDG 13 (climate action), with a score of 46.9%.

As an illustration, on SDG 9, mobile is enabling new business models such as mobile savings and credit and pay-as-you-go solar models to access clean energy. A table illustrates progress on SDG target 9c (increasing access to information and communications technology (ICT) and providing universal and affordable access to the internet in least developed countries). On SDG 4, the report states that women are more likely than men to use mobile for educational purposes, underscoring how mobile can reduce gender inequality, in line with SDG 5 (gender equality). SDG 14 (life below water) received the lowest impact score, at 19.4%, followed by SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) at 34.3%.

On three SDGs, mobile impact scores have significantly improved since 2015: SDG 13, which has improved its score by 7.8%; SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), which has improved its score by 6.3%; and SDG 3 (good health and well-being), which also improved its score by 6.3%. Since the mobile industry committed to the SDGs, the industry has played an increasing expanding role in humanitarian response, such as through the use of mobile phone to provide essential humanitarian assistance during natural or climate-related disasters or epidemics. In 2017, mobile operators reached more than 30 million people affected by crisis and disasters.

The report showcases examples of a better future through mobilize communication. In Malaysia, for example, mobile technology is helping forestry officials to monitor new growth of mangroves, which is expected to help protect coastal areas and enable fish populations to recover. In Peru, mobile classrooms facilitate digital learning for children in remote areas of the Amazon rainforest, providing students with access to educational resources and teachers with innovative materials and methods. In Puerto Rico, AT&T deployed its Cells on Wings (COWs) drone following Hurricane Maria, providing wireless connectivity to customers in a 40 square mile area and facilitating thousands of calls and texts among residents effected by the disaster.

The report also provides in-depth analysis on five SDGs in which operators are engaged and have achieved a significant impact or improvement since 2015: SDG 2 (zero hunger); SDG 10 (reduced inequalities); SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation); SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 11. As an illustration, the mobile industry’s impact on SDG 6 and 7 improved significantly between 2015 and 2017, with the industry driving progress in providing critical utility services to off-grid populations and new service delivery mobiles through different mobile channels, including connectivity, mobile money and M2M technologies. In East Africa, the solar pay-as-you-go model (PAYG) has been so successful that other sectors in the region are replicating the business model for cookstoves, solar-powered irrigation, sanitation products and water delivery. Globally, PAYG solar sales increased from 450,000 in 2015 to 1.6 million in 2017, with 8.5 million individuals benefitting from access to clean and reliable energy in their homes as a result of this technology.

Despite progress towards the SDGs, the report recognizes that the industry “must also do more, faster” to achieve the SDGs, including by delivering and scaling mobile-enabled solutions to accelerate SDG achievement and extending mobile connectivity to people who are offline. Three factors that contribute to slower increases in impact, the report finds, are: market maturity, with less scope to match earlier progress when the mobile industry has already achieved significant gains; challenges connecting the final third of the population, including challenges related to affordability issues, remote locations and lack of digital skills and local content; and growth in new technologies only partially compensating for the ‘deceleration’ effect in network expansion and connecting the unconnected.

To accelerate progress, the report recommends accelerating mobile connectivity to unconnected populations and addressing barriers to mobile connectivity, particularly around incentives for infrastructure investment, affordability, the gender gap, digital skills and availability of local content and services. Second the report recommends proving and scaling mobile-enabled solutions to catalyze SDG achievement by increasing mobile money, mobile health, education, agriculture and mobile-enabled energy, water and sanitation and digital humanitarian assistance and digital identity services. The report underscores the importance of operators, governments, international organizations and other industries collaborating to support the scaling of new and existing mobile solutions.

The report was presented at an event on mobilizing ICTs for sustainable development, held at UN Headquarters in New York, US on 28 November 2018.

249,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/sdg-indicator-group-sets-methodologies-for-all-but-44-indicators/,"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,SDG Indicator Group Sets Methodologies for All but 44 Indicators,"27 November 2018: The UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on the SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) reached agreement on measurement methodologies on several indicators. This agreement will allow for fuller measurement of several aspects of SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), as well as targets on sustainable food production, food waste, access to medicine, free primary and secondary education, market regulation, migration, sustainable urbanization, marine acidity, and organized crime, among others.

IAEG-SDGs 8 convened from 5-8 November 2018, in Stockholm, Sweden, with one of the four days held in a closed format for IAEG members, and the other three days open to observers.

The IAEG developed the global SDG indicator framework in response to a mandate in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The framework was agreed on by the UN Statistical Commission and adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2017. The framework contains 232 indicators for measuring the 169 SDG targets.

Many of the indicators are still under development, and they are classified into three “tiers” to show their status: Tier I denotes that an indicator is both conceptually clear and available data exists for its measurement. A Tier II indicator has a clear methodology but inadequate data. If an indicator is classified as Tier III, it requires methodological development. Tier III indicators are not reflected in the annual SDG reports presented to the HLPF.

By the end of November 2018, following the meeting in Stockholm and subsequent discussions, the Group had agreed to reclassify the following indicators from Tier III to Tier II, reflecting agreement on the methodology for their measurement:

SDG 2 (zero hunger): Indicator 2.4.1 – Proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture (for Target 2.4 – Sustainable Food Production and Resilient Agricultural Practices) (target abbreviations per the Global Goals project);

SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing): Indicator 3.b.3 – Proportion of health facilities that have a core set of relevant essential medicines available and affordable on a sustainable basis (for Target 3.b – Support Research, Development and Universal Access to Affordable Vaccines and Medicines);

SDG 4 (quality education): Indicator 4.1.1 (a) – Proportion of children and young people in grades 2/3 (for Target 4.1 – Free Primary and Secondary Education);

SDG 10 (reduced inequalities): Indicator 10.2.1 – Proportion of people living below 50 per cent of median income, by sex, age and persons with disabilities (for Target 10.2 -Promote Universal Social, Economic and Political Inclusion); Indicator 10.5.1 – Financial Soundness Indicators (for Target 10.5 – Improved regulation of global financial markets and institutions); Indicator 10.7.1 – Recruitment cost borne by employee as a proportion of yearly income earned in country of destination (for Target 10.7 – Responsible and Well-Managed Migration Policies); and Indicator 10.7.2 – Number of countries that have implemented well-managed migration policies (also for Target 10.7)

SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities): Indicator 11.3.2 – Proportion of cities with a direct participation structure of civil society in urban planning and management that operate regularly and democratically (for Target 11.3 – Inclusive and Sustainable Urbanization); and Indicator 11.7.1 – Average share of the built-up area of cities that is open space for public use for all, by sex, age and persons with disabilities (for Target 11.7 – Provide Access to Safe and Inclusive Green and Public Spaces)

SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production): Indicator 12.3.1 (a) – Food loss index (for Target 12.3 – Halve Global Per Capita Food Waste)

SDG 14 (life below water): Indicator 14.3.1 – Average marine acidity (pH) measured at agreed suite of representative sampling station (for Target 14.3 – Reduce Ocean Acidification) (see SDG Knowledge Hub story on this indicator reclassification);

SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions): Indicator 16.4.2 – Proportion of seized, found or surrendered arms whose illicit origin or context has been traced or established by a competent authority in line with international instruments (for Target 16.4 – Combat Organized Crime and Illicit Financial and Arms Flows); and Indicator 16.7.1 (a) Proportions of positions in national and local public institutions, including the legislature (for Target 16.7 – Ensure responsive, inclusive and representative decision-making)



In addition, the Group reclassified six indicators from Tier II to Tier I, due to regular data production for these indicators. They correspond to SDG targets 3.3 (Fight communicable diseases); 3.8 (Achieve universal health coverage) (2 indicators); 3.b (Support research, development and universal access to affordable vaccines and medicines); 6.5 (Implement integrated water resources management) and 6.6 (Protect and restore water-related ecosystems).

For SDGs 12, 13 and 14, several indicators remain in Tier III. But for SDG 10, the reclassifications mean that only one indicator is Tier III.

As of these decisions, the tier classification contains:

Tier I: 100 indicators (no single SDG has all of its indicators in Tier I);

Tier II: 82 indicators; and

Tier III: 44 indicators.

Six other indicators have components in different tiers.

Before the reclassifications noted above, SDG 10 had five of its 11 indicators in Tier III; now only one SDG 10 indicator remains Tier III. Goals for which several indicators remain in Tier III include:

SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) with eight and a half of its 13 indicators in Tier III;

SDG 13 (climate action) with five of eight indicators in Tier III; and

SDG 14 (life on land), with four of ten indicators in Tier III.

Among the remaining Tier III indicators, the following correspond to targets with a 2020 deadline:

SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth): Indicator 8.b.1 – Existence of a developed and operationalized national strategy for youth employment, as a distinct strategy or as part of a national employment strategy (for Target 8.b – By 2020, develop and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment and implement the Global Jobs Pact of the International Labour Organization)

SDG 12: Indicator 12.2.1 – Material footprint, material footprint per capita, and material footprint per GDP (for Target 12.2 – By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources) Indicator 12.4.2 – Hazardous waste generated per capita and proportion of hazardous waste treated, by type of treatment (for Target 12.4 – By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment

SDG 13: Indicator 13.a.1 – Mobilized amount of United States dollars per year between 2020 and 2025 accountable towards the $100 billion commitment (for Target 13.a – Implement the commitment undertaken by developed-country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion annually by 2020 from all sources to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation and fully operationalize the Green Climate Fund through its capitalization as soon as possible)

SDG 14: Indicator 14.2.1 – Proportion of national exclusive economic zones managed using ecosystem-based approaches (for Target 14.2 – By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans) Indicator 14.7.1 – Sustainable fisheries as a proportion of GDP in small island developing States, least developed countries and all countries (for Target 14.7 – By 2030, increase the economic benefits to small island developing States and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism)

SDG 15 (life on land): Indicator 15.9.1 – Progress towards national targets established in accordance with Aichi Biodiversity Target 2 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 (for Target 15.9 – By 2020, integrate ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and local planning, development processes, poverty reduction strategies and accounts)

SDG 17 (partnerships for the Goals): Indicator 17.18.1 – Proportion of sustainable development indicators produced at the national level with full disaggregation when relevant to the target, in accordance with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics (for Target 17.18 – By 2020, enhance capacity-building support to developing countries, including for least developed countries and small island developing States, to increase significantly the availability of high-quality, timely and reliable data disaggregated by income, gender, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability, geographic location and other characteristics relevant in national contexts)



The Group plans to continue to reclassify indicators as requirements are met, considering them during semi-annual in-person meetings and bi-monthly teleconference meetings in between. The next tier reclassification web meetings will take place on 17 January and in early February 2019.

The next in-person IAEG meeting (March or April 2019) is expected to include the final progress review of Tier III indicators to determine whether any should be deleted. These will be included in a “preliminary list of possible deletions, replacements, adjustments and additions” for open consultation between May and July 2019 as part of the first “comprehensive review” of the global indicator framework. A list of 37 indicators under consideration for addition has been prepared.

The consultation results will be reviewed by September 2019, and a final proposal will be prepared for consideration by the UN Statistical Commission at its 51st meeting in March 2020. More details on the timeline of the comprehensive review are available here.

IAEG members stressed during the Stockholm meeting that the review should not lead to an additional burden on national statistical work, nor undermine the investments already made in national statistical systems.

The meeting also discussed: a minimum level of data disaggregation for each target and indicator; two proposed proxy indicators (for 11.a.1 and 12.b.1); and the draft guidelines on data flows and global data reporting. [SDG Knowledge Hub sources] [IAEG-SDGs 8 Webpage]","27 November 2018: The UN Inter-Agency and Expert Group on the SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) reached agreement on measurement methodologies on several indicators.
The IAEG developed the global SDG indicator framework in response to a mandate in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As of these decisions, the tier classification contains:Tier I: 100 indicators (no single SDG has all of its indicators in Tier I);Tier II: 82 indicators; andTier III: 44 indicators.
Before the reclassifications noted above, SDG 10 had five of its 11 indicators in Tier III; now only one SDG 10 indicator remains Tier III.
Goals for which several indicators remain in Tier III include:SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) with eight and a half of its 13 indicators in Tier III;SDG 13 (climate action) with five of eight indicators in Tier III; andSDG 14 (life on land), with four of ten indicators in Tier III."
250,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/paper-outlines-sdg-measurement-challenges/,"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,Paper Outlines SDG Measurement Challenges,"6 December 2018: A paper from the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES) reviews the process involved with identifying the SDG indicators, noting that although the SDGs were negotiated and agreed by all UN Member States, the global statistical community has defined the SDG targets through the indicators. The paper emphasizes that the indicators will determine whether the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is ultimately pronounced a “success, a failure or something in-between.”

The paper titled, ‘The 2030 Agenda: An Unprecedented Statistical Challenge,’ provides a critical examination of the SDG indicators from a statistical perspective and outlines some measurement challenges. Authored by Steve MacFeely (FES), the paper notes that SDG indicators are only performance metrics as they inform whether a target is being achieved or not. However, he writes that relatively little discussion has addressed the additional data required to inform and design integrated policies in order to implement actions to achieve the SDG targets.

The MDGs contained 60 indicators, but countries could only populate two-thirds of them by 2015.

Reflecting on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) – the predecessor framework of the SDGs – the paper notes that the MDGs’ requirements were modest, both in number and complexity, with eight goals, 21 targets and 60 indicators, compared with 17 goals, 169 targets and 232 indicators for the SDGs. Despite that, it says, at the end of the MDGs’ lifecycle in 2015, countries could only populate, on average, two-thirds (68%) of the MDG indicators.

Among other challenges, the author remarks that some Member States’ insistence on prioritizing official country data may be counterproductive in the longer term as it may place an “enormous burden” on some countries, and could result in many SDG indicators remaining unpopulated. He notes that the SDGs are likely to be the driving force for statistical advances in the coming years, in terms of statistical concepts, methodology, statistical organization and the use of new data sources. He warns, however, that these developments could open the door to the outsourcing or privatization of official statistics if the existing systems fail to deliver on expectations.

MacFeely discusses big data and administrative data, predicting that the latter will be “a must richer source of useable data,” but notes that attention to administrative data is lacking. He stresses the importance for national statistical offices (NSOs) and National Statistical Systems (NSSs) to secure legal access to administrative data, adding that the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has recommended changes to statistical legislation to ensure that NSOs or NSSs have access to all the data sources necessary for statistics.

On the cost of measurement, MacFeely reports that resources required to support the poorest countries in implementing the SDG indicator framework range from US$1 billion to US$1.25 billion per annum, while implementing the SDGs could cost between US$3.5 and 5 trillion per year.

The author presented the paper at an event hosted by FES at UN Headquarters in New York, US, in November 2018. The event was moderated by Chantal Line Carpentier, UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), and involved Ivo Havinga, UN Statistics Division, and Sally Engle Merry, New York University.

Also on the SDG indicators, the UN’s Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) held its eighth meeting to discuss work plans for moving remaining indicators out of ‘Tier III’ (on which no agreed methodology for measurement are available), and to consider proxy indicators for Tier III indicators. The meeting took place at the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden from 5-8 November 2018.

The conference, hosted by the Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei (FEEM), also considered the 2018 Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) Italy’s SDG Cities Index report.

The Conference on local leadership for sustainability (‘Per un’Italia sostenibile: la leadership locale come motore dello sviluppo’) took place on 29 November 2019, at FEEM, SDSN Italy’s host institution, in Milan, Italy.

Italy’s SDG Cities Index report seeks to guide local policymakers in further aligning municipal initiatives with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Presenting the report, Laura Cavalli, FEEM and SDSN Italy, remarked that about 75% of Italy’s population lives in urban areas, and that the Index could serve as an analytical planning tool for cities to encourage reflection on ways to address population growth and achieve the SDGs, according to the summary of the event.

The report titled, ‘Per un’Italia sostenibile: l’SDSN Italia SDGs City Index 2018,’ currently available in Italian, examines SDG implementation in Italy’s municipalities. It features indicators specific to the Italian context, which can be used to monitor and measure SDG progress at the sub-national level. It examines 101 municipalities on 16 of the 17 SDGs, using 39 statistical indicators. The Index excludes SDG 14 (life below water) for comparability reasons.

Per the summary of the conference, the report finds that Italian cities have achieved approximately 53% of the SDG targets. Out of the 101 cities analyzed, none has “reached more than 80 per cent of overall achievement” on the SDGs.

The Italian SDG City Index was initially presented during a two-week festival on sustainable development organized by the Italian Alliance for Sustainable Development (Alleanza Italiana per lo Sviluppo Sostenibile – ASviS) and other stakeholders, from 25 May to 7 June 2018, which took place across Italy.

The brief recommends that States with high levels of internal displacement address the needs of IDPs in their implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and that countries include information on IDPs in their voluntary national reviews (VNRs).

Authored by Alice Debarre, Archibald Henry and Masooma Rahmaty, IPI, the brief explores links between internal displacement and the SDGs, highlights ongoing efforts to address the longer-term needs of IDPs, looks at the specific cases of Nigeria and Iraq, and provides recommendations for ways forward. The brief titled, ‘Reaching Internally Displaced Persons to Achieve the 2030 Agenda,’ notes the need to understand international displacement as a long-term challenge that requires coordinated and complementary approaches by humanitarian and development actors.

The authors define IDPs as “persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence… and who have not crossed an internationally recognized state border,” in accordance with the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. The Guiding Principles were introduced in 1998 by the UN Special Representative on IDPs and represent an international framework that “authoritatively restates the rights” of IDPs, as enshrined in international human rights and humanitarian law. The 30 principles cover IDPs’ needs during displacement, return, resettlement and reintegration, and have gained broad international acceptance and authority, although they were never officially adopted by the UN Commission on Human Rights or the UN General Assembly (UNGA).

The brief recalls that the 2030 Agenda pledges to “leave no one behind” and highlights IDPs as a vulnerable group that must be empowered through efforts to implement the SDGs. While there are no SDG targets or indicators specifically related to internal displacement, the brief notes, the 2030 Agenda presents an opportunity to build on existing efforts and ensure that the plight of IDPs is addressed in both the short and long terms. It states that many of the SDGs are directly related to IDPs, and including IDPs in policies to implement the SDGs could help reduce the occurrence and impact of displacement and ensure that IDPs contribute to local economies and economic growth. In this regard, the authors report that Nigeria has included IDPs in its VNR, and linked the issue particularly with SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), and SDG 17 (partnership for the Goals).

The authors also remark that neither the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration nor the Global Compact for Refugees address the issue of internal displacement. They explain that some States perceive international attention to IDP issues as an infringement on their sovereignty and have therefore been reluctant to address it in multilateral fora.

The brief reports that, as of May 2018, there are over 40 million IDPs due to conflict and violence in the world, which is nearly twice the number of refugees worldwide. Also, since they are displaced within national borders, IDPs do not benefit from the legal status of refugees and its associated protections, and fall outside of the mandate of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Among other challenges to addressing IDPs’ needs, the authors note that the different funding streams of humanitarian and development actors and the existing field architecture for UN agencies inhibit efforts to operationalize the humanitarian-development nexus, while being not conducive to joint action or collective outcomes. The authors also cite inadequate collection, processing, and sharing of data on IDPs, and the fact that supporting IDPs is not traditionally perceived as a development issue and is insufficiently included in development strategy and planning.

On initiatives that have been taken at the international level regarding IDPs, the authors outline: the April 2018 launch of the multistakeholder ‘GP20 Plan of Action for Advancing Prevention, Protection and Solutions for Internally Displaced People 2018– 2020;’ the development, by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), of a framework for addressing internal displacement; and the establishment, in 2018, of a UN Joint Steering Committee in charge of advancing humanitarian and development collaboration and assessing the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, following the UN Secretary-General’s proposal to reform the UN development system.

The brief also notes that 37 States sent a letter to the UN Secretary-General in July 2018 asking him to appoint a high-level panel on IDPs in order to bring attention to existing efforts and galvanize continuing action.

The Network will provide “effective, timely and coordinated system-wide” support to Member States, including by establishing the capacity-building mechanism called for in the Compact.



During the Intergovernmental Conference to Adopt a Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, which convened from 10-11 December 2018, in Marrakech, Morocco, 164 UN Member States adopted the Compact following an informal agreement reached in July 2018. In the Compact‘s section on implementation, governments establish a capacity-building mechanism allowing governments and companies to contribute technical, financial and human resources for implementation. In this regard, governments welcome the decision of the Secretary-General to establish a UN network on migration, which will aim to “ensure effective and coherent system-wide support for implementation, including the capacity-building mechanism, as well as follow-up and review of the Global Compact.”

Per the Network’s terms of reference, it will prioritize the rights and wellbeing of migrants and their communities of destination, origin, and transit. Its objectives include:

Supporting coherent action by the UN system at country, regional, and global levels in support of the Compact’s implementation;

Acting as a source of ideas, tools, reliable data and information, analysis, and policy guidance on migration issues, including through the capacity-building mechanism;

Ensuring close collaboration with other existing UN system coordination mechanisms that address migration-related issues;

Establishing and providing support to the capacity-building mechanism;

Engaging with external partners, including migrants, civil society, migrant and diaspora organizations, faith-based organizations, local authorities and communities, the private sector, employers’ and workers’ organizations, trade unions, etc.; and

Reporting to the UN Secretary-General on the Compact’s implementation.

The Network coordinator is the International Organization for Migration (IOM), through its Director General. The Network will consist of those members of the UN system who wish to be a part of it and for whom migration is of relevance to their mandates. Within that Network, an Executive Committee will be established, comprised of those entities with clear mandates, technical expertise and capacity in migration-related fields. The network will include Working Groups with IOM serving as their Secretariat. The Secretary-General will formally review the functional arrangements of the Network on a biennial basis, beginning in October 2020.

Speaking at the launch of the Network on 9 December, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said “now we must breathe life into what we have agreed and demonstrate the Compact’s utility” to: governments as they establish and implement their own migration policies; communities of origin, transit and destination; and migrants themselves. To that end, he highlighted the Network as “a visible sign” of UN system’s commitment to the implementation of the “historic” compact.

Also on follow-up and review of the Compact, governments decide to rename the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development as the International Migration Review Forum. This Forum will serve as the main platform for discussing progress every four years, beginning in 2022.

The Marrakesh Conference took place in a two-day plenary debate and two dialogues, which focused on: ‘Promoting action on the commitments of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration,’ and ‘Partnerships and innovative initiatives for the way forward.’ Speaking at the conference, Guterres explained that the Marrakech Compact rests on two ideas: that migration should be well managed and safe; and that national policies are far more likely to succeed if coupled with international cooperation. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, President of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), said the intergovernmental conference is a proof of the validity of multilateralism as the most effective tool to deal with one the world’s most pressing challenges.

Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, noted that her country will need more skilled labor from outside the EU, and has a vested interest in legal migration. She stressed that “the ‘go it alone’ approach will not solve the issue” and multilateralism is “the only way forward.” Pascal Teixeira, France’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said his country is driven by the belief that “multilateralism is the only response to global challenges,” adding that human mobility will likely increase in the coming decades. “It is illusory to think we can build walls,” he highlighted, but still, “there is no absolute right to migration” and the global compact does not create one.

Erol Kiresepi, CEO of Santa Farma Pharmaceuticals, presented the International Organization of Employers’ Marrakech Declaration, outlining the immediate needs of companies, ways to partner with the private sector, and recommendations for Governments.

On the sidelines of the conference, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico presented a ‘Comprehensive Development Plan in the Framework of the Conference on the Global Compact for Migration,’ which is expected to “change the paradigm” of cooperation between Mexico andnorthern Central America, according to UN Economic and Social Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) Executive Secretary Alicia Bárcena. The Comprehensive Development Plan seeks to promote development and opportunities in the region, contributing to the prevention of the migratory phenomenon and attacking its structural causes.

Noting that there are more than 250 million migrants around the world, UNGA President María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés stressed the need to take action, and clarified that the Compact does not affect the sovereignty of any State but, on the contrary, reinforces it since no State, “no matter how powerful,” can solve by its own means the challenges of international migration.

The Marrakech Compact on Migration was adopted during the Intergovernmental Conference to Adopt the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration that took place in Marrakech, Morocco, from 10-11 December 2018. The adoption of the Compact followed intergovernmental consultations led by the delegations of Mexico and Switzerland, which culminated in informal agreement on the text among Member States in July 2018. At the Marrakech conference, 164 UN Member States joined the Compact’s adoption.

After this adoption, the Compact was submitted for UNGA endorsement through draft resolution A/73/L.66 titled ‘Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration.’ In the draft resolution, the UNGA: recalls resolution A/71/1 of 19 September 2016 in which it decided to convene an intergovernmental conference to adopt the global compact as well as other related resolutions; expresses its gratitude to Morocco for hosting the Marrakech conference; and endorses the Global Compact on Migration adopted by the intergovernmental conference.

The endorsement of the Compact took place during a plenary meeting of the UNGA on 19 December 2018, at UN Headquarters in New York, US. Voting in favor of the resolution were 152 Member States, while five voted against it (Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, Poland and US) and 12 abstained (Algeria, Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Chile, Italy, Latvia, Libya, Liechtenstein, Romania, Singapore and Switzerland). In addition, 24 Member States were not present to take part in the vote.

Addressing the UNGA before Member States took action, Espinosa remarked that the content of the Compact is the result of a broad and intense process of intergovernmental negotiations, and reflects the will of States to address, in a joint manner and with a balanced and integral vision, a complex challenge which is both cross-border and global. She also said the UNGA’s endorsement will allow to: reduce vulnerabilities in migration; address the needs of the communities of origin, transit and destination; fight discrimination and the negative rhetoric against migrants; foster the empowerment of migrants and the communities that take them in; facilitate migrants’ access to decent labor; and contribute to a safe and dignified return and readmission. During the plenary meeting, 43 countries took the floor during the plenary meeting to make statements on their respective votes.

In a statement issued on the day of the endorsement, the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, noted the non-legally binding nature of the Compact. He said the agreement: calls for greater solidarity with migrants in situations of “appalling vulnerability and abuse;” underscores the need to anticipate future trends, from labour markets to the impacts of climate change; and highlights the imperative of devising more legal pathways for migration, which would also help to crack down on trafficking and exploitation.

The UN Network on Migration also issued a statement to welcome the formal endorsement of the Compact. The statement notes that the UN system is committed to support the implementation of the Global Compact, and, through the Network, will help strengthen the benefits of migration and address its “many challenges.” The UN Network on Migration was established at the request of the UN Secretary-General, and currently comprises 38 entities from the UN system. The Network is coordinated by the Director General of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) with strategic oversight provided by an Executive Committee composed of eight UN entities.

In addition to the endorsement of the Marrakech Compact on Migration, the UNGA adopted, on 17 December, the Global Compact on Refugees. Both Compacts were called for by the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants adopted by the UNGA in 2016.

The candidates for Resident Representative will be submitted to the respective countries’ governments for approval prior to appointment.

In May 2018 the UN General Assembly approved a set of changes for “repositioning” the UN development system, including reforms to the RC system. The changes and accompanying new funding scheme aim to ensure the RC system is independent from any agency, more transparent and accountable to Member States, and fully dedicated to the 2030 Agenda.

The 2018 assessment finds that ocean health is relatively stable but additional improvements are needed to achieve a sustainable future.

The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) and Conservation International developed the OHI to analyze the benefits people derive from the ocean. OHI draws on information from over 100 global datasets to analyze ecological, economic, physical and social dimensions of the ocean’s health and evaluate the benefits that oceans provide to people.

Island nations, including Aruba and New Caledonia, scored among the highest for ocean health.

The 2018 OHI finds the average score of our ocean’s health is 70 out of 100. The OHI tracks changes in ocean health over time. In 2017, nearly two-thirds of assessed countries experienced decreases in ocean health. In 2018, 111 countries experienced decreases and 109 countries experienced increases in ocean health. Island nations, including Aruba and New Caledonia, scored among the highest for ocean health. Germany was the only country in the top 17 scorers with a population over one million people. Countries that scored 50 or below included seven countries in Africa, one in Central America and two Middle Eastern nations.

NCEAS Director and OHI lead scientist, Ben Halpern, said the assessment provides an annual comprehensive diagnostic for the world’s oceans that supplies decision makers with information and knowledge to “implement effective actions for improved sustainable ocean management.” Halpern stressed that the OHI’s seven years of data has enabled “deeper insights into how healthy our oceans are through time and space.”

Also on ocean health, Esri announced a partnership with the OHI to produce an online tool titled, ‘Ocean Health Hubs,’ which will enable ocean managers to use data to better understand regional ocean health. Through the partnership, Esri and OHI have integrated OHI scores as a data layer in Esri’s ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World.

OHI Director, Eva Schemmel, explained that Ocean Health Hubs “will streamline data management, target setting and communication into one tool” that multiple collaborators can access and update. By enabling government agencies, scientists, managers, non-governmental organization (NGO) staff and citizens to use the hub together, Schemmel said engagement can be “more efficient and effective.” [Ocean Action Hub Press Release on OHI Assessment] [Ocean Action Hub Press Release on Partnership] [OHI Website]","4 December 2018: The Ocean Health Index (OHI) released its seventh assessment of global ocean health.

According to the authors, the ability of Arab societies to withstand, adapt and recover from cascading global and regional crises “is withering.”

The report was published in advance of the International Conference on ‘Financing Sustainable Development – Curbing Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs),’ which took place from 28-29 November 2018, in Beirut, Lebanon. The conference aimed to crystalize the Arab region’s input to the 2019 High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development (FfD) and the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).

The publication notes that the FfD outlook for the Arab region “remains turbulent,” primarily because of a strained socioeconomic fabric that risks being frayed by the biases of the status quo. The report finds that three years after the adoption of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) on FfD, the Arab financing gap continues to rise, with trillions needed in quality investments of all kinds. The report stresses that FfD is neither happening at the pace nor magnitude that can turn conflicts, poverty, inequality and other socio-economic hardships into “an issue of the past,” let alone realize sustainable development. The cost of conflict and the region’s post-conflict reconstruction add to the challenge, and divert attention away from the 2030 Agenda.

A finding drawn from the analysis of direct and indirect FfD exposures revealed that between 2011 and 2016, for every US$1 gained/mobilized through prime cross-border FfD channels, the region lost/returned US$2.5 to other regions, including high-income bracket economies. The situation, the report notes, challenges the dominating development narrative, as the region appears to be witnessing “an FfD reflux”: substantial resources are flowing out of rather than into the region, constituting a leakage and opportunity lost to finance the region’s own reconstruction and sustainable development imperatives.

The Arab region is also facing the largest crisis of forced displacement since World War II. The rising death toll, the publication emphasizes, constitutes a more critical concern to reconciliation, given that no price tag can be placed on the loss of life that remains largely unaccounted for in empirical assessments. The authors note that another challenge is the looming “lost generation” of Arab youth: more than 92 million decent jobs need to be created by 2030, at a time when inequalities are set to become more acute within the different segments of Arab societies, with oil-rich Arab economies investing almost US$3 trillion in sovereign wealth funds outside the region, financing this way the public debt of many developed economies.

The report warns that the resources mobilized domestically may fall short of achieving the SDGs if the informal sector remains unintegrated in the formal economy and insulated from the overall planning and implementation of the SDG reform agenda. The prospects of the region to achieve the SDGs are further undermined by the fact that the protracted delivery of the 0.7% target for official development assistance (ODA) is undermining the global FfD framework as large portions of aid budgets (11% of Donor Assistance Committee [DAC] allocations) are diverted to cover in-donor refugee costs. [Publication: The State of Financing Development for the Arab Region] [Report summary]","November 2018: The UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) published its first assessment of the state of financing for development in the Arab region.

The Framework, which was established to reduce the emissions of sports operations and to engage sports fans in the effort as well, was launched during an event on the sidelines of the Katowice Climate Change Conference, which is meeting from 2-14 December 2018 in Poland.

The sports industry produces emissions through, inter alia, travel, energy use, venue construction and catering. As such, sports organizations recognize that they have an active role to play in realizing the goals of the Paris Agreement, climate neutrality by 2050, and the SDGs.

The Framework aims to: achieve a clear trajectory for the global sports community to combat climate change; and use sports as a unifying tool to drive climate awareness and action. The initiative includes such signatories as the International Olympic Committee (IOC), International Sailing Federation, World Surf League and Forest Green Rovers Football Club.

Sports organizations recognize that they have an active role to play in realizing the goals of the Paris Agreement, climate neutrality by 2050, and the SDGs.

The Framework elaborates five principles, namely:

undertaking systematic efforts to promote greater environmental responsibility;

reducing overall climate impact;

educating for climate action;

promoting sustainable and responsible consumption; and

advocating for climate action through communication.

Those participating in the initiative have committed to: adhere to these principles; incorporate them into strategies, policies and procedures; and mainstream them within the sports community. In early 2019, participants will be invited to establish working groups to plan, pursue and enhance work related to the Framework’s principles.

The Framework will provide sports organizations with a forum where participants can pursue climate action in a mutually supportive manner by learning from each other, disseminating good practices and lessons learned, developing new tools, and collaborating on areas of mutual interest.

The UNFCCC will use its platforms, such as Climate Neutral Now and Momentum for Change, to track progress and/or highlight successes, and will facilitate and coordinate the initiative within its resources and mandates.

The event also saw the launch of a climate action guide, ‘Sustainability Essentials: Sports for Climate Action,’ for use by sports federations, which was produced by the IOC and the UNFCCC. The IOC also released ‘Carbon Footprint Methodology for the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games,’ which details guidance for Olympic Organizing Committees on measuring the carbon footprint of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. These publications aim to help make sports more sustainable and climate smart.

The Alliance aims to: help raise capital for climate investments in developing countries; encourage other countries to increase their climate protection efforts and financial contributions to developing countries; and compensate for unavoidable emissions by supporting international climate protection projects.

Facilitating emission reduction and carbon offsetting processes helps to raise funds and enable financial transfers to developing countries.

The Alliance seeks to make it easier for companies and organizations to finance carbon dioxide (CO2) offset projects in developing countries, such as biogas plants, wind power, solar energy and reforestation. Such projects avoid emissions or remove them from the atmosphere, while promoting economic and social development locally. The Alliance also aims to promote the voluntary CO2 market by improving the political framework for voluntary offsetting and helping companies network with offsetting specialists and project developers.

A First Climate press release notes that “facilitating emission reduction and carbon offsetting processes helps to raise funds and enable financial transfers to emerging and developing countries where climate protection projects can be implemented easily and more effectively than in industrialized countries.” Such projects also support sustainable development, have a positive impact on people and the environment, and generate social, economic and environmental co-benefits.

Current signatories to the Alliance for Development and Climate include such companies as Bosch, Deutsche Bank and Siemens. The initiative also welcomes private individuals as participants.

By aligning short- and medium-term needs for adaptation and mitigation measures with resources and support from 18 NDC Partnership members through existing and planned projects, the plan seeks to fast track climate action.

The Partnership Plan addresses short-term priority needs set by the government for implementation of its long-term 2020-2025 NDC Roadmap, a detailed implementation plan and monitoring framework on low-carbon and resilient development that details sector-specific priorities that was developed through local and national level consultations. The Plan covers agriculture, civil aviation, energy, early warning systems, forestry, health, transport, urban mobility, waste and water.

The Partnership Plan focuses on:

development of pipelines of bankable climate change-related projects;

resource mobilization and project financing;

strengthening institutional coordination;

strengthening regulatory and institutional environments;

capacity enhancement for mitigation and adaptation actions across sectors;

monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) systems and data management;

budget coding and tracking systems; and

private sector engagement.

Mozambique based its current NDC on its National Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Strategy 2013-2030, which seeks to increase community and economic resilience, and promote low-carbon development through integrating adaptation and mitigation into sectoral and local planning. The government has committed to reduce about 76.5 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO 2 eq) from 2020 to 2030, conditional on the provision of support from the international community.

The Plan was developed in consultation with 21 government ministries and institutions and 18 NDC Partnership members, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Governments of Belgium, Germany, Sweden, Spain and the US, the European Commission (EC), the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability, the International Labour Organization (ILO), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment), the World Bank and the World Resources Institute (WRI), among others.

The side event, convened by the UNFCCC Secretariat on 3 December, provided the opportunity to reflect on experiences gained and lessons learned over the 17 years of the CDM and discuss its continued relevance.

The CDM, a mechanism used by developed countries to help them meet their emission reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol, has registered more than 8,100 projects and programmes in 111 developing countries, including those related to wind power, clean cookstoves and landfill gas. As an incentive, the CDM issues to project developers saleable credits, known as Certified Emission Reduction (CER) credits, for each tonne of CO2 they reduce or avoid.

In adopting the Paris Agreement, countries agreed to create tools to help meet the Paris goals, including a new market-based mechanism. Arguing that the CDM can play a role in the Paris Agreement, panelists, inter alia:

said excluding the CDM from the response to climate change would send a negative signal to the private sector and erode investor confidence in any future carbon mechanism;

credited the CDM with increasing political will that enabled the creation of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS);

said the CDM had delivered such co-benefits as improved indoor air quality and health benefits from efficient cookstove projects, job creation, increased access to electricity, and access to clean water;

emphasized the need for “something like the CDM” to stimulate and provide incentives for investment in emission reductions; and

highlighted CDM successes in Colombia and Brazil.

Participants also emphasized that not finding a place for the CDM in the new climate regime will mean lost infrastructure, with one noting that countries can use already existing capacity, or “we’ll have to create it all again in a few years.” The event discussed the report titled, ‘Achievements of the Clean Development Mechanism: Harnessing Incentive for Climate Action,’ which was published by the CDM Executive Board (EB) in August 2018 to mark the EB’s 100th meeting.

As a contribution to correcting this shortcoming, this issue of SDG Knowledge Weekly focuses on the newsworthy, Africa-related events that took place and knowledge products that were released around the COP.

The African Development Bank Group (AfDB) and Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) previewed findings from a joint assessment of Africa’s “Green Growth Readiness” at a COP 24 side event on 10 December 2018. Through case studies from Gabon, Kenya, Morocco, Mozambique, Rwanda, Senegal and Tunisia, the assessment covers: the current state of green growth in Africa; readiness to promote green growth in the context of SDG implementation; and roles of development partners (including AfDB and GGGI) in promoting green growth in the context of implementing the SDGs and countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement on climate change. An IPS News article reports that the study found urgent needs around finance, as well as the strengthening of policy and planning frameworks for green growth.

Also on green growth, the Government of Rwanda hosted the inaugural Africa Green Growth Forum, which took place in Kigali, from 26-30 November 2018, under the theme: ‘For a green and climate resilient Africa.’ The agenda highlights the timing of the Forum just prior to COP 24, noting that the discussions will serve as an input to the discussions in Poland. Among the many speeches and presentations available, Anthony Nyong, AfDB, highlights investing in green growth in Africa. Among other topics, he describes AfDB tools and investment opportunities in the agriculture and energy sectors, barriers to adoption of green growth technologies, and lessons learned at country level.

A regional NDC hub for African countries was launched “to engage national, sub-national, non-state actors and private sector representatives on appropriate policies, strategies and actions tailored to suit individual needs of African countries to enable them deliver their climate change commitments.” The Hub, which AfDB established in November 2017, focuses on three main areas: long-term climate action; mobilizing means of implementation; and coordination, advocacy and partnerships.

An AfDB brochure summarizes the Hub’s purposes, goals and intended outcomes. It identifies potential vulnerabilities, barriers to success and financial needs for fully realizing countries’ NDC targets, laying out a roadmap for achievement. In support of these objectives, AfDB and partners held discussions at COP 24 on encouraging cooperation across regional NDC hubs and operationalizing NDCs in Africa. A compilation of AfDB publications released prior to and in the margins of COP 24 is available here.

Many African countries “already live the future” of a two degrees warmer planet.

Despite progress on NDC implementation, a second article by Isaiah Esipisu on IPS News notes that many African countries “already live the future” of a scenario where the planet has warmed by 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Responding to questions by Esipisu, Gernot Laganda, World Food Programme (WFP), stresses that climate change is already affecting food security, noting that the number of hungry people is increasing and extreme weather events continually drag people back into poverty. Agriculture-based economies, such as those in Africa, feel the effects of climate change most acutely, he explains, adding that one consequence of climate change is migration, which “is actually a traditional adaptation mechanism.”

Echoing Laganda’s point on migration, Gilbert Houngbo, President, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), emphasizes the need to “invest in Africa’s youth before migration to Europe doubles,” as reported by Hannah Summers in The Guardian. Houngbo flags the importance of investment in sustainable farming on the continent, but acknowledges that more is needed: “priorities are decent schools, potable water and basic healthcare.” He also describes access to modern technology as being essential for young people and outlines the importance of gender equality and women’s empowerment in rural areas. All are key to ensuring food security and profitability of smallholder farms, which can stem migration flows.

The key, as highlighted by Houngbo above, is investment. The Brookings Institution’s Landry Signé and Witney Schneidman reflect on the inaugural Africa Investment Forum, held from 7-9 November 2018, in Johannesburg, South Africa. The Forum, they note, was convened with the aim of “unlocking Africa’s investment potential by facilitating onsite transactions.” While the Forum previewed over 230 projects across 15 sectors and announced investment interest in 49 projects worth US$38.7 billion, Signé and Schneidman note that lower business costs through better business regulations and special economic zones are needed, lest the deals face challenges to implementation and long-term sustainability.

The African Economic Conference was held from 3-5 December 2018, in Kigali, Rwanda. Convened by the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), the conference took place on the theme ‘regional and continental integration for Africa’s development,’ building on the March 2018 commitment of 44 African countries to a common market for Africa, known as the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), and the earlier launch of an African Common Passport in July 2016. Supporting papers cover information and communications technology (ICT), economic integration’s impacts on the environment, regional integration versus bilateral diplomacy, food security, gender equality and energy, among other topics. Numerous UNECA press releases on these subjects are also available.

During the conference, UNECA launched the 2018 Africa Sustainable Development Report, which tracks the continent’s progress towards both the SDGs and the African Union Agenda 2063. The report aligns with the theme of the 2018 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF)— “transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies”—focusing on the five SDGs reviewed: 6 (clean water and sanitation); 7 (affordable and clean energy); 11 (sustainable cities and communities); 12 (responsible consumption and production); and 15 (life on land). A detailed write-up on the report’s findings against each Goal is available on the SDG Knowledge Hub.

Finally, the Intra-African Trade Fair 2018 was held 11-17 December 2018, in Cairo, Egypt. Hosted by the African Export-Import Bank in collaboration with the African Union Commission (AUC), the Fair aimed to bring African businesses together to share information and explore opportunities on the continent. The Afreximbank convened the Fair in part due to low rates of trade within Africa, attributed in part to lack of access to trade and market information.

The publication is designed to help businesses integrate biodiversity into their activities by showing them where to start and how to identify existing indicators that could help measure and track their biodiversity performance.

The publication titled, ‘The Development and Use of Biodiversity Indicators in Business: an Overview,’ is aimed at businesses and practitioners already involved in the development of biodiversity indicators that are being created to provide context around the additional business applications where biodiversity indicators may be required for current or future business needs. The paper also targets businesses only starting their journey in exploring their impacts and dependencies on biodiversity.

The paper offers a logical series of steps to develop robust and reliable biodiversity indicators.

The publication notes that, while a variety of biodiversity indicators, tools, and guidance documents exist for businesses that address many specific business contexts, “what is missing is a big picture perspective and process to navigate the variety of business contexts where indicators are relevant.” To address these needs, the paper introduces an overarching process, which acknowledges the full spectrum of business applications in order to help businesses seeking to use existing indicators or embark on developing their own to measure their biodiversity performance.

The proposed process, the text explains, has many similarities with business decision-making frameworks, and offers a logical series of steps to work through in order to develop robust and reliable biodiversity indicators. The process emphasizes that indicators should always be built into larger management processes and that initial scoping phases are critical for indicator development, answering questions that clarify the business application for indicator use, such as why, what, when, for who, how often, and how detailed.

The paper also introduces a spectrum of business applications for biodiversity indicators. This spectrum outlines four prominent scopes for business applications of biodiversity indicators, which range from site- and corporate-level assessments of biodiversity performance to third-party biodiversity performance assessment.

The policy brief is based on findings from the NDC-SDG Connections Tool, developed by the German Development Institute/Deutsches Institut für Entwicklungspolitik (DIE) and SEI, which analyzes connections between climate change and the SDGs by identifying synergies. The tool derives activities from countries’ NDCs into categories of climate action, and links these with SDG targets.

The complexity of the connections between climate change and the SDGs is a challenge for conventional structures and processes.

The authors identify SDG themes with the strongest climate synergies such as energy, agriculture, water, resilience, resource efficiency, disaster risk reduction (DRR), and infrastructure. The document notes that different ministerial departments are responsible for implementing the NDCs and SDGs, and highlights that “too often they work in silos, and the complexity of the connections between climate change and the SDGs is a challenge for conventional structures and processes of decision-making.”

The authors note that new approaches at the global, national and sub-national levels that integrate horizontal and vertical decision making and increase policy coherence are essential to avoid implementation inefficiencies and to assist in achieving desired outcomes.

The brief highlights trade-offs and gaps between climate action and sustainable development arising from implementation, which include trade-offs in the global stocktake (GST) process under the Paris Agreement on climate change and financing processes. To minimize trade-offs, the authors recommend that countries that have not yet embarked on implementing the SDGs design their future national sustainable development strategies in a way that takes account of and complements their existing NDCs by focusing on issues that have not been addressed in them. They also recommend that countries take into account existing national sustainable development strategies and their synergistic potential in their future NDCs.

Conference participants agreed on a joint vision to incentivize and redirect investment towards promoting waste prevention, recycling and other non-polluting activities and increasing the monitoring of transboundary pollution.

Officials from Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Italy, Turkey, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Hungary, Greece, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Albania participated in the Ministerial Conference on ‘Innovative Solutions to Pollution in South East and Southern Europe,’ which took place from 4-5 December in Belgrade, Serbia. The Government of Serbia and the Italian Ministry of Environment, Land and Sea organized the conference with support from the UN Environment Programme (UNEP, or UN Environment).

The Joint Regional Vision on Innovative Solutions to Pollution seeks to strengthen the regional voice of the environment.

In the ‘Joint Regional Vision on Innovative Solutions to Pollution,’ environment ministers and representatives state their determination to support the development and dissemination of innovative solutions in the field of pollution prevention, monitoring and reduction and to strengthen “the regional voice of the environment” by taking specific actions. These actions include: encouraging environmental policy interventions at all levels by integrating existing policy instruments and creating new policies and tools addressing pollution and supporting inter-ministerial cooperation for improved policy coherence; fostering the development of innovative solutions addressing pollution, supporting green and environmentally sound technologies and promoting the sustainable use of natural capital, including ecosystem-based solutions to tackle pollution; promoting a circular economy by supporting sustainable consumption and production (SCP) patterns in the region, encouraging sustainable lifestyles and making it easier to reduce the use of, reuse and recycle materials, contributing to minimized waste generation and disposal; and accelerating implementation of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) aimed at prevention, control and reduction of pollution, including through supporting the ratification processes of the Minamata Convention on Mercury.

Signatories further commit to, inter alia: encouraging sustainable and innovative financing schemes and private sector-led actions towards sustainable solutions on and investments in non-polluting activities; enhancing regional cooperation in addressing transboundary pollution; encouraging establishment of and strengthening regional partnerships to promote exchange of experiences, transfer of clean technology and accessible use of best available techniques; enhancing and promoting cooperation with and among local authorities to support development of innovative strategies and plans; and strengthening engagement with the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA). Signatories request UNEP to, inter alia: support the Western Balkan countries’ capacities in implementing the SDGs; and establish a UNEP sub-regional presence for facilitating exchange of information and creation of partnerships. Government officials also recognize the need to improve availability of and access to relevant environmental data on pollution.

Conference participants discussed a report by UNEP, titled ‘The State of Pollution in the Western Balkans and Current Challenges.’ The report finds that countries in the region rank among the worst in Europe for air pollution and face serious challenges related to air and water pollution, soil contamination and unregulated waste dumping. For instance, 20-40 percent of inhabitants do not have municipal waste collection, which contributes to widespread illegal waste dumping and plastic pollution that ends up in the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea. The report also raises concern about the region’s energy plans, noting that all countries in the area plan to build new coal power plans. The report argues that the “economic and environmental reasoning behind this is questionable,” with solar and wind energy becoming cheaper than coal or hydropower. The report recommends that countries, inter alia: implement economic instruments, such as an excise tax on “dirty fuels” to address pollution and fund green incentives; introduce environmental objectives into energy and transport policies; and expand their networks of marine and terrestrial protected areas.

A single-year record of approximately US$129 million was committed by nine contributor Governments, including two first-time contributors, exceeding the Fund’s previous record of US$95.9 million set in 2017.

During the Adaptation Fund Contributor Dialogue on 11 December, co-hosted by the German and Swedish Governments, Germany, France, Italy, Sweden, Ireland, two regions in Belgium, and first-time contributors New Zealand and the European Commission announced their pledges. Germany made a 70 million Euros pledge, the largest single donation to the Fund ever.

Sweden’s objective is to make the Adaptation Fund an integral part of the Paris Agreement’s financial architecture.

Welcoming the pledges and highlighting the high demand for the Fund, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said a record US$264 million in project requests was received for the last Adaptation Fund Board meeting alone. Expressing gratitude for the contributions, Adaptation Fund Board (AFB) Chair Victor Viñas said the Fund pioneered ‘Direct Access,’ an innovative climate finance modality, which helps build national capacities and fosters country ownership in adaptation. Karolina Skog, Minister for the Environment, Sweden, said her country’s objective is to make the Adaptation Fund an integral part of the financial architecture of the Paris Agreement on climate change, and commended efforts to mainstream gender into project design and implementation.

Projects funded by the Adaptation Fund and highlighted during the Dialogue include: in Rwanda, terracing, afforestation and de-silting caves, which restored flooded farmlands to vulnerable communities; in Jamaica, empowering agricultural communities through water and land management through a Direct Access project; and, in South Africa, reducing flood and drought risks among 25,000 people and enhancing resilience in local farmers.

Since 2010, the Adaptation Fund has committed US$532 million to 80 adaptation projects in vulnerable communities in developing countries, serving 5.8 million direct beneficiaries. COP 24 is meeting in Katowice, Poland, from 2-4 December 2018.

Participants underscored the importance of inclusive, holistic and nationally-driven reconstruction processes, and recognized linkages between the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and sustaining peace.

President of Côte d’Ivoire, Alassane Ouattara, whose country holds the UNSC presidency for December, described how “holistic strategies for economic recovery and development—implemented from the very start of the post-conflict phase” helped avert a relapse of conflict and instability in Côte d’Ivoire. Ouattara highlighted the role of the private sector in transforming his country’s economy, describing how some 65,000 former combatants were disarmed, demobilized and reintegrated into society and provided with decent jobs, alongside anti-corruption measures, governance reforms and efforts to enhance social cohesion. Ouattara underscored that his country’s citizens now live “in peace and in tolerance” and can serve as a case study for the UNSC.

France and other speakers also recognized Côte d’Ivoire’s progress towards peace. African Union Commission (AUC) Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat observed that “Côte d’Ivoire’s experience is an eloquent demonstration that peace is within reach” when actors are determined to turn commitments into action. The UK also praised Côte d’Ivoire’s ongoing reforms, reflecting that meaningful institutional change requires patience and time.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres emphasized the importance of a focus on prevention, saying “peace cannot be sustainable without development, and lasting peace is essential for the preservation of development gains.” He said a holistic, inclusive approach is necessary to fight potential factors in instability, such as climate change-related competition for resources, inequality and corruption. He also underscored the importance of peace and development activities that “are owned, and led by national local actors,” including women, youth, the elderly, minority groups and those with disabilities. Guterres called for: building local capacities to prevent and respond to conflicts; forging partnerships to safeguard development gains, including partnerships with regional and sub-regional organizations and international financial institutions (IFIs); and ensuring adequate resources for peacebuilding and development during conflict, including by mobilizing foreign investment and supporting the UN Peacebuilding Fund. He concluded by saying the 2030 Agenda and the sustaining peace agenda “are complementary and mutually reinforcing” and encouraged Member States to embrace these frameworks “as our best guarantees against instability and insecurity.”

France called to integrate the 2030 Agenda into post-conflict development and reconstruction.

Other speakers called for integrated approaches to post-conflict recovery, including the AUC Chairperson and Sweden. Rwanda shared three core pillars from her country’s reconstruction period: the importance of security, peace and stability; institution building; and the development dividend. She further stressed the importance of inclusive reconstruction efforts, underscoring the importance of engaging women in the entire process. The Netherlands, for instance, stressed “environmental sustainability is no longer optional in economic development” and underscored the need to protect agriculture-based livelihoods to ensure food security during conflicts, saying such an approach requires innovative partnerships among the private sector, financial institutions and other key stakeholders.

Several delegates underscored the importance of predictable and sustainable financing for peacekeeping, including Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal. Equatorial Guinea said his delegation is participating in negotiations on a draft resolution that aims to provide financing for peacekeeping operations in Africa through the UN regular budget. The US called for voluntary contributions to the Peacebuilding Fund and emphasized the need to pair mandates with achievable exist strategies.

Several delegates supported nationally-led reconstruction processes. Kuwait said national ownership and “sincere political will for reconciliation” are necessary to avoid relapses. Poland highlighted the role of respect for human rights and social cohesion in contributing to stability, describing the participation of women and youth as critical in effective implementation of peacebuilding and sustaining peace. France said the 2030 Agenda should be integrated into post-conflict development and reconstruction, including as part of restoring the rule of law.

Additional concerns raised by delegates include: the potential of terrorist threats in West Africa and the Sahel to jeopardize efforts to recover from conflict; and the need to ensure justice for victims to address desires for revenge; and the importance. Burkina Faso said recurrent terrorist attacks has hindered his country’s progress and called for stronger UN coordination with and support for the Group of Five (G-5) Sahel joint force to combat terrorism.

268,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/bangladesh-un-consider-expected-ldc-graduation-in-2024/,"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,"Bangladesh, UN Consider Expected LDC Graduation in 2024","14 December 2018: The challenges and benefits related to graduating from the least developed countries (LDCs) category were the focus of an event organized by the UN Office of the UN High Representative for Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (OHRLLS) and the Secretariat of the UN Committee for Development Policy (CDP). The event also highlighted a recently published book on Bangladesh’s expected graduation from the LDC category in 2024.

LDCs are characterized by low levels of income and severe structural impediments to sustainable development. The category was established by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in 1971 to acknowledge that special support measures are needed to assist the least developed among the developing countries. Currently 47 countries are part of the LDC category.

If Bangladesh meets the graduation criteria again in 2021, it will be recommended for graduation from the LDC category in 2024.

Decisions on inclusion into, and graduation from, the list of LDCs are made by the UNGA based on recommendations by the CDP that are endorsed by the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). The CDP, a subsidiary advisory body of ECOSOC and composed of 24 members, analyzes the list of LDCs every three years during triennial reviews to identify any countries that may qualify for inclusion into or graduation from the LDC category. In March 2018, the CDP found that Bangladesh met the criteria for graduation for the first time. If Bangladesh meets the graduation criteria for a second time, at the next triennial review in 2021, the CDP will recommend it for graduation from the LDC category in 2024.

The book titled, ‘Bangladesh’s Graduation from the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) Group: Pitfalls and Promises,’ explores, inter alia: the issues of moving out of the LDC category; the structural transformation of Bangladesh’s economy and smooth transition after graduation; prospects, challenges and strategies related to Bangladesh’s “sustainable graduation”; and whether Bangladesh’s pursuit of the 2030 Agenda will facilitate a smooth transition after LDC graduation. The book was authored by several experts and edited by Debapriya Bhattacharya, Centre for Policy Dialogue, who will serve as a CDP member starting in January 2019. It was published in October 2018.

During the event, Bhattacharya said that if Bangladesh graduates, it will be one of the first large LDCs to do so, and it is the first country to meet all three graduation thresholds of the LDC criteria, namely gross national income (GNI) per capita, human assets index (HAI) and economic vulnerability index (EVI). He noted that Bangladesh is characterized by a “double transition” since, in addition to its expected graduation from the LDC category in 2024, it transitioned from a low-income country to a lower-middle-income country in 2015.

Bhattacharya said advancing towards the SDGs will contribute to a smoother and more sustainable transition from the LDC category, and that 16 out of the 17 Goals are linked to graduation criteria. He called for a universal regime that will support graduating countries towards a smooth transition, especially in the areas of: access to concessional finance; trade, including access to markets; access to climate finance and climate facility; and flexibility of implementation of intellectual protection regimes under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).

Roland Mollerus, CDP Secretariat, reported that since 1971, five LDCs have graduated from the LDC category, namely: Botswana, Cabo Verde, Equatorial Guinea, the Maldives, and Samoa. He said five additional LDCs should graduate by 2024. Those are: Vanuatu (graduation in 2020); Angola (graduation in 2021); Bhutan (graduation in 2023), São Tomé and Príncipe (graduation in 2024); and Solomon Islands (graduation in 2024).

Masud Bin Momen, Permanent Representative of Bangladesh, said graduation from the LDC category is an important milestone for Bangladesh’s pursuit of development. He noted that the graduation process is happening at a time when the world is witnessing fundamental changes, including in terms of rising nationalism, and that protectionist measures could create strong disincentives for graduating countries. He remarked that the book is “very timely,” considering that his government has commissioned a study to assess the impact of graduation for Bangladesh and to suggest practical solutions for a smooth transition.

Perks Master Ligoya, Permanent Representative of Malawi, which is assuming the chairmanship of the LDC group from 2018-2021, underlined Bangladesh’s high degree of vulnerability due climate change impacts, natural disasters, and the Rohingya refugee crisis, among other factors. He said the period following graduation will be challenging for Bangladesh as the country will lose specific support measures. Sakiko Fukuda-Parr, The New School and CDP, welcomed the book’s analysis of the costs of graduation, and underlined the importance of climate finance and technology access for graduating and other countries.

A draft UNGA resolution on following up on the UN’s LDC conference held in Istanbul, Turkey, in 2011, was approved by the UNGA’s Second Committee in December 2018. Ligoya remarked that the resolution invites all development partners to strengthen their support for graduation and smooth transition toward graduating and recently graduated countries.

Heidi Schroderus-Fox, OHRLLS, noted the creation of the UN Task Force on Graduation and Smooth Transition, which brings together representatives from various UN entities. The Task Force discusses graduation issues as well as concrete ways in which in the UN System can provide support to the graduating countries.

On 27 November, the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) launched the ‘Handbook on the Least Developed Country Category: Inclusion, Graduation and Special Support Measures’ examining, among other issues, criteria and procedures for inclusion and graduation, and international support measures for the LDCs.

269,http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/behavioral-and-cognitive-approaches-to-biodiversity-conservation/,"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD's SDG Knowledge Hub,Guest Article: Behavioral and Cognitive Approaches to Biodiversity Conservation,"It was quite intriguing to read an article that explains how a sign that sought to promote awareness in conservation, had in fact worked against conservation. A sign was put up in a peatland forest in Arizona, US, to deter people from stealing from the forest. It read as follows: “Many past visitors have removed petrified wood from this park, destroying the natural state of the petrified forest.” Months later, when a review was done on the impact of this sign and pilferage from the forest, researchers were astonished to find that stealing had tripled.

A behavioral science perspective on how people perceived the sign suggests that people must have thought that “since others have done it, it is alright to continue doing so.” This is a startling finding for a conservation expert who never thought of this angle in conservation.

Let me give you another example. A recent World Wildlife Fund (WWF) report cites a 60 percent loss of biodiversity globally since 1970 in spite of billions of dollars spent on conservation and dozens of global political commitments. For the common man on the street, the message is simple: we have lost 60 percent of biodiversity but I am not feeling any immediate impacts. My needs are still met, I am wealthier, consume better and invest in issues of my choice. There is no great famine, no large death toll, no economic downturn that I can see in front of my eyes.

I know this is a provocative statement to make but this is more or less what is happening in our conversations about conservation. In a book titled, ‘The Death of Environmentalism,’ the author states that the word “warming” in “global warming” “feels good” for some people. Similarly, in conservation, declining biodiversity is still not seen as a threat to our survival by non-conservationists, including the general public.

My recent research into cognitive and behavioral thinking led to me to look for uncommon answers to the way we are communicating about conservation and its importance. A few thousand delegates who convene once every two years to have heated discussions on why we are losing in our actions to protect biodiversity and what we can do to improve the situation has not helped us in the recent decades.

Looking at cognitive science, I came across an interesting set of experiences from the advertising industry on how the industry captures people’s attention and imagination to push their agenda. Two specific examples are of relevance to how we advance the biodiversity agenda using cognition: social proofing; and communicating impacts of our actions.

Social Proofing Our Message

In an article published in the Wall Street Journal on turning consumers green, the author notes that there was more response to the sign that said neighbors are actively using the options to go green than to those that mention how much money one can save, how responsible one could be towards the environment or to what extent this is a moral obligation.

Reported progress on biodiversity conservation and climate change suggests that few are aware of this. Having reviewed all the national reports to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) submitted by States until 2018, it is clear that almost all of them address what governments are doing for conservation but there is very little information on what others, including civil society, business community, UN agencies and academic institutions, are contributing. This is a major disconnect, which disincentivizes people from partnering in conservation. Few environment ministries’ web portals, united in the network of national Clearing-House Mechanisms, highlight successes of these stakeholders.

For the post-2020 biodiversity framework, we need to social proof the strategic plan and targets. Merely reporting that these are developed in a participatory manner through a few workshops and consultations will not do.

Communicating Impacts of Our Actions

We all know that in spite of all our efforts the environment is getting from bad to worse. All the investments are yet to give us impactful results, and we are struggling to make the “big breakthrough.” In this context, it is important to be cautious with our messages about challenges and failures.

It is alright to admit to failures, but environmental managers need to ensure that the message is communicated in a manner that clarifies the reasons for failure better. Additionally, the more the common man feels the guilt for their own actions, the better the chances for behavioral change. This, however, would require workable solutions.

Take the example of a 1962 advertisement by David & Goliath for the car rental company Avis that was far behind Hertz in brand popularity. It stated: “When you’re only number two you try harder. Or Else.” The advertisement increased Avis’s annual profit by US$1.2 million in a decade, and the company ran it for 50 years.

Behavioral and Cognitive Approaches in the Post-2020 Framework and 2030 Agenda

The 2010 Biodiversity Target was met only partially, and there are indications that the Aichi Biodiversity Targets will not be achieved in their entirety. At the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the CBD to be held in Beijing, China, governments will face the challenging task of upholding people’s confidence in multilateral approaches to and national actions on saving biodiversity.

Conservation could benefit from cognitive and behavioral approaches now more than ever before. These approaches could help achieve the Aichi Biodiversity Targets as well as SDG 15 (life on land) and SDG 14 (life below water). This is the main message from a side event FLEDGE organized during the CBD COP 14 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The examples and approaches outlined in this article resonated with many countries who suggested actions towards behavioral change. It is our hope that countries will explore these options further as we develop the post-2020 biodiversity framework.

270,https://sdg.iisd.org/news/unece-review-finds-mongolia-on-track-on-sdgs/,"Tue, 18 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",IISD Reporting Services,UNECE Review Finds Mongolia on Track on SDGs,"13 December 2018: The UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has conducted a review of Mongolia’s environmental performance. The Environmental Performance Review (EPR) finds that Mongolia is on track with implementation and monitoring of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs.

The Government of Mongolia requested the UNECE to conduct the EPR. The UNECE produced the EPR, the second conducted outside of the UNECE region, in cooperation with the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). The EPR takes stock of Mongolia’s progress in managing its environment since 1987, and addresses a number of issues, including air protection, biodiversity conservation and water, waste and land management, as well as national efforts to integrate environmental considerations into the forestry and health sectors.

The EPR finds that Mongolia is “among the frontrunners” in shaping its national targets and setting up policy frameworks and institutional mechanisms for SDG implementation and follow up. Mongolia has integrated the SDGs into its key policy document, the 2016 Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2030, and has demonstrated awareness and ownership of the SDGs among its public officials.

Although Mongolia has an “extensive legal framework on environmental protection,” that is consistent and coherent, implementation and enforcement of this legislation is often delayed. The country has a clear green development policy objective but has not applied the strategic environmental assessment (SEA) tool to evaluate environmental impacts of future sectoral policies.

Mongolia is successfully advancing a community-based approach to natural resource management.

On air pollution, the EPR describes air pollution as a major area of concern, with particulate matter the main pollutant in the country and no regular monitoring of emissions of power plants and heat-only boilers that are major polluters. Government policies focus on the capital city and insufficiently address air quality in other regions. The EPR recommends a more efficient air quality monitoring network and efforts to monitor the emissions from major stationary air polluting sources and fine particles. The report also raises concerns related to the impacts on human health of asbestos, chemicals and noise, among other challenges.

On biodiversity protection, Mongolia’s terrestrial protected area system covers 29.9 percent of the country’s territory. The EPR states the country is “successfully advancing” a community-based approach to natural resource management, with 18 percent of the country’s forested areas managed by local communities and three protected areas managed by non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Challenges to the country’s biodiversity efforts include wildlife migration corridors in the country’s unprotected landscapes; wildlife competition with domestic livestock; and a lack of financial, human, operational and technical capacities.

On disaster risk management (DRM), the Government of Mongolia has developed policies and plans for disaster risk reduction (DRR). However, urbanization-related challenges, such as unplanned expansion of human settlements, have resulted in a lack of access to basic services or location of settlements in flood pathways. The report recommends strengthening disaster resilience and using available resources for DRM.

Among Mongolia’s successes, the report highlights the phasing out of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the reintroduction of Przewalski’s horse to its homeland and the expansion of eco-schools. On challenges, the EPR highlights increased mining activities, which have impacted the environment and workers’ health. According to the EPR, coal and gold mining have degraded an estimated 100,000 hectares of land, and only a very small part of degraded land has been restored. Artisanal miners still use mercury, even though Mongolia banned its import and use in 2007.

The report makes a number of recommendations related to SDG implementation and monitoring, including to operationalize the National SDG Committee under the Prime Minister and to ensure regular preparation of reports on SDG implementation. Other recommended measures include to: conduct a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) for all regional, national and sectoral policies, development programmes and plans; conduct training courses to raise awareness on SEA; develop an action plan on rehabilitation of abandoned and damaged mining areas; develop policies to create opportunities for artisanal miners to transition to other areas of employment; and ensure the independence of environmental inspectors.

The report highlights also outline Mongolia’s progress on SDG target 17.14 (enhance policy coherence for sustainable development) and SDG target 11.4 (strengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the world’s cultural

and natural heritage).

They include over-fishing, fisheries by-catch, illegal trade, habitat destruction, depletion of prey, pollution, boat strikes and climate change – according to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). These obstacles – formidable on their own – are compounded by the pelagic nature of many sharks. They range beyond any one country’s borders or jurisdiction.

In this context and amid declining populations, almost a decade ago, countries came together to do something about it. A big step was taken on 1 March 2010, in Manila, the Philippines – when range States signed into effect the CMS Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks. This was the first dedicated global instrument focused on safeguarding pelagic sharks. Its establishment set in motion a series of important policy steps that would raise awareness and the stakes for sharks conservation well into the future.

The first event was a meeting of the MoU signatories in 2012. With funding provided under the European Union Thematic Programme for Environment and Sustainable Management of Natural Resources including Energy (ENRTP), the First Meeting of the Signatories (MOS 1) to the MoU convened in 2012. Its major outcome was the adoption of a Global Conservation Plan for the seven sharks species listed (at that time) under the MOU. The Plan aimed to catalyze global and regional initiatives to reduce threats to migratory sharks and to maintain their favorable conservation status based on the best available scientific information.

The Plan was based on five objectives: improving the understanding of migratory shark populations through research, monitoring and information exchange; ensuring that directed and non-directed fisheries for sharks were sustainable; ensuring, to the extent practicable, the protection of critical habitats and migratory corridors and critical life stages of sharks; increased public awareness of threats to sharks and their habitats, and enhanced public participation in conservation activities; and enhanced national, regional and international cooperation.

2014 shaped up to be an important year for shark conservation, catalyzed in part by the successful beginnings of the MoU.

Two years later, 2014 would shape up to be an incredibly important year for shark conservation, catalyzed in part by the successful beginnings of the MoU and Conservation Plan.

First, progress was made, also with ENTRP support, towards the implementation of the Plan, particularly to prevent wildlife trafficking in sharks in the Middle East and North Africa Region. Three workshops were organized to inform fisheries officers, custom officers and coast guards about legal requirements and guidelines regarding the conservation of sharks under various Conventions and relevant Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). These meetings were held in Yemen, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, and they exemplified the kind of outreach needed for the MoU to gain traction. Through these meetings, Arab countries came together to combat illegal international trade and looked for ways to collaborate under the framework of MoU. By the time these meetings concluded in 2014, the MoU’s membership had grown by 33%, with nine Arab countries joining.

Second, recognition of the MoU went beyond range State countries all the way to the UN General Assembly (UNGA). In a 2014 resolution, the UNGA welcomed a FAO review of the International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks, and affirmed the importance of the Sharks MoU (See A/RES/67/79).

Finally and also in 2014, the eleventh meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the CMS (COP 11) convened in November. Of the thirty-one approved proposals to add species to the Convention’s two appendices, a record 21 shark, ray and sawfish species were added, as proposed by Kenya, Egypt, the European Union, Fiji, Costa Rica and Ecuador and leading the Conference to be nicknamed the “Sharks COP.” These listings were made as the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Shark Specialist Group (SSG) released the results of the first-ever global analysis showing that a quarter of the world’s sharks and rays were threatened with extinction.

The work of the MoU was timely and gaining momentum. By 2016, as the Second Meeting of the Signatories (MOS 2) convened, MoU membership had grown to 40 countries. At this meeting in San Jose, Costa Rica, from 15-19 February 2016, these Signatory States added 22 additional shark and ray species to Annex I of the MoU. They also created a Conservation Working Group.

Signatory States have now gathered for their third meeting, which is taking place from 10-14 December 2018, in Monaco. With 29 species now listed under the MoU, well beyond the seven species when it originally commenced, these States will discuss progress on the Action Plan and the agreement. It will also be an opportunity to harness momentum for the MoU, which has enabled collaboration on the conservation of sharks at a time when challenges to the ocean and all its inhabitants are growing.

The ‘Call to Action’ was issued during the closing session of the political phase of the Talanoa Dialogue on 12 December during the Katowice Climate Change Conference, which is meeting in Poland from 2-14 December. It was delivered by youth champions Timoci Naulusala, Fiji, and Hanna Wojdowska, Poland, and captures a series of “calls” directed at governments, international agencies, non-Party stakeholders, civil society, spiritual leaders and youth, with the aim of fostering greater political will and action, including through enhancing financial, technical and technological cooperation and capacity building.

The Call to Action represents the outcome of a year-long process that saw governments and other stakeholders discuss, in an informal setting, climate policy and ways to increase ambition and actions. It captures “key messages emerging from the Talanoa Dialogue and synthesis report” to governments as they begin to update their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and prepare long-term climate strategies, which are to be submitted by 2020. These key messages are:

We must fulfill the goals of the Paris Agreement;

We must achieve a just transformation towards a better world;

We must unlock the full potential of technology;

We must demonstrate bold leadership; and

We must act together.

During the concluding Dialogue session, COP 24 President Michal Kurtyka noted the close alignment of the Dialogue and the main negotiations at COP 24 on the implementation guidelines for the Paris Agreement, which both address paths that countries will follow in efforts to ramp up climate actions.

Talanoa Dialogue must now also give way to the Talanoa Call for Action.

COP 23 President and Prime Minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama, said the “Talanoa Dialogue must now also give way to the Talanoa Call for Action,” emphasizing the need to increase ambition and action five-fold to achieve the 1.5°C target, and exchange ideas and best practices to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Kurtyka and Bainimarama invited all stakeholders, including the general public, to join the Talanoa Call for Action.

The concluding Dialogue plenary followed 21 ministerial roundtables, held on 11 December, during which nearly 100 ministers and over 40 non-Party stakeholders convened to discuss ways to advance global climate action.

The Talanoa Dialogue, based on a Fijian traditional way of conversing to tackle collective issues, gathered views on three guiding questions: Where we are? Where do we want to go? and How do we get there? It aimed to take stock of global efforts since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015 and inform the preparation of NDCs.

The partnership, which was made in the spirit of SDG-17, is between leading Canadian-based global travel risk management and travel insurance provider Ingle International Inc., and SUNx (Strong Universal Network), which focusses on Climate Friendly Travel. The partnership is founded on a shared commitment to develop the Maurice Strong Legacy Scholarship Program, with Ingle International as its first global sponsor.

Speaking from COP 24 – the United Nations Climate Change Conference, Professor Geoffrey Lipman, Co-founder of SUNx, said:

""We are honoured to announce our partnership with Ingle International to launch the global rollout of the Maurice Strong Legacy Scholarship Program. This will create 100,000 ""Strong Climate Champions"" by 2030, in every UN State, to help to drive the behavioural change and influence the fundamental government and industry actions needed to tackle Climate Change.

We need to realize the exposure to our children and grandchildren. We need to stop talking amongst ourselves, and engage directly with future generations. SUNx – a legacy initiative for Maurice Strong, the father of global Sustainable Development Action – will spearhead a movement for 100,000 climate activists by 2030, responding creatively to the Paris Accords and SDG-13.

By the simple act of a Scholarship Plan for graduates committed to help society take action towards more stable temperature levels, we can empower the next generation, who are the ones that will have to really deal with the transformation to the New Climate Economy.""

Robin Ingle, CEO of Ingle International said:

""As a global travel risk management and insurance provider, we specialize in assessing risk, and there is no greater risk to our civilisation than Climate Change, as Sir David Attenborough pointed out at the start of the COP 24 meeting. At the same time, we identify ways to mitigate and respond to these risks positively, and we see no better means in doing this than to empower the next generation with the knowledge base that they will need to take action. Also, as a Canadian, I recognise the immense contribution that Maurice Strong made for half a century to help put in place the actions we are taking today. These are some of the reasons why Ingle International is proud to be the first global sponsor of this important program.""

The partners proposed a partnership and an annual forum that would underline how a transition to clean transport can provide cleaner air, innovative industry and a safe and stable climate.

According to the UNFCCC, the transportation sector has had the fastest emissions growth of any sector over the last 50 years. The transportation sector is responsible for 23 percent of global energy-related carbon emissions, and represents a major source of air pollution.

COP 24 is a platform to promote and recognize e-mobility as an essential part of the solution to climate change.

Kurtyka said the Polish COP 24 Presidency proposes “e-mobility as one of the main topics of this year’s COP.” He explained that Poland aims to contribute to global climate policy and galvanize global trends towards electromobility through the Partnership and its annual forum. He highlighted Poland’s experience in implementing legislation and projects on electromobility, including the ‘Zero Emission Urban Bus System’ (ZeEUS). Kurtyka stressed that Poland wants e-mobility actions “to become an impulse towards ensuring universal opportunities to live in clean, environmentally friendly cities.” Harrington said the UK and Poland “are calling on all countries to renew their efforts to accelerate the transition to low-emission vehicles to create a cleaner, greener legacy for future generations.”

The ‘Driving Change Together Partnership,’ or ‘Katowice Partnership for E-Mobility,’ is a dedicated framework for encouraging technological and organizational changes in the sector to further develop zero-emission transport. A proposal on the Partnership stresses that transport must be decarbonized to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change, and underlines the potential economic, health and environmental benefits of a transition to a low-carbon economy, in particular the development and deployment of zero-emission vehicles. The proposal recognizes initiatives committed to achieving the goal of sustainable transport and development of e-mobility, and calls on Parties and non-Party stakeholders to use COP 24 as a platform to “promote and recognize e-mobility as an essential part of the solution to climate change.” The proposal further declares an intent to work together to ensure that e-mobility and the UNFCCC process “complement and enhance each other” and share experience and expertise towards e-mobility through capacity building and peer-to-peer cooperation.

Through the Partnership, supported by an annual forum, the Polish COP 24 Presidency will create a network of partnerships between regional and national governments, cities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to build and share knowledge of electromobility and accelerate a “transport e-mobility revolution” at international and local levels.

The guide draws on experiences and knowledge from around the world on matters such as privacy, safety and facilities for managing menstrual hygiene and baby care, also providing information on meeting the needs of older adults and persons with disabilities.

The agencies note that women and girls suffer disproportionately from inadequate sanitation, as their specific needs are often overlooked by planners. They further note that public or community toilets may be the only sanitation option for people living in informal settlements.

The agencies emphasize that the UN has recognized the rights to water and sanitation as human rights since 2010, and that governments have a responsibility to provide universal access to sanitation. They state that toilets should be “sufficient in number” as well as physically accessible, safe, affordable, and designed for everyone to use.

Chandigarh has been ranked second by Niti Aayog in India’s Index for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) among all the states and Union Territories. It has topped the UTs with an index score of 68, a release by Ministry of Statistics, Government of India, Friday said.

The SDG India Index measures the progress of states and UTs complying with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. The First Baseline Report of SDG India Index for 2018 has been prepared with support from Global Green Growth Institute and the UN.

“Among the UTs, Chandigarh takes the lead because of its exemplary performance in providing clean water and sanitation to its people. It has further made good progress towards providing affordable and clean energy, generating decent work and economic growth, and providing quality education,” the report stated.

Chandigarh is in the category of “front runners”, while Himachal Pradesh and Kerala has topped the index with a score of 69. They are also “front runners” in achieving the SDG.

“We normalised the raw data on a score of 0-100. The lowest score means worst performing and 100 means best. A state or UT scoring 68 means that it is inching closer to the complete score in terms of accomplishment of the goals,” said Officer on Special Duty Sanyukta Samaddar from Niti Aayog.

There were 16 SDGs, including sanitation and clean water, poverty eradication, human health, quality education and various others, on which the states/UTs were measured “to help organise and streamline development actions for greater achievement of human well being”.

In the goal of “Quality Education”, Chandigarh was among the best performing with 85 index score and ranked in “front runners”

The goal was measured on adjusted net enrollment ratio at elementary (Class 1-8) and secondary (Class 9-10) schools, percentage of correct responses on learning outcomes in language, mathematics and EVS for Class 5 students, correct responses in language, mathematics, science and social science for Class 8 students and school teachers professionally qualified.

In the goal of “Gender Equality”, Chandigarh scored 51, second among the states/UTs.

The goal was measured on sex ratio at birth (female per 1,000 male), average female to male ratio of average wages/salaries received per day by regular wage/salaried employees of age 15-59 years for rural and urban and ensuring women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision, percentage of seats won by women in the General elections to state legislative Assembly and various others.

However, there are several areas where a lot if improvement is required.

The first goal of “No Poverty” had Chandigarh scoring just 39 marks. The index parameters, under which the city was surveyed, included percentage of population living below National Poverty Line, households with any usual member covered by any health scheme or insurance, percentage of persons who demanded employment under MGNREGA, proportion of the population (out of the total eligible) receiving social protection benefits like maternity benefit and number of homeless per 10,000 households.

Chandigarh fell in “Aspirant” category, while Tamil Nadu and Mizoram were the best performers with 76 and 71 index score.

In another goal “Good Health and Well Being”, Chandigarh has an index score of only 23, while Kerala tops with 92. Even Punjab and Haryana scored better than Chandigarh in this with 71 and 57 respectively.

In this category, the city was measured on parameters like maternal mortality ratio, number of government physicians, nurses, midwives per lakh population and under-five mortality rate per 1,000 live births, percentage of children aged 12-23 months fully immunised (BCG, measles and three doses of pentavalent vaccine) and annual notification of tuberculosis cases per lakh population. Chandigarh was found wanting on these criteria and thus scored among the least.

Similarly, in the category of “Sustainable Cities and Communities”, Chandigarh has an index score of just 40. The parameters included percentage of urban households living in slums, wards with 100 per cent door-to-door waste collection, waste processed and others. Chandigarh has not been able to carry our segregation of waste at household level.","The SDG India Index measures the progress of states and UTs complying with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals The SDG India Index measures the progress of states and UTs complying with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development GoalsChandigarh has been ranked second by Niti Aayog in India’s Index for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) among all the states and Union Territories.

THE KIT

Since day one, we have been at the forefront of the MTB saddle game, supporting riders for over 20 years. While many are still onboard and riding today, they are having children of their own, which has shown us the need for quality youth components that were truly designed to fit smaller bodies. The new Junior Pro Kit allows you to take your family riding adventures to the next level.Kids are starting to ride at a younger age, and progressing faster than ever. With sweet new color coordinated parts (just like mom and dad have on their bikes) riding becomes way more fun, and safer too. The traction grabbers and replaceable steel pins in the small nylon pedals keep their feet from slipping, while thinner bar ends and smaller OD grips allow for increased control and overall confidence. To top it off, a proper size saddle simply makes the ride more comfortable and enjoyable.The junior line concept has been in the works for a couple years now. As a company originally invested in saddles we started developing the Fly Jr in 2014. Higher end kids mountain bikes were emerging, yet the options for smaller quality seats were limited -- mostly just price point BMX saddles which were far too large and heavy. We set out to solve that problem. The Fly Jr was the industry's first branded performance saddle specifically designed for youth MTB riders. Some of our OE partners such as Bergamont, Cube, Mondraker and especially Norco were early adopters and used the saddle as an OEM part on their complete bikes. With their insight, along with our riders, friends and their children, as well as our engineer having a 7 year old rider too, we started looking for other ways to improve this underserved segment.Money doesn’t grow on trees around here either, so we’re fully aware that pricing is an issue for many parents, especially when determining whether to spend on youth components or not. However, we didn’t cut any corners when designing the JR PRO KIT. Most children's bike accessories are either mass produced as economically as possible or made in custom small batches that are incredibly expensive. We set out to offer the perfect balance -- parts that are of a similar quality to higher end adult components, at a price that wouldn’t break the bank. We also made them as durable as possible, so they last as long as your child needs.The Fly Jr was the industry's first branded performance MTB saddle designed specifically with youth riders in mind.The Slater 90 pedal features a 90x90mm platform that is optimal for smaller feet. Unlike most children’s pedals (plastic body, steel axle, loose ball bearing and molded pins that easily wear out in weeks), the Slater 90 pedal strikes a balance between those cheap disposable plastic pedals and the uber expensive machined aluminum ones.Most junior grips are simply just shortened adult grips that are far too thick for little hands. By tooling a unique bar that offers 19mm bar ends, the Slater Jr grip offers a better riding experience, while not sacrificing the comfort by using a thinner grip.The Slater 650 bar was developed for optimal ergonomics. It features a 31.8mm mount, but uniquely tapers to 19mm (standard bar ends are 22.2mm) to accommodate thinner grips such as the SDG Slater Jr.All of the premium components in the JR PRO KIT cater to a range of youth riders and ages, ideally running 18” to 24” wheeled bikes. Available in 4 colorways: Black, Neon Pink, Neon Green and Cyan Blue, the JR PRO KIT is now available worldwide for $149.99 USD. Additionally, all of the components included will be available separately in late January 2019, along with replacement parts and rebuild service kits.*A special thanks to Randy Noborikawa for the cool, hand drawn illustrations.","With the junior pro kit she gets skinnier diameter bars and grips, matching pedals and an amazing SDG seat to match it all.

Srinagar, Dec 27: In the first released United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) index, Jammu and Kashmir has got 20th rank among states in India.

According to SDG India Index Baseline Report-2018 released by the NITI Aayog on Thursday, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu have been ranked on top 3 positions and are on track to achieve the UN SDG.

J&K’s overall SDG index score is 53 and has been ranked 20 performing states and 27th among states as well as union territories in the country.

As per SDG report, the states with cent percent score are enumerated as achievers, states with a score between 65 to 99 are front runners, states with a score ranging between 50 to 64 are performers and states with a score from 0 to 49 are listed as aspirants.

The Sustainable Development Goals are a collection of 17 goals with 169 targets by the United Nations. These goals were adopted by India in 2015 and are the blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all citizens.

The SDG index aims to promote healthy competition among states by evaluating their progress in social, economic and environmental terms that will help India in achieving the UN SDG by 2030.

These goals are aimed to end poverty in all its forms, end hunger, ensure good health and well-being, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth.

NITI Aayog, CEO, Amitabh Kant, said SDG index has been prepared to provide a holistic view on the social, economic and environmental status of the country and its states and UTs.

The report has been jointly prepared by the State Governments, Central Ministries, United Nations in India and NITI Aayog knowledge partners.

The performance of the states and union territories on indicators for SDG is based on percentage of the population living below national poverty line, households with any usual member covered by any health insurance scheme, persons provided employment under MGNREGA, percentage of population receiving social protection under maternity benefit and homeless households.

The agenda of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), were adopted by 193 countries at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in September 2015. The SDGs, which came into effect from 1 January 2016, have 2030 as their deadline for achieving the targets. SDGs are aimed at addressing key aspects of universal well-being across different socio-economic, cultural, geographical divisions as also the interconnectedness among these social multiple dimensions of improving human welfare.

According to NITI Aayog, State Governments have been taking leading role through Panchayati Raj Institutions, urban local bodies and civil society organizations to take the SDGs forward and to ensure that the most marginalized persons are reached first.

“SDGs can only be met through visionary long-term strategic planning and cooperative federalism, where governments at both the Centre and States work together to bring about transformation. States play a huge role in the implementation of government programmers and in influencing all social and economic parameters necessary to achieve SDGs,” said Amitabh Kant.","Adil AhmadSrinagar, Dec 27: In the first released United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) index, Jammu and Kashmir has got 20th rank among states in India.

The Sudanese Pound (SDG) continues to fall against the US Dollar, as the greenback surpasses the SDG 70 threshold on the parallel market in Khartoum. This in spite of a crackdown against street forex traders by the security authorities this weekend.

Financial analyst, former banker and civil society activist Hafiz Ismail predicts “the depreciation of the Sudanese Pound and the deterioration of the standard of living will continue to an unusual extent, with no foreseeable end”.

His remarks came after the Dollar purchase price in the black market rose to between SDG 62 and SDG 63 for cash and for cheques at SDG 72.

The Market Makers Mechanism retains the Dollar purchase price of SDG 47.5 in commercial banks and ATMs, however, Ismail told Radio Dabanga that partial treatment as it is happening now is for no avail and stressed the need for radical treatment in the overall framework.

civil society activist Hafiz Ismail (File photo)

Balance of payments deficit

Ismail says: “The current government does not have the ability to find any radical solutions due to the weak infrastructure of the economy, the large balance of payments deficit, and the lack of sources of financing or external borrowing.”

He pointed out that “the government’s attempt to drain cash liquidity created another problem: It converted the same currency into a commodity so that the price of the cheque and the price of hard cash are different.” He added that “many people are trading in the Sudanese Pound.”

He attributed the problem to the lack of the overall view of the solution and the lack of means of reform in the hands of the current government.

68.93% inflation

The rate of inflation in Sudan rose to 68.93 per cent in November.

Ismail: “Prime Minister and Finance Minister Motaz Mousa did not imagine the severity of the crisis when he took office because the problem looked like an economic crisis. However, it is in essence a crisis of governance that needs radical reforms, a comprehensive review of the state apparatus, performance of government, and fighting corruption.”

Ismail said that “contrary to the belief of many, Sudan is not a free market because a few groups are monopolising goods and control their prices”.

He pointed out that the increase in commodity prices occurs much higher than the decrease of the value of Sudanese Pound because traders in this way want to maintain their capital despite the disastrous effects on the citizen.

He added that the lack of confidence in the government makes things worse because officials say contradictory things and make promises that do not keep or have the ability to do so, which accelerates the deterioration.

Note: As effective foreign exchange rates can vary widely in Sudan, Radio Dabanga bases all SDG currency conversions on the Market Makers Mechanism-determined daily US Dollar rate quoted by the Central Bank of Sudan (CBoS).","December 11 - 2018 KHARTOUMThe Sudanese Pound (SDG) continues to fall against the US Dollar, as the greenback surpasses the SDG 70 threshold on the parallel market in Khartoum.
